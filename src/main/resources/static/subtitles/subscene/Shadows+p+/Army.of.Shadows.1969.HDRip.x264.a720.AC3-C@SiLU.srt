1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,920
"Bad memories: be yet welcomed...
you are my distant youth..."

2
00:01:54,721 --> 00:02:00,566
Army in the Shadows

3
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:32,505
October 20, 1942

4
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,972
- Do you mind if we stop for a while?
- Not at all.

5
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:31,372
It won't take too long.

6
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:33,460
Just some shopping.

7
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,590
You have to sort it out for yourself
these days.

8
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,634
It's very understandable.

9
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,721
You will be alright in this camp.

10
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,853
The best camp in France!

11
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:43,896
This camp was for Germans.

12
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,028
I'm not sure I understand.

13
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:50,160
At the beginning of the war, we were
expecting a lot of german prisoners.

14
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:53,289
But of course there were none.

15
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,422
However, this camp is very useful now.

16
00:03:56,422 --> 00:03:57,466
What good luck!

17
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:58,509
You said it!

18
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,958
Always the same; don't know who they
are, or how to treat them.

19
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:01,133
Some of them arrive without being charged
and stay forever.

20
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:06,352
Some, who committed crimes,
get out very quickly and become influential...

21
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:10,527
in the department,
or in the Vichy government.

22
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:15,745
Philippe Gerbier, 41 years old.
Engineer.

23
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:24,097
Vivid and independent mind.
Distant and ironic.

24
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,183
To subdue.

25
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:31,402
Seems to be influential.
To be treated gently.

26
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,709
Suspected of Gaullist thinking.
To subdue.

27
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:46,014
Set free by lack of evidence:
influential, to be treated gently.

28
00:05:52,278 --> 00:05:56,451
The room you are going to
was for german officers.

29
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,626
I'm honored.

30
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:16,283
Certainly to be treated gently...

31
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:20,458
and certainly with caution.

32
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:35,607
Philippe Gerbier

33
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:37,695
Colonel Jarret Du Plessis

34
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:42,914
I don't know why you are here
but I'll tell you why I was arrested.

35
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:47,088
I said in a café that
Admiral Darlant was a bastard.

36
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:53,352
And Marechal Petain is a bastard also,
whose treatment of soldiers is reprehensible.

37
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:55,438
You, Colonel, have the chance
to suffer for your opinions.

38
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:57,526
Aubert, a druggist.

39
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,658
Do you know, Sir,
what a Mallert Shell is?

40
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:01,701
No.

41
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:06,919
It's a component of a
certain chemical reaction.

42
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:11,094
I am a chemist and I had to keep
a Mallert Shell.

43
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:14,226
I was censured for shell possession,

44
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:16,314
and no one would listen to any explications.

45
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:18,401
Octave Bonnafous.

46
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:21,532
Business man.

47
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:25,707
I unfortunately stumbled into
a Gaullist meeting...

48
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:28,838
No more laws!
Only bastards!

49
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:29,882
They took my pension away!

50
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:33,013
Where should I settle in?

51
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:40,319
As the room leader, allow me
to assign you this free mattress.

52
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:51,800
I am Legrain, communist.

53
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:54,932
Here's Armel, teacher and catholic.

54
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:57,020
Is he sleeping?

55
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,063
No, he's very sick.

56
00:08:58,063 --> 00:08:59,107
No infirmary?

57
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:00,150
Already full.

58
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:04,325
Do you play dominos?

59
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:05,369
I'm afraid not.

60
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,456
We'll teach you.

61
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:10,588
Thank you, but I would rather not.

62
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:15,807
Excuse us then, but we must finish playing
before they turn off the light.

63
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,938
The Commandant is not as stupid as he looks.

64
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:24,156
He put me in with three idiots
and two lost children.

65
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:06,950
Going for a walk?

66
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,037
I'm working in the power station.

67
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:11,125
Well done!

68
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:15,299
I don't get paid,
but I like it and wish to practice.

69
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:29,911
See you later, comrade!

70
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:36,175
Are you communist?

71
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:39,305
No, but we're comrades all the same.

72
00:10:50,787 --> 00:10:52,876
There are people here
from every country.

73
00:11:02,268 --> 00:11:03,311
Russians.

74
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:08,531
Poles.

75
00:11:14,793 --> 00:11:15,837
Algerians.

76
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:34,624
Jews from all over,

77
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,149
Gypsies.

78
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:52,368
Yugoslavians.

79
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,543
Romanian, Czech.

80
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:01,761
Germans against Nazism,
Italians against Fascism.

81
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:03,849
Spanish against Franco,

82
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:12,199
And some others,
arrested for smuggling.

83
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:27,856
You alright?

84
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:13,779
I managed the installation
of powerlines in Savoie.

85
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:16,911
You're an electrician?

86
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:22,130
- Just like you.
- Surely you're more qualified than I.

87
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:26,305
Maybe we could talk about it sometime.

88
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,349
Of course.

89
00:13:29,436 --> 00:13:30,480
With pleasure.

90
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,829
The young teacher died one night,
silently.

91
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:44,048
The Algerians carried his body away.
I never heard him speak.

92
00:14:24,754 --> 00:14:28,929
I'm not sad.
He's in a better place.

93
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,979
All debts will be paid one day.

94
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:56,066
Mister Gerbier.

95
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:02,329
I wish to speak with you tonight.

96
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:31,554
There are two obstacles to escape;
barbed wire and guards.

97
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:34,685
We can pass under the barbed wire,

98
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:39,903
and I can blind the guards
by turning off all the lights.

99
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:43,035
Why haven't you escaped yet?

100
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:48,254
I didn't want to escape alone,
and leave Armelle.

101
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:51,385
But I trust you.

102
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:53,472
Why are you telling me this?

103
00:15:54,515 --> 00:15:56,603
I think you're needed on the outside.

104
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:01,823
Turn off the light and go to sleep.

105
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:03,909
Good night.

106
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:05,491
Secretly, between us,

107
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,578
the escape plan was taking shape.

108
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:09,666
Little by little.

109
00:17:53,503 --> 00:17:54,547
Gerbier, come here.

110
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:56,634
Get ready.

111
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:08,116
Hurry please.

112
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,776
Please salute Legrain for me.

113
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:57,171
- There are the bastards.
- But...

114
00:18:58,215 --> 00:18:59,259
Farewell, Sir.

115
00:19:32,658 --> 00:19:34,745
Allow me, please.

116
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:35,788
Thanks.

117
00:22:44,706 --> 00:22:45,750
There's just one chance.

118
00:22:46,794 --> 00:22:48,882
I'll ask the soldier for something,

119
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:55,145
and then you'll cross the two gates.

120
00:22:58,275 --> 00:22:59,318
Good luck.

121
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:49,955
Excuse me sir, do you have a cigarette?

122
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:57,798
What do you want?

123
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:04,061
I'd like a shave.

124
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,299
<i>Marechal has said... Marechal has accomplished...
Marechal keeps his promises.</i>

125
00:27:47,392 --> 00:27:48,436
There you go.

126
00:27:54,697 --> 00:27:55,742
I'll get your change.

127
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:58,872
- No wait...
- Wait for your change.

128
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,223
Take this.

129
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,485
Not very much, but it's all I have.

130
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:15,572
Thank you.

131
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:35,404
Paul Dounat received orders
from his organization.

132
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:42,709
He had to be in front of
the Marseilles courts

133
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:46,884
at noon, and wait there
for a friend he knew.

134
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:18,198
Police. Papers please.

135
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:29,678
All right.
But follow me anyway.

136
00:29:29,678 --> 00:29:30,721
For a simple check.

137
00:30:11,428 --> 00:30:12,473
Dirty job.

138
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:16,646
Felix, put on your hat.

139
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:18,733
No need in the car.

140
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:24,996
This is the guy who betrayed you.

141
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:31,260
I don't think there's any need to question you.

142
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:46,917
We should have refused him.
It's my fault.

143
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:51,090
So much to do,
and such little help.

144
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,178
Bison, faster please.

145
00:30:54,222 --> 00:30:56,309
They'll notice us.

146
00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:01,529
I'm also in a hurry.
I have to repair a radio,

147
00:31:03,615 --> 00:31:07,790
and a young agent's bicycle.
And prepare tonight's reception.

148
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,878
Do you have the fake papers?

149
00:31:09,878 --> 00:31:13,008
Yes, do you want them now?

150
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:40,146
The car must stay here.

151
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:41,190
It might be noticed.

152
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,322
- We'll take a walk.
- I'll come with you.

153
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:45,365
Not necessary.

154
00:31:45,365 --> 00:31:46,408
Indeed.

155
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:52,671
I suppose not.

156
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:04,153
I'll pick you up later tonight.

157
00:32:35,465 --> 00:32:37,552
One false move, and I shoot you.

158
00:32:55,295 --> 00:32:58,426
Hell, when we rented this house,
the other one was empty!

159
00:32:58,426 --> 00:32:59,470
Let's go anyway.

160
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:10,952
This way.

161
00:33:11,996 --> 00:33:14,083
Is he the traitor that we're supposed to...

162
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,126
Yes, he is.

163
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,215
And are you the boss?

164
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:30,783
He is Claude LeMasque.
He's asked for harder assignments.

165
00:33:30,783 --> 00:33:33,914
I came one hour earlier
to get everything ready...

166
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:38,090
and noticed that
some neighbors had arrived.

167
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,176
There was nobody yesterday!

168
00:33:40,176 --> 00:33:43,307
I called immediately,
but you had already left.

169
00:33:43,307 --> 00:33:45,396
It'll be alright.

170
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:48,526
We can begin the interrogating.

171
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,615
I prepared chairs, desk, paper...

172
00:33:51,658 --> 00:33:52,702
This is not a trial.

173
00:33:52,702 --> 00:33:54,790
Here's what it's about.

174
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,920
No way!
The neighbors will hear everything!

175
00:33:58,964 --> 00:34:00,008
Listen...

176
00:34:03,138 --> 00:34:04,182
The walls are paper-thin.

177
00:34:04,182 --> 00:34:07,314
The English didn't deliver on
the silenced guns we requested.

178
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:10,446
Let's look for a better place.

179
00:34:16,707 --> 00:34:17,751
How could you do it?

180
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:27,145
There's no better place.

181
00:34:28,188 --> 00:34:29,232
The cellar won't work.

182
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,408
And neither will the attic.

183
00:34:36,538 --> 00:34:37,582
We will need a good knife.

184
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:41,758
Bison has one.

185
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:44,887
A knife? Are you kidding?

186
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:46,976
I can't let you do that.

187
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,151
Felix! Go look for something
in the kitchen.

188
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:54,282
Please don't do this.
It's murder!

189
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,414
We are here to kill, regardless.

190
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:01,588
That's true, but not like this.

191
00:35:01,588 --> 00:35:03,676
I know what you mean.

192
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:09,938
I swear I am not scared,
but this is my first time ...

193
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:14,113
This is our first time also,
can't you see?

194
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:16,201
I didn't find anything.

195
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:21,420
Maybe we could wait for Bison?

196
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,464
No, out of the question.

197
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:25,594
We must finish it now.

198
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,683
Bloody hell!

199
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:31,857
We can't just smash his head in, can we?

200
00:35:34,988 --> 00:35:37,076
Gag him.

201
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:21,956
We must strangle him.

202
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:27,175
With our bare hands?

203
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,307
No.
There's a towel in the kitchen.

204
00:36:42,832 --> 00:36:47,006
Enough!
You came here for this!

205
00:36:49,094 --> 00:36:52,225
You wanted a harder assignment?
Here it is, so don't complain.

206
00:37:22,494 --> 00:37:24,581
Make him sit down.

207
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:26,668
Felix, go behind.

208
00:37:26,668 --> 00:37:29,800
I will hold his hands
and Masque will grab his legs.

209
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:43,368
I promise you won't suffer.

210
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:36,093
We're leaving.

211
00:39:37,136 --> 00:39:38,180
I'm coming.

212
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,967
I could not imagine
this was possible.

213
00:39:58,011 --> 00:39:59,054
Neither could I.

214
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,317
Get some cyanide pills.

215
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,492
And if you're arrested, eat them.

216
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,623
I will.

217
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,123
A glass of rum.

218
00:42:15,785 --> 00:42:16,830
- Jean François!
- Felix!

219
00:42:21,003 --> 00:42:24,135
It's been a long time.
Still young and handsome.

220
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:27,266
What are you doing in Marseilles?

221
00:42:27,266 --> 00:42:31,442
I moved my workshop here from Paris.

222
00:42:31,442 --> 00:42:32,486
And you?

223
00:42:33,528 --> 00:42:34,572
Nothing special.

224
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:40,835
I have to go.
Can you walk a bit with me?

225
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:41,879
Alright, let's go.

226
00:42:46,054 --> 00:42:47,098
Can you wait five minutes?

227
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:49,184
Five minutes.
Not my whole life.

228
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,753
Always lucky!

229
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:05,885
A bit risky to wear a pilot's jacket?

230
00:43:06,929 --> 00:43:07,971
Fuck them.

231
00:43:09,015 --> 00:43:10,059
- And then?
- And then what?

232
00:43:12,147 --> 00:43:13,191
Just fuck them?

233
00:43:14,235 --> 00:43:16,322
What else? Fight?

234
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:18,410
I know some more exciting things.

235
00:43:19,454 --> 00:43:20,497
Really exciting?

236
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:21,541
Yes.

237
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:26,759
You'll have to get up early,
sleep on the train, on the road,

238
00:43:27,803 --> 00:43:29,891
without reasons or explanations.

239
00:43:29,891 --> 00:43:30,935
I'm interested.

240
00:43:33,022 --> 00:43:35,110
Come and see me tomorrow,
here's my address.

241
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:38,241
No, don't write it down.
Just remember it.

242
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,328
And never tell a soul.

243
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:41,371
Of course.

244
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:43,459
Everyone says that...
but even a girlfriend...

245
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:44,503
I don't have one.

246
00:43:44,503 --> 00:43:45,548
The girl in the bar?

247
00:43:45,548 --> 00:43:48,678
I told her 5 minutes...
she'll have to wait a few more.

248
00:43:48,678 --> 00:43:50,765
Parents you like to talk with...

249
00:43:50,765 --> 00:43:52,853
They all died.

250
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:55,984
Just one brother,
who stayed in Paris.

251
00:43:57,027 --> 00:44:01,203
I love him.
But would never confide in him.

252
00:44:09,553 --> 00:44:12,685
<i>Theater and Music Center.</i>

253
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,034
Do you have an appointment?

254
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,078
With Mr. Russel.

255
00:44:23,122 --> 00:44:24,165
This way, please.

256
00:44:39,821 --> 00:44:40,865
I came as quickly as I could.

257
00:44:40,865 --> 00:44:42,953
It's very urgent indeed.

258
00:44:42,953 --> 00:44:46,083
How many people to board
for Gibraltar?

259
00:44:47,128 --> 00:44:49,215
Two canadian officers,
from Dieppe commando,

260
00:44:49,215 --> 00:44:52,347
three aviators from R.A.F.,

261
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:56,521
and also two Belgians
sentenced to death by Germans.

262
00:44:56,521 --> 00:44:58,608
Eight including me.

263
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:02,784
Where will they wait for the submarine?
The doctor's clinic is under surveillance.

264
00:45:05,915 --> 00:45:09,047
Couldn't we send them outside,
a few at a time?

265
00:45:09,047 --> 00:45:11,133
No, too dangerous.

266
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:17,397
A Canadian officer will want to go into a café
and talk, forgetting his accent.

267
00:45:20,528 --> 00:45:23,659
We will be informed of the submarine
arrival just one day in advance.

268
00:45:24,703 --> 00:45:27,833
Everyone must go to the Viella farm.

269
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:28,877
Everyone?

270
00:45:30,965 --> 00:45:33,052
It's not very safe...

271
00:45:33,052 --> 00:45:35,140
We are not an insurance company.

272
00:45:36,184 --> 00:45:38,271
On the contrary, indeed!

273
00:45:39,315 --> 00:45:42,445
You must choose a real trustworthy man
to supervise everything.

274
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:47,664
I have this man.
You don't know him.

275
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:51,839
He did a very good job
on several recent missions.

276
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:56,016
He is now in Paris.
To deliver a new radio to Matilda.

277
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:01,233
- When will he be back?
- Tomorrow morning.

278
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:05,409
Contact him immediately.
Everything must be ready by tomorrow night.

279
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:07,495
I'll be there at the last second.

280
00:46:09,584 --> 00:46:11,671
And take a break.

281
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:13,758
When you will be gone.

282
00:46:13,758 --> 00:46:16,889
No, now.
There'll be no time after that.

283
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:09,076
<i>The luggages will be checked
inside the station.</i>

284
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:52,913
Need some help?

285
00:48:24,226 --> 00:48:25,270
Goodbye.

286
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,969
Open your case.

287
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:49,276
No smuggled goods?

288
00:48:49,276 --> 00:48:50,319
No.

289
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,362
What is this?

290
00:48:54,495 --> 00:48:56,582
Just a radio.

291
00:48:56,582 --> 00:48:58,669
Okay, you can go.

292
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:09,107
Madam, please, luggage check.

293
00:49:39,374 --> 00:49:40,419
Any trouble?

294
00:49:42,507 --> 00:49:45,638
Not really. Stopped twice.

295
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:03,381
Tell Felix we need a new quartz.
The frequency has changed.

296
00:50:04,425 --> 00:50:06,513
Alright. May I help you?

297
00:50:07,558 --> 00:50:08,600
Certainly not.

298
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:50,351
The second radio is in the case.

299
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:52,437
Okay. Want something to eat?

300
00:50:52,437 --> 00:50:53,481
No, thanks. I'm going to surprise someone...

301
00:51:49,843 --> 00:51:51,931
Hello, Saint-Luc!

302
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:55,062
Ah, little Jean!

303
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,324
Still so many books around...

304
00:52:02,368 --> 00:52:04,455
And the music instruments...

305
00:52:07,587 --> 00:52:09,674
Nothing's changed.

306
00:52:09,674 --> 00:52:12,806
The temperature has changed!

307
00:52:12,806 --> 00:52:16,980
So I bought this,
in order to avoid freezing.

308
00:52:20,112 --> 00:52:23,242
I stay there when I work at night
or when I eat.

309
00:52:23,242 --> 00:52:26,375
But how did you get here?

310
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:28,462
Hope you have a permit.

311
00:52:28,462 --> 00:52:31,593
Oh! Saint-Luc is back to earth.

312
00:52:31,593 --> 00:52:35,768
He knows about the permit!

313
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:38,899
Of course I've got one.
And even...

314
00:52:39,943 --> 00:52:42,031
...and I'm even very hungry.

315
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:43,074
We're going to eat.

316
00:52:43,074 --> 00:52:44,118
Marie.

317
00:52:44,118 --> 00:52:45,162
Yes, Mr. Luc.

318
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:48,292
What do we have on today's menu?

319
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:50,380
Some rutabaga like yesterday.

320
00:52:51,425 --> 00:52:52,468
And?

321
00:52:52,468 --> 00:52:54,555
Some unticketed cheese.

322
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,819
A little butter, but no bread.

323
00:53:00,819 --> 00:53:02,904
I have tickets for bread,

324
00:53:04,993 --> 00:53:07,080
and I can give all of them to you.

325
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:14,387
You're not resourceful.
You're still greedy.

326
00:53:14,387 --> 00:53:17,516
So I am, but what can I do?

327
00:53:17,516 --> 00:53:20,649
What about smuggling?

328
00:53:20,649 --> 00:53:22,736
Marie is afraid of cops...
And I...

329
00:53:22,736 --> 00:53:23,780
And you also...

330
00:53:41,524 --> 00:53:43,611
It's becoming warmer.

331
00:53:46,743 --> 00:53:49,873
I felt very warm this morning.
Twice.

332
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,136
So many people on the train or the metro...

333
00:54:00,311 --> 00:54:06,573
I was wondering if Matilda,
that I knew only a little bit...

334
00:54:06,573 --> 00:54:09,704
was not closer to me than you,
my brother,

335
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:14,923
who I have so much love for,
but with whom I share so few things.

336
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:29,536
I went back to Marseilles the same day,

337
00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:35,798
but today I had a very strange feeling.

338
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:42,598
Hello Mrs. Vialla.
Your home has become an hotel!

339
00:55:46,772 --> 00:55:47,816
Hello!

340
00:55:49,905 --> 00:55:50,949
- Hello!
- Good evening sir.

341
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,341
The fishing boat will await you
after midnight.

342
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:02,428
Maybe you can all sail together.

343
00:56:02,428 --> 00:56:07,648
Mrs. Vialla's daughter
will lead you there, surreptitiously.

344
00:56:07,648 --> 00:56:08,691
Perfect.

345
00:56:08,691 --> 00:56:10,778
Am I leaving?

346
00:56:10,778 --> 00:56:13,910
No. There's one more passenger.
Unexpected.

347
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,997
The big boss.

348
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:19,129
But he will not sail with us.
We're full.

349
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:21,216
You will board with him.
Somewhere else.

350
00:56:21,216 --> 00:56:22,260
Bison will bring him.

351
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,434
You'll wait for my light signal.
Three short and one long.

352
00:56:26,434 --> 00:56:27,478
Got it.

353
00:56:32,697 --> 00:56:36,873
Madame, we will leave.
How much do I owe you?

354
00:56:36,873 --> 00:56:38,961
You can pay later.

355
00:56:41,046 --> 00:56:43,134
You already told me that before.

356
00:56:43,134 --> 00:56:45,222
Yet you came back,
so you must like the welcome.

357
00:56:48,354 --> 00:56:50,441
You will walk in single file.

358
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:54,616
Not too near,
but always keeping watch over each other.

359
00:56:54,616 --> 00:56:59,834
Not a sound, not a word.

360
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,978
Keep quiet, I have a gun!

361
00:57:50,978 --> 00:57:54,109
- What are you doing here at night?
- And you?

362
00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:56,197
I'm Mrs. Vialla's brother-in-law.

363
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,284
The nurse?

364
00:57:59,329 --> 00:58:02,458
I'm verifying that everything is alright.

365
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:03,502
And then?

366
00:58:03,502 --> 00:58:06,634
It's okay, a police patrol has just departed.

367
00:58:06,634 --> 00:58:11,852
Germans are too few and get lost.
So they trust the customs.

368
00:58:11,852 --> 00:58:12,897
And the customs?

369
00:58:12,897 --> 00:58:16,028
The customs? But I am the customs!

370
00:58:16,028 --> 00:58:18,114
I am the only one in charge
in this area.

371
00:58:18,114 --> 00:58:19,159
No kidding!

372
00:59:02,996 --> 00:59:04,040
Get on board!

373
00:59:33,265 --> 00:59:34,308
Good luck, boss.

374
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:44,746
So strange to think the big boss
looks like any other man.

375
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:51,008
Here in this boat, where base and
tip of the pyramid meet.

376
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:56,227
Strange.

377
00:59:56,227 --> 00:59:59,358
I'll have to talk with Saint-Luc
about it after the war.

378
01:00:12,926 --> 01:00:16,059
Watch your steps sir.

379
01:00:42,151 --> 01:00:44,240
I'm so happy to be travelling with you.

380
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,283
I feel the same.

381
01:01:59,597 --> 01:02:01,685
I cannot deliver you all the weapons
you asked me for.

382
01:02:02,728 --> 01:02:07,947
The English don't believe too much in
the efficiency of the French resistance.

383
01:02:07,947 --> 01:02:11,079
They want to keep as many planes
as possible to bomb Germany.

384
01:02:12,123 --> 01:02:14,209
But we will improve
your transmission equipment.

385
01:02:14,209 --> 01:02:18,385
So we'll send you some radio operators,

386
01:02:18,385 --> 01:02:21,516
and we'll help your agents

387
01:02:21,516 --> 01:02:24,647
to improve the landing place
that we will really need for later.

388
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:40,799
The war will be over for the French
when they can see this wonderful movie.

389
01:09:15,634 --> 01:09:18,763
I heard Felix was arrested today.

390
01:09:23,978 --> 01:09:26,064
<i>Free France</i>

391
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:32,322
I still had many things
to do in London,

392
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:38,476
but I decided to go back to France
that same day.

393
01:11:12,452 --> 01:11:15,581
Have you ever parachuted before?

394
01:11:15,581 --> 01:11:16,624
Never.

395
01:11:16,624 --> 01:11:20,796
When your feet hit the ground,

396
01:11:20,796 --> 01:11:26,011
don't try to stay upright.
Bend your knees and fall, understood?

397
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:26,950
I think so.

398
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:43,530
Matilda moved to Lyon
during my absence.

399
01:19:44,573 --> 01:19:49,788
She's a great leader.
I made her my assistant.

400
01:20:16,907 --> 01:20:22,122
The boss already told me how
wonderful she was.

401
01:20:23,165 --> 01:20:29,423
But I'm still surprised by her skill
in giving and receiving orders.

402
01:20:32,552 --> 01:20:35,472
She studied the map of Gestapo
headquarters for hours.

403
01:20:35,472 --> 01:20:38,810
She finally discovered where
Felix was imprisoned.

404
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:43,921
A jail for prisoners that they
absolutely need information from.

405
01:20:45,068 --> 01:20:49,240
At first, she wanted to use a bomb.

406
01:20:50,283 --> 01:20:56,541
Then she made another plan,
which required a disguise.

407
01:21:20,531 --> 01:21:24,703
She arranged for me a new place
for my headquaters.

408
01:21:33,047 --> 01:21:36,176
No place is more secure or pleasant.

409
01:21:36,176 --> 01:21:43,477
My host is now the Baron de Ferte,
an ex-cavalry officer.

410
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,563
Before the war,

411
01:21:46,606 --> 01:21:48,692
the Republic was my enemy.

412
01:21:49,735 --> 01:21:53,907
With my tenant farmer, and my servant,

413
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:58,079
I had created a little army
equipped with guns and pikes...

414
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:00,165
to assault the prefecture

415
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,251
on horseback

416
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:06,423
in the case of royalist insurrection.

417
01:22:10,596 --> 01:22:15,811
This militia still exists,
and is used to protect me now.

418
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:24,155
The Baron himself suggested use of
his field for landing and dropping.

419
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:28,327
We did as he wished and even more.

420
01:22:32,499 --> 01:22:34,585
Strange carousel...

421
01:23:09,004 --> 01:23:12,134
While the first airplane is landing...

422
01:23:12,134 --> 01:23:16,306
the second one keeps on flying
at low altitude...

423
01:23:16,306 --> 01:23:21,521
to cover up the sound of the
first plane's landing and take-off.

424
01:23:21,521 --> 01:23:23,398
And then they switch.

425
01:23:25,484 --> 01:23:30,908
This night, four men left for London,
and four men arrived from there.

426
01:23:30,908 --> 01:23:35,080
Bison, Le Masque, Jean-Francois
et Matilda were supervising.

427
01:24:49,134 --> 01:24:52,263
Does your husband know
about your activities?

428
01:24:53,306 --> 01:24:54,349
No he doesn't.

429
01:24:55,392 --> 01:24:56,435
Nor does my daughter.

430
01:25:04,779 --> 01:25:07,908
Here she is.
17 years old.

431
01:25:09,994 --> 01:25:11,037
Don't keep it with you.

432
01:25:13,123 --> 01:25:15,210
You're right. I won't.

433
01:25:16,253 --> 01:25:19,382
Before anything else,

434
01:25:21,468 --> 01:25:25,640
we must talk about Felix.

435
01:25:26,683 --> 01:25:28,769
I know Felix doesn't have
prussic acid pills.

436
01:25:29,812 --> 01:25:35,027
I'm not afraid of him talking,
but he has no way to escape torture.

437
01:25:36,904 --> 01:25:39,199
The Gestapo will not give in.

438
01:25:40,242 --> 01:25:45,457
And he will suffer for days, maybe weeks...

439
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:47,543
I know that.

440
01:25:48,586 --> 01:25:49,629
There aren't many possibilities.

441
01:25:49,629 --> 01:25:50,672
Did you find one?

442
01:25:51,715 --> 01:25:54,844
Yes. Enter the Gestapo
and leave with Felix.

443
01:25:57,973 --> 01:26:04,231
Matilda, I want to rescue Felix.
But not at any cost.

444
01:26:04,231 --> 01:26:06,317
I cannot sacrifice anyone.

445
01:26:06,317 --> 01:26:08,403
I don't need many men.

446
01:26:08,403 --> 01:26:12,575
With Le Masque, Jean-Francois,
Bison and me, I can make it.

447
01:26:12,575 --> 01:26:13,618
No problem.

448
01:26:16,747 --> 01:26:17,791
What is your plan?

449
01:26:17,791 --> 01:26:20,920
Bison, can you get three
german officer's uniforms?

450
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:21,963
Of course.

451
01:26:23,006 --> 01:26:24,049
Do it then.

452
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:29,264
The problem is how to contact
and inform Felix.

453
01:26:30,307 --> 01:26:33,436
I haven't figured it out yet,
but I will.

454
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:38,651
Because he must be ready
when we will come.

455
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:41,780
I have tried to contact him
for a week now.

456
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:46,995
But that building is very
strictly guarded.

457
01:26:48,038 --> 01:26:50,124
Yes, not so easy to enter.

458
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:53,253
- Careful it's warm.
- Thanks.

459
01:27:43,318 --> 01:27:44,361
<i>Mr. Gerbier</i>

460
01:27:46,447 --> 01:27:51,662
<i>I don't have the courage of
Le Masque nor the strength of Bison.</i>

461
01:27:53,748 --> 01:27:55,834
<i>Nor the skills of Matilda.</i>

462
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,006
<i>I will not participate in this escape plan</i>

463
01:28:02,092 --> 01:28:08,350
<i>But I'm sure that
my comrades will succeed.</i>

464
01:28:11,479 --> 01:28:13,565
<i>Don't try to find out
what happened to me.</i>

465
01:29:07,802 --> 01:29:15,103
<i>Mr. Dupont knows much of
the resistance movement.</i>

466
01:29:27,515 --> 01:29:28,558
How did you make it?

467
01:29:29,601 --> 01:29:30,644
Well...

468
01:29:37,945 --> 01:29:41,074
We will use only two uniforms.

469
01:29:42,117 --> 01:29:44,204
I know, Mrs. Matilda.

470
01:30:33,225 --> 01:30:35,311
I won't let you do it without me.

471
01:30:36,354 --> 01:30:38,440
And I won't let you go with us!

472
01:30:39,483 --> 01:30:41,569
Remember what you said,

473
01:30:42,612 --> 01:30:44,698
"I cannot sacrifice anyone."

474
01:30:44,698 --> 01:30:47,828
Especially if "anyone" is you.

475
01:30:48,871 --> 01:30:50,957
But Matilda, why you instead of me?

476
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,043
Listen.

477
01:30:54,086 --> 01:31:00,344
Two men won't be noticed.
But three men would.

478
01:31:00,344 --> 01:31:03,473
When Jean-François was still there,
you asked for three uniforms.

479
01:31:03,473 --> 01:31:09,731
But at least, I would have taken
only Le Masque and Le Bison.

480
01:31:09,731 --> 01:31:11,817
Jean-Francois...

481
01:31:13,903 --> 01:31:14,946
I trusted him.

482
01:31:15,989 --> 01:31:18,075
Me too, that's not what I meant.

483
01:31:20,161 --> 01:31:24,333
But... I could never imagine
he would leave us this way.

484
01:32:42,351 --> 01:32:43,602
<i>Who's that man?</i>

485
01:32:43,602 --> 01:32:45,688
<i>He was denounced by an anonymous letter.</i>

486
01:32:56,119 --> 01:32:57,162
You can enter.

487
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:28,452
Naturally, is Dupont your real name?

488
01:33:28,452 --> 01:33:29,495
Of course.

489
01:33:29,495 --> 01:33:31,581
Which organization do you belong?

490
01:33:32,624 --> 01:33:33,667
I don't know what you mean.

491
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:36,796
Do you understand the consequences?

492
01:33:39,925 --> 01:33:45,140
You will be shot under this name
and no one will know what happened to you.

493
01:34:25,818 --> 01:34:28,947
I decided to leave this place.
Perhaps a premonition?

494
01:34:28,947 --> 01:34:35,205
Three days after, Baron de Ferte
and his men were arrested and shot.

495
01:35:39,664 --> 01:35:45,087
We must take a man named Felix
Lepercq to Paris...

496
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:49,259
to the headquarters of
Oberstufuhrer Bolmerburg.

497
01:35:50,094 --> 01:35:52,388
- Felix Lepercq?
- Yes, a terrorist.

498
01:35:52,388 --> 01:35:54,474
Hurry up, it's urgent.

499
01:35:54,474 --> 01:35:55,517
Get down.

500
01:36:38,281 --> 01:36:39,324
One moment, please.

501
01:38:49,701 --> 01:38:53,873
An ambulance from Paris Gestapo...

502
01:38:53,873 --> 01:38:58,045
wants to take terrorist
Felix Lepercq.

503
01:38:57,002 --> 01:39:02,217
Make an on-duty Doctor come and give
the transfer authorization.

504
01:40:47,562 --> 01:40:49,648
Felix.

505
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:54,863
Felix can you hear me?

506
01:40:55,906 --> 01:40:57,992
Matilda, Le Bison and Le Masque
are here.

507
01:40:59,035 --> 01:41:04,250
I will help you.
Are you in a lot of pain?

508
01:41:54,315 --> 01:41:55,358
It's not possible.

509
01:41:58,487 --> 01:41:59,530
He will suffer a lot,

510
01:42:01,408 --> 01:42:02,659
until he dies.

511
01:42:56,896 --> 01:43:03,154
Impossible. I can't let you
transfer a dying man. Sorry.

512
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:08,369
Okay, I will report this.

513
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:00,363
Felix.

514
01:46:01,406 --> 01:46:02,449
I have several prussic acid pills.

515
01:46:03,492 --> 01:46:04,535
Do you want one?

516
01:46:36,868 --> 01:46:38,954
We could have saved Felix.

517
01:46:38,954 --> 01:46:39,997
No.

518
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,127
No one and nothing could.

519
01:46:45,213 --> 01:46:46,256
Not even you.

520
01:46:52,514 --> 01:46:55,643
Besides, every policeman is looking for you.

521
01:46:55,643 --> 01:46:58,772
You should disappear for awhile.

522
01:46:59,815 --> 01:47:01,901
The next airplane is yours.

523
01:47:02,944 --> 01:47:03,987
You're not serious?

524
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:08,159
Resistance organizations are rising
from everywhere.

525
01:47:09,202 --> 01:47:14,417
We must unite them, train them,
supply them.

526
01:47:16,503 --> 01:47:18,589
There's nobody to replace me now.

527
01:47:20,675 --> 01:47:24,847
If you get arrested, we will
replace you however we can.

528
01:47:45,708 --> 01:47:46,751
Police!

529
01:47:48,837 --> 01:47:51,966
So, is the food good here?

530
01:47:53,009 --> 01:47:56,138
You have meat at every meal,
and without tickets?

531
01:47:57,181 --> 01:48:00,310
We will check all papers.

532
01:48:04,482 --> 01:48:05,525
Hurry up, let's go.

533
01:49:25,837 --> 01:49:26,880
I'll keep it, for later.

534
01:50:52,407 --> 01:50:57,623
He says "Finish your smoke. They're
coming and I don't want trouble."

535
01:50:57,623 --> 01:50:59,709
Everyone has his own troubles.

536
01:51:15,354 --> 01:51:16,397
This time is the last one.

537
01:52:56,526 --> 01:53:00,699
The word "Love" makes sense to me
only when I think of the boss.

538
01:53:01,742 --> 01:53:03,828
He's more important to me
than anything.

539
01:53:03,828 --> 01:53:06,957
More than everything.
But not more than life.

540
01:53:06,957 --> 01:53:10,920
If Luc Jardie would die,
I would still like to live.

541
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:13,006
And I'm going to die.

542
01:53:13,215 --> 01:53:15,092
And I'm not afraid.

543
01:53:16,344 --> 01:53:18,430
How is that possible?

544
01:53:19,473 --> 01:53:22,602
It's because I'm too narrow-minded
to believe it.

545
01:53:23,645 --> 01:53:27,817
And if I don't believe it
until the last moment,

546
01:53:27,817 --> 01:53:28,860
I will never die.

547
01:53:30,946 --> 01:53:34,909
What a discovery!
The boss would like the idea.

548
01:53:36,161 --> 01:53:38,247
I must explore this discovery.

549
01:53:38,247 --> 01:53:39,290
I must...

550
01:55:32,979 --> 01:55:38,194
You will turn your back to the
machine-gun and face the wall.

551
01:55:38,194 --> 01:55:40,280
And then you will run
as fast as you can.

552
01:55:41,323 --> 01:55:42,366
We will not shoot immediately.

553
01:55:42,366 --> 01:55:44,452
We will give you a chance.

554
01:55:44,452 --> 01:55:49,667
If you get to the wall, you'll
be shot in the next round instead.

555
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:52,796
We can try anyway.

556
01:55:52,796 --> 01:55:53,839
Nothing to lose.

557
01:55:54,882 --> 01:55:59,054
He knows about my legs.
He's waiting for the show.

558
01:56:00,097 --> 01:56:03,226
And I feel more tied by his certainty
than by my chains.

559
01:56:09,485 --> 01:56:10,528
Go!

560
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:17,829
I don't want to run.

561
01:56:17,829 --> 01:56:18,872
I won't.

562
01:58:24,034 --> 01:58:28,206
The most important thing was to time
it precisely. Matilda did.

563
01:58:29,249 --> 01:58:32,378
Oh, it was easy
with all the information we had.

564
01:58:35,507 --> 01:58:37,593
And if I didn't run?

565
01:58:40,722 --> 01:58:44,894
Something wrong?
Thinking about those who didn't run?

566
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:50,109
No, thinking about this officer,
was what convinced me to run.

567
01:58:50,109 --> 01:58:52,195
Like a rabbit in panic!

568
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:17,723
Go on.

569
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:06,196
It's good to be safe.

570
02:02:22,885 --> 02:02:24,971
Enough for one month.

571
02:02:24,971 --> 02:02:27,891
There is drinking water, but I'll try
to bring you some wine.

572
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:30,186
No way, see you in a month.

573
02:02:31,229 --> 02:02:32,272
All right.

574
02:02:38,530 --> 02:02:42,702
I'm gonna leave.
Somebody could spot the car.

575
02:02:42,702 --> 02:02:43,745
Okay.

576
02:02:50,003 --> 02:02:53,132
Treat your arm and your leg.
It might get infected.

577
02:02:56,261 --> 02:02:58,347
I put a shaver on the table.

578
02:03:56,756 --> 02:04:00,928
I'm by myself for three weeks,
like a timid animal.

579
02:04:01,971 --> 02:04:08,229
I write a long report for London,
and try to believe I'm still useful.

580
02:05:26,455 --> 02:05:28,542
I haven't seen Matilda
or anyone since.

581
02:06:06,090 --> 02:06:11,305
I read the five books Luc Jardie
wrote before the war.

582
02:06:11,305 --> 02:06:13,391
They keep me company.

583
02:06:37,381 --> 02:06:41,553
At night, Jean-Francois'
disappearance haunts me.

584
02:07:48,306 --> 02:07:50,392
Le Bison or Le Masque?

585
02:07:57,693 --> 02:07:59,779
But it's ... you!

586
02:08:15,424 --> 02:08:17,510
I have to talk to you.

587
02:08:17,510 --> 02:08:18,553
When did you come back?

588
02:08:18,553 --> 02:08:22,725
Four days ago.
Since Matilda was arrested.

589
02:08:25,854 --> 02:08:26,897
Matilda?

590
02:08:32,112 --> 02:08:34,198
We have to talk about her tonight.

591
02:08:37,328 --> 02:08:38,371
We have to, Philippe.

592
02:08:42,543 --> 02:08:46,715
They didn't hurt her.

593
02:08:47,758 --> 02:08:49,844
She got in touch with us.

594
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:55,059
Gestapo found her real name
very quickly,

595
02:08:56,102 --> 02:08:57,979
and where her family was living.

596
02:08:58,188 --> 02:09:01,317
She had her daughter's picture,

597
02:09:03,403 --> 02:09:04,446
and you can guess what happened...

598
02:09:05,489 --> 02:09:06,532
That picture?

599
02:09:07,575 --> 02:09:09,661
This was her only mistake.

600
02:09:10,704 --> 02:09:15,919
The Germans quickly found her weakness.

601
02:09:17,797 --> 02:09:20,091
Why did she keep the picture?

602
02:09:20,091 --> 02:09:22,177
I told her!

603
02:09:22,177 --> 02:09:23,220
Listen to this,

604
02:09:24,263 --> 02:09:26,349
She begged the Germans to give her
the picture back.

605
02:09:27,184 --> 02:09:29,270
What do you mean?

606
02:09:29,478 --> 02:09:32,607
Matilda sent us an S.O.S.
The Germans gave her two choices.

607
02:09:33,650 --> 02:09:36,779
Tell everything she knows
about the organization,

608
02:09:36,779 --> 02:09:41,995
or they will send her daughter
to Poland as a prostitute.

609
02:09:45,124 --> 02:09:47,210
Now you know everything.

610
02:09:49,296 --> 02:09:51,382
We have to find a solution.

611
02:09:52,425 --> 02:09:53,468
Could she escape?

612
02:09:53,468 --> 02:09:57,640
No, she can't escape,
nor commit suicide.

613
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:59,726
Matilda will never give up
her daughter to the gestapo.

614
02:10:01,812 --> 02:10:02,855
Can she stall time?

615
02:10:03,898 --> 02:10:05,984
Until when?

616
02:10:05,984 --> 02:10:09,113
It's not a solution.

617
02:10:09,113 --> 02:10:10,156
Here comes Le Bison.

618
02:10:11,199 --> 02:10:14,328
Don't tell him I'm here.

619
02:10:15,371 --> 02:10:16,414
Go in that room.

620
02:10:59,073 --> 02:11:01,160
Here are some new glasses.

621
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:03,246
Thanks.

622
02:11:17,952 --> 02:11:18,995
Any news from Matilda?

623
02:11:23,063 --> 02:11:24,106
What's going on?

624
02:11:24,106 --> 02:11:25,149
I know nothing.

625
02:11:25,149 --> 02:11:26,192
What?

626
02:11:27,235 --> 02:11:30,364
I don't. Here's a letter.

627
02:12:12,085 --> 02:12:17,300
Matilda was released yesterday.
And two comrades were arrested today.

628
02:12:18,447 --> 02:12:19,386
Is it so?

629
02:12:21,576 --> 02:12:22,515
If they say it is.

630
02:12:31,902 --> 02:12:35,135
Le Masque, you knew this?

631
02:12:37,221 --> 02:12:39,307
I'm not in charge of this report.

632
02:12:42,332 --> 02:12:45,461
Matilda is to be killed immediately.

633
02:12:47,547 --> 02:12:48,590
I can't believe it.

634
02:12:51,824 --> 02:12:54,848
I will never hurt Mrs. Matilda.

635
02:12:55,996 --> 02:12:57,039
I have been working with her.

636
02:12:57,039 --> 02:12:59,125
She saved me once.

637
02:12:59,125 --> 02:13:02,254
This is a great woman!

638
02:13:03,297 --> 02:13:07,469
Men...as many as you want...

639
02:13:09,555 --> 02:13:13,727
But Mrs. Matilda, never!

640
02:13:14,770 --> 02:13:15,813
We will not discuss about it.

641
02:13:16,752 --> 02:13:18,838
She must disappear and she will.

642
02:13:18,838 --> 02:13:19,881
You won't do it!

643
02:13:19,881 --> 02:13:24,053
We have other killers.
If necessary, I will do it.

644
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:28,225
You won't.
You don't have the right.

645
02:13:29,372 --> 02:13:31,354
You could have run as a champion...

646
02:13:32,501 --> 02:13:35,630
you would be dead already
if not for Mrs. Matilda.

647
02:13:41,888 --> 02:13:42,931
You won't do it.

648
02:13:43,766 --> 02:13:48,146
She can give me to the Gestapo,
she protected me, and you,

649
02:13:49,190 --> 02:13:50,233
and now,
she's protecting her daughter.

650
02:13:50,233 --> 02:13:51,276
Can we blame her?

651
02:13:51,276 --> 02:13:54,300
Enough!
The decision is made.

652
02:14:00,663 --> 02:14:05,773
If you're as cowardly as that,
I'll kill you first!

653
02:14:23,609 --> 02:14:24,652
Stop it!

654
02:14:24,652 --> 02:14:28,720
Shut your mouth! You were still a child
when I started commanding men...

655
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:30,806
What do you think?

656
02:14:30,806 --> 02:14:34,039
Would I let you do that?
Have you gone crazy?

657
02:14:35,082 --> 02:14:37,168
You, get out!
Or I'll kill you both!

658
02:14:50,727 --> 02:14:55,943
You need a few cooler
heads in this room.

659
02:15:00,115 --> 02:15:01,053
My friend, sit down.

660
02:15:04,182 --> 02:15:06,268
Calm down and have a cigarette.

661
02:15:08,459 --> 02:15:09,397
Don't you think, Gerbier?

662
02:15:10,545 --> 02:15:12,527
You heard everything.

663
02:15:13,674 --> 02:15:19,932
Yes, Matilda is truly a great woman.
Even more than you know.

664
02:15:20,662 --> 02:15:22,957
But we're going to kill her.

665
02:15:22,957 --> 02:15:24,104
I can't believe you.

666
02:15:24,104 --> 02:15:26,190
You will, listen my friend.

667
02:15:26,190 --> 02:15:29,319
We will kill Matilda,
because she asked us to.

668
02:15:31,405 --> 02:15:32,448
She told you that?

669
02:15:32,448 --> 02:15:35,577
No, but it's not difficult to guess.
Think of it like this,

670
02:15:35,577 --> 02:15:38,602
If Matilda only wanted to save
her daughter,

671
02:15:38,602 --> 02:15:42,774
she just had to give names
and addresses.

672
02:15:43,921 --> 02:15:48,093
In spite of this, Matilda told them
we change our address every day,

673
02:15:48,093 --> 02:15:51,118
she must contact some people...
whatever...

674
02:15:52,265 --> 02:15:55,186
So that they set her free.
Clear, isn't it?

675
02:15:55,395 --> 02:16:01,653
Imagine you were in her position.
Forced to betray comrades.

676
02:16:02,696 --> 02:16:04,782
And suicide is not allowed.

677
02:16:09,997 --> 02:16:10,935
I would like to be killed.

678
02:16:13,022 --> 02:16:17,194
Do you find yourself braver
or better than Matilda?

679
02:16:23,347 --> 02:16:25,329
Please excuse me.

680
02:16:25,329 --> 02:16:29,814
Take a german car. Le Masque will
drive. I'll come with you.

681
02:16:29,814 --> 02:16:31,900
Are you mad?

682
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:33,986
I'm sure Matilda would like
to see me.

683
02:16:35,029 --> 02:16:37,115
Please, this is not your place.

684
02:16:38,158 --> 02:16:39,201
This is an order.

685
02:16:41,287 --> 02:16:43,373
You didn't have to do that, boss.

686
02:17:07,363 --> 02:17:10,492
Do you really believe what you said?

687
02:17:11,535 --> 02:17:12,578
I don't know.

688
02:17:16,750 --> 02:17:18,836
Maybe this hypothesis is right.

689
02:17:19,879 --> 02:17:22,904
Maybe she just wanted to see
her daughter again,

690
02:17:22,904 --> 02:17:24,990
and now is finding it harder
to give it all up.

691
02:17:26,033 --> 02:17:28,119
That's what I want to find out.

692
02:17:31,352 --> 02:17:34,273
I had to come back to you
for the hardest job.

693
02:17:35,524 --> 02:17:37,506
You, in this car, with killers!

694
02:17:38,549 --> 02:17:40,739
Nothing's sacred now in this world.

695
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:52,212
February 23rd, 1943, Sunday.

696
02:18:42,277 --> 02:18:43,216
Go.

697
02:18:53,750 --> 02:19:02,095
Nov the 8th, 1943.
Le Masque had just time
to take his prussic acid pill.

698
02:19:07,310 --> 02:19:14,611
Dec the 16th, 1943.
Le Bison was beheaded with an axe
in a German jail.

699
02:19:19,826 --> 02:19:27,127
Jan the 22nd, 1944.
Luc Jardie died under torture,
after giving one name: his own.

700
02:19:32,342 --> 02:19:38,600
Jan the 13rd, 1944.
Gerbier decided not to run this time...
