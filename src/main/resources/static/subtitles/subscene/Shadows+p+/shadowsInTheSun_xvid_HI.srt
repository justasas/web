really isn't in his best interest?

I understand what you're saying...

00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:40,399
that writing comes from experience.

742
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,697
But even after you've experienced something,
you still gotta get it down on the page.

that was great.

No, it was. That was great.

It would be helpful for me if you could...

I don't know, throw something like that
down on a page...

We would talk about writing,

- Right, no, I just wanted...

You don't think I know what it would do
for your career if you signed me?

Okay, but what does that have to do
with Weldon and writing?

There is an old story
about a bird who loved to fly.

802

One day, while he was high up in the air...

803
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:35,336
it began to rain...

804
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:38,567
and its feathers became so heavy...

805
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:42,600
that when it tried to land, it broke its wing.

806
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:47,613
Time passed, and the bird became better.

807
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:52,879
It wanted to fly,
but no matter how hard it tried...

808
00:59:53,088 --> 00:59:56,649
something inside stopped it
from leaving the ground.

809
00:59:57,693 --> 01:00:00,787
Day after day it tried, and day after day...

810
01:00:01,263 --> 01:00:03,561
its fear held it down.

811
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:07,359
Then one day, a strong wind came...

812
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,002
and lifted it high into the sky.

813
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:16,276
It opened its wings
and it realized that it could fly.

814
01:00:16,345 --> 01:00:19,678
I know. Okay. I get it, I do.

815
01:00:19,748 --> 01:00:22,376

No, that's reality, Jeremy.

877
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,960
Art is not something you choose to do.

878
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:40,666
It's something that chooses you.

879
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,839
Why did you wanna become a writer?

880
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:52,041
- Because I think that I have...
- No, it's not something you think.

881
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:54,047
It's something you know.

882
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,645

[Dog barking]

885
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:08,027
It's amazing how much
she looks like her mother.

886
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:12,600
Sometimes I'll walk into her room
and for a moment I'll think...

888
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,208

in a golden glow of honeyed light...

while the wind dances gently
through the long strands of her hair.

893
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:53,001
Her face is strong, proud...

894
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,642
with eyes that don't easily
give away their secrets.

895
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:02,681
It's a face that doesn't call out...

896
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,482
but softly beckons.

897
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:11,986
How was that?

898
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:16,697
You tell me.

899
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:28,303
By the way...

900
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,312

- Ciao, Weldon.
- Ciao.

What?

907
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:28,833
You two are the couple next door?

GUSTAVO: Weldon, it's going to be
a late night.

914

Why don't you all stay at the hotel?

915

What exactly does that mean?

942
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:43,524

won't come along, pull the chain.

It's only when they hear that flushing sound
and they begin to slide down into the abyss...

you think knowing me a couple of weeks...

and living 25 years of a sheltered existence...

990
01:15:49,612 --> 01:15:51,637

to tell me how to live my life?

And you are a writer, Weldon.

I can't explain it to myself.

- Stop it. Just stop.
- Stop what?

- Because...
- Because why?

Because I'm afraid!

You should've seen me today, Father.
You'd have been proud. I was very clever.

1037

What happened?

1038
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:18,578
I forced Weldon down a road
he didn't wanna go...

1039
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:23,055
and I'm a little afraid
of what he's gonna find at the end of it.

in order to build something new.

Did it ever occur to you
that maybe the great Weldon Parish...

1042
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:41,565
just simply does not have anything left to say?

1043

one paragraph that tells me
that I have something...

1049
