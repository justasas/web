1
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,896
<i>Pass it by! Come on, pass it by!</i>

2
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,599
- How you doin'?
- Good. Pass it by!

3
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:18,165
<i>Come on! Pass it by!</i>

4
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:22,339
<i>Hey, Bennie.</i>

5
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,113
Hey, Bennie. You got the loot?
The boys are waiting.

6
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:28,587
- I got the money. But you ain't coming with us.
- Aw, Bennie.

7
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:30,646
Hey, baby, I got the money.
I got the bread.

8
00:03:30,723 --> 00:03:33,659
<i>Twenty bucks.</i>

9
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:35,956
- Hey, I got the 20. Wait a minute.
- Be careful!

10
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,827
Let go of my leg.
Let go of my leg.

11
00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:41,595
Let go of my hand.
Let go of my arm, man.

12
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:44,502
- Let me see that bill.
- Forward!

13
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:57,618
- Twenty bucks apiece.
- Twenty bucks.

14
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,848
- That's shocking.
- No, I'm gonna get you one.

15
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:11,255
- Look what we've got here.
- Dennis, you're in.

16
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,998
- I haven't seen him around, have you?
- Who cares?

17
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,275
Hey.

18
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,278
Get a load of him.

19
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:28,876
- Hi.
- Hello.

20
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:31,649
Been here long?

21
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:35,557
- Two or three days. Where have you been?
- Two or three days?

22
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:37,618
How come I haven't
been around before this?

23
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:39,629
I don't know. Your problem.

24
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,866
What do you do?

25
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:46,371
Nothing very much.

26
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:49,465
Well, I'm not gonna ask you
the story of your life.

27
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:52,875
- You seem nice.
- I wish you would.

28
00:04:56,382 --> 00:05:01,549
<i>Well, I'm making enough.
I got a nice cozy place.</i>

29
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:08,427
- Well, I haven't had any better offers.
- What's to drink?

30
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:11,659
- Want to finish your drink?
- A little bit.

31
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:17,728
Good boy. Big boy.

32
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:20,070
- Tonight -
- What's the matter?

33
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:22,542
Well, uh...

34
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:24,704
I think I'm caught in this booth.

35
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:28,974
Come and get comfortable.

36
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,816
Oh, come on.

37
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:39,226
You come on.
What do you mean by "interesting"?

38
00:05:42,565 --> 00:05:45,034
Huh?

39
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:48,095
What do you mean by
"come up to my apartment"?

40
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:55,642
That's a silly question
for a big girl like you.

41
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:57,648
What do you do?

42
00:05:58,783 --> 00:06:00,718
I'm a musician.

43
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:05,223
Jazz musician.

44
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:08,483
I play trumpet.

45
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,824
You didn't bring
your instrument tonight, did you?

46
00:06:17,137 --> 00:06:20,264
You guys are really something.

47
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,332
Well, what have you been
sitting here all night for?

48
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:28,347
Huh?

49
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:30,681
I thought you knew all the answers.

50
00:06:30,752 --> 00:06:33,687
Well, you want to get
picked up, don't you?

51
00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:36,748
Would you like that?
I'd like to take you.

52
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:39,156
- I'll bet you would.
- Have a great time.

53
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:42,560
What do you say?
All right? Please?

54
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,429
- Such a baby.
- What do you say?

55
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,629
I'm not kidding. I'm very serious.
Would you like it?

56
00:06:48,704 --> 00:06:50,297
- Huh?
- All right.

57
00:06:59,982 --> 00:07:03,078
- What's your name?
- Nancy.

58
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:07,519
- What's yours?
- Ben.

59
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:12,628
Hi.

60
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:16,695
<i>That's a lousy agreement.</i>

61
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,928
I've been a singer
in this business for 10 years...

62
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:21,562
and I've never introduced
a girlie line in my life.

63
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:23,901
Well, I can't change you. Hughie -

64
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:26,067
It's not a question of the money.

65
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:29,977
It's just that my client feels
that it's beneath his dignity...

66
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:32,708
to have to introduce
a bunch of floozies.

67
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:35,719
I've got a few guys ready
right now to take your place.

68
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:38,813
<i>You aren't infallible, you know.</i>

69
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,493
<i>Okay. All right, cut it.</i>

70
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:50,762
- Cut it! Cut it out.
- All right, all right.

71
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:52,770
Okay, okay.

72
00:08:52,838 --> 00:08:55,171
Okay, cut it. Cut it.

73
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,334
- All right. All right.
- Okay, uh -

74
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,317
Now, there are 10 million people in
New York City. Half of them are girls.

75
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:07,684
<i>And any one of them can sing this song
better than you broads. Any one of them.</i>

76
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:11,553
<i>"A real mad chick," right?</i>

77
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,819
And shake your bodies around!

78
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:16,863
Do something, will ya?
Now, let's try it once more.

79
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,595
<i>- All right, if you want me to do it.
- Once more, girls. "A real mad chick".</i>

80
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:24,833
But look, I'm going to feel like an awful
damn fool introducing those girlies.

81
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:26,839
You're an artist.

82
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:28,842
If you make up your mind
to do it, you can do it.

83
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,378
Look, I was an artist 10 years ago.

84
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,814
<i>Now, that's when I was an artist.</i>

85
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:36,875
How you doing?
You want to see me for a moment?

86
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:38,887
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

87
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:40,684
- Bennie -
- Wait a minute.

88
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:42,690
Let me see him for a moment, okay?

89
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:45,193
A moment, man. You know.

90
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:47,195
- What is it, Bennie?
- You got a minute?

91
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,197
Yeah, I got a minute.
Let me tell you something.

92
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:51,531
You know what these people
want to do to me?

93
00:09:51,602 --> 00:09:54,537
It's bad enough working
in a third-rate nightclub...

94
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:58,632
packaged with the strippers and floozies
and playing second fiddle to them.

95
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,577
They want me
to introduce the girlie line.

96
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:03,636
Crazy.

97
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:07,049
- They can't even sing.
- Look, Hugh.

98
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:09,849
I need 20 bucks to pay a guy back
I borrowed from for a few beers.

99
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:13,413
- Are you ready for our deal now?
- We're still making up our mind about it.

100
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:15,722
- Where's your boy?
- He's over there talking to his brother.

101
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:17,921
I want to pay him back.
Have you got it?

102
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:21,490
Here's my offer now. You're gonna
play two nights. $35 a night. Yes or no?

103
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:24,230
We'll take it, Jack.
We've got no problems.

104
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:26,238
You've got to introduce the girls,
the whole line.

105
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:30,208
- We need the money, Hugh.
- You got it, 20 bucks for me?

106
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:32,211
What's it gonna be?

107
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,279
- Look, we haven't decided anything.
- We've decided, and he'll be there.

108
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:40,286
Look, man.
I'll see you later.

109
00:10:40,354 --> 00:10:43,016
You're only a kid.
It's a lot of money for a kid.

110
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,423
Anything. Okay, excuse me.
Bennie.

111
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:48,428
Now, Mr. Ackerman.
There are no problems at all.

112
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:50,430
He's got a little trouble
with his kid brother.

113
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:53,059
And it's going to be taken care of
in just about another minute.

114
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:56,627
Now, as we agreed, we're going to be
there tonight in Philly right on time.

115
00:10:56,705 --> 00:10:58,639
Bennie.

116
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:02,440
Look, Hugh.
We've gotta settle this thing.

117
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:04,756
What's the deal?

118
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:08,143
He wants to give us $35
a night and third billing.

119
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:10,151
And you introduce
the girlie line, Hughie.

120
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,847
We heard that part before.

121
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:17,383
- All right, what time do I leave?
- Just be in Philly in time for the show.

122
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,656
That's all I want from you.

123
00:11:24,202 --> 00:11:27,035
<i>Rupe, you're a very lucky boy.</i>

124
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:29,437
<i>If you knew how many people
wanted this job.</i>

125
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:31,838
<i>You guys are both very lucky boys.</i>

126
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,470
<i>Well, I wouldn't say that
exactly, Mr. Ackerman.</i>

127
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,487
What's the matter?

128
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:45,819
What's the matter?
Come on, what's the matter?

129
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:48,985
- I forgot your toothbrush.
- Look, I'll buy one.

130
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:51,325
Hey, how about moving up there?

131
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:55,361
- How you gonna get home?
- I thought I'd take a nice little walk.

132
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:57,370
No, look,
I want you to take a cab.

133
00:11:57,437 --> 00:12:00,100
Oh, please, Hugh.
Don't start that again.

134
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:02,767
I'm 20 years old,
and I've lived in this city all my life.

135
00:12:02,844 --> 00:12:05,335
- I think I can manage.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

136
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:08,007
Look. You don't know everything,
and you're a baby.

137
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:10,551
I mean, all you have to do
is read the papers.

138
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:14,179
A girl can't walk safely
down the streets at night in any city...

139
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:17,851
without being hollered at and
called names and pinched and abused.

140
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:21,861
I don't want my baby sister being hurt
for a few pennies. Now, you take a cab.

141
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,456
Nothing ever happens to me
when I walk home.

142
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,559
Round trip to Philadelphia, please.

143
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:34,710
Look, nothing's gonna happen to me,
nothing ever does.

144
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:38,772
I love you.
Now, take care of yourself. Okay?

145
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:41,249
And do a good show.
And come on, let's go.

146
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:43,980
- And look-
- The suitcase.

147
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,650
- You're gonna be late.
- Look, take a cab, please. All right?

148
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,659
Get out of here.

149
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:52,862
You're gonna miss it!

150
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:05,073
- Where you been? You're never on time.
- Look, we'll make it.

151
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:07,077
Come on.

152
00:13:13,353 --> 00:13:16,844
- No, we're gonna make it. Come on.
- Man, it's too late.

153
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:19,051
Look, he's stopping.
Come on, man, run.

154
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,424
After you.

155
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:51,018
Hey, Sam.
Thanks for letting us use this pad, man.

156
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:54,026
- How'd you like that date?
- Yeah, man, but everybody's gotta live.

157
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:56,394
Sure, sure. Fourth billing
and introduce the girlie act.

158
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:59,331
- Now, that really burns me.
- Forget it, will you?

159
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:03,565
What am I introducing a bunch of
dumb broads for? What's to introduce?

160
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:06,402
So they're dumb broads.
So they gotta live too.

161
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:08,066
That's the way I feel also.

162
00:15:08,143 --> 00:15:10,908
That beats baked beans
with baked beans, buddy.

163
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:16,283
Sam. All right, I'm a singer.
And I sing a song.

164
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:20,288
Now, what am I gonna say about a bunch
of dumb broads with white ribbons...

165
00:15:20,356 --> 00:15:22,655
going around singing "A Pretty Girl"?
Does that make sense?

166
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:26,522
Well, you just can't say that exactly.

167
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:29,293
I don't know, say a few nice words
about the audience...

168
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:31,300
like, uh, I don't know.

169
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:33,997
Just smile, be yourself, you know?

170
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:36,199
I'm a singer.
Nobody seems to get that.

171
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:38,333
And singers sing.
I mean, that's it. That's all, man.

172
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:41,435
Well, man. You can always
tell a couple of jokes.

173
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:44,072
Everybody likes jokes.
That makes people feel good.

174
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:45,741
Sam, what time is it?

175
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:49,310
You make them feel relaxed, at easy.
Like Steve Allen, you know.

176
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:51,379
Jokes? What jokes?
I don't know any jokes.

177
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:54,790
- Look, I don't even know my own name.
- Now, come on, baby. Let's go.

178
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,522
<i>- Now, hold on a minute.
- To hell with jokes. You tell a joke.</i>

179
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:59,861
Look, dummy,
don't let yourself go.

180
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:02,061
<i>Tell us somejokes, man.</i>

181
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:05,402
Yeah, yeah, okay.

182
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:07,463
How's that one
about the witch doctor?

183
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,906
Are you kidding?
They'd close the joint.

184
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:11,910
I was just thinking out loud.

185
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:15,677
I'll tell you one a little bit,
little bit more refined.

186
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,777
Uh, you like that one about
the rabbit in the tree?

187
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,515
I don't know that one.

188
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:23,580
That one about the rabbit that
fell on out of the tree and says...

189
00:16:23,658 --> 00:16:27,095
"Man, that lovemaking's for the birds".

190
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:29,892
- That's great. That's cute.
- Don't you like it?

191
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:33,402
- Oh, man, come on.
- Wait a minute, man. What do you mean?

192
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:37,235
Look, man. Hold it.
That's cute. That's funny.

193
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:39,241
- Everybody likes jokes.
- That's right.

194
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:41,641
Man, you won't offend anybody.
You know, with dates?

195
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:44,943
- Do you really think that's funny?
- Yeah, come on. Give it a try, will ya?

196
00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:47,848
- I do, man.
- I don't know. - Come on.

197
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:51,684
- Look, I can't.
- Try it, Hugh, once, will ya?

198
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,752
- Okay, okay.
- There you go.

199
00:16:55,826 --> 00:16:59,422
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
did you ever hear-

200
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:01,522
This is stupid, man.
I can't do this.

201
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:05,467
Try it, man. What's to lose with us?
Are we gonna kill you?

202
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:08,131
Look, if you're so smart,
you do it yourself.

203
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,742
Okay, I will.

204
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:13,971
It's easy though, you know.

205
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:16,105
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

206
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:21,552
On my way over here this evening
a very funny thing happened to me.

207
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:28,187
Got it? I was walking down the street
looking up at this great big tree.

208
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,197
- And way up there on -
- Man. Say it out fast. Catch 'em off guard.

209
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:36,498
- No, you got to set 'em up, man.
- Set 'em up? You'll rock 'em to sleep.

210
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:39,266
- Man, who are you, Steve Allen?
- All I'm saying -

211
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,831
Wait. I got it. I got it. I got it.

212
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,046
I say, uh...

213
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:49,110
"Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

214
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:51,880
Well, you certainly look like
a refined audience we got here tonight...

215
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:53,888
and I have a couple
of refined jokes to tell".

216
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:56,288
- See? I play up the class.
- There you go.

217
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:03,623
Beautiful couple here,
ladies and gentlemen.

218
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:07,693
There's a couple celebrating
their third drink since 7:15.

219
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:12,107
Hey, that's pretty good, man!

220
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:15,743
You're beautiful.
You two married?

221
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:19,973
What are you asking if they're married for?
They're with a fella.

222
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,984
He's the lookout.

223
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:25,251
Here's the Andrew Sisters,
ladies and gentlemen...

224
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:28,951
Patty, Maxene and LaVerne.

225
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:31,758
- Are you two girls married?
- I just asked that.

226
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:34,925
Well, it got a laugh over there.
I figured it would get a laugh here.

227
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:52,111
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want you to meet a singer-

228
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:54,381
We've got a singer right now
named Hughie Hurd.

229
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:57,288
<i>He's a great singer. I want you all
to, like, take care ofhim.</i>

230
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:59,757
Give him a lot of applause, please,
because he's new in town.

231
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,301
Man, he's putting them all to sleep.

232
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,548
- Kill him, man. Get him off.
- What?

233
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:54,717
What is this "bring the girls on"?
What kind of a place you running here?

234
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:00,851
Bring the girls on.
Bring them on out.

235
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:03,327
Call the girls, man.
Introduce the girls.

236
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:07,528
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- Bring on the girls, will ya?

237
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:57,246
Well, is everybody going
to sit around here all day?

238
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:01,682
Dennis, stop that, will ya?
It makes me sick.

239
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:05,559
- What's the matter with you, Tom?
- I got a hangover. That's what's the matter.

240
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,894
That's what you get
for staying out all night.

241
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,127
Who takes care of your sister
when you stay out all night?

242
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:13,602
Man, I hire a babysitter. Don't I hire
a babysitter for you, sweetheart?

243
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:16,299
David's writing a new novel
all about you, Ben.

244
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:20,971
Better not be any of that
beat generation jazz like the last one.

245
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,108
Stop it, Dennis. It makes me sick.

246
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:27,084
Right in my coffee, Tom.

247
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,915
Yeah, take some Dramamine.
It helps sometimes.

248
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:32,948
- Dramamine? What's Dramamine?
- It's airsick medicine.

249
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,689
I'm not airsick. I'm ground sick.

250
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:38,390
But I'll take anything
if it'll help me with the way I feel.

251
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,060
Dennis, will you do me a favor
and get me some of that stuff?

252
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:43,796
- What is it?
- Will you get me some Dramamine, please?

253
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:46,430
Do me a favor, huh?
Dennis, I appreciate that very much.

254
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:49,134
Oh, Tom! Will you cut it out?
For crying out loud.

255
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,517
You guys.

256
00:21:56,584 --> 00:22:00,646
You never break your pattern.
You'll never go anywhere with your lives.

257
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:04,089
- Tom, take this. Drink up.
- How many do I take?

258
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:06,094
Take just this one.

259
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:12,099
<i>Why don't you do something,
learn something?</i>

260
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:14,534
There are thousands of things to do
in New York City.

261
00:22:14,604 --> 00:22:18,836
<i>- Like what?
- Why don't you do something different?</i>

262
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:20,843
<i>Do you want to meet new people?</i>

263
00:22:20,911 --> 00:22:22,970
You wanna come to a literary
party I'm having tonight?

264
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:26,210
Don't invite them, David.
They won't even wear ties.

265
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:29,116
- Lelia's coming.
- What the hell is a literary party?

266
00:22:29,187 --> 00:22:34,056
<i>Just where people interested
in books and other literary efforts...</i>

267
00:22:34,124 --> 00:22:36,059
get together and discuss things.

268
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:38,255
Well, if they're coming,
I'm not going to be there...

269
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:41,696
because they're gonna just act awful,
and I'll be so embarrassed.

270
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:44,132
<i>- Oh, it's all right.
- Oh, a tie. You kidding?</i>

271
00:22:44,203 --> 00:22:46,467
<i>You can comejust as you are.
Do you want to come?</i>

272
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:49,667
<i>- Yeah, I'll read a poem.
- Don't get excited, honey.</i>

273
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:53,144
Who wants to make
that fink party anyway?

274
00:22:53,212 --> 00:22:57,843
<i>All right, something else.
A concert or a museum?</i>

275
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:02,013
A museum, I'm for it.
Ben, Tom?

276
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,990
I don't think you've ever even been
in a museum, any of you.

277
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:08,654
I? I've never been in a museum?

278
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,325
<i>We've been in plenty of museums.
I bet you can't even spell it.</i>

279
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,233
- Oh, will you stop teasing me?
- Here, Tom. Pick it up.

280
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:17,567
Lelia has a very bright mind, Bennie.

281
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:20,539
- She's developing very rapidly.
- Bull.

282
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:24,773
I don't want to sit around here and
be insulted by these creeps. Let's go.

283
00:23:24,847 --> 00:23:27,681
Lelia, you should eat something
besides black coffee.

284
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,346
David, please.
Don't start lecturing me now.

285
00:23:38,027 --> 00:23:40,462
Well?

286
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,862
- Come on, David. Let's go.
- Never mind. We're going.

287
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:46,130
What will it be, Dennis,
the Margarine or the Metropolitan?

288
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:48,865
Let's go to the Metropolitan.
They got mummies there and everything.

289
00:23:48,938 --> 00:23:50,873
- What do you say?
- You guys kidding?

290
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,070
<i>- No, man. Let's cut.
- Let's go.</i>

291
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:56,739
- Let's go. Come on, Ben.
- Hey, Bennie.

292
00:23:56,815 --> 00:23:59,215
Come on, Ben. Let's go.

293
00:24:03,421 --> 00:24:05,753
Hey, Bennie, Dennis.

294
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:20,128
I don't know what you wanted
to come here for, Dennis.

295
00:24:20,206 --> 00:24:23,404
This joint is nothing but a place
for a bunch of sexless women...

296
00:24:23,477 --> 00:24:25,411
who don't have
any love in their life.

297
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:27,641
A lot of big deal professors.

298
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:29,876
A lot of creeps trying to show
off how much they know.

299
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,283
- You couldn't be wronger.
- I suppose professors don't come here?

300
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:36,117
Well, I didn't say that.

301
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:38,351
All right, Dennis. Look at that.

302
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:40,918
I suppose you can tell me
what he's about, huh, genius?

303
00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:43,725
- He's a statue.
- I know he's a statue, Dennis.

304
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:46,097
What kind of a statue?
I know he's a statue.

305
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:49,433
- Well, Tom, I don't know everything.
- You know something, Dennis?

306
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:51,995
- You don't know nothing.
- Oh, yeah? What do you know?

307
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,066
- A lot more than you do, pal.
- Yeah?

308
00:24:54,144 --> 00:24:56,111
What you come here for
if you know so much?

309
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:58,840
You have no respect for art,
no respect at all.

310
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:02,251
You listen to me, Dennis.

311
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,312
You're nothing but an ignorant slob,
Dennis, a little ignorant slob.

312
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:08,414
<i>- I went to college, Dennis.
- You?</i>

313
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,290
<i>All I ever got out of it
was dissipation...</i>

314
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:14,388
<i>and a lot of early bells
disturbing my sleep.</i>

315
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:16,399
<i>A lot of supercilious professors...</i>

316
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:19,595
slob professors shooting off
their mouth about something...

317
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,367
trying to teach me something they'd
already failed at in life themselves.

318
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:25,933
So don't tell me
I don't appreciate anything.

319
00:25:40,628 --> 00:25:42,858
Tom, do you know what
I'm going to do with that?

320
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:45,523
I'm gonna put it on a Christmas card.
Just a mask on a card.

321
00:25:45,598 --> 00:25:48,499
- Won't that be wild?
- Don't send one to me, pal.

322
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:51,230
Look, Tom, will you cool it?
You know what you're talking about?

323
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:53,431
I suppose you really understand
that thing, huh, Bennie?

324
00:25:53,507 --> 00:25:57,082
It's not a question of understanding it.
If you feel it, you feel it, stupid.

325
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:58,274
That's what I been trying to tell you.

326
00:25:58,346 --> 00:26:00,940
- Aw, shut up, Dennis.
- Aw, shut up, yourself.

327
00:26:01,015 --> 00:26:03,848
- Say you're sorry.
- All right, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

328
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,852
Hey, look at that one, now.
Look at that one, man.

329
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,855
- You're really sorry?
- Yeah, I'm really sorry.

330
00:26:07,923 --> 00:26:10,255
- Okay. I apologize.
- Take it easy, guys, will you?

331
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:12,260
Hey, look at this.
Now, look.

332
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:15,761
<i>Now, look at this cat.</i>

333
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:18,299
He really had a sense of humor
when he made this.

334
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:20,426
That isn't supposed
to be humorous, Tom.

335
00:26:20,503 --> 00:26:23,734
What are we supposed to do,
get serious with a can like that?

336
00:26:23,806 --> 00:26:27,573
- I'm telling you right now, Tom.
- Don't get excited, Dennis.

337
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:29,703
I'm not going to hurt it.
It's made of iron.

338
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:31,714
A chick like that may destroy me.

339
00:26:31,782 --> 00:26:34,080
What's the matter with Tom?
Is he crazy or something?

340
00:26:34,252 --> 00:26:35,305
No, Dennis.

341
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:37,314
Someday you may marry a girl
that looks like that.

342
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,742
Oh, God forbid.

343
00:26:39,543 --> 00:26:41,153
- It's not funny, Dennis.
- It's not funny.

344
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:47,764
This joint gives me the creeps, Bennie.
Let's go, come on.

345
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:50,734
- Where are you going?
- Let's get out of here.

346
00:26:50,802 --> 00:26:52,793
Okay.

347
00:27:00,747 --> 00:27:03,545
Lelia.

348
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:05,913
I'm not trying
to hurt your feelings.

349
00:27:05,986 --> 00:27:09,444
But if you're going to write a story,
you have to do it professionally.

350
00:27:09,521 --> 00:27:12,013
David, I don't want to be a writer.

351
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:15,085
I didn't want to do this.
You convinced me to do it.

352
00:27:15,162 --> 00:27:18,290
And now all you can do is criticize.

353
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:21,358
I just want you to be honest.

354
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:26,805
Look, your story has some pretty good
things. But it's very hard to be honest.

355
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:28,536
I don't understand your viewpoint.

356
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,637
Jean-Paul Sartre has absolutely nothing
to do with existential psychoanalysis.

357
00:27:32,715 --> 00:27:34,444
- Would you like a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

358
00:27:34,516 --> 00:27:36,780
Well, it's all a bit vague.
Don't you think so, Joan?

359
00:27:36,852 --> 00:27:38,979
I do not. The trouble with you is...

360
00:27:39,054 --> 00:27:42,182
you suffer from self-induced hysteria
at the word existentialism.

361
00:27:42,258 --> 00:27:44,250
- Are you aware of that?
- Can I fix you a drink?

362
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:46,261
<i>- No, thank you.
- I assure you, I don't.</i>

363
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:49,162
<i>I know the article to which you refer.
I've read it three times.</i>

364
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:51,894
<i>I couldn't even find
the basic precepts.</i>

365
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:54,938
<i>- Which article was that?
- If you can explain it, I'd be delighted.</i>

366
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:58,237
Well, it's perfectly obvious.
Man, in contrast to other animals...

367
00:27:58,308 --> 00:28:00,243
is conscious of his own existence.

368
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,474
Therefore, conscious of
the possibility of non-existence.

369
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:06,015
<i>Ergo, he has anxiety, right?</i>

370
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,018
Right, absolutely.
I couldn't agree with you more.

371
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:11,078
Well, it figures.

372
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,895
Now this girl here...

373
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,330
she has no control over herself.

374
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,768
She's been deeply hurt.

375
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,771
And yet she goes on
as if nothing happened...

376
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,774
living her life the same as before.

377
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:32,403
It just doesn't make any sense.
Life takes more than imagination.

378
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:37,416
Well, the point is that
if you're yourself, you won't get hurt.

379
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:42,387
- Are you a writer too?
- Oh, no. Do I look like a writer?

380
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:45,426
Well, I can't tell anymore.

381
00:28:45,493 --> 00:28:49,521
<i>- I'm a dancer really.
- Oh, a dancer. Why, that's great.</i>

382
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:52,725
- Are you a ballet dancer?
- Oh, no, exotic.

383
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,567
<i>- Exotic?
- Oh, you don't know what that is, do you?</i>

384
00:28:57,638 --> 00:29:02,441
- Not exactly.
- It's, uh, sort of modern...

385
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:04,446
only more exotic.

386
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:06,447
That sounds terrific.

387
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:09,177
Listen, would you mind if I came
to see you perform sometime?

388
00:29:09,252 --> 00:29:11,618
<i>Oh, no. The very next time,
I'll invite you.</i>

389
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:13,622
Great. When will that be?

390
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,091
Oh, I'm not dancing right now.

391
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,822
Oh, no? Why not?

392
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:21,456
I'm going to have a baby in March.

393
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,834
You're -

394
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:26,836
That's great.
You're going to have a baby.

395
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:31,103
A baby. That sounds terrific.
Congratulations. That's great news.

396
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:33,838
<i>- We think so, don't we, honey?
- Huh?</i>

397
00:29:33,912 --> 00:29:36,973
Yeah, well, that's swell.
Congratulations.

398
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:39,710
<i>- Thank you.
- Listen, if it's okay...</i>

399
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:42,981
I'll just excuse myself
and fix my drink a little bit.

400
00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:01,705
<i>You don't know what it is to be hurt.
You can't always see it coming.</i>

401
00:30:01,776 --> 00:30:05,336
Sometimes a person could ruin your life.

402
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:09,247
And yet, all he'd be able
to honestly say is "I'm sorry".

403
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:12,047
Hi, David.
Am I interrupting something?

404
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:15,817
Tony. Lelia Carruthers, Tony Russell.

405
00:30:15,891 --> 00:30:17,483
- Hello.
- Hello.

406
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,653
I was just trying
to convince Lelia that...

407
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:22,390
writers today have got to be
realistic in their approach.

408
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,661
What he's trying to say is,
he hates my writing.

409
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:28,259
You be the judge, Tony.
You be the judge.

410
00:30:28,337 --> 00:30:30,601
On her first day in New York this year...

411
00:30:30,673 --> 00:30:33,336
Lelia's writing about
a walk down Fifth Avenue.

412
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:38,838
<i>She sees a stranger standing
in the sunlight on a street corner...</i>

413
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:41,816
<i>and she walks up and kisses him,
this perfect stranger.</i>

414
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:44,547
<i>It's revolting on a Sunday afternoon.</i>

415
00:30:44,622 --> 00:30:48,719
It is not.
If I wanted to, I would.

416
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:01,569
Was that so bold?

417
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:04,235
I guess I have to
change sides, David.

418
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,302
David, would you go and get me
some more champagne?

419
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:09,870
It's even more revolting in real life.

420
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:13,684
Some more champagne.

421
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:16,882
I think you've had plenty.

422
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:26,095
- What did you say your name was?
- Lelia.

423
00:31:27,234 --> 00:31:29,725
It's a lovely party, isn't it?

424
00:31:29,803 --> 00:31:32,397
Do you know you're staring at me?

425
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:37,139
- I'm hypnotizing you.
- Thank you.

426
00:31:37,212 --> 00:31:39,237
Who do you belong to, Lelia?

427
00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:42,316
Why, I belong to me.

428
00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:44,648
What about David?

429
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:51,660
- No more champagne, Lelia.
- David, I was just about to see Lelia home.

430
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:54,161
What do you mean?
I'm taking Lelia home.

431
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,427
Well, uh, you're both wrong...

432
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,798
because neither one of you
are taking me home.

433
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:02,805
I'm meeting Vickie and
she's spending the night at my house.

434
00:32:02,872 --> 00:32:07,504
Oh. I guess my hypnotic spell is
a little rusty. What about tomorrow?

435
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:10,513
Tomorrow, Lelia and I
are going to the park.

436
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,140
<i>- Oh, well, good, good. I'll come along.
- No.</i>

437
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:16,482
- Oh.
- David, don't be so unfriendly.

438
00:32:31,337 --> 00:32:34,637
Don't be such an old man, David.

439
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,642
- Hi, Moe.
- Moe-Moe.

440
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,077
Hey, baby.
Give me one of those.

441
00:32:41,081 --> 00:32:43,015
- Hello, stranger. There's a stranger.
- Hi, Moe.

442
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,017
- Hello, Moe.
- How have you been?

443
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:47,713
- Lelia, come here.
- You sure look like you've got a hangover.

444
00:32:48,788 --> 00:32:50,256
I've gotta go.

445
00:32:50,324 --> 00:32:52,554
- What's the story here?
- I'll talk to you later about it.

446
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:54,526
I thought you and Lelia were making
the scene. Dave, wait a minute!

447
00:32:54,595 --> 00:32:57,257
- I can't. I can't.
- Oh, wow.

448
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,751
I'm really not very happy.

449
00:33:53,826 --> 00:33:57,227
I mean, I'm happy, but I'm not
as happy as everybody thinks I am.

450
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:59,230
- Why not?
- Oh...

451
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:02,426
because I feel that I should be
farther ahead than I am.

452
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:06,064
And everything
is passing me by, and -

453
00:34:06,139 --> 00:34:08,074
- How old are you?
- Twenty.

454
00:34:08,141 --> 00:34:12,976
- I'd never guess.
- Oh, stop. Don't laugh. I'm serious.

455
00:34:13,046 --> 00:34:16,380
I have the feeling that
I'll never, you know, be smart...

456
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,079
and I'm never going
to get the things that I want.

457
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:22,955
And, uh - Oh -

458
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:24,992
What do you feel like?
Tell me what you feel like.

459
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,052
- I feel like I'm in a -
- In a cocoon and you can't get out?

460
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,063
That's right.
How did you know?

461
00:34:30,132 --> 00:34:32,793
I didn't think boys were supposed to
understand things like that.

462
00:34:32,868 --> 00:34:36,703
- You see, I am far behind.
- Behind who?

463
00:34:36,773 --> 00:34:40,675
- Now you sound like David.
- I hope not.

464
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:44,406
Why not? David's one of the most
intelligent people I've met in my life.

465
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:46,415
But not very romantic.

466
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:49,816
No, he's not very romantic.

467
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,792
You know, I'm not a very nice person.

468
00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:57,828
I mean,
I have very romantic inclinations.

469
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,363
Be forewarned that I'm not one
of these storybook characters...

470
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,798
that's supposed to be
all noble and righteous.

471
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,427
When I see someone I like...

472
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:09,304
and if she likes me,
we accept my romantic inclinations.

473
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,275
Do you happen to know
where we are right now?

474
00:35:15,348 --> 00:35:17,474
No.

475
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:22,146
That's where I live,
right there, number seven.

476
00:35:23,524 --> 00:35:25,754
Come on up for a drink.

477
00:35:28,595 --> 00:35:31,120
You know you're beautiful?

478
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:03,999
Don't you move.

479
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:15,577
Don't move.

480
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:54,444
You've got the softest lips
I've ever felt.

481
00:37:01,363 --> 00:37:03,296
Tony.

482
00:37:04,298 --> 00:37:06,232
I love you, Lelia.

483
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,760
I don't want anything to drink.

484
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,376
All right, baby.

485
00:37:20,148 --> 00:37:22,343
I love you, Lelia.

486
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:25,453
Love you, Lelia.

487
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:28,981
Baby, I love you.

488
00:37:30,861 --> 00:37:32,794
So much.

489
00:37:54,952 --> 00:37:57,251
Lelia.

490
00:37:57,322 --> 00:37:59,517
Really, if I'd known
this was the first time for you...

491
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:01,582
I wouldn't have touched you.

492
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:05,186
I didn't know it could be so awful.

493
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:08,333
Don't be so upset, sweetheart.

494
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,631
Baby.

495
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,233
It'll be much easier next time.

496
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,740
There isn't going to be a next time.

497
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,378
Want a cigarette? Huh?

498
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:32,450
- Come on, have a cigarette.
- No.

499
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:39,824
<i>I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
I guess I did.</i>

500
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:46,064
I was so frightened.

501
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,412
I kept saying to myself,
"You mustn't cry.

502
00:38:53,483 --> 00:38:56,316
If you love a man,
you shouldn't be so frightened".

503
00:38:57,821 --> 00:38:59,812
It's only natural.

504
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,690
There isn't a girl in the world
that wouldn't feel the same way.

505
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:05,752
She's got to.

506
00:39:07,564 --> 00:39:10,397
- What happens now?
- What happens?

507
00:39:11,635 --> 00:39:15,300
Uh, what do you mean,
"What happens now"?

508
00:39:17,777 --> 00:39:20,904
- I mean, do I stay with you?
- Stay with me?

509
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,472
Uh, stay with me?
Do you mean live with me?

510
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:28,778
Yes.

511
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:34,619
Do you want to?

512
00:39:38,064 --> 00:39:40,692
No.

513
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:42,735
I want to go home.

514
00:39:44,906 --> 00:39:47,033
Okay, baby.

515
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:56,939
I thought being with you
would be so important...

516
00:39:58,554 --> 00:40:00,886
mean so much...

517
00:40:03,058 --> 00:40:07,051
that afterwards two people would be
as close as it's possible to get.

518
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:12,299
But instead...

519
00:40:15,138 --> 00:40:19,200
<i>- we're just two strangers.
- Lelia.</i>

520
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:22,836
- Lelia.
- It's over.

521
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:26,883
I know that much about life.

522
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,512
Lelia, you can come stay with me.

523
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:34,524
I want you to.

524
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:38,061
But when I say
that you're close to me...

525
00:40:38,128 --> 00:40:40,995
that's all I can say,
because that's the way I am.

526
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,664
But that does not mean that I don't feel
the same things that you feel.

527
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:49,536
Tony, please, please don't.

528
00:40:50,543 --> 00:40:54,172
- Lelia, I love you.
- Please don't touch me.

529
00:40:55,181 --> 00:40:58,150
Please don't touch me.
I want to go home.

530
00:41:02,189 --> 00:41:05,022
- I want to get dressed now.
- Okay, sweetheart. Okay.

531
00:41:05,092 --> 00:41:07,925
- Please leave me alone.
- Okay, sweetheart, I'll take you home.

532
00:41:07,995 --> 00:41:11,227
Okay, sweetheart.
Sweetheart, it's okay.

533
00:41:11,298 --> 00:41:13,232
- I'm with you.
- I want to go home.

534
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,292
I'll take you home.
I'll take you home.

535
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:23,543
Seventy-five, buddy.

536
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:28,106
Look, uh, why don't you just take
the taxi wherever you're gonna go?

537
00:41:28,182 --> 00:41:30,345
Because I'm coming upstairs with you.

538
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:34,211
Look, folks. Come on,
it's my busy time. Let's go.

539
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,782
Yeah, yeah.
Just a second, huh?

540
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:41,222
Look, why don't we
just end it right here?

541
00:41:41,297 --> 00:41:43,630
Make up your minds.

542
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:48,969
Because you don't want it that way,
and because I don't want it that way.

543
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,907
You go with her,
or end it and you stay.

544
00:41:51,975 --> 00:41:54,536
But, uh, come on,
make up your mind.

545
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,103
- How much - How much on the clock?
- Seventy-five.

546
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,983
I'm coming upstairs with you, Lelia,
whether you like it or not.

547
00:42:01,053 --> 00:42:05,113
- Please, don't make any scenes.
- I'll make the biggest scene you ever saw.

548
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,522
You're that important to me.

549
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:13,030
All right, all right. You can come up,
but just for a minute.

550
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:15,965
Okay, fine.

551
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:20,607
Ain't love grand?

552
00:42:20,673 --> 00:42:23,141
Why don't you
mind your own business.

553
00:42:24,978 --> 00:42:26,912
Keep it. Keep it.

554
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,525
<i>- What's wild?
- Deuces wild.</i>

555
00:42:44,598 --> 00:42:46,533
<i>- It's up to you, Dennis.
- Any kind of deuce?</i>

556
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,537
<i>Any kind of deuce. It's up to you,
Dennis. You open or what?</i>

557
00:42:49,605 --> 00:42:52,164
I open for 50.
Give me two cards, Ben.

558
00:42:52,241 --> 00:42:54,209
Wait a minute.
Want me to call you, do you?

559
00:42:55,578 --> 00:42:57,773
Tell you what
I'm gonna do, Dennis.

560
00:42:59,048 --> 00:43:01,209
You need the money,
so I'm gonna let you have it.

561
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:04,481
I'm gonna let you have this hand
and bury my cards.

562
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:06,488
<i>I don't wanna play anymore.
Let's call some girls.</i>

563
00:43:06,556 --> 00:43:08,751
<i>- Come on, let's call a couple of chicks.
- Why not?</i>

564
00:43:08,825 --> 00:43:10,986
<i>- Get on the phone, Bennie.
- Come on, Ben.</i>

565
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:13,359
Who do you know, Ben?
You should know a lot of chicks.

566
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:16,058
You said you had something.
You've been bragging all day about it.

567
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:18,398
Ben, call Barbara.
Barbara Kennedy.

568
00:43:19,771 --> 00:43:23,538
Twelve twenty-one, please.

569
00:43:26,045 --> 00:43:28,569
Room 1221.
Uh, Anita.

570
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,484
I don't know her last name, just Anita.
Yeah, room 1221.

571
00:43:35,754 --> 00:43:37,745
Yeah, hello, baby.

572
00:43:40,393 --> 00:43:43,054
This is Clark.
I'm all through flying.

573
00:43:45,131 --> 00:43:48,658
Anita? Yeah, Tom.

574
00:43:48,736 --> 00:43:50,431
<i>How about a couple of drinks?</i>

575
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:54,132
Can you get that redhead
that works in the hat check room?

576
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,732
No, there's three of us.
I got two buddies.

577
00:43:56,811 --> 00:43:59,302
Yeah, Bennie and Dennis.

578
00:44:00,748 --> 00:44:03,718
We're feeling mighty low.
Can you get another girl?

579
00:44:03,784 --> 00:44:07,619
All right, I'll meet you in about
20 minutes? Yeah, see you.

580
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:10,590
- Tell you, man?
- Come on, let's go.

581
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:13,321
Didn't I tell you the chicks would go?
You didn't believe me.

582
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:15,522
<i>Let's go!
Come on, let's go.</i>

583
00:44:16,898 --> 00:44:19,390
<i>Come on, Bennie.</i>

584
00:45:32,246 --> 00:45:35,375
<i>Okay, let's break it up.</i>

585
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,146
That's more like it.
How you been?

586
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:41,190
I'm fine. Uh, Tony Russell,
this is my brother, Hugh.

587
00:45:41,256 --> 00:45:44,487
<i>- Hi.
- And this is Rupert Crosse.</i>

588
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:47,222
Glad to know you.

589
00:45:47,297 --> 00:45:49,231
How are you?

590
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,498
Well, how did the thing go?
I mean, big crowds?

591
00:45:54,637 --> 00:45:57,607
<i>Fine. The only one bad spot
in the whole thing was...</i>

592
00:45:57,675 --> 00:46:01,167
<i>this character here decides to--
he's gonna rewrite everything.</i>

593
00:46:01,245 --> 00:46:03,236
<i>You ever hearJelly Roll
sung like an opera?</i>

594
00:46:03,314 --> 00:46:07,251
<i>Come on. The song's notJelly Roll, man.
It's a ballad. It's a beautiful thing.</i>

595
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:10,151
- You sing like a velvety-
- Of course, honey.

596
00:46:10,222 --> 00:46:12,713
Oh, Lelia.

597
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:15,419
I have an appointment.
I have to go.

598
00:46:23,303 --> 00:46:26,066
I have an appointment.
I told you.

599
00:46:33,746 --> 00:46:37,911
- Where are you going?
- My appointment.

600
00:46:37,985 --> 00:46:39,953
You didn't tell me about
an appointment earlier.

601
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,079
I just remembered about it
a couple of minutes ago.

602
00:46:42,156 --> 00:46:45,489
<i>Tony, I love you.
Doesn't that mean anything?</i>

603
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:54,734
Look, Lelia.

604
00:46:54,803 --> 00:46:56,930
We'll have lunch tomorrow, okay?

605
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:06,277
After lunch, we'll go to a movie
or something like that.

606
00:47:06,348 --> 00:47:08,283
<i>Maybe have some drinks.</i>

607
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,754
Lelia.

608
00:47:12,822 --> 00:47:14,756
Lelia.

609
00:47:17,093 --> 00:47:19,027
Look.

610
00:47:20,163 --> 00:47:22,495
I don't wanna fight with you.
I don't wanna argue with you.

611
00:47:22,565 --> 00:47:25,729
- What's the matter?
- I want you to go.

612
00:47:25,803 --> 00:47:27,737
Why?

613
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:31,400
I don't want you -
I don't want you to hurt my sister.

614
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:34,342
- I don't wanna hurt your sister.
- Look. Maybe I can make you understand.

615
00:47:34,413 --> 00:47:37,176
- Lelia, I don't want to hurt you.
- Look, I want you to go!

616
00:47:37,248 --> 00:47:39,183
Why? I don't understand that.

617
00:47:39,252 --> 00:47:43,245
Look, I want you to go.
I mean, it's as simple as that.

618
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:46,315
- I don't want you around.
- Want to have dinner with us tomorrow?

619
00:47:46,391 --> 00:47:47,668
I don't want nothing from you.

620
00:47:47,673 --> 00:47:50,225
I'll take you and Rupe to dinner.
All of us will go.

621
00:47:50,296 --> 00:47:52,423
I can't seem to
make it clear to you.

622
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:56,403
I don't want you around
hurting my sister.

623
00:47:57,904 --> 00:48:00,465
I don't want you
to hurt anything of mine.

624
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,702
Now go.

625
00:48:02,775 --> 00:48:05,142
Just get out!

626
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:08,982
- You're telling me to get out.
- Get out, man.

627
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,813
What do you want me to do now?
Just get out.

628
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:19,819
Remember, you told me to get out.

629
00:48:19,894 --> 00:48:22,158
Look, would you leave?

630
00:48:23,164 --> 00:48:26,225
Would you leave before I do something
I don't want to do right now.

631
00:48:26,302 --> 00:48:29,465
Would you just get out of here.
Go ahead.

632
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,870
But you remember you told me
to get out of here!

633
00:48:31,941 --> 00:48:34,273
Will you get out of the house!

634
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,684
- You got me, Bennie -
- I love you.

635
00:49:13,886 --> 00:49:16,855
Okay. It's all right.

636
00:49:16,923 --> 00:49:19,414
Oh, I love him so much.

637
00:49:40,014 --> 00:49:42,507
<i>You all right, baby?</i>

638
00:49:51,026 --> 00:49:52,961
Good night, baby.

639
00:49:53,028 --> 00:49:55,054
Get some sleep, will you?

640
00:50:33,673 --> 00:50:37,972
That water better be hot this morning or
I'm gonna wipe that superintendent out.

641
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:43,583
Excuse me.

642
00:50:46,587 --> 00:50:49,453
Hey, how do you manage to get here
three minutes before I do?

643
00:50:49,523 --> 00:50:52,686
What do you do, get up late at night
and watch the alarm or something?

644
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,888
- Too bad.
- Just don't slop it up in there, okay?

645
00:50:55,962 --> 00:50:58,022
Well, some people like water on them.

646
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,830
Oh, go drown yourself.

647
00:51:04,706 --> 00:51:06,799
Hey, baby. How you feeling?

648
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,808
- Fine.
- Great.

649
00:51:08,877 --> 00:51:12,609
Looks like I'll have to go out
and buy you a whole field of tobacco.

650
00:51:13,816 --> 00:51:15,908
How you feel now?
You feel like talking to me about it?

651
00:51:15,985 --> 00:51:18,215
- Maybe it'll help you.
- No, Hugh.

652
00:51:19,488 --> 00:51:22,480
There's not much to say.
Thanks anyway.

653
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,050
Is it just possible for somebody
to get a towel in this place?

654
00:51:25,128 --> 00:51:27,221
Oh, I forgot to put them up.
I'll get you one.

655
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:29,788
No, don't drag it out.
It's probably someplace simple...

656
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:31,994
like in the hi-fi set.

657
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:34,833
Look, I better get it while it's hot.

658
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:38,602
Oh, Lelia. Look, I got some cats
coming up tonight.

659
00:51:38,676 --> 00:51:41,804
And, uh, if you don't feel
up to it, we can cancel.

660
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:44,212
Oh, no, Hugh.
It's all right, really.

661
00:51:45,216 --> 00:51:48,845
I'll even order some things.
It'll give me something to do.

662
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,355
Great, great. That's my baby.

663
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,024
Al.

664
00:52:00,866 --> 00:52:03,835
Al told me a story yesterday about Bird.

665
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:10,031
Bird had this big limousine that had been
assessed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue...

666
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,876
and he was driving it all over town,
you know, like a block long.

667
00:52:13,948 --> 00:52:16,382
And, uh, he was driving with
two other people in the car...

668
00:52:16,451 --> 00:52:19,511
and Al was, like, the guy
in the center who, like, told me.

669
00:52:19,586 --> 00:52:22,316
And the guy on the outside he didn't like
and they were going uptown.

670
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:25,257
And they were going down Broadway
and they had to make a left...

671
00:52:25,326 --> 00:52:27,453
and another left to go uptown.

672
00:52:27,528 --> 00:52:30,498
So as they stopped at the light...

673
00:52:30,566 --> 00:52:32,500
Bird said...

674
00:52:32,568 --> 00:52:36,402
"Man, would you mind getting out
of the car? I have to make a left turn".

675
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:38,633
So the guy said, "Okay, Bird,"
and got out of the car.

676
00:52:38,707 --> 00:52:42,074
And Bird made his left turn
and went uptown without him.

677
00:52:42,145 --> 00:52:45,945
- Isn't that sick?
- Yeah, very.

678
00:52:46,016 --> 00:52:48,678
- Hey, Bennie, you got a towel for me?
- Yeah.

679
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:51,816
Thanks.

680
00:52:53,156 --> 00:52:55,921
Maybe I'll just join
a small group in Vegas.

681
00:52:56,926 --> 00:52:59,827
Bennie, what's this I hear
about you getting a job?

682
00:52:59,898 --> 00:53:02,366
I mean, that really upsets me.

683
00:53:02,433 --> 00:53:06,598
- You're kidding, aren't you?
- Very funny, very funny.

684
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:10,199
Lelia, can I get you
a cup of coffee or something?

685
00:53:10,275 --> 00:53:12,800
No, Hugh.

686
00:53:12,878 --> 00:53:15,279
What's the matter with you?
Are you sick?

687
00:53:18,283 --> 00:53:21,447
You look awful. You ought
to get some rest at night.

688
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,455
Will you shut up!

689
00:53:28,194 --> 00:53:30,128
What did I say?

690
00:53:31,131 --> 00:53:33,190
Just forget it.

691
00:53:33,267 --> 00:53:35,201
I won't forget it. What did I say?

692
00:53:35,269 --> 00:53:38,238
- What's the matter with her?
- Nothing you'd be interested in.

693
00:53:38,305 --> 00:53:41,706
Look, she's my sister too. I wanna know
what's the matter with her.

694
00:53:41,775 --> 00:53:44,972
Nothing, baby. Just a little problem
that came up last night.

695
00:53:45,045 --> 00:53:47,412
A little problem?
What is the little problem?

696
00:53:49,217 --> 00:53:54,211
Look, Bennie. It's just a problem
with the races, that's all.

697
00:53:57,392 --> 00:54:01,659
Like I said, Bennie,
nothing you'd be interested in.

698
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,691
Who all is coming
to this party tonight?

699
00:54:05,769 --> 00:54:08,066
Oh, just some people.

700
00:54:26,157 --> 00:54:28,091
You know what you need?

701
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:31,424
You need a guy to take care of you
and protect your values.

702
00:54:31,496 --> 00:54:34,364
You need a home and security
and babies, honey.

703
00:54:34,433 --> 00:54:36,367
That's what you need.

704
00:54:37,469 --> 00:54:40,734
<i>- Oh, look. There's DaveyJones. Davey!
- No, Vickie.</i>

705
00:54:40,806 --> 00:54:42,740
Meet Davey. He's wonderful.
You'll love him.

706
00:54:42,808 --> 00:54:45,641
- Vickie, no.
- Davey! DaveyJones. Davey!

707
00:54:45,711 --> 00:54:49,273
Davey, I want you to meet Lelia.
Lelia, this is Davey.

708
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:52,045
- Hello there.
- Hello.

709
00:54:52,118 --> 00:54:54,916
Sit down for a second, Davey.

710
00:54:56,856 --> 00:55:00,918
Davey went to the same school -
Your brother's school, Stuyvesant.

711
00:55:03,097 --> 00:55:07,056
<i>Vickie--
How long have you known Vickie?</i>

712
00:55:08,502 --> 00:55:10,800
What do you do all day?

713
00:55:10,871 --> 00:55:14,399
- I paint.
- You're an artist.

714
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,246
Maybe I can drop by one afternoon.
Take in a movie or something.

715
00:55:18,313 --> 00:55:20,713
I don't like the movies.

716
00:55:20,783 --> 00:55:24,583
Well, there are other places to go.
Take you to a club then. How about that?

717
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:28,455
Or we'll go to an opera.

718
00:55:28,524 --> 00:55:30,458
I might drop up one afternoon.

719
00:55:30,526 --> 00:55:32,517
Maybe we can go for a walk
through the park or-

720
00:55:32,594 --> 00:55:34,530
I don't like the park either.

721
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:37,158
<i>Oh, give me a break.</i>

722
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,253
Hi, Dave, daddy.

723
00:55:45,354 --> 00:55:47,644
Hello, Rupert. How are you?
I'm not interrupting, am I?

724
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,681
Vickie, will you help me out, put in
a good word here or there somewhere?

725
00:55:55,587 --> 00:55:57,714
Well.

726
00:55:57,789 --> 00:56:00,781
- To talk to Lelia.
- Hi, baby. How are you doing?

727
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,727
Why don't you take her
to that wonderful painters' -

728
00:56:03,796 --> 00:56:06,890
They're having some kind of thing
over at Cooper Union.

729
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:10,595
- She'd love that.
- I wouldn't dig that at all.

730
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,138
Well, that's the kind of thing
I enjoy, you see?

731
00:56:14,473 --> 00:56:18,034
Well, we'll go then.

732
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:25,851
Lelia. Hello.

733
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,217
I'd like to see you
for a second, can I?

734
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:30,586
<i>- Yeah, what?
- It's about Tony.</i>

735
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:41,727
Say, uh, excuse me. Can I talk to Lelia
for just a second? It's something important.

736
00:56:41,803 --> 00:56:44,294
<i>- No, David. I'd rather not.
- Honey. It's okay.</i>

737
00:56:44,373 --> 00:56:47,604
No, please. David,
I don't want to discuss any of this.

738
00:56:47,676 --> 00:56:50,703
- Please. Just come with me for a second.
- No, David, please!

739
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:54,614
He called me. He was very upset about
something that happened here the other day.

740
00:56:54,684 --> 00:56:58,017
- And he got me upset about it.
- I know, David.

741
00:56:58,087 --> 00:57:00,988
Yeah, but I feel I'm involved in it.
And I just want to tell you...

742
00:57:01,057 --> 00:57:03,389
that I didn't know at all
what he was like, when, you know -

743
00:57:03,459 --> 00:57:06,452
Hey, hey, Dave, Dave.

744
00:57:06,531 --> 00:57:08,794
Come on, Dave.
Leave my sister alone.

745
00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:11,426
Come on, man.
Come on and join the party.

746
00:57:16,507 --> 00:57:18,442
Look, I have to go.

747
00:57:18,509 --> 00:57:20,445
I'll see you later, all right?

748
00:57:20,512 --> 00:57:23,709
- You're a very good dancer.
- I'm not such a good dancer.

749
00:57:23,783 --> 00:57:26,115
Lelia, come on over here.
Come on over here.

750
00:57:26,184 --> 00:57:28,175
Looks like you and her
are getting along real fine.

751
00:57:28,254 --> 00:57:30,484
Well.

752
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:02,417
Look, why don't you just
come on and have a drink with us...

753
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:06,655
and join in the party
and forget about your mood for a while?

754
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,663
You know, I just don't understand.

755
00:58:08,732 --> 00:58:11,565
I think you really
want to join in the party...

756
00:58:11,633 --> 00:58:13,760
but maybe you don't know how.

757
00:58:13,836 --> 00:58:16,305
You want to be coaxed a little bit.

758
00:58:16,372 --> 00:58:18,306
You really feel that way?

759
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:23,137
I prefer to be coaxed.
But don't you coax me, okay?

760
00:58:23,214 --> 00:58:25,044
There are other ways.

761
00:58:27,852 --> 00:58:30,150
You want a drink?
Want me to get you a drink?

762
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:34,055
<i>- No, thanks. I don't drink.
- You'll find it's good for what ails you.</i>

763
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:39,894
<i>Just pull yourself together, because
you're not kidding anybody but yourself.</i>

764
00:58:39,965 --> 00:58:44,902
You know, you have
your sense of values all mixed up.

765
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:46,904
So I can just -

766
00:58:46,971 --> 00:58:49,406
No, don't touch me.

767
00:58:49,474 --> 00:58:51,704
Come on, just a little taste.

768
00:59:02,555 --> 00:59:05,149
- Let him go, let him go.
- You're crazy, baby.

769
00:59:05,224 --> 00:59:08,092
<i>- Let me go. Let me go.
- Hugh, come on.</i>

770
00:59:08,162 --> 00:59:10,153
Let me go!

771
00:59:14,002 --> 00:59:16,561
<i>What the hell is wrong with that guy?</i>

772
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:18,628
What's wrong with you?
You don't have to get carried away.

773
00:59:18,706 --> 00:59:20,866
He's always messing up the damn thing!
What's wrong with him?

774
00:59:20,942 --> 00:59:23,103
This is a party! Stop it!

775
00:59:39,096 --> 00:59:42,691
Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow.

776
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,391
Everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

777
00:59:58,683 --> 01:00:01,481
- Gee, he's your brother, and I -
- I know.

778
01:00:01,552 --> 01:00:04,077
I find it hard to believe
you can't talk to him.

779
01:00:04,155 --> 01:00:09,184
I don't know, right now I'd just be satisfied
with a home and a few kids, you know.

780
01:00:09,262 --> 01:00:12,753
- Simple things.
- I envy you.

781
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:16,289
He's a pretty unhappy kid, you know.
It's too bad you can't -

782
01:00:16,368 --> 01:00:19,132
He's mixed up and for some reason,
I don't know...

783
01:00:19,204 --> 01:00:21,502
he doesn't,
either doesn't want to, is afraid to -

784
01:00:21,573 --> 01:00:24,008
Okay, Hugh.
Let her off the hook, will you?

785
01:00:25,146 --> 01:00:26,511
<i>The night's almost over.</i>

786
01:00:28,482 --> 01:00:31,006
Let's end it off with a little smile
rather than all this.

787
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:35,487
What's with this "Leave the girl alone"?
Why don't you leave me alone?

788
01:00:35,556 --> 01:00:38,616
I was only attempting to remind you
that we invited her here...

789
01:00:38,691 --> 01:00:40,422
<i>to have a good time, that's all.</i>

790
01:00:40,495 --> 01:00:42,986
She obviously wants to hear
what I have to say.

791
01:00:43,063 --> 01:00:45,793
<i>- Maybe he doesn't wanna talk about it.
- She's not complaining.</i>

792
01:00:45,867 --> 01:00:48,427
Why don't you butt out,
mind your own business?

793
01:00:48,502 --> 01:00:51,097
<i>We want to kill each other,
that's my business.</i>

794
01:00:51,173 --> 01:00:54,472
Every time I turn around, it's you behind me
pushing me, interfering with me.

795
01:00:54,543 --> 01:00:56,637
<i>- You could be replaced.
- You sound pretty mad about it.</i>

796
01:00:56,712 --> 01:01:01,046
Okay, Hugh.
Let's knock it off, huh?

797
01:01:03,052 --> 01:01:04,610
Hey, look.
I'm picking up your phrases.

798
01:01:04,687 --> 01:01:07,019
The other day in Philadelphia
when I was singing...

799
01:01:07,089 --> 01:01:09,114
you know,
I don't appreciate that at all.

800
01:01:09,192 --> 01:01:11,855
<i>- Oh, yeah.
- I'm getting ready to sing the song.</i>

801
01:01:11,929 --> 01:01:13,863
In the middle of the song...

802
01:01:13,932 --> 01:01:17,492
for what reason I don't know
why you did it, you decided to change it.

803
01:01:17,568 --> 01:01:19,536
This don't make sense.
Does that make any kind of sense?

804
01:01:19,603 --> 01:01:23,472
No, I don't think it's fair to...

805
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,637
- sort of as a last minute sort of thing.
- Another little bright idea of his.

806
01:01:27,713 --> 01:01:29,976
Without interfering with you...

807
01:01:30,049 --> 01:01:32,677
I think what you feel more
is my attitude towards life.

808
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:36,186
<i>Maybe that bugs you, but don't hold it
against me. That's the way I am, see.</i>

809
01:01:36,255 --> 01:01:39,190
How much longer you
planning on us staying here?

810
01:01:39,258 --> 01:01:42,922
<i>- I don't know. What time is it now?
- Five after 5:00.</i>

811
01:01:45,532 --> 01:01:47,500
- Here are your keys.
- Where the hell have you been?

812
01:01:47,567 --> 01:01:50,058
- What the hell do you care?
- What do you mean, "What do I care"?

813
01:01:50,136 --> 01:01:52,069
- There are your keys. Where's Lelia?
- She's out.

814
01:01:52,138 --> 01:01:54,333
Don't mess with me.
I'm splitting. There are your keys.

815
01:01:54,407 --> 01:01:57,241
- I want to talk to you.
- No. Get out of my way.

816
01:01:57,311 --> 01:01:59,779
- I want to talk to you!
- Are you gonna stop it?

817
01:01:59,847 --> 01:02:02,645
Take your hands off!

818
01:02:02,717 --> 01:02:04,378
Look, Bennie, you're my brother.

819
01:02:04,452 --> 01:02:06,852
What do you want me to do,
start the whole thing all over again?

820
01:02:06,921 --> 01:02:09,446
Goddamn it, if I have to whip you,
I'm gonna tell you something!

821
01:02:09,523 --> 01:02:12,493
- Look, wait a minute, will you?
- I'm going.

822
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:15,189
Bennie, will you listen? I love you.
What the hell am I supposed to say?

823
01:02:16,665 --> 01:02:22,365
<i>Bennie. Bennie, for God's--
Take the keys, please.</i>

824
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:25,463
- Bennie.
- All right.

825
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:29,876
Are we friends?
Buddies? Brothers?

826
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,982
Huh?

827
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:44,060
- Hi. All ready?
- Well, hello.

828
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:47,497
No. Where's my flowers?

829
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:51,431
I was late, so I didn't have
a chance to - I just ran right over.

830
01:02:51,503 --> 01:02:54,233
Well, I just don't think
that's very nice of you at all.

831
01:02:54,306 --> 01:02:58,107
Don't you think you should bring a lady
something when you beg to take her out?

832
01:02:58,177 --> 01:03:00,509
I can go back and get them
if you want me to.

833
01:03:00,578 --> 01:03:03,070
No, just go make yourself comfortable.
There's drinks in there.

834
01:03:03,149 --> 01:03:05,674
- Go, go.
- Will you be long?

835
01:03:05,751 --> 01:03:07,742
I'll be as long as I am.

836
01:03:12,325 --> 01:03:14,385
- Hi, there.
- Oh, hi.

837
01:03:14,462 --> 01:03:16,622
I'm Davey. I'm taking Lelia
to the dance tonight.

838
01:03:16,698 --> 01:03:20,565
Oh, good. Pleased to meet you.

839
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:25,162
Uh, why don't you go and have a drink
with my brother and Rupe?

840
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:28,471
- Thanks.
- Introduce yourself, why don't you?

841
01:03:30,011 --> 01:03:32,275
Hi, fellas.

842
01:03:32,348 --> 01:03:34,282
- Hi.
- Hi.

843
01:03:34,349 --> 01:03:37,148
- It doesn't even make sense to be singing.
- I don't want to talk about -

844
01:03:37,218 --> 01:03:38,880
- What?
- What's up?

845
01:03:38,953 --> 01:03:40,888
What's up?
What do you mean, "What's up"?

846
01:03:40,955 --> 01:03:43,185
- You want a drink?
- I'd love one.

847
01:03:43,258 --> 01:03:45,920
- Good, get one over there.
- Yeah, drinks over there.

848
01:03:45,995 --> 01:03:48,327
Over there, man. Drinks over there.
The whole song -

849
01:03:48,397 --> 01:03:51,093
It would sound ridiculous
the other way, you know?

850
01:03:51,167 --> 01:03:53,158
- I'd want to do it, you know -
- Lelia, let's -

851
01:03:53,236 --> 01:03:55,170
I'm not ready, David.
David, I'm -

852
01:03:55,238 --> 01:03:57,172
Do I look ready? No.

853
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,368
Therefore, wait.
Be comfortable and wait.

854
01:03:59,443 --> 01:04:01,377
- Lelia, it's getting late.
- Well, wait.

855
01:04:07,618 --> 01:04:10,109
I'm not gonna say I'm gonna sing
all the things like that.

856
01:04:10,187 --> 01:04:12,917
- Were you just doing "Lucky Day"?
- Yeah.

857
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,221
I know that song.
I'm doing it in my nightclub act.

858
01:04:15,294 --> 01:04:17,227
- Great, man. Great.
- Oh, boy. That's terrific.

859
01:04:17,295 --> 01:04:19,628
No, but really.
I know it, and he's doing it wrong.

860
01:04:19,698 --> 01:04:21,689
Oh, really?
You want to show him how to do it?

861
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:24,759
That's wrong, man. You're dragging it
through the middle. It's a up tune, man.

862
01:04:24,837 --> 01:04:27,031
- It has to go and swing.
- You tell him, now.

863
01:04:27,105 --> 01:04:30,598
- You know, you know.
- See? Now, that's the right idea.

864
01:04:30,677 --> 01:04:34,840
Oh, wow. Isn't this -

865
01:04:34,914 --> 01:04:38,248
Hey, Bennie. Isn't this great?

866
01:04:40,787 --> 01:04:45,725
Hey, Bennie. Isn't he a smash?

867
01:04:45,794 --> 01:04:48,490
What do you think you're doing?
What do you think you're doing here?

868
01:04:48,563 --> 01:04:49,616
I was explaining that song.

869
01:04:49,621 --> 01:04:51,726
I didn't ask you to interrupt
my brother's business.

870
01:04:51,799 --> 01:04:54,132
- He was singing it wrong.
- He makes the money, not you.

871
01:04:54,202 --> 01:04:56,260
<i>- You don't understand.
- What do you mean?</i>

872
01:04:56,337 --> 01:04:59,101
I didn't ask you to come in here
and disturb my relatives.

873
01:04:59,174 --> 01:05:02,076
<i>So please sit down and be quiet.</i>

874
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,941
Did you hear that?
Wasn't it great?

875
01:05:07,016 --> 01:05:09,484
<i>Marvelous.</i>

876
01:05:09,552 --> 01:05:12,146
- Where is he?
- Are you kidding with this guy?

877
01:05:13,956 --> 01:05:15,891
Rupe, I feel -

878
01:05:22,632 --> 01:05:24,691
I'm a strange one.

879
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:41,484
Would you mind shaking it up, Lelia?

880
01:05:42,487 --> 01:05:44,921
I've been waiting for exactly
two and a half hours.

881
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:49,518
Do you want to go out with a wreck,
or would you like me to look nice?

882
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:53,328
I want you to look good, but I want you
to shake it up. Do you mind?

883
01:05:53,398 --> 01:05:55,663
You want to go to the dance with me?

884
01:05:55,734 --> 01:05:59,671
<i>- I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to.
- Then you'll wait. I'm not finished yet.</i>

885
01:05:59,739 --> 01:06:01,674
Hey, hey, what's with you two?

886
01:06:01,742 --> 01:06:04,609
Lelia, do you have to
talk to him like that?

887
01:06:04,677 --> 01:06:07,613
I'll talk-What do you mean,
"Do I have to talk to him that way"?

888
01:06:07,681 --> 01:06:09,774
I wouldn't blame the fella
if he got up and left.

889
01:06:13,854 --> 01:06:16,322
I don't know.

890
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:18,382
Sure wouldn't let anybody
talk to me like that.

891
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:21,088
You didn't tell me you had
such a tough sister, man.

892
01:06:21,163 --> 01:06:24,654
- Does she carry on like that all the time?
- Look, I'm just happy to see her going out.

893
01:06:25,834 --> 01:06:28,360
I'm done.

894
01:06:28,436 --> 01:06:30,962
- How do I look?
- You look nice.

895
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,770
- You be a good boy. Be a good boy.
- Yeah, thank you.

896
01:06:33,843 --> 01:06:37,177
- I'll see you. Write to me.
- I'll write, and I'll send the money.

897
01:06:37,246 --> 01:06:40,579
<i>Come on, I'm finished.</i>

898
01:06:40,651 --> 01:06:42,584
Come on, let's go.

899
01:06:46,289 --> 01:06:48,225
My coat, sir.

900
01:07:16,755 --> 01:07:19,156
Hey.

901
01:07:19,225 --> 01:07:23,093
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to talk to Lelia.

902
01:07:23,163 --> 01:07:26,428
Well, you can't talk to Lelia.
I don't want you in here.

903
01:07:26,499 --> 01:07:28,990
- Never mind, don't even talk. Just get out.
- Let me tell you -

904
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:32,164
I don't want to hear anything
you've got to say. Will you go, please?

905
01:07:32,238 --> 01:07:35,072
<i>- I don't want to hear anything.
- Please listen to me for a minute.</i>

906
01:07:35,143 --> 01:07:38,738
I don't want to listen to you.
Get out of the place!

907
01:07:38,813 --> 01:07:40,804
- Hugh. Let me talk to him.
- Wait a minute.

908
01:07:40,881 --> 01:07:45,319
- Wait a minute. This is my problem.
- This is our problem, our problem.

909
01:07:45,386 --> 01:07:48,219
- Okay.
- So what do you want?

910
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:50,315
I just want you
to tell her that I'm sorry.

911
01:07:50,393 --> 01:07:53,988
- All right. He's sorry, he's sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

912
01:07:54,062 --> 01:07:57,055
- Will you tell her that?
- Yes, I will. Most definitely I will tell her.

913
01:07:57,132 --> 01:08:01,000
Will you tell her that I realize now...

914
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:04,302
- there's no difference between us.
- Anything else?

915
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:06,969
She'll always mean a great deal to me.

916
01:08:07,044 --> 01:08:10,275
- Anything else?
- Just tell her that...

917
01:08:10,347 --> 01:08:13,248
Tony said, "I'm sorry".

918
01:08:13,317 --> 01:08:16,343
There's no difference
between you and Lelia.

919
01:08:17,621 --> 01:08:19,988
She means a great deal to you.

920
01:08:21,326 --> 01:08:23,260
And you're sorry.

921
01:08:24,429 --> 01:08:25,987
<i>Thank you.</i>

922
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:56,955
You must like to fight or something, man.
You keep pushing people.

923
01:08:59,367 --> 01:09:01,800
- See you.
- Okay.

924
01:09:05,673 --> 01:09:07,335
What are you doing?

925
01:09:07,408 --> 01:09:09,343
Getting ready to go to Chicago, buddy.
How about you?

926
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:11,902
Wait a minute. I'll pack,
and I'll be right with you.

927
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:14,608
Okay. So you meet me
down at the station.

928
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,617
- All right.
- Twenty minutes.

929
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,054
Twenty minutes.

930
01:09:26,096 --> 01:09:29,657
- You're a very good dancer.
- Sure.

931
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:33,134
- You don't believe me?
- I believe you.

932
01:09:33,203 --> 01:09:35,433
It's just that I know
I'm a good dancer.

933
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,704
Oh, wow. What an ego.

934
01:09:39,878 --> 01:09:43,540
- Do you come here often?
- Yes.

935
01:09:43,615 --> 01:09:45,639
I like this place. It swings.

936
01:09:46,818 --> 01:09:49,149
Well, maybe you can
take me here next week.

937
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,189
But I didn't ask you.

938
01:09:51,255 --> 01:09:54,249
Well, if I want to go,
I'm sure you'll take me.

939
01:09:54,326 --> 01:09:58,593
Now, look, Lelia, where I come from,
the men do the asking.

940
01:09:58,663 --> 01:10:02,531
- The girls just go yes or no.
- Well.

941
01:10:02,602 --> 01:10:05,765
I guess I just don't fit into
that pattern, now, do I?

942
01:10:05,838 --> 01:10:10,674
No, you don't. As a matter of fact,
you're just a little too much for me.

943
01:10:10,744 --> 01:10:13,713
Well, then why don't you
take me home?

944
01:10:13,781 --> 01:10:16,271
- Why did you ask me in the first place?
- Now, steady, girl.

945
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:18,375
Do you always shout down
your boyfriends that way?

946
01:10:18,452 --> 01:10:23,322
- I never shout.
- Well, it would seem that way to me.

947
01:10:24,526 --> 01:10:28,292
Look, do you always go around
embarrassing people in front of strangers?

948
01:10:28,363 --> 01:10:30,297
I mean, laughing at them
in front of your family...

949
01:10:30,365 --> 01:10:33,698
keeping them waiting for hours
just to show off how masculine you are.

950
01:10:33,769 --> 01:10:35,702
Darling, I'm not masculine.

951
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:38,934
Well, it would seem that way to me.

952
01:10:39,008 --> 01:10:41,341
Well, how do you want me to behave?

953
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:45,744
Look, just dance.
And be as lovely as you look.

954
01:10:45,815 --> 01:10:51,310
Look, David, I am what I am,
and nobody tells me what to do.

955
01:10:51,388 --> 01:10:54,186
Look, I don't know who
you think you're fighting.

956
01:10:54,257 --> 01:10:56,418
You know, I saw the way
he looked at you back there.

957
01:10:56,493 --> 01:10:59,190
And I also saw the way
he looked at me.

958
01:11:27,427 --> 01:11:31,659
You know, despite
your horrible exterior...

959
01:11:32,765 --> 01:11:34,699
it's you I like.

960
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:06,129
- Hey!
- Come on.

961
01:12:06,202 --> 01:12:08,568
- So you finally made it.
- No sweat, man.

962
01:12:08,637 --> 01:12:11,267
- Hugh, I've got some bad news.
- The train move?

963
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,275
No.

964
01:12:13,342 --> 01:12:16,779
No, I checked with
our telephone service and...

965
01:12:16,847 --> 01:12:21,113
there's no point in us going to Cincinnati
because the job is closed out.

966
01:12:21,184 --> 01:12:23,550
- What about Chicago?
- It's still there.

967
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:26,146
- So what happened?
- Ackerman.

968
01:12:26,224 --> 01:12:28,852
Ackerman called Cincinnati
at his own expense...

969
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:32,158
and told them
you were being difficult.

970
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:34,926
- So?
- So that means no Cincinnati.

971
01:12:36,567 --> 01:12:40,664
That means we go to Chicago for
a week's billing and come back here...

972
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:44,698
and maybe some cheap, mangy
club owner will give us a job...

973
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:47,041
- introducing the girlie line.
- Wait a minute, will you?

974
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:50,310
<i>Or maybe you can sing
to a room full of drunks.</i>

975
01:12:50,382 --> 01:12:53,045
Look, we've been in this business
for a long time.

976
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:57,113
I'm supposed to be a manager.
You're supposed to be a singer. Right?

977
01:12:57,190 --> 01:13:01,923
Now who have I ever managed
besides you? And what have you ever done?

978
01:13:01,995 --> 01:13:04,430
<i>- Rupe, wait a minute.
- The bestjob I've been able to get you...</i>

979
01:13:04,497 --> 01:13:08,764
is in the Black Rose
in Tucson, Arizona.

980
01:13:08,835 --> 01:13:11,464
Rupe, wait a minute, baby. Wait.

981
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:15,374
No, no, I've had it
with this rat race. I've had it.

982
01:13:15,444 --> 01:13:17,502
I'm busted. I'm busted.

983
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:21,174
<i>I've been insulted by these pigs,
laughed at.</i>

984
01:13:21,248 --> 01:13:25,276
And what's in it for you or for me?
Look, if we've got to be failures...

985
01:13:25,354 --> 01:13:29,189
<i>let's do so in our own city
or get the hell out ofhere.</i>

986
01:13:29,258 --> 01:13:32,284
- Out of where, man?
- Here, the States.

987
01:13:32,362 --> 01:13:36,298
We'll go to Paris, France, Africa.
I don't care.

988
01:13:36,366 --> 01:13:38,834
It's going to be the same
no matter where we go.

989
01:13:38,901 --> 01:13:43,532
<i>- Look, I have had it.
- Rupert, wait a minute.</i>

990
01:13:43,607 --> 01:13:47,475
Do you believe in me?
Rupert, do you believe in me?

991
01:13:47,544 --> 01:13:49,478
<i>I don't mean what
those other people think of me.</i>

992
01:13:49,546 --> 01:13:54,211
I mean what we give each other.
You know, what comes out of both of us.

993
01:13:54,284 --> 01:13:56,617
Your talent, my voice.

994
01:13:56,689 --> 01:13:59,419
Man, when you're on time,
you're still not on time.

995
01:13:59,491 --> 01:14:02,791
<i>Rupe, do you believe this?
Because, Rupert...</i>

996
01:14:02,861 --> 01:14:06,297
I believe that you're
the greatest manager in the world.

997
01:14:06,365 --> 01:14:08,492
<i>And we're together.</i>

998
01:14:08,566 --> 01:14:10,831
Rupe, you're the greatest
manager in the world.

999
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:21,076
Come on, let's go.

1000
01:14:55,751 --> 01:14:57,549
<i>Next week, Eastland's.</i>

1001
01:14:57,619 --> 01:14:59,918
<i>Move, will you? Come on.</i>

1002
01:14:59,989 --> 01:15:02,048
Hey.

1003
01:15:02,126 --> 01:15:05,754
Hey.

1004
01:15:07,363 --> 01:15:11,129
- You're gonna get us killed.
- Almost hit me, the dirty-

1005
01:15:17,242 --> 01:15:19,175
You ready?
Make the announcement.

1006
01:15:19,244 --> 01:15:21,576
Girls, the Happiness Boys
singing "Up On The Moonbeam".

1007
01:15:21,645 --> 01:15:23,580
Girls, the Happiness Boys.

1008
01:15:39,799 --> 01:15:43,964
Hit it, boys.

1009
01:15:48,175 --> 01:15:50,507
Hey, man!

1010
01:15:50,577 --> 01:15:52,568
Hey, Bennie.

1011
01:15:53,881 --> 01:15:56,874
- Hey. What's going on here?
- Take it easy. Leave him alone.

1012
01:15:56,950 --> 01:16:00,080
Get out of here.
We're with these girls.

1013
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:02,282
<i>- So what's the story?
- What are you guys doing here?</i>

1014
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:05,657
We just came in here,
and we're clowning around.

1015
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,662
Go clown around somewhere else,
huh, buddy?

1016
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,891
- Take it easy. We're only kidding.
- We're with these girls.

1017
01:16:09,964 --> 01:16:12,159
Shut up, punk.

1018
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,225
- Wait a minute.
- What do you mean, "Take it easy"?

1019
01:16:14,302 --> 01:16:18,604
- I mean take it easy.
- Hands off, buddy.

1020
01:16:18,675 --> 01:16:21,303
Take your hands off me.

1021
01:16:21,377 --> 01:16:23,572
Let's see you imitate somebody now,
stool pigeon.

1022
01:16:23,647 --> 01:16:25,638
We're only kidding around, buddy.
All right, come on.

1023
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:27,649
Come on, man. Don't get excited.

1024
01:16:27,717 --> 01:16:29,845
Listen for a second.
What you want to fight for?

1025
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,286
Just get your hands off.
You want to tangle ass, let's go.

1026
01:16:32,356 --> 01:16:34,722
<i>- Let's go.
- Take it easy, brother.</i>

1027
01:16:39,263 --> 01:16:41,754
- You're gonna get yours, brother.
- Come on, mother. You for me.

1028
01:16:41,832 --> 01:16:44,824
- You're for me too, boy.
- You're just the guy I want.

1029
01:16:44,902 --> 01:16:47,701
- All right, let's go!
- Yeah? Come on!

1030
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:09,593
My eye, my eye!

1031
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:29,274
You -

1032
01:17:29,351 --> 01:17:31,912
I'll kill you!

1033
01:18:40,493 --> 01:18:43,930
- How about it, Jonathan? Tell him.
- Three beers.

1034
01:18:44,932 --> 01:18:49,927
- He wants to - He's all shook up.
- No more of this jazz for me, baby.

1035
01:18:50,005 --> 01:18:51,973
You can go home
for a week and cool it.

1036
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:55,703
So what are you gonna do?
We went out to have a ball, didn't we?

1037
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:58,268
- That's what we did.
- So you gotta pay the price, man.

1038
01:18:58,347 --> 01:19:01,180
If you get beat up, you get beat up.

1039
01:19:03,353 --> 01:19:05,413
I don't know why we do this, man.

1040
01:19:05,488 --> 01:19:09,219
- I mean, go around, try to pick up girls.
- Stupid broads.

1041
01:19:09,292 --> 01:19:14,025
You'd think we'd have girls of our own
like every normal type guy.

1042
01:19:14,098 --> 01:19:16,328
<i>So?</i>

1043
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:18,699
<i>So I'm not gonna do it anymore.</i>

1044
01:19:18,769 --> 01:19:22,137
Want me to be corny and say
this has taught me a lesson?

1045
01:19:22,206 --> 01:19:26,700
<i>- Well, it's taught me a lesson.
- Aw, just forget about it.</i>

1046
01:19:26,778 --> 01:19:28,712
Okay, forget about it.

1047
01:19:29,714 --> 01:19:32,045
Uh. Yeah, okay.
Forget about it.

1048
01:19:33,418 --> 01:19:37,321
- I'm gonna shove off. Okay, Bennie?
- Okay.

1049
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:40,188
- All right. I'll see you.
- So long.

1050
01:19:40,259 --> 01:19:43,751
I'll see you, Dennis.
Yeah, you too.

1051
01:19:45,064 --> 01:19:47,430
So long.

1052
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,867
I gotta get a pack of cigarettes.
