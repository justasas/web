00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:23,294
<i>Whoo! Yee-ha!</i>

2
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,155
<i>Pass it by! Come on, pass it by!</i>

3
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:38,858
- How you doin'?
- Good. Pass it by!

4
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,424
<i>Come on! Pass it by!</i>

5
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:45,598
<i>Hey, Bennie.</i>

6
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:49,372
Hey, Bennie. You got the loot?
The boys are waiting.

7
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:51,844
- I got the money. But you ain't coming with us.
- Aw, Bennie.

8
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:53,904
Hey, baby, I got the money.
I got the bread.

9
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:56,916
<i>Twenty bucks.</i>

10
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:59,214
- Hey, I got the 20. Wait a minute.
- Be careful!

11
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:02,085
Let go of my leg.
Let go of my leg.

12
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:04,852
Let go of my hand.
Let go of my arm, man.

13
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:07,759
- Let me see that bill.
- Forward!

14
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:20,873
- Twenty bucks apiece.
- Twenty bucks.

15
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:23,103
- That's shocking.
- No, I'm gonna get you one.

16
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:34,510
- Look what we've got here.
- Dennis, you're in.

17
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,252
- I haven't seen him around, have you?
- Who cares?

18
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,529
Hey.

19
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,532
Get a load of him.

20
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:52,129
- Hi.
- Hello.

21
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:54,902
Been here long?

22
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:58,810
- Two or three days. Where have you been?
- Two or three days?

23
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,871
How come I haven't
been around before this?

24
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:02,882
I don't know. Your problem.

25
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:06,119
What do you do?

26
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:09,622
Nothing very much.

27
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,716
Well, I'm not gonna ask you
the story of your life.

28
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,127
- You seem nice.
- I wish you would.

29
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:24,799
<i>Well, I'm making enough.
I got a nice cozy place.</i>

30
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,677
- Well, I haven't had any better offers.
- What's to drink?

31
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:34,909
- Want to finish your drink?
- A little bit.

32
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:40,977
Good boy. Big boy.

33
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:43,319
- Tonight -
- What's the matter?

34
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,791
Well, uh...

35
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,953
I think I'm caught in this booth.

36
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,223
Come and get comfortable.

37
00:04:57,038 --> 00:04:59,063
Oh, come on.

38
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:02,474
You come on.
What do you mean by "interesting"?

39
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:08,281
Huh?

40
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,341
What do you mean by
"come up to my apartment"?

41
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:18,888
That's a silly question
for a big girl like you.

42
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,894
What do you do?

43
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,963
I'm a musician.

44
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,468
Jazz musician.

45
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,729
I play trumpet.

46
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:37,070
You didn't bring
your instrument tonight, did you?

47
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,509
You guys are really something.

48
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:46,576
Well, what have you been
sitting here all night for?

49
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:51,591
Huh?

50
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,923
I thought you knew all the answers.

51
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:56,930
Well, you want to get
picked up, don't you?

52
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:59,990
Would you like that?
I'd like to take you.

53
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,399
- I'll bet you would.
- Have a great time.

54
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,803
What do you say?
All right? Please?

55
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:08,671
- Such a baby.
- What do you say?

56
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,871
I'm not kidding. I'm very serious.
Would you like it?

57
00:06:11,946 --> 00:06:13,538
- Huh?
- All right.

58
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:26,318
- What's your name?
- Nancy.

59
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:30,759
- What's yours?
- Ben.

60
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,868
Hi.

61
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,024
<i>#A real mad chick#</i>

62
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:10,094
<i>#Is like a lollipop#</i>

63
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:15,836
<i>#She'll keep you on the stick#</i>

64
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,709
#If you don't play it cool#

65
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:24,114
#She'll play you for a fool#

66
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:29,589
#A lollipop, a lollipop
will never make you sick#

67
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,852
#A real mad chick#

68
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,758
#Is like an ice cream cone#

69
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:39,931
<i>That's a lousy agreement.</i>

70
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,162
I've been a singer
in this business for 10 years...

71
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:44,796
and I've never introduced
a girlie line in my life.

72
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:47,136
Well, I can't change you. Hughie -

73
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,301
It's not a question of the money.

74
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:53,212
It's just that my client feels
that it's beneath his dignity...

75
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,942
to have to introduce
a bunch of floozies.

76
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,952
I've got a few guys ready
right now to take your place.

77
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,046
<i>- You aren't infallible, you know.
- #Is like a cherry pie#</i>

78
00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:07,153
<i>#You'll never find the pit#</i>

79
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:11,725
<i>- Okay. All right, cut it.
- #Whether shower or sleet#</i>

80
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,994
- Cut it! Cut it out.
- All right, all right.

81
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:16,002
Okay, okay.

82
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,402
- Okay, cut it. Cut it.
- #With every kiss#

83
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:21,566
- All right. All right.
- Okay, uh -

84
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:27,547
Now, there are 10 million people in
New York City. Half of them are girls.

85
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:30,914
<i>And any one of them can sing this song
better than you broads. Any one of them.</i>

86
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,783
<i>"A real mad chick," right?
#A real mad chick#</i>

87
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:37,050
And shake your bodies around!

88
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:40,093
Do something, will ya?
Now, let's try it once more.

89
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:43,824
<i>- All right, if you want me to do it.
- Once more, girls. "A real mad chick".</i>

90
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:48,062
But look, I'm going to feel like an awful
damn fool introducing those girlies.

91
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:50,069
You're an artist.

92
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:52,071
If you make up your mind
to do it, you can do it.

93
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:54,607
Look, I was an artist 10 years ago.

94
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:58,042
<i>Now, that's when I was an artist.</i>

95
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:00,103
How you doing?
You want to see me for a moment?

96
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,115
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

97
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:03,912
- Bennie -
- Wait a minute.

98
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:05,918
Let me see him for a moment, okay?

99
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:08,420
A moment, man. You know.

100
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:10,423
- What is it, Bennie?
- You got a minute?

101
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:12,425
Yeah, I got a minute.
Let me tell you something.

102
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,757
You know what these people
want to do to me?

103
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:17,764
It's bad enough working
in a third-rate nightclub...

104
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:21,859
packaged with the strippers and floozies
and playing second fiddle to them.

105
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,803
They want me
to introduce the girlie line.

106
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:26,863
Crazy.

107
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,275
- They can't even sing.
- Look, Hugh.

108
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:33,074
I need 20 bucks to pay a guy back
I borrowed from for a few beers.

109
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:36,639
- Are you ready for our deal now?
- We're still making up our mind about it.

110
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:38,947
- Where's your boy?
- He's over there talking to his brother.

111
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:41,146
I want to pay him back.
Have you got it?

112
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:44,714
Here's my offer now. You're gonna
play two nights. $35 a night. Yes or no?

113
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,454
We'll take it, Jack.
We've got no problems.

114
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:49,462
You've got to introduce the girls,
the whole line.

115
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,432
- We need the money, Hugh.
- You got it, 20 bucks for me?

116
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:55,435
What's it gonna be?

117
00:09:57,304 --> 00:10:01,502
- Look, we haven't decided anything.
- We've decided, and he'll be there.

118
00:10:01,575 --> 00:10:03,509
Look, man.
I'll see you later.

119
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:06,239
You're only a kid.
It's a lot of money for a kid.

120
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:09,646
Anything. Okay, excuse me.
Bennie.

121
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:11,651
Now, Mr. Ackerman.
There are no problems at all.

122
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,653
He's got a little trouble
with his kid brother.

123
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:16,281
And it's going to be taken care of
in just about another minute.

124
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:19,849
Now, as we agreed, we're going to be
there tonight in Philly right on time.

125
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:21,861
Bennie.

126
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:25,662
Look, Hugh.
We've gotta settle this thing.

127
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:27,977
What's the deal?

128
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,364
He wants to give us $35
a night and third billing.

129
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,372
And you introduce
the girlie line, Hughie.

130
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,068
We heard that part before.

131
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:40,603
- All right, what time do I leave?
- Just be in Philly in time for the show.

132
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,876
That's all I want from you.

133
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,353
<i>#You'll never find the pit#</i>

134
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:50,254
<i>Rupe, you're a very lucky boy.</i>

135
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:52,656
<i>If you knew how many people
wanted this job.</i>

136
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:55,058
<i>You guys are both very lucky boys.</i>

137
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:57,689
<i>Well, I wouldn't say that
exactly, Mr. Ackerman.</i>

138
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,668
#A real mad chick##

139
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:05,705
What's the matter?

140
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:09,037
What's the matter?
Come on, what's the matter?

141
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:12,203
- I forgot your toothbrush.
- Look, I'll buy one.

142
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,543
Hey, how about moving up there?

143
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,578
- How you gonna get home?
- I thought I'd take a nice little walk.

144
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:20,586
No, look,
I want you to take a cab.

145
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:23,316
Oh, please, Hugh.
Don't start that again.

146
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,984
I'm 20 years old,
and I've lived in this city all my life.

147
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,551
- I think I can manage.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

148
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:31,223
Look. You don't know everything,
and you're a baby.

149
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:33,766
I mean, all you have to do
is read the papers.

150
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:37,395
A girl can't walk safely
down the streets at night in any city...

151
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:41,066
without being hollered at and
called names and pinched and abused.

152
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:45,077
I don't want my baby sister being hurt
for a few pennies. Now, you take a cab.

153
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:47,670
Nothing ever happens to me
when I walk home.

154
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,773
Round trip to Philadelphia, please.

155
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:57,924
Look, nothing's gonna happen to me,
nothing ever does.

156
00:11:57,992 --> 00:12:01,985
I love you.
Now, take care of yourself. Okay?

157
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:04,462
And do a good show.
And come on, let's go.

158
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:07,193
- And look-
- The suitcase.

159
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,863
- You're gonna be late.
- Look, take a cab, please. All right?

160
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,872
Get out of here.

161
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:16,075
You're gonna miss it!

162
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:28,285
- Where you been? You're never on time.
- Look, we'll make it.

163
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:30,289
Come on.

164
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:40,055
- No, we're gonna make it. Come on.
- Man, it's too late.

165
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,261
Look, he's stopping.
Come on, man, run.

166
00:12:42,336 --> 00:12:44,634
After you.

167
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:14,221
Hey, Sam.
Thanks for letting us use this pad, man.

168
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:17,229
- How'd you like that date?
- Yeah, man, but everybody's gotta live.

169
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:19,595
Sure, sure. Fourth billing
and introduce the girlie act.

170
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,533
- Now, that really burns me.
- Forget it, will you?

171
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:26,767
What am I introducing a bunch of
dumb broads for? What's to introduce?

172
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,604
So they're dumb broads.
So they gotta live too.

173
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:31,268
That's the way I feel also.

174
00:14:31,345 --> 00:14:34,109
That beats baked beans
with baked beans, buddy.

175
00:14:35,115 --> 00:14:39,484
Sam. All right, I'm a singer.
And I sing a song.

176
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:43,489
Now, what am I gonna say about a bunch
of dumb broads with white ribbons...

177
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:45,855
going around singing "A Pretty Girl"?
Does that make sense?

178
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,722
Well, you just can't say that exactly.

179
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:52,493
I don't know, say a few nice words
about the audience...

180
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:54,500
like, uh, I don't know.

181
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:57,196
Just smile, be yourself, you know?

182
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,398
I'm a singer.
Nobody seems to get that.

183
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:01,532
And singers sing.
I mean, that's it. That's all, man.

184
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:04,634
Well, man. You can always
tell a couple of jokes.

185
00:15:04,711 --> 00:15:07,271
Everybody likes jokes.
That makes people feel good.

186
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:08,939
Sam, what time is it?

187
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:12,508
You make them feel relaxed, at easy.
Like Steve Allen, you know.

188
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:14,577
Jokes? What jokes?
I don't know any jokes.

189
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:17,988
- Look, I don't even know my own name.
- Now, come on, baby. Let's go.

190
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:20,720
<i>- Now, hold on a minute.
- To hell with jokes. You tell a joke.</i>

191
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,058
Look, dummy,
don't let yourself go.

192
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,257
<i>Tell us somejokes, man.</i>

193
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,598
Yeah, yeah, okay.

194
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,660
How's that one
about the witch doctor?

195
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:33,103
Are you kidding?
They'd close the joint.

196
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:35,107
I was just thinking out loud.

197
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:38,872
I'll tell you one a little bit,
little bit more refined.

198
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:41,972
Uh, you like that one about
the rabbit in the tree?

199
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:43,710
I don't know that one.

200
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:46,776
That one about the rabbit that
fell on out of the tree and says...

201
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:50,290
"Man, that lovemaking's for the birds".

202
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:53,087
- That's great. That's cute.
- Don't you like it?

203
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,596
- Oh, man, come on.
- Wait a minute, man. What do you mean?

204
00:15:56,663 --> 00:16:00,429
Look, man. Hold it.
That's cute. That's funny.

205
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,435
- Everybody likes jokes.
- That's right.

206
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,835
Man, you won't offend anybody.
You know, with dates?

207
00:16:04,905 --> 00:16:08,136
- Do you really think that's funny?
- Yeah, come on. Give it a try, will ya?

208
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,041
- I do, man.
- I don't know. - Come on.

209
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:14,877
- Look, I can't.
- Try it, Hugh, once, will ya?

210
00:16:16,283 --> 00:16:18,945
- Okay, okay.
- There you go.

211
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,614
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
did you ever hear-

212
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:24,714
This is stupid, man.
I can't do this.

213
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,659
Try it, man. What's to lose with us?
Are we gonna kill you?

214
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:31,323
Look, if you're so smart,
you do it yourself.

215
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,934
Okay, I will.

216
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:37,163
It's easy though, you know.

217
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:39,296
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

218
00:16:40,807 --> 00:16:44,743
On my way over here this evening
a very funny thing happened to me.

219
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,377
Got it? I was walking down the street
looking up at this great big tree.

220
00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:55,387
- And way up there on -
- Man. Say it out fast. Catch 'em off guard.

221
00:16:55,455 --> 00:16:59,687
- No, you got to set 'em up, man.
- Set 'em up? You'll rock 'em to sleep.

222
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,456
- Man, who are you, Steve Allen?
- All I'm saying -

223
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:05,020
Wait. I got it. I got it. I got it.

224
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,234
I say, uh...

225
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:12,298
"Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

226
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:15,068
Well, you certainly look like
a refined audience we got here tonight...

227
00:17:15,142 --> 00:17:17,076
and I have a couple
of refined jokes to tell".

228
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:19,476
- See? I play up the class.
- There you go.

229
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:26,810
Beautiful couple here,
ladies and gentlemen.

230
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:30,880
There's a couple celebrating
their third drink since 7:15.

231
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,294
Hey, that's pretty good, man!

232
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,928
You're beautiful.
You two married?

233
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:43,159
What are you asking if they're married for?
They're with a fella.

234
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:45,170
He's the lookout.

235
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:48,437
Here's the Andrew Sisters,
ladies and gentlemen...

236
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:52,137
Patty, Maxene and LaVerne.

237
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:54,942
- Are you two girls married?
- I just asked that.

238
00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:58,109
Well, it got a laugh over there.
I figured it would get a laugh here.

239
00:18:11,665 --> 00:18:15,294
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want you to meet a singer-

240
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:17,564
We've got a singer right now
named Hughie Hurd.

241
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,471
<i>He's a great singer. I want you all
to, like, take care ofhim.</i>

242
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,940
Give him a lot of applause, please,
because he's new in town.

243
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,284
#Hello, baby#

244
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:38,848
#I had to call you on the phone#

245
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,256
#I said, hello, baby#

246
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:49,600
#I had to call you on the phone#

247
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,498
<i>#'Cause your daddy is so lonesome#</i>

248
00:18:57,911 --> 00:19:01,347
<i>#And daddy wants his baby home#</i>

249
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,481
Man, he's putting them all to sleep.

250
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:10,683
#If you read my letter, baby##

251
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:13,726
- Kill him, man. Get him off.
- What?

252
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,895
What is this "bring the girls on"?
What kind of a place you running here?

253
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:24,029
Bring the girls on.
Bring them on out.

254
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:26,504
Call the girls, man.
Introduce the girls.

255
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:30,705
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- Bring on the girls, will ya?

256
00:19:30,777 --> 00:19:34,645
#A real mad chick#

257
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:39,147
<i>#Is like a lollipop#</i>

258
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:45,353
#She'll keep you on the stick#

259
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,296
#If you don't play it cool#

260
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:53,355
#She'll play you for a fool##

261
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:20,420
Well, is everybody going
to sit around here all day?

262
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:24,855
Dennis, stop that, will ya?
It makes me sick.

263
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:28,731
- What's the matter with you, Tom?
- I got a hangover. That's what's the matter.

264
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:31,066
That's what you get
for staying out all night.

265
00:20:31,138 --> 00:20:33,299
Who takes care of your sister
when you stay out all night?

266
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:36,774
Man, I hire a babysitter. Don't I hire
a babysitter for you, sweetheart?

267
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:39,471
David's writing a new novel
all about you, Ben.

268
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:44,142
Better not be any of that
beat generation jazz like the last one.

269
00:20:45,152 --> 00:20:47,279
Stop it, Dennis. It makes me sick.

270
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:50,255
Right in my coffee, Tom.

271
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:52,086
Yeah, take some Dramamine.
It helps sometimes.

272
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,118
- Dramamine? What's Dramamine?
- It's airsick medicine.

273
00:20:56,196 --> 00:20:58,858
I'm not airsick. I'm ground sick.

274
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:01,560
But I'll take anything
if it'll help me with the way I feel.

275
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,229
Dennis, will you do me a favor
and get me some of that stuff?

276
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,966
- What is it?
- Will you get me some Dramamine, please?

277
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,600
Do me a favor, huh?
Dennis, I appreciate that very much.

278
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:12,304
Oh, Tom! Will you cut it out?
For crying out loud.

279
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:19,685
You guys.

280
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:23,814
You never break your pattern.
You'll never go anywhere with your lives.

281
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,257
- Tom, take this. Drink up.
- How many do I take?

282
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,261
Take just this one.

283
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:35,266
<i>Why don't you do something,
learn something?</i>

284
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,701
There are thousands of things to do
in New York City.

285
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:42,003
<i>- Like what?
- Why don't you do something different?</i>

286
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:44,009
<i>Do you want to meet new people?</i>

287
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:46,136
You wanna come to a literary
party I'm having tonight?

288
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:49,376
Don't invite them, David.
They won't even wear ties.

289
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:52,282
- Lelia's coming.
- What the hell is a literary party?

290
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:57,221
<i>Just where people interested
in books and other literary efforts...</i>

291
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,224
get together and discuss things.

292
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:01,419
Well, if they're coming,
I'm not going to be there...

293
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:04,861
because they're gonna just act awful,
and I'll be so embarrassed.

294
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:07,297
<i>- Oh, it's all right.
- Oh, a tie. You kidding?</i>

295
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,631
<i>You can comejust as you are.
Do you want to come?</i>

296
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,831
<i>- Yeah, I'll read a poem.
- Don't get excited, honey.</i>

297
00:22:12,906 --> 00:22:16,307
Who wants to make
that fink party anyway?

298
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:21,006
<i>All right, something else.
A concert or a museum?</i>

299
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:25,177
A museum, I'm for it.
Ben, Tom?

300
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:28,153
I don't think you've ever even been
in a museum, any of you.

301
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,816
I? I've never been in a museum?

302
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,487
<i>We've been in plenty of museums.
I bet you can't even spell it.</i>

303
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,395
- Oh, will you stop teasing me?
- Here, Tom. Pick it up.

304
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:40,729
Lelia has a very bright mind, Bennie.

305
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,701
- She's developing very rapidly.
- Bull.

306
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,934
I don't want to sit around here and
be insulted by these creeps. Let's go.

307
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:50,841
Lelia, you should eat something
besides black coffee.

308
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:55,507
David, please.
Don't start lecturing me now.

309
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:03,621
Well?

310
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,022
- Come on, David. Let's go.
- Never mind. We're going.

311
00:23:06,092 --> 00:23:09,289
What will it be, Dennis,
the Margarine or the Metropolitan?

312
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:12,024
Let's go to the Metropolitan.
They got mummies there and everything.

313
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:14,032
- What do you say?
- You guys kidding?

314
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,228
<i>- No, man. Let's cut.
- Let's go.</i>

315
00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:19,898
- Let's go. Come on, Ben.
- Hey, Bennie.

316
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:22,373
Come on, Ben. Let's go.

317
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,911
Hey, Bennie, Dennis.

318
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,285
I don't know what you wanted
to come here for, Dennis.

319
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:46,560
This joint is nothing but a place
for a bunch of sexless women...

320
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,567
who don't have
any love in their life.

321
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,796
A lot of big deal professors.

322
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,031
A lot of creeps trying to show
off how much they know.

323
00:23:53,106 --> 00:23:56,439
- You couldn't be wronger.
- I suppose professors don't come here?

324
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:59,273
Well, I didn't say that.

325
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:01,507
All right, Dennis. Look at that.

326
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:04,072
I suppose you can tell me
what he's about, huh, genius?

327
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,880
- He's a statue.
- I know he's a statue, Dennis.

328
00:24:06,953 --> 00:24:09,251
What kind of a statue?
I know he's a statue.

329
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,587
- Well, Tom, I don't know everything.
- You know something, Dennis?

330
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,150
- You don't know nothing.
- Oh, yeah? What do you know?

331
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:17,219
- A lot more than you do, pal.
- Yeah?

332
00:24:17,297 --> 00:24:19,265
What you come here for
if you know so much?

333
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,994
You have no respect for art,
no respect at all.

334
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,404
You listen to me, Dennis.

335
00:24:25,472 --> 00:24:29,465
You're nothing but an ignorant slob,
Dennis, a little ignorant slob.

336
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:31,567
<i>- I went to college, Dennis.
- You?</i>

337
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:34,442
<i>All I ever got out of it
was dissipation...</i>

338
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,540
<i>and a lot of early bells
disturbing my sleep.</i>

339
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:39,551
<i>A lot of supercilious professors...</i>

340
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:42,747
slob professors shooting off
their mouth about something...

341
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:46,519
trying to teach me something they'd
already failed at in life themselves.

342
00:24:46,593 --> 00:24:49,084
So don't tell me
I don't appreciate anything.

343
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:06,007
Tom, do you know what
I'm going to do with that?

344
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,673
I'm gonna put it on a Christmas card.
Just a mask on a card.

345
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:11,649
- Won't that be wild?
- Don't send one to me, pal.

346
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,380
Look, Tom, will you cool it?
You know what you're talking about?

347
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:16,581
I suppose you really understand
that thing, huh, Bennie?

348
00:25:16,656 --> 00:25:20,230
It's not a question of understanding it.
If you feel it, you feel it, stupid.

349
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:21,423
That's what I been trying to tell you.

350
00:25:21,494 --> 00:25:24,088
- Aw, shut up, Dennis.
- Aw, shut up, yourself.

351
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:26,997
- Say you're sorry.
- All right, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

352
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,001
Hey, look at that one, now.
Look at that one, man.

353
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,003
- You're really sorry?
- Yeah, I'm really sorry.

354
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,403
- Okay. I apologize.
- Take it easy, guys, will you?

355
00:25:33,473 --> 00:25:35,407
Hey, look at this.
Now, look.

356
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,908
<i>Now, look at this cat.</i>

357
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:41,446
He really had a sense of humor
when he made this.

358
00:25:41,514 --> 00:25:43,573
That isn't supposed
to be humorous, Tom.

359
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,881
What are we supposed to do,
get serious with a can like that?

360
00:25:46,953 --> 00:25:50,719
- I'm telling you right now, Tom.
- Don't get excited, Dennis.

361
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,849
I'm not going to hurt it.
It's made of iron.

362
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,860
A chick like that may destroy me.

363
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,226
What's the matter with Tom?
Is he crazy or something?

364
00:25:57,397 --> 00:25:58,451
No, Dennis.

365
00:25:58,552 --> 00:26:00,460
Someday you may marry a girl
that looks like that.

366
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:01,888
Oh, God forbid.

367
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:04,299
- It's not funny, Dennis.
- It's not funny.

368
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:10,908
This joint gives me the creeps, Bennie.
Let's go, come on.

369
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:13,878
- Where are you going?
- Let's get out of here.

370
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,938
Okay.

371
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,688
Lelia.

372
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,057
I'm not trying
to hurt your feelings.

373
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,587
But if you're going to write a story,
you have to do it professionally.

374
00:26:32,665 --> 00:26:35,156
David, I don't want to be a writer.

375
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:38,227
I didn't want to do this.
You convinced me to do it.

376
00:26:38,304 --> 00:26:41,432
And now all you can do is criticize.

377
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:44,500
I just want you to be honest.

378
00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:49,947
Look, your story has some pretty good
things. But it's very hard to be honest.

379
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:51,677
I don't understand your viewpoint.

380
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:55,778
Jean-Paul Sartre has absolutely nothing
to do with existential psychoanalysis.

381
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:57,584
- Would you like a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

382
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,921
Well, it's all a bit vague.
Don't you think so, Joan?

383
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,120
I do not. The trouble with you is...

384
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:05,323
you suffer from self-induced hysteria
at the word existentialism.

385
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:07,389
- Are you aware of that?
- Can I fix you a drink?

386
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:09,401
<i>- No, thank you.
- I assure you, I don't.</i>

387
00:27:09,469 --> 00:27:12,302
<i>I know the article to which you refer.
I've read it three times.</i>

388
00:27:12,372 --> 00:27:15,034
<i>I couldn't even find
the basic precepts.</i>

389
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:18,077
<i>- Which article was that?
- If you can explain it, I'd be delighted.</i>

390
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,375
Well, it's perfectly obvious.
Man, in contrast to other animals...

391
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:23,381
is conscious of his own existence.

392
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:26,612
Therefore, conscious of
the possibility of non-existence.

393
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,154
<i>Ergo, he has anxiety, right?</i>

394
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:31,156
Right, absolutely.
I couldn't agree with you more.

395
00:27:31,224 --> 00:27:34,216
Well, it figures.

396
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,032
Now this girl here...

397
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:44,467
she has no control over herself.

398
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:47,905
She's been deeply hurt.

399
00:27:47,974 --> 00:27:49,908
And yet she goes on
as if nothing happened...

400
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:51,910
living her life the same as before.

401
00:27:51,978 --> 00:27:55,539
It just doesn't make any sense.
Life takes more than imagination.

402
00:27:55,615 --> 00:28:00,552
Well, the point is that
if you're yourself, you won't get hurt.

403
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,523
- Are you a writer too?
- Oh, no. Do I look like a writer?

404
00:28:05,592 --> 00:28:08,561
Well, I can't tell anymore.

405
00:28:08,628 --> 00:28:12,655
<i>- I'm a dancer really.
- Oh, a dancer. Why, that's great.</i>

406
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,860
- Are you a ballet dancer?
- Oh, no, exotic.

407
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:20,702
<i>- Exotic?
- Oh, you don't know what that is, do you?</i>

408
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:25,574
- Not exactly.
- It's, uh, sort of modern...

409
00:28:25,645 --> 00:28:27,579
only more exotic.

410
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:29,581
That sounds terrific.

411
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:32,311
Listen, would you mind if I came
to see you perform sometime?

412
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:34,751
<i>Oh, no. The very next time,
I'll invite you.</i>

413
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:36,755
Great. When will that be?

414
00:28:36,823 --> 00:28:39,223
Oh, I'm not dancing right now.

415
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:41,954
Oh, no? Why not?

416
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:44,588
I'm going to have a baby in March.

417
00:28:46,032 --> 00:28:47,966
You're -

418
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:49,968
That's great.
You're going to have a baby.

419
00:28:50,036 --> 00:28:54,234
A baby. That sounds terrific.
Congratulations. That's great news.

420
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:56,969
<i>- We think so, don't we, honey?
- Huh?</i>

421
00:28:57,043 --> 00:29:00,103
Yeah, well, that's swell.
Congratulations.

422
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,841
<i>- Thank you.
- Listen, if it's okay...</i>

423
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:06,112
I'll just excuse myself
and fix my drink a little bit.

424
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:24,834
<i>You don't know what it is to be hurt.
You can't always see it coming.</i>

425
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:28,465
Sometimes a person could ruin your life.

426
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:32,375
And yet, all he'd be able
to honestly say is "I'm sorry".

427
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:35,175
Hi, David.
Am I interrupting something?

428
00:29:35,248 --> 00:29:38,945
Tony. Lelia Carruthers, Tony Russell.

429
00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:40,610
- Hello.
- Hello.

430
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:42,780
I was just trying
to convince Lelia that...

431
00:29:42,855 --> 00:29:45,517
writers today have got to be
realistic in their approach.

432
00:29:45,591 --> 00:29:48,788
What he's trying to say is,
he hates my writing.

433
00:29:48,861 --> 00:29:51,386
You be the judge, Tony.
You be the judge.

434
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:53,728
On her first day in New York this year...

435
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,462
Lelia's writing about
a walk down Fifth Avenue.

436
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,964
<i>She sees a stranger standing
in the sunlight on a street corner...</i>

437
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,942
<i>and she walks up and kisses him,
this perfect stranger.</i>

438
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,673
<i>It's revolting on a Sunday afternoon.</i>

439
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:11,843
It is not.
If I wanted to, I would.

440
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,694
Was that so bold?

441
00:30:24,764 --> 00:30:27,358
I guess I have to
change sides, David.

442
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:30,425
David, would you go and get me
some more champagne?

443
00:30:30,503 --> 00:30:32,994
It's even more revolting in real life.

444
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,808
Some more champagne.

445
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,005
I think you've had plenty.

446
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:49,218
- What did you say your name was?
- Lelia.

447
00:30:50,356 --> 00:30:52,847
It's a lovely party, isn't it?

448
00:30:52,925 --> 00:30:55,519
Do you know you're staring at me?

449
00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:00,260
- I'm hypnotizing you.
- Thank you.

450
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:02,358
Who do you belong to, Lelia?

451
00:31:03,503 --> 00:31:05,437
Why, I belong to me.

452
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:07,769
What about David?

453
00:31:10,843 --> 00:31:14,779
- No more champagne, Lelia.
- David, I was just about to see Lelia home.

454
00:31:14,847 --> 00:31:17,281
What do you mean?
I'm taking Lelia home.

455
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,547
Well, uh, you're both wrong...

456
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,918
because neither one of you
are taking me home.

457
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:25,924
I'm meeting Vickie and
she's spending the night at my house.

458
00:31:25,992 --> 00:31:30,622
Oh. I guess my hypnotic spell is
a little rusty. What about tomorrow?

459
00:31:30,696 --> 00:31:33,631
Tomorrow, Lelia and I
are going to the park.

460
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:36,259
<i>- Oh, well, good, good. I'll come along.
- No.</i>

461
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:39,600
- Oh.
- David, don't be so unfriendly.

462
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,753
Don't be such an old man, David.

463
00:31:57,824 --> 00:31:59,758
- Hi, Moe.
- Moe-Moe.

464
00:31:59,826 --> 00:32:03,193
Hey, baby.
Give me one of those.

465
00:32:04,197 --> 00:32:06,131
- Hello, stranger. There's a stranger.
- Hi, Moe.

466
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:08,133
- Hello, Moe.
- How have you been?

467
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:10,829
- Lelia, come here.
- You sure look like you've got a hangover.

468
00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:13,371
I've gotta go.

469
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:15,669
- What's the story here?
- I'll talk to you later about it.

470
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:17,641
I thought you and Lelia were making
the scene. Dave, wait a minute!

471
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,372
- I can't. I can't.
- Oh, wow.

472
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,861
I'm really not very happy.

473
00:33:16,936 --> 00:33:20,337
I mean, I'm happy, but I'm not
as happy as everybody thinks I am.

474
00:33:20,406 --> 00:33:22,340
- Why not?
- Oh...

475
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:25,536
because I feel that I should be
farther ahead than I am.

476
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:29,172
And everything
is passing me by, and -

477
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:31,182
- How old are you?
- Twenty.

478
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:36,085
- I'd never guess.
- Oh, stop. Don't laugh. I'm serious.

479
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:39,488
I have the feeling that
I'll never, you know, be smart...

480
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,187
and I'm never going
to get the things that I want.

481
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:46,062
And, uh - Oh -

482
00:33:46,132 --> 00:33:48,100
What do you feel like?
Tell me what you feel like.

483
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:51,159
- I feel like I'm in a -
- In a cocoon and you can't get out?

484
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,171
That's right.
How did you know?

485
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,901
I didn't think boys were supposed to
understand things like that.

486
00:33:55,975 --> 00:33:59,809
- You see, I am far behind.
- Behind who?

487
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:03,781
- Now you sound like David.
- I hope not.

488
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:07,512
Why not? David's one of the most
intelligent people I've met in my life.

489
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,521
But not very romantic.

490
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,922
No, he's not very romantic.

491
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,897
You know, I'm not a very nice person.

492
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:20,933
I mean,
I have very romantic inclinations.

493
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,468
Be forewarned that I'm not one
of these storybook characters...

494
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:25,902
that's supposed to be
all noble and righteous.

495
00:34:25,972 --> 00:34:28,532
When I see someone I like...

496
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,408
and if she likes me,
we accept my romantic inclinations.

497
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,379
Do you happen to know
where we are right now?

498
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,578
No.

499
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:45,249
That's where I live,
right there, number seven.

500
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,856
Come on up for a drink.

501
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:54,222
You know you're beautiful?

502
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,098
Don't you move.

503
00:35:36,742 --> 00:35:38,676
Don't move.

504
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,539
You've got the softest lips
I've ever felt.

505
00:36:24,457 --> 00:36:26,391
Tony.

506
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,327
I love you, Lelia.

507
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:33,854
I don't want anything to drink.

508
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:38,469
All right, baby.

509
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,437
I love you, Lelia.

510
00:36:46,612 --> 00:36:48,546
Love you, Lelia.

511
00:36:49,548 --> 00:36:52,073
Baby, I love you.

512
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:55,887
So much.

513
00:37:18,043 --> 00:37:20,341
Lelia.

514
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:22,607
Really, if I'd known
this was the first time for you...

515
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:24,672
I wouldn't have touched you.

516
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,276
I didn't know it could be so awful.

517
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,423
Don't be so upset, sweetheart.

518
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:35,720
Baby.

519
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,322
It'll be much easier next time.

520
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,829
There isn't going to be a next time.

521
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:52,466
Want a cigarette? Huh?

522
00:37:52,545 --> 00:37:55,537
- Come on, have a cigarette.
- No.

523
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:02,912
<i>I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
I guess I did.</i>

524
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,150
I was so frightened.

525
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:16,498
I kept saying to myself,
"You mustn't cry.

526
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:19,402
If you love a man,
you shouldn't be so frightened".

527
00:38:20,906 --> 00:38:22,897
It's only natural.

528
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:26,775
There isn't a girl in the world
that wouldn't feel the same way.

529
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,837
She's got to.

530
00:38:30,649 --> 00:38:33,482
- What happens now?
- What happens?

531
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,383
Uh, what do you mean,
"What happens now"?

532
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,988
- I mean, do I stay with you?
- Stay with me?

533
00:38:44,063 --> 00:38:47,555
Uh, stay with me?
Do you mean live with me?

534
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,860
Yes.

535
00:38:55,574 --> 00:38:57,701
Do you want to?

536
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:03,774
No.

537
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:05,817
I want to go home.

538
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:10,114
Okay, baby.

539
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:20,020
I thought being with you
would be so important...

540
00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:23,966
mean so much...

541
00:39:26,138 --> 00:39:30,131
that afterwards two people would be
as close as it's possible to get.

542
00:39:33,445 --> 00:39:35,379
But instead...

543
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:42,278
<i>- we're just two strangers.
- Lelia.</i>

544
00:39:42,354 --> 00:39:45,915
- Lelia.
- It's over.

545
00:39:48,027 --> 00:39:49,961
I know that much about life.

546
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,589
Lelia, you can come stay with me.

547
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:57,602
I want you to.

548
00:39:58,704 --> 00:40:01,138
But when I say
that you're close to me...

549
00:40:01,206 --> 00:40:04,073
that's all I can say,
because that's the way I am.

550
00:40:05,077 --> 00:40:09,741
But that does not mean that I don't feel
the same things that you feel.

551
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:12,613
Tony, please, please don't.

552
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:17,248
- Lelia, I love you.
- Please don't touch me.

553
00:40:18,257 --> 00:40:21,226
Please don't touch me.
I want to go home.

554
00:40:25,264 --> 00:40:28,097
- I want to get dressed now.
- Okay, sweetheart. Okay.

555
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:31,000
- Please leave me alone.
- Okay, sweetheart, I'll take you home.

556
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,301
Okay, sweetheart.
Sweetheart, it's okay.

557
00:40:34,373 --> 00:40:36,307
- I'm with you.
- I want to go home.

558
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,366
I'll take you home.
I'll take you home.

559
00:40:44,149 --> 00:40:46,617
Seventy-five, buddy.

560
00:40:46,685 --> 00:40:51,179
Look, uh, why don't you just take
the taxi wherever you're gonna go?

561
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:53,417
Because I'm coming upstairs with you.

562
00:40:54,793 --> 00:40:57,284
Look, folks. Come on,
it's my busy time. Let's go.

563
00:40:57,363 --> 00:40:59,854
Yeah, yeah.
Just a second, huh?

564
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,294
Look, why don't we
just end it right here?

565
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,702
Make up your minds.

566
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,040
Because you don't want it that way,
and because I don't want it that way.

567
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:14,978
You go with her,
or end it and you stay.

568
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:17,607
But, uh, come on,
make up your mind.

569
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,174
- How much - How much on the clock?
- Seventy-five.

570
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,053
I'm coming upstairs with you, Lelia,
whether you like it or not.

571
00:41:24,123 --> 00:41:28,184
- Please, don't make any scenes.
- I'll make the biggest scene you ever saw.

572
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,592
You're that important to me.

573
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:36,100
All right, all right. You can come up,
but just for a minute.

574
00:41:36,168 --> 00:41:39,035
Okay, fine.

575
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,675
Ain't love grand?

576
00:41:43,742 --> 00:41:46,210
Why don't you
mind your own business.

577
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,981
Keep it. Keep it.

578
00:41:55,587 --> 00:42:00,889
#I love you truly, truly, dear##

579
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,592
<i>- What's wild?
- Deuces wild.</i>

580
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:09,600
<i>- It's up to you, Dennis.
- Any kind of deuce?</i>

581
00:42:09,668 --> 00:42:12,603
<i>Any kind of deuce. It's up to you,
Dennis. You open or what?</i>

582
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:15,231
I open for 50.
Give me two cards, Ben.

583
00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:17,275
Wait a minute.
Want me to call you, do you?

584
00:42:18,644 --> 00:42:20,839
Tell you what
I'm gonna do, Dennis.

585
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:24,275
You need the money,
so I'm gonna let you have it.

586
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:27,546
I'm gonna let you have this hand
and bury my cards.

587
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:29,553
<i>I don't wanna play anymore.
Let's call some girls.</i>

588
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:31,816
<i>- Come on, let's call a couple of chicks.
- Why not?</i>

589
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,051
<i>- Get on the phone, Bennie.
- Come on, Ben.</i>

590
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:36,424
Who do you know, Ben?
You should know a lot of chicks.

591
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:39,123
You said you had something.
You've been bragging all day about it.

592
00:42:39,198 --> 00:42:41,462
Ben, call Barbara.
Barbara Kennedy.

593
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:46,601
Twelve twenty-one, please.

594
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,633
Room 1221.
Uh, Anita.

595
00:42:52,644 --> 00:42:56,546
I don't know her last name, just Anita.
Yeah, room 1221.

596
00:42:58,817 --> 00:43:00,808
Yeah, hello, baby.

597
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,117
This is Clark.
I'm all through flying.

598
00:43:08,193 --> 00:43:11,720
Anita? Yeah, Tom.

599
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,492
<i>How about a couple of drinks?</i>

600
00:43:13,565 --> 00:43:17,194
Can you get that redhead
that works in the hat check room?

601
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:19,794
No, there's three of us.
I got two buddies.

602
00:43:19,872 --> 00:43:22,363
Yeah, Bennie and Dennis.

603
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,778
We're feeling mighty low.
Can you get another girl?

604
00:43:26,845 --> 00:43:30,679
All right, I'll meet you in about
20 minutes? Yeah, see you.

605
00:43:30,749 --> 00:43:33,650
- Tell you, man?
- Come on, let's go.

606
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:36,381
Didn't I tell you the chicks would go?
You didn't believe me.

607
00:43:36,455 --> 00:43:38,582
<i>Let's go!
Come on, let's go.</i>

608
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:42,449
<i>Come on, Bennie.</i>

609
00:43:56,975 --> 00:44:02,174
#You are just a dream#

610
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:07,310
<i>#And someday you'll disappear#</i>

611
00:44:08,453 --> 00:44:13,891
<i>#Kiss me and make
this moment divine#</i>

612
00:44:13,959 --> 00:44:16,484
<i>#Beautiful#</i>

613
00:44:16,562 --> 00:44:22,432
<i>#Tell me you will always be mine#</i>

614
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:24,765
<i>#Beautiful#</i>

615
00:44:24,836 --> 00:44:30,604
<i>#Forever is a long, long time#</i>

616
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:36,411
<i>#Spend it with your lips on mine#</i>

617
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:40,645
<i>#Beautiful#</i>

618
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:45,656
<i>#My beautiful you#</i>

619
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:50,388
<i>#My beautiful you##</i>

620
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,428
<i>Okay, let's break it up.</i>

621
00:44:58,503 --> 00:45:01,199
That's more like it.
How you been?

622
00:45:01,273 --> 00:45:04,242
I'm fine. Uh, Tony Russell,
this is my brother, Hugh.

623
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:07,540
<i>- Hi.
- And this is Rupert Crosse.</i>

624
00:45:07,613 --> 00:45:10,275
Glad to know you.

625
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:12,283
How are you?

626
00:45:12,351 --> 00:45:16,549
Well, how did the thing go?
I mean, big crowds?

627
00:45:17,689 --> 00:45:20,658
<i>Fine. The only one bad spot
in the whole thing was...</i>

628
00:45:20,726 --> 00:45:24,218
<i>this character here decides to--
he's gonna rewrite everything.</i>

629
00:45:24,296 --> 00:45:26,287
<i>You ever hearJelly Roll
sung like an opera?</i>

630
00:45:26,365 --> 00:45:30,301
<i>Come on. The song's notJelly Roll, man.
It's a ballad. It's a beautiful thing.</i>

631
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:33,202
- You sing like a velvety-
- Of course, honey.

632
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,763
Oh, Lelia.

633
00:45:35,841 --> 00:45:38,469
I have an appointment.
I have to go.

634
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:49,115
I have an appointment.
I told you.

635
00:45:56,795 --> 00:46:00,959
- Where are you going?
- My appointment.

636
00:46:01,033 --> 00:46:03,001
You didn't tell me about
an appointment earlier.

637
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:05,127
I just remembered about it
a couple of minutes ago.

638
00:46:05,203 --> 00:46:08,536
<i>Tony, I love you.
Doesn't that mean anything?</i>

639
00:46:15,847 --> 00:46:17,781
Look, Lelia.

640
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:19,976
We'll have lunch tomorrow, okay?

641
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:29,324
After lunch, we'll go to a movie
or something like that.

642
00:46:29,394 --> 00:46:31,328
<i>Maybe have some drinks.</i>

643
00:46:33,865 --> 00:46:35,799
Lelia.

644
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:37,801
Lelia.

645
00:46:40,138 --> 00:46:42,072
Look.

646
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:45,540
I don't wanna fight with you.
I don't wanna argue with you.

647
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:48,773
- What's the matter?
- I want you to go.

648
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,781
Why?

649
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:54,444
I don't want you -
I don't want you to hurt my sister.

650
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:57,386
- I don't wanna hurt your sister.
- Look. Maybe I can make you understand.

651
00:46:57,456 --> 00:47:00,220
- Lelia, I don't want to hurt you.
- Look, I want you to go!

652
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:02,226
Why? I don't understand that.

653
00:47:02,294 --> 00:47:06,287
Look, I want you to go.
I mean, it's as simple as that.

654
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,357
- I don't want you around.
- Want to have dinner with us tomorrow?

655
00:47:09,434 --> 00:47:10,710
I don't want nothing from you.

656
00:47:10,715 --> 00:47:13,268
I'll take you and Rupe to dinner.
All of us will go.

657
00:47:13,338 --> 00:47:15,465
I can't seem to
make it clear to you.

658
00:47:16,475 --> 00:47:19,444
I don't want you around
hurting my sister.

659
00:47:20,946 --> 00:47:23,506
I don't want you
to hurt anything of mine.

660
00:47:23,582 --> 00:47:25,743
Now go.

661
00:47:25,817 --> 00:47:28,183
Just get out!

662
00:47:30,088 --> 00:47:32,022
- You're telling me to get out.
- Get out, man.

663
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:34,854
What do you want me to do now?
Just get out.

664
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,859
Remember, you told me to get out.

665
00:47:42,934 --> 00:47:45,198
Look, would you leave?

666
00:47:46,204 --> 00:47:49,264
Would you leave before I do something
I don't want to do right now.

667
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,504
Would you just get out of here.
Go ahead.

668
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:54,909
But you remember you told me
to get out of here!

669
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,312
Will you get out of the house!

670
00:48:31,817 --> 00:48:35,719
- You got me, Bennie -
- I love you.

671
00:48:36,922 --> 00:48:39,891
Okay. It's all right.

672
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,449
Oh, I love him so much.

673
00:49:03,048 --> 00:49:05,539
<i>You all right, baby?</i>

674
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:15,993
Good night, baby.

675
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:18,086
Get some sleep, will you?

676
00:49:56,701 --> 00:50:01,001
That water better be hot this morning or
I'm gonna wipe that superintendent out.

677
00:50:04,676 --> 00:50:06,610
Excuse me.

678
00:50:09,614 --> 00:50:12,481
Hey, how do you manage to get here
three minutes before I do?

679
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,714
What do you do, get up late at night
and watch the alarm or something?

680
00:50:15,787 --> 00:50:18,915
- Too bad.
- Just don't slop it up in there, okay?

681
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:21,049
Well, some people like water on them.

682
00:50:21,126 --> 00:50:23,856
Oh, go drown yourself.

683
00:50:27,732 --> 00:50:29,825
Hey, baby. How you feeling?

684
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,835
- Fine.
- Great.

685
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:35,634
Looks like I'll have to go out
and buy you a whole field of tobacco.

686
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:38,934
How you feel now?
You feel like talking to me about it?

687
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,240
- Maybe it'll help you.
- No, Hugh.

688
00:50:42,514 --> 00:50:45,506
There's not much to say.
Thanks anyway.

689
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,075
Is it just possible for somebody
to get a towel in this place?

690
00:50:48,153 --> 00:50:50,246
Oh, I forgot to put them up.
I'll get you one.

691
00:50:50,322 --> 00:50:52,813
No, don't drag it out.
It's probably someplace simple...

692
00:50:52,891 --> 00:50:55,018
like in the hi-fi set.

693
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,857
Look, I better get it while it's hot.

694
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:01,626
Oh, Lelia. Look, I got some cats
coming up tonight.

695
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,828
And, uh, if you don't feel
up to it, we can cancel.

696
00:51:04,903 --> 00:51:07,235
Oh, no, Hugh.
It's all right, really.

697
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:11,868
I'll even order some things.
It'll give me something to do.

698
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,377
Great, great. That's my baby.

699
00:51:18,783 --> 00:51:21,047
Al.

700
00:51:23,888 --> 00:51:26,857
Al told me a story yesterday about Bird.

701
00:51:28,593 --> 00:51:33,053
Bird had this big limousine that had been
assessed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue...

702
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:36,897
and he was driving it all over town,
you know, like a block long.

703
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:39,402
And, uh, he was driving with
two other people in the car...

704
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,531
and Al was, like, the guy
in the center who, like, told me.

705
00:51:42,607 --> 00:51:45,337
And the guy on the outside he didn't like
and they were going uptown.

706
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,277
And they were going down Broadway
and they had to make a left...

707
00:51:48,346 --> 00:51:50,473
and another left to go uptown.

708
00:51:50,548 --> 00:51:53,517
So as they stopped at the light...

709
00:51:53,585 --> 00:51:55,519
Bird said...

710
00:51:55,587 --> 00:51:59,421
"Man, would you mind getting out
of the car? I have to make a left turn".

711
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,652
So the guy said, "Okay, Bird,"
and got out of the car.

712
00:52:01,726 --> 00:52:05,093
And Bird made his left turn
and went uptown without him.

713
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:08,963
- Isn't that sick?
- Yeah, very.

714
00:52:09,034 --> 00:52:11,696
- Hey, Bennie, you got a towel for me?
- Yeah.

715
00:52:13,104 --> 00:52:14,833
Thanks.

716
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,938
Maybe I'll just join
a small group in Vegas.

717
00:52:19,944 --> 00:52:22,845
Bennie, what's this I hear
about you getting a job?

718
00:52:22,914 --> 00:52:25,382
I mean, that really upsets me.

719
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:29,614
- You're kidding, aren't you?
- Very funny, very funny.

720
00:52:31,122 --> 00:52:33,215
Lelia, can I get you
a cup of coffee or something?

721
00:52:33,291 --> 00:52:35,816
No, Hugh.

722
00:52:35,894 --> 00:52:38,294
What's the matter with you?
Are you sick?

723
00:52:41,299 --> 00:52:44,462
You look awful. You ought
to get some rest at night.

724
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,470
Will you shut up!

725
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,143
What did I say?

726
00:52:54,145 --> 00:52:56,204
Just forget it.

727
00:52:56,281 --> 00:52:58,215
I won't forget it. What did I say?

728
00:52:58,283 --> 00:53:01,252
- What's the matter with her?
- Nothing you'd be interested in.

729
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:04,720
Look, she's my sister too. I wanna know
what's the matter with her.

730
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:07,986
Nothing, baby. Just a little problem
that came up last night.

731
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,425
A little problem?
What is the little problem?

732
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:17,224
Look, Bennie. It's just a problem
with the races, that's all.

733
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:24,671
Like I said, Bennie,
nothing you'd be interested in.

734
00:53:26,711 --> 00:53:28,702
Who all is coming
to this party tonight?

735
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,078
Oh, just some people.

736
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:51,101
You know what you need?

737
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:54,434
You need a guy to take care of you
and protect your values.

738
00:53:54,506 --> 00:53:57,373
You need a home and security
and babies, honey.

739
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,376
That's what you need.

740
00:54:00,478 --> 00:54:03,743
<i>- Oh, look. There's DaveyJones. Davey!
- No, Vickie.</i>

741
00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:05,749
Meet Davey. He's wonderful.
You'll love him.

742
00:54:05,817 --> 00:54:08,650
- Vickie, no.
- Davey! DaveyJones. Davey!

743
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,281
Davey, I want you to meet Lelia.
Lelia, this is Davey.

744
00:54:12,357 --> 00:54:15,053
- Hello there.
- Hello.

745
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,924
Sit down for a second, Davey.

746
00:54:19,864 --> 00:54:23,925
Davey went to the same school -
Your brother's school, Stuyvesant.

747
00:54:26,104 --> 00:54:30,063
<i>Vickie--
How long have you known Vickie?</i>

748
00:54:31,509 --> 00:54:33,807
What do you do all day?

749
00:54:33,878 --> 00:54:37,405
- I paint.
- You're an artist.

750
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,251
Maybe I can drop by one afternoon.
Take in a movie or something.

751
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,719
I don't like the movies.

752
00:54:43,788 --> 00:54:47,588
Well, there are other places to go.
Take you to a club then. How about that?

753
00:54:48,593 --> 00:54:51,460
Or we'll go to an opera.

754
00:54:51,529 --> 00:54:53,463
I might drop up one afternoon.

755
00:54:53,531 --> 00:54:55,522
Maybe we can go for a walk
through the park or-

756
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,534
I don't like the park either.

757
00:54:57,602 --> 00:55:00,162
<i>Oh, give me a break.</i>

758
00:55:07,212 --> 00:55:08,257
Hi, Dave, daddy.

759
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:10,648
Hello, Rupert. How are you?
I'm not interrupting, am I?

760
00:55:10,715 --> 00:55:13,684
Vickie, will you help me out, put in
a good word here or there somewhere?

761
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,717
Well.

762
00:55:20,792 --> 00:55:23,784
- To talk to Lelia.
- Hi, baby. How are you doing?

763
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,729
Why don't you take her
to that wonderful painters' -

764
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:29,892
They're having some kind of thing
over at Cooper Union.

765
00:55:29,968 --> 00:55:33,597
- She'd love that.
- I wouldn't dig that at all.

766
00:55:33,671 --> 00:55:36,139
Well, that's the kind of thing
I enjoy, you see?

767
00:55:37,475 --> 00:55:41,036
Well, we'll go then.

768
00:55:46,918 --> 00:55:48,852
Lelia. Hello.

769
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,218
I'd like to see you
for a second, can I?

770
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:53,587
<i>- Yeah, what?
- It's about Tony.</i>

771
00:56:00,131 --> 00:56:04,727
Say, uh, excuse me. Can I talk to Lelia
for just a second? It's something important.

772
00:56:04,802 --> 00:56:07,293
<i>- No, David. I'd rather not.
- Honey. It's okay.</i>

773
00:56:07,372 --> 00:56:10,603
No, please. David,
I don't want to discuss any of this.

774
00:56:10,675 --> 00:56:13,701
- Please. Just come with me for a second.
- No, David, please!

775
00:56:13,778 --> 00:56:17,612
He called me. He was very upset about
something that happened here the other day.

776
00:56:17,682 --> 00:56:21,015
- And he got me upset about it.
- I know, David.

777
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:23,986
Yeah, but I feel I'm involved in it.
And I just want to tell you...

778
00:56:24,055 --> 00:56:26,387
that I didn't know at all
what he was like, when, you know -

779
00:56:26,457 --> 00:56:29,449
Hey, hey, Dave, Dave.

780
00:56:29,527 --> 00:56:31,791
Come on, Dave.
Leave my sister alone.

781
00:56:31,863 --> 00:56:34,423
Come on, man.
Come on and join the party.

782
00:56:39,504 --> 00:56:41,438
Look, I have to go.

783
00:56:41,506 --> 00:56:43,440
I'll see you later, all right?

784
00:56:43,508 --> 00:56:46,705
- You're a very good dancer.
- I'm not such a good dancer.

785
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,110
Lelia, come on over here.
Come on over here.

786
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,171
Looks like you and her
are getting along real fine.

787
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:53,479
Well.

788
00:57:22,714 --> 00:57:25,410
Look, why don't you just
come on and have a drink with us...

789
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:29,647
and join in the party
and forget about your mood for a while?

790
00:57:29,721 --> 00:57:31,655
You know, I just don't understand.

791
00:57:31,723 --> 00:57:34,556
I think you really
want to join in the party...

792
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:36,752
but maybe you don't know how.

793
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,296
You want to be coaxed a little bit.

794
00:57:39,364 --> 00:57:41,298
You really feel that way?

795
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:46,127
I prefer to be coaxed.
But don't you coax me, okay?

796
00:57:46,204 --> 00:57:48,035
There are other ways.

797
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,140
You want a drink?
Want me to get you a drink?

798
00:57:53,211 --> 00:57:57,045
<i>- No, thanks. I don't drink.
- You'll find it's good for what ails you.</i>

799
00:57:57,115 --> 00:58:02,883
<i>Just pull yourself together, because
you're not kidding anybody but yourself.</i>

800
00:58:02,954 --> 00:58:07,891
You know, you have
your sense of values all mixed up.

801
00:58:07,959 --> 00:58:09,893
So I can just -

802
00:58:09,961 --> 00:58:12,395
No, don't touch me.

803
00:58:12,463 --> 00:58:14,693
Come on, just a little taste.

804
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,137
- Let him go, let him go.
- You're crazy, baby.

805
00:58:28,212 --> 00:58:31,079
<i>- Let me go. Let me go.
- Hugh, come on.</i>

806
00:58:31,149 --> 00:58:33,140
Let me go!

807
00:58:36,988 --> 00:58:39,548
<i>What the hell is wrong with that guy?</i>

808
00:58:39,624 --> 00:58:41,615
What's wrong with you?
You don't have to get carried away.

809
00:58:41,692 --> 00:58:43,853
He's always messing up the damn thing!
What's wrong with him?

810
00:58:43,928 --> 00:58:46,089
This is a party! Stop it!

811
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,675
Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow.

812
00:59:06,884 --> 00:59:09,375
Everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

813
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:24,464
- Gee, he's your brother, and I -
- I know.

814
00:59:24,535 --> 00:59:27,060
I find it hard to believe
you can't talk to him.

815
00:59:27,138 --> 00:59:32,166
I don't know, right now I'd just be satisfied
with a home and a few kids, you know.

816
00:59:32,243 --> 00:59:35,735
- Simple things.
- I envy you.

817
00:59:35,813 --> 00:59:39,271
He's a pretty unhappy kid, you know.
It's too bad you can't -

818
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:42,114
He's mixed up and for some reason,
I don't know...

819
00:59:42,186 --> 00:59:44,484
he doesn't,
either doesn't want to, is afraid to -

820
00:59:44,555 --> 00:59:46,989
Okay, Hugh.
Let her off the hook, will you?

821
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,491
<i>The night's almost over.</i>

822
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,987
Let's end it off with a little smile
rather than all this.

823
00:59:54,065 --> 00:59:58,468
What's with this "Leave the girl alone"?
Why don't you leave me alone?

824
00:59:58,536 --> 01:00:01,596
I was only attempting to remind you
that we invited her here...

825
01:00:01,672 --> 01:00:03,401
<i>to have a good time, that's all.</i>

826
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,965
She obviously wants to hear
what I have to say.

827
01:00:06,043 --> 01:00:08,773
<i>- Maybe he doesn't wanna talk about it.
- She's not complaining.</i>

828
01:00:08,846 --> 01:00:11,406
Why don't you butt out,
mind your own business?

829
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:14,076
<i>We want to kill each other,
that's my business.</i>

830
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:17,451
Every time I turn around, it's you behind me
pushing me, interfering with me.

831
01:00:17,522 --> 01:00:19,615
<i>- You could be replaced.
- You sound pretty mad about it.</i>

832
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:24,024
Okay, Hugh.
Let's knock it off, huh?

833
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,588
Hey, look.
I'm picking up your phrases.

834
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,997
The other day in Philadelphia
when I was singing...

835
01:00:30,067 --> 01:00:32,092
you know,
I don't appreciate that at all.

836
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,832
<i>- Oh, yeah.
- I'm getting ready to sing the song.</i>

837
01:00:34,906 --> 01:00:36,840
In the middle of the song...

838
01:00:36,908 --> 01:00:40,469
for what reason I don't know
why you did it, you decided to change it.

839
01:00:40,545 --> 01:00:42,513
This don't make sense.
Does that make any kind of sense?

840
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:46,448
No, I don't think it's fair to...

841
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:50,613
- sort of as a last minute sort of thing.
- Another little bright idea of his.

842
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:52,952
Without interfering with you...

843
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,652
I think what you feel more
is my attitude towards life.

844
01:00:55,726 --> 01:00:59,162
<i>Maybe that bugs you, but don't hold it
against me. That's the way I am, see.</i>

845
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:02,165
How much longer you
planning on us staying here?

846
01:01:02,233 --> 01:01:05,896
<i>- I don't know. What time is it now?
- Five after 5:00.</i>

847
01:01:08,506 --> 01:01:10,474
- Here are your keys.
- Where the hell have you been?

848
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,032
- What the hell do you care?
- What do you mean, "What do I care"?

849
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:15,044
- There are your keys. Where's Lelia?
- She's out.

850
01:01:15,112 --> 01:01:17,307
Don't mess with me.
I'm splitting. There are your keys.

851
01:01:17,381 --> 01:01:20,214
- I want to talk to you.
- No. Get out of my way.

852
01:01:20,284 --> 01:01:22,752
- I want to talk to you!
- Are you gonna stop it?

853
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:25,618
Take your hands off!

854
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:27,351
Look, Bennie, you're my brother.

855
01:01:27,425 --> 01:01:29,825
What do you want me to do,
start the whole thing all over again?

856
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,419
Goddamn it, if I have to whip you,
I'm gonna tell you something!

857
01:01:32,496 --> 01:01:35,465
- Look, wait a minute, will you?
- I'm going.

858
01:01:35,533 --> 01:01:38,161
Bennie, will you listen? I love you.
What the hell am I supposed to say?

859
01:01:39,637 --> 01:01:45,337
<i>Bennie. Bennie, for God's--
Take the keys, please.</i>

860
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,435
- Bennie.
- All right.

861
01:01:48,512 --> 01:01:52,846
Are we friends?
Buddies? Brothers?

862
01:01:54,018 --> 01:01:55,952
Huh?

863
01:02:04,128 --> 01:02:07,029
- Hi. All ready?
- Well, hello.

864
01:02:08,032 --> 01:02:10,466
No. Where's my flowers?

865
01:02:11,636 --> 01:02:14,400
I was late, so I didn't have
a chance to - I just ran right over.

866
01:02:14,472 --> 01:02:17,202
Well, I just don't think
that's very nice of you at all.

867
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:21,075
Don't you think you should bring a lady
something when you beg to take her out?

868
01:02:21,145 --> 01:02:23,477
I can go back and get them
if you want me to.

869
01:02:23,547 --> 01:02:26,038
No, just go make yourself comfortable.
There's drinks in there.

870
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,642
- Go, go.
- Will you be long?

871
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:30,710
I'll be as long as I am.

872
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,352
- Hi, there.
- Oh, hi.

873
01:02:37,428 --> 01:02:39,589
I'm Davey. I'm taking Lelia
to the dance tonight.

874
01:02:39,664 --> 01:02:43,532
Oh, good. Pleased to meet you.

875
01:02:43,601 --> 01:02:48,129
Uh, why don't you go and have a drink
with my brother and Rupe?

876
01:02:48,205 --> 01:02:51,436
- Thanks.
- Introduce yourself, why don't you?

877
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:55,241
Hi, fellas.

878
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,247
- Hi.
- Hi.

879
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:00,113
- It doesn't even make sense to be singing.
- I don't want to talk about -

880
01:03:00,184 --> 01:03:01,845
- What?
- What's up?

881
01:03:01,919 --> 01:03:03,853
What's up?
What do you mean, "What's up"?

882
01:03:03,921 --> 01:03:06,151
- You want a drink?
- I'd love one.

883
01:03:06,223 --> 01:03:08,885
- Good, get one over there.
- Yeah, drinks over there.

884
01:03:08,959 --> 01:03:11,291
Over there, man. Drinks over there.
The whole song -

885
01:03:11,362 --> 01:03:14,058
It would sound ridiculous
the other way, you know?

886
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:16,122
- I'd want to do it, you know -
- Lelia, let's -

887
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,134
I'm not ready, David.
David, I'm -

888
01:03:18,202 --> 01:03:20,136
Do I look ready? No.

889
01:03:20,204 --> 01:03:22,331
Therefore, wait.
Be comfortable and wait.

890
01:03:22,406 --> 01:03:24,340
- Lelia, it's getting late.
- Well, wait.

891
01:03:30,581 --> 01:03:33,072
I'm not gonna say I'm gonna sing
all the things like that.

892
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,880
- Were you just doing "Lucky Day"?
- Yeah.

893
01:03:35,953 --> 01:03:38,183
I know that song.
I'm doing it in my nightclub act.

894
01:03:38,255 --> 01:03:40,189
- Great, man. Great.
- Oh, boy. That's terrific.

895
01:03:40,257 --> 01:03:42,589
No, but really.
I know it, and he's doing it wrong.

896
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,651
Oh, really?
You want to show him how to do it?

897
01:03:44,729 --> 01:03:47,721
That's wrong, man. You're dragging it
through the middle. It's a up tune, man.

898
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:49,993
- It has to go and swing.
- You tell him, now.

899
01:03:50,067 --> 01:03:53,559
- You know, you know.
- See? Now, that's the right idea.

900
01:03:53,637 --> 01:03:57,801
Oh, wow. Isn't this -

901
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:01,208
- Hey, Bennie. Isn't this great?
- #I found a horseshoe#

902
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:03,678
#I couldn't go wrong#

903
01:04:03,748 --> 01:04:08,685
- #And when you just happened along##
- Hey, Bennie. Isn't he a smash?

904
01:04:08,753 --> 01:04:11,449
What do you think you're doing?
What do you think you're doing here?

905
01:04:11,522 --> 01:04:12,575
I was explaining that song.

906
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,685
I didn't ask you to interrupt
my brother's business.

907
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:17,091
- He was singing it wrong.
- He makes the money, not you.

908
01:04:17,161 --> 01:04:19,220
<i>- You don't understand.
- What do you mean?</i>

909
01:04:19,296 --> 01:04:22,060
I didn't ask you to come in here
and disturb my relatives.

910
01:04:22,133 --> 01:04:25,034
<i>So please sit down and be quiet.</i>

911
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,900
Did you hear that?
Wasn't it great?

912
01:04:29,974 --> 01:04:32,442
<i>Marvelous.</i>

913
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:35,104
- Where is he?
- Are you kidding with this guy?

914
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:38,848
Rupe, I feel -

915
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:47,648
I'm a strange one.

916
01:05:02,506 --> 01:05:04,440
Would you mind shaking it up, Lelia?

917
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,877
I've been waiting for exactly
two and a half hours.

918
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:12,473
Do you want to go out with a wreck,
or would you like me to look nice?

919
01:05:13,484 --> 01:05:16,282
I want you to look good, but I want you
to shake it up. Do you mind?

920
01:05:16,353 --> 01:05:18,617
You want to go to the dance with me?

921
01:05:18,689 --> 01:05:22,625
<i>- I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to.
- Then you'll wait. I'm not finished yet.</i>

922
01:05:22,693 --> 01:05:24,627
Hey, hey, what's with you two?

923
01:05:24,695 --> 01:05:27,562
Lelia, do you have to
talk to him like that?

924
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:30,566
I'll talk-What do you mean,
"Do I have to talk to him that way"?

925
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:32,727
I wouldn't blame the fella
if he got up and left.

926
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:39,275
I don't know.

927
01:05:39,343 --> 01:05:41,334
Sure wouldn't let anybody
talk to me like that.

928
01:05:41,412 --> 01:05:44,040
You didn't tell me you had
such a tough sister, man.

929
01:05:44,114 --> 01:05:47,606
- Does she carry on like that all the time?
- Look, I'm just happy to see her going out.

930
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:51,311
I'm done.

931
01:05:51,388 --> 01:05:53,913
- How do I look?
- You look nice.

932
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:56,721
- You be a good boy. Be a good boy.
- Yeah, thank you.

933
01:05:56,794 --> 01:06:00,127
- I'll see you. Write to me.
- I'll write, and I'll send the money.

934
01:06:00,197 --> 01:06:03,530
<i>Come on, I'm finished.</i>

935
01:06:03,601 --> 01:06:05,535
Come on, let's go.

936
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,174
My coat, sir.

937
01:06:39,703 --> 01:06:42,103
Hey.

938
01:06:42,172 --> 01:06:46,040
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to talk to Lelia.

939
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:49,375
Well, you can't talk to Lelia.
I don't want you in here.

940
01:06:49,446 --> 01:06:51,937
- Never mind, don't even talk. Just get out.
- Let me tell you -

941
01:06:52,016 --> 01:06:55,110
I don't want to hear anything
you've got to say. Will you go, please?

942
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:58,018
<i>- I don't want to hear anything.
- Please listen to me for a minute.</i>

943
01:06:58,088 --> 01:07:01,683
I don't want to listen to you.
Get out of the place!

944
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,750
- Hugh. Let me talk to him.
- Wait a minute.

945
01:07:03,827 --> 01:07:08,264
- Wait a minute. This is my problem.
- This is our problem, our problem.

946
01:07:08,332 --> 01:07:11,165
- Okay.
- So what do you want?

947
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:13,260
I just want you
to tell her that I'm sorry.

948
01:07:13,337 --> 01:07:16,932
- All right. He's sorry, he's sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

949
01:07:17,007 --> 01:07:19,999
- Will you tell her that?
- Yes, I will. Most definitely I will tell her.

950
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:23,945
Will you tell her that I realize now...

951
01:07:24,014 --> 01:07:27,245
- there's no difference between us.
- Anything else?

952
01:07:27,318 --> 01:07:29,912
She'll always mean a great deal to me.

953
01:07:29,987 --> 01:07:33,218
- Anything else?
- Just tell her that...

954
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:36,191
Tony said, "I'm sorry".

955
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:39,286
There's no difference
between you and Lelia.

956
01:07:40,564 --> 01:07:42,930
She means a great deal to you.

957
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:46,202
And you're sorry.

958
01:07:47,371 --> 01:07:48,929
<i>Thank you.</i>

959
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:19,895
You must like to fight or something, man.
You keep pushing people.

960
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:24,740
- See you.
- Okay.

961
01:08:28,612 --> 01:08:30,273
What are you doing?

962
01:08:30,347 --> 01:08:32,281
Getting ready to go to Chicago, buddy.
How about you?

963
01:08:32,349 --> 01:08:34,840
Wait a minute. I'll pack,
and I'll be right with you.

964
01:08:34,918 --> 01:08:37,546
Okay. So you meet me
down at the station.

965
01:08:37,621 --> 01:08:39,555
- All right.
- Twenty minutes.

966
01:08:41,058 --> 01:08:42,992
Twenty minutes.

967
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:48,960
<i>#Lovely is the blue
of your eyes, beautiful#</i>

968
01:08:49,033 --> 01:08:52,594
- You're a very good dancer.
- Sure.

969
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:56,071
- You don't believe me?
- I believe you.

970
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,370
It's just that I know
I'm a good dancer.

971
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:01,640
Oh, wow. What an ego.

972
01:09:02,813 --> 01:09:06,476
- Do you come here often?
- Yes.

973
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:08,575
I like this place. It swings.

974
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:12,085
Well, maybe you can
take me here next week.

975
01:09:12,156 --> 01:09:14,124
But I didn't ask you.

976
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:17,183
Well, if I want to go,
I'm sure you'll take me.

977
01:09:17,261 --> 01:09:21,527
Now, look, Lelia, where I come from,
the men do the asking.

978
01:09:21,598 --> 01:09:25,466
- The girls just go yes or no.
- Well.

979
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:28,699
I guess I just don't fit into
that pattern, now, do I?

980
01:09:28,772 --> 01:09:33,607
No, you don't. As a matter of fact,
you're just a little too much for me.

981
01:09:33,677 --> 01:09:36,646
Well, then why don't you
take me home?

982
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:39,205
- Why did you ask me in the first place?
- Now, steady, girl.

983
01:09:39,283 --> 01:09:41,308
Do you always shout down
your boyfriends that way?

984
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:46,254
- I never shout.
- Well, it would seem that way to me.

985
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:51,224
Look, do you always go around
embarrassing people in front of strangers?

986
01:09:51,295 --> 01:09:53,229
I mean, laughing at them
in front of your family...

987
01:09:53,297 --> 01:09:56,630
keeping them waiting for hours
just to show off how masculine you are.

988
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,634
Darling, I'm not masculine.

989
01:09:58,702 --> 01:10:01,865
Well, it would seem that way to me.

990
01:10:01,939 --> 01:10:04,271
Well, how do you want me to behave?

991
01:10:04,341 --> 01:10:08,675
Look, just dance.
And be as lovely as you look.

992
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:14,241
Look, David, I am what I am,
and nobody tells me what to do.

993
01:10:14,318 --> 01:10:17,116
Look, I don't know who
you think you're fighting.

994
01:10:17,187 --> 01:10:19,348
You know, I saw the way
he looked at you back there.

995
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:22,119
And I also saw the way
he looked at me.

996
01:10:22,192 --> 01:10:27,129
<i>#Whisper, you make
this moment divine#</i>

997
01:10:27,197 --> 01:10:29,893
<i>#Beautiful#</i>

998
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:35,906
<i>#Tell me you will
always be mine#</i>

999
01:10:35,973 --> 01:10:38,100
<i>#Beautiful#</i>

1000
01:10:38,175 --> 01:10:43,909
<i>#Forever is a long, long time#</i>

1001
01:10:44,915 --> 01:10:50,285
<i>#Spend it with your lips
on mine, beautiful#</i>

1002
01:10:50,354 --> 01:10:54,586
You know, despite
your horrible exterior...

1003
01:10:55,692 --> 01:10:57,626
it's you I like.

1004
01:10:58,962 --> 01:11:03,956
<i>#My beautiful you##</i>

1005
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:29,054
- Hey!
- Come on.

1006
01:11:29,126 --> 01:11:31,492
- So you finally made it.
- No sweat, man.

1007
01:11:31,562 --> 01:11:34,190
- Hugh, I've got some bad news.
- The train move?

1008
01:11:34,264 --> 01:11:36,198
No.

1009
01:11:36,266 --> 01:11:39,702
No, I checked with
our telephone service and...

1010
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:44,036
there's no point in us going to Cincinnati
because the job is closed out.

1011
01:11:44,107 --> 01:11:46,473
- What about Chicago?
- It's still there.

1012
01:11:46,543 --> 01:11:49,068
- So what happened?
- Ackerman.

1013
01:11:49,146 --> 01:11:51,774
Ackerman called Cincinnati
at his own expense...

1014
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:55,080
and told them
you were being difficult.

1015
01:11:55,152 --> 01:11:57,848
- So?
- So that means no Cincinnati.

1016
01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:03,585
That means we go to Chicago for
a week's billing and come back here...

1017
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:07,619
and maybe some cheap, mangy
club owner will give us a job...

1018
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:09,962
- introducing the girlie line.
- Wait a minute, will you?

1019
01:12:10,033 --> 01:12:13,230
<i>Or maybe you can sing
to a room full of drunks.</i>

1020
01:12:13,303 --> 01:12:15,965
Look, we've been in this business
for a long time.

1021
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:20,032
I'm supposed to be a manager.
You're supposed to be a singer. Right?

1022
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:24,843
Now who have I ever managed
besides you? And what have you ever done?

1023
01:12:24,915 --> 01:12:27,349
<i>- Rupe, wait a minute.
- The bestjob I've been able to get you...</i>

1024
01:12:27,417 --> 01:12:31,683
is in the Black Rose
in Tucson, Arizona.

1025
01:12:31,755 --> 01:12:34,383
Rupe, wait a minute, baby. Wait.

1026
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:38,292
No, no, I've had it
with this rat race. I've had it.

1027
01:12:38,362 --> 01:12:40,421
I'm busted. I'm busted.

1028
01:12:40,497 --> 01:12:44,092
<i>I've been insulted by these pigs,
laughed at.</i>

1029
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:48,194
And what's in it for you or for me?
Look, if we've got to be failures...

1030
01:12:48,272 --> 01:12:52,106
<i>let's do so in our own city
or get the hell out ofhere.</i>

1031
01:12:52,175 --> 01:12:55,201
- Out of where, man?
- Here, the States.

1032
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:59,215
We'll go to Paris, France, Africa.
I don't care.

1033
01:12:59,283 --> 01:13:01,751
It's going to be the same
no matter where we go.

1034
01:13:01,818 --> 01:13:06,448
<i>- Look, I have had it.
- Rupert, wait a minute.</i>

1035
01:13:06,523 --> 01:13:10,391
Do you believe in me?
Rupert, do you believe in me?

1036
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:12,394
<i>I don't mean what
those other people think of me.</i>

1037
01:13:12,462 --> 01:13:17,126
I mean what we give each other.
You know, what comes out of both of us.

1038
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,532
Your talent, my voice.

1039
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:22,333
Man, when you're on time,
you're still not on time.

1040
01:13:22,406 --> 01:13:25,705
<i>Rupe, do you believe this?
Because, Rupert...</i>

1041
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:29,212
I believe that you're
the greatest manager in the world.

1042
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:31,406
<i>And we're together.</i>

1043
01:13:31,481 --> 01:13:33,745
Rupe, you're the greatest
manager in the world.

1044
01:13:41,658 --> 01:13:43,990
Come on, let's go.

1045
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:20,459
<i>Next week, Eastland's.</i>

1046
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:22,828
<i>Move, will you? Come on.</i>

1047
01:14:22,899 --> 01:14:24,958
Hey.

1048
01:14:25,035 --> 01:14:28,664
Hey.

1049
01:14:30,273 --> 01:14:34,039
- You're gonna get us killed.
- Almost hit me, the dirty-

1050
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:42,084
You ready?
Make the announcement.

1051
01:14:42,152 --> 01:14:44,484
Girls, the Happiness Boys
singing "Up On The Moonbeam".

1052
01:14:44,554 --> 01:14:46,488
Girls, the Happiness Boys.

1053
01:14:46,556 --> 01:14:49,286
#Up on the moonbeam#

1054
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:54,262
#Up on the moonbeam#

1055
01:14:55,265 --> 01:14:58,132
#Up on the moonbeam#

1056
01:15:00,404 --> 01:15:02,634
<i>- #Up on the moonbeam with you#
- #Up on the moonbeam#</i>

1057
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:06,870
- Hit it, boys.
- #What makes my head go round and round#

1058
01:15:06,943 --> 01:15:10,071
#While my heart stands still##

1059
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:13,413
Hey, man!

1060
01:15:13,483 --> 01:15:15,474
Hey, Bennie.

1061
01:15:16,787 --> 01:15:19,779
- Hey. What's going on here?
- Take it easy. Leave him alone.

1062
01:15:19,856 --> 01:15:22,984
Get out of here.
We're with these girls.

1063
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,187
<i>- So what's the story?
- What are you guys doing here?</i>

1064
01:15:25,262 --> 01:15:28,561
We just came in here,
and we're clowning around.

1065
01:15:28,632 --> 01:15:30,566
Go clown around somewhere else,
huh, buddy?

1066
01:15:30,634 --> 01:15:32,795
- Take it easy. We're only kidding.
- We're with these girls.

1067
01:15:32,869 --> 01:15:35,064
Shut up, punk.

1068
01:15:35,138 --> 01:15:37,129
- Wait a minute.
- What do you mean, "Take it easy"?

1069
01:15:37,207 --> 01:15:41,507
- I mean take it easy.
- Hands off, buddy.

1070
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:44,206
Take your hands off me.

1071
01:15:44,281 --> 01:15:46,476
Let's see you imitate somebody now,
stool pigeon.

1072
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,541
We're only kidding around, buddy.
All right, come on.

1073
01:15:48,618 --> 01:15:50,552
Come on, man. Don't get excited.

1074
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:52,747
Listen for a second.
What you want to fight for?

1075
01:15:52,823 --> 01:15:55,189
Just get your hands off.
You want to tangle ass, let's go.

1076
01:15:55,258 --> 01:15:57,624
<i>- Let's go.
- Take it easy, brother.</i>

1077
01:16:02,165 --> 01:16:04,656
- You're gonna get yours, brother.
- Come on, mother. You for me.

1078
01:16:04,734 --> 01:16:07,726
- You're for me too, boy.
- You're just the guy I want.

1079
01:16:07,804 --> 01:16:10,602
- All right, let's go!
- Yeah? Come on!

1080
01:16:29,159 --> 01:16:32,492
My eye, my eye!

1081
01:16:50,046 --> 01:16:52,173
You -

1082
01:16:52,249 --> 01:16:54,809
I'll kill you!

1083
01:18:03,386 --> 01:18:06,822
- How about it, Jonathan? Tell him.
- Three beers.

1084
01:18:07,824 --> 01:18:12,818
- He wants to - He's all shook up.
- No more of this jazz for me, baby.

1085
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:14,864
You can go home
for a week and cool it.

1086
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:18,594
So what are you gonna do?
We went out to have a ball, didn't we?

1087
01:18:18,668 --> 01:18:21,159
- That's what we did.
- So you gotta pay the price, man.

1088
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:24,071
If you get beat up, you get beat up.

1089
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,302
I don't know why we do this, man.

1090
01:18:28,378 --> 01:18:32,109
- I mean, go around, try to pick up girls.
- Stupid broads.

1091
01:18:32,182 --> 01:18:36,915
You'd think we'd have girls of our own
like every normal type guy.

1092
01:18:36,987 --> 01:18:39,217
<i>So?</i>

1093
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:41,587
<i>So I'm not gonna do it anymore.</i>

1094
01:18:41,658 --> 01:18:45,025
Want me to be corny and say
this has taught me a lesson?

1095
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:49,589
<i>- Well, it's taught me a lesson.
- Aw, just forget about it.</i>

1096
01:18:49,666 --> 01:18:51,600
Okay, forget about it.

1097
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:54,934
Uh. Yeah, okay.
Forget about it.

1098
01:18:56,306 --> 01:19:00,208
- I'm gonna shove off. Okay, Bennie?
- Okay.

1099
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:03,075
- All right. I'll see you.
- So long.

1100
01:19:03,146 --> 01:19:06,638
I'll see you, Dennis.
Yeah, you too.

1101
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:10,317
So long.

1102
01:19:10,387 --> 01:19:12,753
I gotta get a pack of cigarettes.
