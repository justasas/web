1
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,099
You wanted to see me, Sir?
You read the times this morning?

2
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,399
Avershays Press annouced the deal with Irving Gattinger.

3
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,599
Gattinger said he was done with writing.
Yes.

4
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,099
He hasn't written a book in 10 years.
It's a brilliant move.

5
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,999
Based on name recognition alone
it'll be an instant bestseller.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,899
Yes.

7
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,399
What do you think about Weldon Parish?

8
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,898
Parish is one of my personal favorites.

9
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,398
Are you thinking of signing him?
The man hasn't written anything in 20 years.

10
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,298
Or more reason.
What do you know about him?

11
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:12,398
Um.. Weldon Parish.

12
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,198
He left Unites States in mid 1980s.

13
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,598
Moved to a small Italian village
and after his wife died,

14
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,698
he simply gave up writing.

15
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:23,598
He's become wreckless.
He doesn't even give interviews.

16
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,499
Mmm. We could sign Weldon Parish.
We woud set the publishing world on it's ears.

17
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:36,498
I want you to go to Italy and talk to him.

18
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:38,798
Mr. Benton, with all due respect,

19
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,198
and believe me, no one would like to see a

20
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,998
Weldon Parish novel more than myself,

21
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:44,198
It's just not going to happen.

22
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,398
That people have tried. The man is
just not interested in writing.

23
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:51,998
Well, I expect you to make him interested.

24
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:56,198
Have a nice trip. Goodbye Jeremy.

25
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:23,897
Hi,
"Aveti una stanza con una banio?"

26
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:28,496
All the rooms have a private bathroom.
Ah. You speak English.

27
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:31,396
Does it sound like English?

28
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,996
Yes?
There you go.

29
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:36,896
Great. Look, I have some bags and...
Excuse me?

30
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:39,096
I have a couple more bags in the car.

31
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:45,395
Well.

32
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:48,995
Thank you.

33
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:53,995
What? Are you kidding?
I carried the bags.

34
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:55,795
I opened the door.

35
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,696
You opened the door....ok.

36
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:24,795
Is everything ok?
Ugh yes.

37
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:26,895
The room itself is fine, but..

38
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,395
There is a hmm..

39
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:33,495
There is a couple next door of me and they are...

40
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:34,795
Screwing.

41
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:37,894
Yes.

42
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:41,194
They come here every chance they get for privacy.

43
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:45,794
Huh.. anyway. I am actually
in town looking for Weldon Parish.

44
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:48,694
You wouldn't by any chance know, would you?

45
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,794
No.

46
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:53,394
Well, any idea where he lives?

47
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:55,694
No?

48
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:57,394
No...

49
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:59,994
Really. He's up here for 20 years,

50
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:04,194
and you don't know him and you have no idea where he lives.

51
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:05,794
Yes.

52
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:08,695
Right.

53
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:21,594
Weldon Parish?

54
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:25,194
Excuse me.
Do you know where I can find Weldon Parish?

55
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,594
Weldon Parish?

56
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:31,194
Weldon Parish?

57
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:59,993
( Italian )

58
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:50,992
Ok...

59
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:54,392
Hello Mr. Parish, my name is Jeremy Taylor.

60
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:56,792
Hello, Mr. Parish.

61
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:59,192
Hi, Mr. Parish, My name is Jeremy Taylor.

62
00:07:59,193 --> 00:08:00,892
Pearce Learner Publishing.

63
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:04,292
Hi, Weldon. I am Jeremy.
He is not here.

64
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:09,692
I just thought I would tell you so you wouldn't
waste the whole day talking to the door.

65
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:14,192
Are you a reporter?
Me? No. Why?

66
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,209
Cause papa hates reporters.

67
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:19,291
He says they are the lowest form of human life.

68
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:21,891
My name is Jeremy Taylor. I am an
editor with Pearce Learner Publishing.

69
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:24,991
That's even worse. He says that editors

70
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:28,391
don't even qualify as human life.

71
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:33,991
Oh... Well, it can't hurt to talk to him, can it?
No, it could hurt very much.

72
00:08:33,992 --> 00:08:39,291
The last editor who came here,
he chased him down to the water with an axe.

73
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:43,291
Ok. Well, I'll take my chances if you don't mind.

74
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:46,991
Ok. He is around the back. In the cellar.

75
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:52,191
Excuse me? I didn't catch your name.

76
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:53,991
Isabella.

77
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:18,690
Mr. Parish?

78
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:26,790
Mr. Parish. My name is Jeremy Taylor.
With Pearce Learner Publishing..

79
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:31,690
I have to say this is a great honor for me, sir.
(Foreign Language)

80
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:32,990
What?

81
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,690
Yes, I know he is here.
He is talking to me.

82
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:41,690
Can't you see he is talking to me?

83
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:44,490
Who are you talking to?
The King of the......

84
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:47,890
...
I am having Spam for lunch.

85
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:51,490
Do you like Spam?
I like mine with raisins.

86
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,890
Umm, you are Weldon Parish.

87
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:02,891
The writer.
They say I am.

88
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,189
Were you looking for someone else?

89
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,989
Yes, I think I was.

90
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,389
Ok, ok.
Hold on a second.

91
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,689
Did you find him?

92
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,689
Yes, I found him.

93
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,089
What happened to him?

94
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,189
No one really knows.
His mind just broke.

95
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,389
That's why everyone protects him.
Si.

96
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,589
That's just joyce.

97
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,590
Hmm, I want to check out in the morning
if that's ok?

98
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,488
He just came in. No.. he thinks
you are completely crazy, Weldon.

99
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:08,489
He is leaving tomorrow,ok?
Ciao, ciao.

100
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:24,088
That's a pretty elaborate plot
to get me to go away, don't you think?

101
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,688
Apparently that wasn't elaborate enough.

102
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,488
Mr. Parish, I came a long way to see you.

103
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:37,489
I didn't ask you to. See ya.

104
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,588
Do you know what "go away" means?

105
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:54,488
All I am asking for is
a few minutes of your time.

106
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:02,387
You are not going to go away, are you?

107
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,287
I am sorry to be so persistent,

108
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:07,887
but nobody ever got anyway by
taking "no" for an answer, right?

109
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:12,187
Alright. Make your pitch.

110
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:16,687
As I said before, I am with
Pearce Learner Publishing.

111
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:20,587
A place where we pride ourselves in
being able to work with creative individuals.

112
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:22,887
We believe in bringing the writer's
vision to the page.

113
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:25,387
And as a writer myself, I understand
how important that is.

114
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:26,587
What do you write?

115
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:30,587
Umm, well, I am actually still
working on my first novel.

116
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:34,887
I mean, I don't even know if it's any good, but
I have always dreamt of being a writer.

117
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,887
And being a writer you think you can understand me?

118
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:41,487
Well, Yes.
Well, you can't.

119
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:44,287
Actually, Mr. Parish, i think if you were to give me.....
Look...

120
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,887
You made your pitch.
I am not interested.

121
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:49,387
But I am not finished.
Yes. you are.

122
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:57,986
That's Bruno. Bruno dislikes
strangers more than I do.

123
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:00,486
Now would be a good time
to start running.

124
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:03,086
What?

125
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:05,487
Oh, Oh my god!

126
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:33,186
Hello?
Ah, Jeremy.

127
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,586
How is it going over there?
Oh sir, I'm...

128
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:39,186
Not well.
Well, did you meet him?

129
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:41,286
Oh yes.
Yes, I've met him.

130
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,872
What's he like?

131
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:48,885
The word "unstable" comes to mind.
Well, show me an artist who isn't, eh?

132
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:52,185
Well, I think I can say with
a great deal of confidence

133
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:55,285
that the man is not interested in writing.

134
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:59,385
Well, it is up to you to convenice him.

135
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:01,785
I am expecting results, Jeremy.

136
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:03,485
Jeremy?

137
00:14:03,486 --> 00:14:04,585
Jeremy, are you there?

138
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:06,685
Yes, yes. I am sorry.
I am still here, but you know what?

139
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:09,285
Actually, I've got to run right now.
Can I call you back later?

140
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:10,486
Ok. Thank you. Bye.

141
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:23,185
Si. Si. Si....

142
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:27,385
Ciao.

143
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:29,285
Hi!
Hi!

144
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,485
I heard about what happened this afternoon.

145
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:36,385
Dog... Yeah.
Yeah, your father is a very funny man.

146
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:39,484
I am so sorry. I tried to warn you.

147
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:44,384
So.. Where are you going?

148
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,184
I was actually just looking for a place to eat.

149
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:52,984
Oh, ok. there is only one place.

150
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:56,584
You would like that I take you?

151
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:59,784
Yes. Yes, I would.
Come.

152
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:02,384
Have you decided?

153
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:06,384
No, we haven't seen the menus yet.
There is no menu. Only specials.

154
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:09,484
Ok, then what are the specials?

155
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:13,084
Mix green salad and Spaghetti with Pesto.

156
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:16,584
Anything else?
No.

157
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,384
Perfect. Then can I have the mix green Salad
and some Speghetti with pesto?

158
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:24,584
Excellent choice. Isebella?
I've eaten.

159
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,484
Well.

160
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:30,984
You know..If you've eaten, you really
don't have to stay here with me.

161
00:15:30,985 --> 00:15:34,583
No, people shouldn't eat alone.

162
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:38,183
I eat alone all the time so I am used to it.

163
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:41,583
You changed your hair.
It looks good.

164
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,683
Really?

165
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:47,183
Thank you.

166
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:55,584
So.. Isabella.
What is it that you do here?

167
00:15:56,784 --> 00:16:00,783
I work with my horses,
I work with the vineyard.

168
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:03,883
That doesn't sound too bad to me.

169
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:10,083
Your father seems to have adapted well.
Well, my father is not an ordinary man.

170
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:12,883
Why do you want him to write so bad?

171
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:15,283
Well..

172
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:17,983
Honestly?
Mm.

173
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:24,883
When I was 12 years old,
I broke my collar bone.

174
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,682
So I was on the same bed for 5 weeks,
and I don't know if you have ever tried,

175
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:31,082
but it's not easy to keep a 12 years old
in bed for 5 weeks.

176
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,382
One day my hunt brings me a book.

177
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:36,382
"The Shadow Dancer" by Weldon Parish.

178
00:16:36,383 --> 00:16:39,382
And.. as I am reading this book,

179
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:42,082
Something absolutely miraculous happens to me.

180
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,182
I am transported into a differnt world,

181
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,882
and everyday for 5 weeks,
I lived through those words.

182
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:50,082
And to have the talent to instill those kind of
feelings to other people is a gift. And...

183
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,982
It just should not be wasted.

184
00:16:53,983 --> 00:16:57,682
You should have spoken to him like that.
Like what?

185
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,182
I see the passion that you have for his work.

186
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:04,082
You should have let him see it.
Well, I tried.

187
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,982
No, you tried to sell him.
And I know my father.

188
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:11,083
He reponds to honesty.
You should have tried using some.

189
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,882
If you want another chance.

190
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:22,782
He'll be at "Carina's letter". Umm,
It's a bar just outside of the home.

191
00:17:31,582 --> 00:17:33,881
You wouldn't have the straight.

192
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:37,981
That, my dear friend. You'll have to pay to find out.

193
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:41,681
This is interesting. You are acting like you have it.

194
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:44,281
You are trying to make me believe you have it.

195
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:47,781
So?
So. In a way you are lying.

196
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:51,281
Prist shouldn't live, Giovanni.
There is no lying in poker.

197
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:55,382
There is only bluffing.
And God forgives bluffing.

198
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:26,180
What? I can't come have a drink at the bar?

199
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:29,480
You could have a drink at the hotel.

200
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:31,980
Well, I would have.
But there is no one there.

201
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:38,480
Why don't you let me buy you a drink?

202
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:40,981
Just so you know there is no hard feelings about today.

203
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,081
Thank you.

204
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:58,680
Salute!
Salute!

205
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:00,581
Salute.

206
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:11,079
Ok. Why don't you ask me then you can go.
Ask what?

207
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,879
Question that's burning a hole in your little brain.

208
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,379
Why do I stop writing.

209
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,779
Ok. Why did you stop writing?
I didn't have anything else to say, Ollie.

210
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,979
Ok? It's that simple.
Now, you can go.

211
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,879
A writer always has something to say.
Oh.. Now you are an authority.

212
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,679
How the hell do you know
what I have to say?

213
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,179
No.. no.. no.. ha..  Mr. Parish.
Look. We say we'll have a drink.

214
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,679
I don't remember anything about a conversation.

215
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,179
Well, the mere act of accepting an
invitation to have a drink,

216
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,379
implies a certain degree of a conversation.

217
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,779
I hope you don't write like you talk.
Why? How do I talk?

218
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,579
Like an uptight jockstrap.

219
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,379
Ok.. Well, why were you upset?
Actually, I wouldn't upset anything.

220
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,680
I would have gotten the hint by not wanting to talk.

221
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,079
You are not one of those lampy pampy guy
unless there is a drink all night, are you?

222
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:20,078
Very Impressive.

223
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,778
Ok. Hasta la bye bye.

224
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:27,478
No, I bought this bottle of wine,
and I intend not to finishing it.

225
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:30,479
Eh?

226
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:38,078
See you guys tomorrow.

227
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:41,978
What do you mean,
"See you guys tomorrow"?

228
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:47,879
You said you were going back to London.
No. You said I was going back to London.

229
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:59,377
Hi, kid. You too.
You've had too much to drink.

230
00:20:59,678 --> 00:21:04,378
Well just drive you back to the hotel.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

231
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:34,477
What's this?
You guys are going to rough me up a little bit?

232
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:38,777
Hay, Seriously. Hay, what's that?
What are you doing back there?

233
00:21:38,778 --> 00:21:42,077
It's obvious that you just won't go away.

234
00:21:42,078 --> 00:21:45,177
Hay. Wow.. Hay, Father.
You're just gonna stand by and let this happen?

235
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,677
This is God's will, my son.
I don't know why you can't understand.

236
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:51,277
I think I've gone a great length
to make myself clear.

237
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:56,176
God! I was just trying to do my job.
Well, now you are going to join the others.

238
00:21:56,177 --> 00:21:58,976
What others? There are others in there?
They wouldn't go away, either.

239
00:21:58,977 --> 00:22:01,476
Ok, but I will. I will go. I promise.
I don't believe you.

240
00:22:01,477 --> 00:22:04,076
I think you'll just saying that so I'll let you go.

241
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:06,976
No, No.. I will abolutely go.
Tomorrow. As soon as I can.

242
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:09,676
I think he is telling the truth.
Yes. Listen to him.

243
00:22:09,677 --> 00:22:11,776
I don't believe him.
No...

244
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:15,376
No.. Wow..There is no need for this.
La Reverende.

245
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:28,176
What does "go away" mean, Mr. Taylor?

246
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:31,276
It means "go away."

247
00:22:31,677 --> 00:22:35,276
I'll expect you to do just that.

248
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:36,177
Lion.

249
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:53,175
I'm baptizing you in the name of father,

250
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:56,576
the son and the holy ghost.

251
00:22:59,276 --> 00:23:02,075
What are you doing?
Baptizing you.

252
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:05,576
I am Jewish.
Not anymore.

253
00:23:38,676 --> 00:23:39,875
Hay, Ciao.

254
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:57,374
Unbelieveable.

255
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:03,275
You've got balls, boy. I'll give you that.
And you've got my car keys.

256
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:11,874
There you go.

257
00:24:12,775 --> 00:24:13,974
Is that all?

258
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:17,575
Yeap.

259
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:43,073
You know what? That's not it.

260
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:44,973
Because whatever reason you have
for not wanting to write,

261
00:24:44,974 --> 00:24:47,173
I accept them being personal,
but that's still no excuse for you to be

262
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:50,073
such an unbelieveable asshole.

263
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,773
I guess I am not everyone.
You know,

264
00:24:52,774 --> 00:24:55,873
I admit. I only came here because my boss sent me.

265
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:59,473
But underneath, I came here because
I have always wanted to meet you.

266
00:24:59,474 --> 00:25:01,873
I thought that maybe if I could meet
the Great Weldon Parish,

267
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:03,973
Perhaps you can teach me how to be a better writer.

268
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:07,173
But I realize now that the only  things that you have
to teach me are bitterness,

269
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:09,873
and mistrust.

270
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:12,373
There goes the great business, Weldon?

271
00:25:12,374 --> 00:25:15,373
What brings you to town, Ian?

272
00:25:15,374 --> 00:25:18,073
I just finished my new novel and came back for a drink.

273
00:25:18,374 --> 00:25:20,573
You remember that once you finished a book
way back,

274
00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:23,373
when you still had so many to say.

275
00:25:23,974 --> 00:25:26,173
I am sorry. Did I striken out?

276
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:28,873
It must be tough, being all dried out and said.

277
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:31,172
and having to live on the past glories.

278
00:25:32,873 --> 00:25:37,672
At least he has past glories to live on.
and who might you be?

279
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:41,072
Jeremy Taylor.
Ian McBain.

280
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:43,972
Ian McBain, the novelist?

281
00:25:45,873 --> 00:25:48,672
I know your work.
You are a fan?

282
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:50,672
No, I didn't say that.
Jeremy.

283
00:25:50,673 --> 00:25:54,572
Actually, I would say that your themes are all the same.

284
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:57,072
That your narration lacks depth and imagination.

285
00:25:57,073 --> 00:25:59,472
Jeremy.
Your prose struggles for wit.

286
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:04,972
Overall, you style is sluggish, at best.
And contains absolutely nothing that

287
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:07,772
your average Joe with a typewriter couldn't produce.

288
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:19,473
He punched me in the nose.
You'll live. I'll drive.

289
00:26:26,472 --> 00:26:29,172
You...... shall carry us to.......

290
00:26:36,472 --> 00:26:38,671
No..

291
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:41,771
Oh my god! Weldon.. Please.. Please.. No!

292
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:43,772
Weldon!

293
00:26:58,572 --> 00:27:01,271
That was great, wasn't it?

294
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:04,671
You are completely out of your mind.
You know what, right?

295
00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:08,871
Don't you feel it?
Feel what?

296
00:27:08,872 --> 00:27:11,771
Oh God!
Life!

297
00:27:14,772 --> 00:27:19,571
Would you sit down? You maniac! God!

298
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:25,970
Ok, I am serious. Stop now.
Break! Break! Wow!

299
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:49,671
Jesus!

300
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:58,370
I'm sorry about your car.
Oh. Shut up.

301
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:03,170
Look, I know maybe I was a little rough on you.

302
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:07,570
A little rough?

303
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:11,170
You think you were a little rough on me?

304
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:13,869
After you sit your dog on me,

305
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:18,070
Tight me up and threw me in the lake?
It was a pond.

306
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,569
Do you really think I am bitter?

307
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,969
Why do you care what I think?
I am just asking.

308
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,869
Everyone around here is afraid to tell me the truth.

309
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,169
Yes, I think you are bitter.

310
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:43,569
And, I think you are rude, insensitive,
dangerous, self-centered,..

311
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,170
Get the Idea.

312
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,669
Look at you.

313
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,369
You are in a jail, the both of you.
It was a matter of honor.

314
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,769
Come on dad, it was a manner of boredom
so you have to go and create trouble.

315
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,769
I don't care too much for your tone.

316
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,968
Remember who is the parent and who is the child.

317
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:11,969
I am a little confused about that myself.
So.. Why don't you remind me, huh?

318
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:18,068
Are you ok?

319
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,369
No.

320
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:35,568
I am gonna have some people up at the house. Tomorrow.

321
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:39,968
Why don't you come by?
I thought you didn't like me.

322
00:29:39,969 --> 00:29:44,869
I don't. but I dislike you less than I did yesterday.

323
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:13,967
Ciao, Isabella. Weldon?
(Italian)

324
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:17,866
Hi!

325
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:21,666
Still mad?

326
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:26,166
Someone could have got killed yesterday.

327
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:28,966
In all fairness , it wasn't entirely your father's fault.

328
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:31,966
Exactly. He gets into enough trouble on his own.

329
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:34,966
He doesn't need help from anyone.
Ugh.. look, I am sorry, but

330
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:38,466
Ian McBain was saying that he is all dried out and
living on past glories.

331
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:41,666
I couldn't just stand there and let him say those things.

332
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:47,366
I love my father very much.
But tell me.

333
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:50,565
Which part of the statement isn't true?

334
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:54,665
-That's an aweful cruel thing to say about
your own father. Don't you think?

335
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:57,165
Really?
Well, yes.

336
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:00,265
None of my business.
No, I know what you see.

337
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:04,265
You see the great Weldon Parish.
A man's man.

338
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:07,865
A man who lives the life on his terms,
and others de damned.

339
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:12,465
But you don't have to pick up the pieces.

340
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:17,965
You don't have to watch a man
who was once strong and gentle,

341
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:20,465
Slowly destroying himself.

342
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:28,966
How long it's been like that?
Since the day he stops writing.

343
00:32:29,766 --> 00:32:31,565
Are you saying you think he still wants to write?

344
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:33,965
Of course, he wants to write.

345
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:37,465
Then why doesn't he?
Because he is afraid.

346
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:44,465
He is afraid that what was once great
about him is gone.

347
00:32:45,565 --> 00:32:48,565
He is afraid that Ian McBain is right.

348
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:05,664
Jeremy, these are my two other daughters,
Dinnie and Maura.

349
00:33:05,665 --> 00:33:08,464
Pleasure to meet you both.
Jeremy Taylor.

350
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:10,365
Bon appetito. (Italian)

351
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:12,364
Appetito. Appetito. (Italian)

352
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:17,464
I didn't see you at the mass
this morning, Mr. Taylor.

353
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:21,964
Oh, are you Catholic?
No, I am not.

354
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:26,964
Be careful, he'll try to convert you.
I know. He's already tried, actually.

355
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:31,364
But does it matter what religion we are?
In the end, we all die.

356
00:33:31,365 --> 00:33:33,764
There's this shocking defect that one day,

357
00:33:33,765 --> 00:33:39,864
we will all be rotten corpses,
in the dark, demp, creek.

358
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:49,263
Cheers.

359
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,363
So, what is it you do? Mr. Taylor?

360
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:57,063
Why don't you all stop picking at him and let him eat?

361
00:33:58,064 --> 00:33:59,464
He is a book editor.

362
00:34:06,264 --> 00:34:12,164
Yes. He is a book editor.
I am sitting next to a book editor.

363
00:34:14,164 --> 00:34:20,364
Please. Try to make a bribe, my son.
God gave you a tremendous talent.

364
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:29,862
It's true.

365
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:35,362
This... No, this time I can't tell you.

366
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:37,562
It's a secret. It's a secret.

367
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:42,062
Buon Giorno. (Good day.)
Buon Giorno. (Good day.)

368
00:34:42,963 --> 00:34:48,362
(Italian)

369
00:34:48,363 --> 00:34:50,462
Jeremy, this is Amalia.

370
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:52,162
Pleasure to meet you.
How do you do.

371
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:56,962
Weldon.

372
00:34:57,663 --> 00:35:00,662
That's the bill for my car repairs.

373
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:04,262
I noticed one of my cows was missing this morning.

374
00:35:04,263 --> 00:35:05,962
You wouldn't know anything about it.

375
00:35:05,963 --> 00:35:10,462
I've got it. for safe keeping.
So this is settled.

376
00:35:10,463 --> 00:35:13,762
You stole my cow.
Call it collateral.

377
00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:16,062
Excuses me.
Oh. Hello, Amalia.

378
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:17,063
Hello, Ian.

379
00:35:17,163 --> 00:35:21,362
Oh, you are looking very beautiful today.
Can I speak to you in private for a moment?

380
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:22,762
I am busy.

381
00:35:22,763 --> 00:35:24,662
Well, I just came by to ask if you'd... ugh..

382
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:27,261
If you'd like to go to the town party with me.

383
00:35:27,262 --> 00:35:30,161
I can't. I am going with Weldon.

384
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,861
It's news to me.

385
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:36,561
One of these days you are gonna
push me too far, Weldon.

386
00:35:36,562 --> 00:35:39,762
Yeah? Well, lets hope you are
standing by a cliff when I do.

387
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,061
What?
Get dressed.

388
00:36:06,062 --> 00:36:09,361
What?
Get dressed.

389
00:36:09,362 --> 00:36:12,261
Get dressed... Get dressed...

390
00:36:13,262 --> 00:36:15,761
Seriously, what are we doing?

391
00:36:15,862 --> 00:36:19,761
(....)

392
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:35,760
There you are sweetie.

393
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:38,260
Come to take you home from the bad man.

394
00:36:38,261 --> 00:36:41,160
Weldon, I am not stealing a cow.

395
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:45,760
This is my cow.
I can't steal something I already own.

396
00:36:45,761 --> 00:36:49,360
Then why do you need me here for?
You can be a litttle tempermental.

397
00:36:49,361 --> 00:36:52,160
I'm gonna need you to get behind her
and give her a little push.

398
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:54,461
No, no way.

399
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,160
I understand that cow'd be Ian's?

400
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,059
What's this?
What does it look like?

401
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,359
No, I mean, that's it for?
For you to get rid of that computer.

402
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,759
Why? Computer makes it easier.

403
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,359
Writing is not supposed to be easy,
supposed to be hard.

404
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,659
Typewriters make you think about
the words you choose more carefully

405
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,459
because you can't erase them with the
push of a button.

406
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:31,858
Do you konw how?
I don't dance.

407
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:34,658
I'll teach you.
No... no.. no.. Look.

408
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:37,158
You don't want to write,
I don't want to dance, ok?

409
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:40,458
So if I would write, you would dance?

410
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:44,759
Maybe?
I don't wanna dance with you that bad.

411
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:53,758
Now, everybody has their price, Weldon,
and it has to be something you want.

412
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:59,358
What's your price? What would you do
to get me to write a book for you?

413
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,857
Well, for starters,
I could offer you a large advance.

414
00:39:02,858 --> 00:39:04,657
I don't need money.

415
00:39:05,658 --> 00:39:09,058
Ok, but there has to be
something that you want.

416
00:39:14,058 --> 00:39:16,357
I want you to kiss my ass.

417
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:19,857
No, seriously.

418
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,457
I am serious.

419
00:39:24,258 --> 00:39:26,057
I am going to drop my drawers.

420
00:39:26,058 --> 00:39:29,257
And if you kiss my ass in front of everybody,

421
00:39:29,258 --> 00:39:31,757
I'll sign the contract.

422
00:39:35,658 --> 00:39:38,257
OK.
Oh my god. Wow. Wow. Wow.

423
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:41,257
No, not okey. Not okey at all.

424
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:47,857
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.
I wouldn't call that much of a chance.

425
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:50,257
All you had to do was use your imagination.

426
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:54,957
Pretend I was a beautiful woman.
1/3 of a second.

427
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:57,957
We all would have known how much you wanted it.

428
00:40:07,257 --> 00:40:10,956
OK, fine. I'll do it.
Huh, too late.

429
00:40:10,957 --> 00:40:13,256
What?
Too late.

430
00:40:13,257 --> 00:40:18,257
Life is about seizing the moment,
and you just let this book slit by.

431
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:28,056
That was a shady trick you pulled on me back there.

432
00:40:28,657 --> 00:40:31,756
You know what your problem is?
you are too anal.

433
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:34,956
I am not the one who asked you to kiss my ass.

434
00:40:37,057 --> 00:40:39,156
You knew I wouldn't do it, didn't you?

435
00:40:39,157 --> 00:40:40,656
Of course.

436
00:40:40,657 --> 00:40:43,756
You are far too concerned with what
a room full of strangers might think of you,

437
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:46,756
to do anything foolish or spontaneous.

438
00:40:46,757 --> 00:40:50,056
Well, that's called restrained.
Boring.

439
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:52,955
Perhaps. But it's better than
being a lunatic.

440
00:40:52,956 --> 00:40:55,855
Everybody needs a lunacy.

441
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:58,055
It's what frees us from
the pain in this world.

442
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:01,355
There is a wild man inside you, Jeremy.

443
00:41:01,356 --> 00:41:04,055
I can see him in your eyes.
Why don't you let him out?

444
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:05,555
You might like him.

445
00:41:06,356 --> 00:41:09,656
If he's anything like you,
I'll think I'll keep him locked up. Thanks.

446
00:41:42,456 --> 00:41:44,555
Look, would you mind trying to putting on your pants?

447
00:41:44,556 --> 00:41:47,454
I am not really comfortable
standing next to a naked man.

448
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:49,254
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.

449
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,754
I used to come here with my wife.

450
00:42:08,555 --> 00:42:10,154
She loved this place.

451
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:15,354
She'd spend hours just....shhhh.

452
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:21,054
Back then I never had time for the little things.

453
00:42:22,655 --> 00:42:24,654
I was always so afraid I....

454
00:42:25,755 --> 00:42:29,555
wouldn't get a thought down
or I'd forget a line of dialogue.

455
00:42:32,555 --> 00:42:36,455
when the police came to tell me that her car had...

456
00:42:39,954 --> 00:42:42,854
After that nothing mattered.

457
00:42:46,954 --> 00:42:49,853
And now I wish I could go back.

458
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:52,853
Just for one day.

459
00:42:55,754 --> 00:42:59,053
Time is a precious thing, Jeremy.

460
00:42:59,054 --> 00:43:03,954
And the years teach much was today's living new.

461
00:44:59,852 --> 00:45:01,451
Jeremy.

462
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:04,951
Oh.. Hi.

463
00:45:05,752 --> 00:45:09,051
Weldon told me tell you
to be at this place at five.

464
00:45:10,852 --> 00:45:12,451
Um... What? Five?

465
00:45:12,552 --> 00:45:14,852
Five.
OK. Fine. Five.

466
00:45:18,752 --> 00:45:21,850
She is beautiful, isn't she?

467
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:25,250
Who?
Who?

468
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:27,650
That's a good one.

469
00:45:30,951 --> 00:45:33,350
Are you still mad at me?
No.

470
00:45:33,351 --> 00:45:36,450
My father told me it wasn't your fault.

471
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:41,950
That's right. It really wasn't.
Who?

472
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:46,950
What's that?
I have no idea.

473
00:45:48,551 --> 00:45:52,950
Would you care to take a seat?
Sure. OK.

474
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:54,250
OK.

475
00:45:56,951 --> 00:46:01,350
You are writing.
Well, trying.

476
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:04,550
Well, that's say..
I am looking for inspiration.

477
00:46:04,551 --> 00:46:06,950
You.. finding anything?

478
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:14,050
Em... Yes.
I think I am starting to.

479
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,350
Are you missing London?

480
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,549
No.

481
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,449
Actually, No. I am not, really.

482
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,149
Your family?

483
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,249
Well, I don't have too much family left.
Both of my parents died when I was 16 years old,

484
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,549
and I moved to London to live with my aunt,
but she passed 3 years ago.

485
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,649
I am so sorry.

486
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,449
Eh, well, you didn't know.
Thank you.

487
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:50,249
You have a girlfriend?
No.

488
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,550
I did, but you know...
Those things go. Didn't work out.

489
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,649
Come on, that's not fair.

490
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:04,849
You don't speak any Italian, huh?
No, not a word.

491
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,249
No.
No.

492
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,748
Well, if I can ever help you...

493
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:14,648
Well, actually, since you've offered. There are
a couple of words i've been meaning to learn.

494
00:47:14,649 --> 00:47:16,548
For instance, beautiful.

495
00:47:17,449 --> 00:47:19,048
"Bello."

496
00:47:19,049 --> 00:47:20,948
"Bello."
Mm.

497
00:47:20,949 --> 00:47:22,248
Okey.

498
00:47:22,249 --> 00:47:24,348
And, lips.

499
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:29,948
"Labbia."
Right.

500
00:47:30,449 --> 00:47:32,749
Now, just a kiss.

501
00:47:37,549 --> 00:47:40,248
That's enough Italian for one day, huh?

502
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:43,848
Okey. Okey.

503
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:46,749
I'll see you later.
Oh, yeah.

504
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:01,348
Describe it to me.

505
00:48:02,649 --> 00:48:04,247
Now?

506
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,747
What you're looking at.
Describe it to me.

507
00:48:08,148 --> 00:48:12,547
Well, it's sun setting.. huh..
green the hills, and..

508
00:48:12,548 --> 00:48:15,348
No, describe it to me as if you are writing it.

509
00:48:20,748 --> 00:48:24,647
The sun.. droppin in behind a...

510
00:48:24,648 --> 00:48:30,548
The sun dropped?
English is your first language, isn't it?

511
00:48:33,048 --> 00:48:35,847
I can't think on the spot like this.

512
00:48:35,848 --> 00:48:40,848
Jeremy, anyone can use words.
It's called talking,

513
00:48:42,248 --> 00:48:46,447
but writers arrange them in a way so that
they'll take on that beauty in their form.

514
00:48:47,148 --> 00:48:53,048
Think of words as... colors.
and paper is the canvas.

515
00:48:56,048 --> 00:48:59,346
Alright. Well, if it's really that easy,
why don't you try painting it?

516
00:49:01,047 --> 00:49:04,046
Sorry. I realized you don't want to do that.

517
00:49:05,547 --> 00:49:07,346
You are right.

518
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:14,746
What if I... did do it..

519
00:49:17,047 --> 00:49:19,446
I'd probably say something like...

520
00:49:21,847 --> 00:49:23,346
The sunset...

521
00:49:25,447 --> 00:49:26,846
slowly

522
00:49:27,947 --> 00:49:32,547
igniting the sky and fiery shades of reded orange.

523
00:49:34,647 --> 00:49:39,546
In the distance, dark clouds rolled over the horizen,

524
00:49:39,547 --> 00:49:42,247
riding the summer winds.

525
00:49:46,147 --> 00:49:49,146
Soon, day will give away to night,

526
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,645
and with it will come..

527
00:49:54,546 --> 00:49:57,746
the sun as that washes over everything.

528
00:53:44,242 --> 00:53:46,041
"Italian"

529
00:53:46,642 --> 00:53:48,641
For my size.

530
00:53:50,842 --> 00:53:53,341
Gracie. (Thank you.).

531
00:53:55,342 --> 00:53:57,141
And this?

532
00:53:57,142 --> 00:54:00,341
No. No. (Italian.)

533
00:54:02,942 --> 00:54:04,341
OK. OK.

534
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:06,442
Perfect.

535
00:54:15,642 --> 00:54:17,641
(Italian)

536
00:54:17,642 --> 00:54:22,041
I was wondering if you were coming.
When have I ever missed the monday night.

537
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,840
What is this?
Karaoke night.

538
00:54:24,841 --> 00:54:27,140
What do you think?

539
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:30,240
You guys actually do this?
Yeah.

540
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:32,340
And so do you.

541
00:54:32,341 --> 00:54:34,740
Oh, no. No way.
You'll be fine.

542
00:54:34,741 --> 00:54:37,640
No, no. Seriously, I won't do it.
You just need a couple of drinks.

543
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:41,041
I don't care how many drinks you put in me,
I am not getting up and singing.

544
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,239
(Italian)

545
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,339
Jeremy, is that you?

546
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,939
Yes, sir. It's me.

547
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:54,239
Any progress in this Parish affair?
A little, yeah.

548
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,739
Well, what seems to be the problem?

549
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:03,139
Well, he seems to think that he doesn't
want to write, but I think that he does.

550
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,539
Do you think he genuinely like you?

551
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,739
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

552
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,539
Good. Use it. Anything is possible.

553
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:15,838
Get him to see that his writing
is in everyone's best interest.

554
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:19,238
Well, what if writing really
isn't in his best interest?

555
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:23,138
Jeremy, the funtion of business
is to get things done.

556
00:56:23,139 --> 00:56:26,838
That is what you are there for.
To get things done.

557
00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:28,439
Now, do it.

558
00:56:34,539 --> 00:56:38,538
Ok, well. I understand what you are saying
that writing comes from experience.

559
00:56:38,539 --> 00:56:40,338
But even after you've experienced something,

560
00:56:40,339 --> 00:56:42,238
you still got to get it down on a page.

561
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:45,338
That's called talent.

562
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:51,438
Weldon. The other day, when you
describe the sunset, that was great.

563
00:56:51,439 --> 00:56:56,338
No, it was. That was great.
And I gotta tell you, I think it would really..
It would be helpful for me

564
00:56:56,339 --> 00:57:01,639
if you could... I don't know...
Throw something like that down on a page and,
and just... just let me see it, you know?

565
00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:03,938
What are you doing?

566
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:07,437
Nothing.
We had a deal, remember?

567
00:57:07,438 --> 00:57:10,737
We would talk about writing.
Not about me writing.

568
00:57:10,738 --> 00:57:12,637
Right. No, I just wanna...
I know what you want.

569
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:15,237
What do you think I am, an idiot?

570
00:57:15,238 --> 00:57:18,937
You don't think I know what it would
do for your career if you sign me?

571
00:57:18,938 --> 00:57:21,037
That's not why I am doing this.

572
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:27,537
Alright., we were talking about experience.

573
00:57:27,538 --> 00:57:32,137
If you were writing a fight scene,
It helps if you've been in a fight.

574
00:57:32,138 --> 00:57:35,137
Have you ever been in a fight?
Me? Yeah.

575
00:57:35,138 --> 00:57:37,937
The closest I ever came was getting
punched in the nose the other day.

576
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:43,537
That's pathetic. If you were writing a character
who got.. punched in the stomach.

577
00:57:43,538 --> 00:57:45,137
How would you describe that?

578
00:57:45,138 --> 00:57:47,537
Just use my imagination.

579
00:57:47,538 --> 00:57:50,237
OK. Go ahead. Tell me what you feel like.

580
00:57:52,438 --> 00:57:55,737
I'll double over in pain,
I'll be gasping for breath.

581
00:57:57,038 --> 00:58:00,137
Ugh.. What else?

582
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:01,236
Well, I don't know.

583
00:58:04,837 --> 00:58:06,036
Ok, now.

584
00:58:06,037 --> 00:58:09,336
You got the doubling over and
gasping for air part right.

585
00:58:09,337 --> 00:58:13,036
But it's also that breath sensation you got.
The pounding in your head,

586
00:58:13,037 --> 00:58:15,536
the weak legs and tearing eyes.

587
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:19,136
Oh, notice this snot hanging out of your nose.

588
00:58:19,937 --> 00:58:22,536
There is a feeling that you'll never
gonna breath again and then...

589
00:58:22,537 --> 00:58:25,237
you lung is filled with cool fresh air.

590
00:58:29,637 --> 00:58:31,536
That's experience.

591
00:58:33,737 --> 00:58:36,537
Stop trying to manipulate me.

592
00:59:01,136 --> 00:59:03,635
Father, am I disturbing you?

593
00:59:03,636 --> 00:59:07,035
No. No. No, my son.

594
00:59:07,036 --> 00:59:12,136
I, I was just preparing the sacraments
for the evening prayer.

595
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:17,235
I, I've been expecting you.

596
00:59:17,236 --> 00:59:19,735
You have?
yes.

597
00:59:20,436 --> 00:59:27,036
I am a priest, and part of my job
is to help those who need it.

598
00:59:29,136 --> 00:59:32,636
You wish to speak about Weldon and writing.

599
00:59:43,536 --> 00:59:45,335
So. How do I reach him?

600
00:59:46,236 --> 00:59:48,034
Do you believe in fate?

601
00:59:50,835 --> 00:59:53,634
I'm... father.. I don't know.

602
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:55,234
I do.

603
00:59:55,235 --> 01:00:00,734
I believe that each of us are
predestined to walk a path in life.

604
01:00:00,735 --> 01:00:03,334
Along this path, we meet others.

605
01:00:03,335 --> 01:00:07,434
And through knowing them,
we changed their lives.

606
01:00:08,935 --> 01:00:12,534
Ok, but...what does that have to do with
Weldon and writing?

607
01:00:13,935 --> 01:00:17,734
There's an old story about a bird
who loved to fly.

608
01:00:17,735 --> 01:00:22,134
One day, while it was high up in the air,

609
01:00:22,135 --> 01:00:27,334
it began to rain. And its
feathers became so heavy

610
01:00:27,335 --> 01:00:31,434
that when it tried to land, it broke its wing.

611
01:00:32,135 --> 01:00:35,934
Time past, and the bird became better.

612
01:00:35,935 --> 01:00:40,434
It wanted to fly, but
no matter how hard it tried,

613
01:00:40,435 --> 01:00:44,833
Something inside stopped
it from leaving the ground.

614
01:00:44,834 --> 01:00:48,533
Day after day, it tried.
And day after day.

615
01:00:48,534 --> 01:00:51,533
it's fear, held it down.

616
01:00:51,534 --> 01:00:54,633
Then one day, a strong wind came,

617
01:00:54,634 --> 01:00:58,233
and lifted high into the sky.

618
01:00:58,234 --> 01:01:03,733
It opened its wings, and
realized that it could fly.

619
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:05,933
I got. I do.

620
01:01:05,934 --> 01:01:08,933
Weldon is the bird and he
is afriad to fly, right?

621
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:15,334
No, Jeremy. Weldon is the bird,
and you are the wind.

622
01:01:16,634 --> 01:01:20,234
That is the path, fate's chosen for you.

623
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:48,232
Hi.

624
01:01:48,433 --> 01:01:50,633
Hello.

625
01:01:58,533 --> 01:02:02,632
Father Moretti tells me you had
a nice little chat today.

626
01:02:02,633 --> 01:02:06,633
Obviously, I didn't punch you
in the stomach hard enough.

627
01:02:10,233 --> 01:02:12,632
I need to apologize for earlier.

628
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:15,432
Look, I only went to speak
with Father Moretti

629
01:02:15,633 --> 01:02:18,732
because I... I didn't understand what happ....

630
01:02:20,533 --> 01:02:23,932
This is my manuel script.
I know.

631
01:02:23,933 --> 01:02:25,332
Where did you get this?

632
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:29,332
I went to the hotel and told Gustav
you wanted me to get it for you.

633
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:33,231
You had no right to do that, Weldon.

634
01:02:34,432 --> 01:02:36,631
You've got talent, Jeremy.

635
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:41,231
You are a good writer.

636
01:02:41,232 --> 01:02:44,231
The problem is you don't
trust your talent.

637
01:02:44,232 --> 01:02:49,232
You don't believe you could find that
part of you that has something to say.

638
01:02:51,132 --> 01:02:56,031
But... how do I know when I found it?

639
01:02:56,032 --> 01:02:59,231
What do you mean?
There is no mistake in it.

640
01:02:59,232 --> 01:03:02,031
I know there is a lot of time
and effort put into those pages.

641
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:05,031
Have enough faith in yourself to let them go.

642
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:08,232
Take what you've learned from
them and start again.

643
01:03:46,231 --> 01:03:48,030
Ciao.

644
01:03:51,731 --> 01:03:57,631
"Italian"

645
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:02,830
I have abosutely no idea what
you just said, but sounds good.

646
01:04:02,831 --> 01:04:06,130
Want some company?
Sure, come.

647
01:04:06,731 --> 01:04:09,730
Rid the horses, ha?
Uhuh.

648
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:40,030
Jesus, I am gonna die.

649
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:48,829
When was the last time you were on a horse?

650
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:54,729
That's see... Last time I was on a horse was...

651
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,929
That would be never.

652
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:00,029
Never?
Yes, never.

653
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:03,629
Why did you come?
Well, it's a new experience. ...

654
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:06,630
I think I've no experiences lately.

655
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:13,929
Ooh... Wow...

656
01:05:22,829 --> 01:05:25,028
So how was the writing go?

657
01:05:28,329 --> 01:05:32,028
Um... I don't know actually.

658
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:37,628
I am really starting to question
wheather or not I have what it takes.

659
01:05:37,629 --> 01:05:41,028
Oh, yes. Self-doubt.

660
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:44,328
It is a common theme with creative people.

661
01:05:44,329 --> 01:05:47,528
Do you find a lot of creative people are...

662
01:05:47,529 --> 01:05:49,428
Crazy?
Yes, crazy.

663
01:05:49,429 --> 01:05:52,128
Of course they are crazy.

664
01:05:52,129 --> 01:05:54,828
There are thousands of writers, artists.

665
01:05:54,829 --> 01:05:59,128
For most of them, the dreams were never come true.

666
01:05:59,129 --> 01:06:01,328
You have to be crazy.

667
01:06:02,629 --> 01:06:07,628
Well, thanks, Weldon. That's very encouraging.
No.. that's the reality, Jeremy.

668
01:06:07,629 --> 01:06:13,528
Art is not something you choose to do.
It's something that chooses you.

669
01:06:14,828 --> 01:06:18,127
Why did you want to become a writer?

670
01:06:19,528 --> 01:06:24,127
Because... I think that I..
No, it's not something you think.

671
01:06:24,228 --> 01:06:30,128
It's something you know.
Tell me when you know the answer.

672
01:06:36,528 --> 01:06:40,327
It's amazing how much she lives like her mother.

673
01:06:40,328 --> 01:06:43,928
Sometimes I walk into her room
and for a moment I'd think...

674
01:06:50,128 --> 01:06:54,127
Describe her to me.
Come on, not this again.

675
01:06:54,128 --> 01:06:58,028
Just do it, will you?

676
01:07:08,027 --> 01:07:13,726
Sun light frames her body and
golden glow of honey light.

677
01:07:13,727 --> 01:07:19,526
All the wind dances gently
through the long strands of her hair.

678
01:07:19,527 --> 01:07:23,726
Her face is strong, proud,

679
01:07:23,727 --> 01:07:29,426
With eyes that don't easily away their secrets.

680
01:07:29,427 --> 01:07:35,227
It's a face that doesn't call out,
with softly beckons.

681
01:07:39,227 --> 01:07:41,226
How was that?

682
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:45,227
You tell me.

683
01:07:54,827 --> 01:07:56,526
By the way,

684
01:07:56,527 --> 01:07:59,126
How long have you been
in love with my daughter?

685
01:08:37,726 --> 01:08:43,626
"Italian"

686
01:08:44,126 --> 01:08:46,525
Ciao, Weldon.
Ciao.

687
01:08:48,926 --> 01:08:50,224
What?

688
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:54,724
You two are the couple next door?

689
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:59,324
Are you ready for the party?

690
01:09:00,725 --> 01:09:03,625
Yeah.

691
01:09:50,724 --> 01:09:55,523
I was not stealing.
I was accepting charity.

692
01:09:55,524 --> 01:10:01,324
Weldon. It's going to be a late night.
Why don't you all stay at the hotel?

693
01:10:04,624 --> 01:10:07,123
Half price, of course.

694
01:10:08,624 --> 01:10:10,824
Ok, free.

695
01:12:53,221 --> 01:12:55,520
You were gone when I woke up this morning.

696
01:12:57,921 --> 01:12:59,820
You had a dream.

697
01:13:01,621 --> 01:13:04,220
That's funny cause it felt pretty real to me.

698
01:13:06,521 --> 01:13:10,220
Yes, but last night was last night.

699
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:14,120
What exactly does that mean?

700
01:13:15,221 --> 01:13:18,620
Means I wanted to see how I felt with you.

701
01:13:19,721 --> 01:13:21,319
And how did you feel?

702
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,619
Jeremy....

703
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,819
We live in different worlds, ha?

704
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,719
There is no reason why you
couldn't come and live in my world.

705
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,819
Do I look like I belong in London?

706
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:42,819
My life is here, with my
family and my horses.

707
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,619
Isabella, I don't want to just
let this slip away.

708
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,319
I know...

709
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,619
I am sorry. I...

710
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:59,720
I just wanted to share something with you.

711
01:14:47,419 --> 01:14:53,218
It is a god damn pitty, Weldon.
Your daughter is a wonderful girl.

712
01:14:53,219 --> 01:14:57,018
Yes, she is.
Yeah, she is.

713
01:14:58,519 --> 01:15:01,118
What was god thinking
when he created women?

714
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:07,418
He was probably trying to
make up for creating us.

715
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:09,818
You think?

716
01:15:09,819 --> 01:15:14,617
True. I mean most of us are smelly, hairy morons,

717
01:15:14,618 --> 01:15:16,717
with one foot out of the cave.

718
01:15:16,718 --> 01:15:21,417
But women, that's where god outdid himself.

719
01:15:21,418 --> 01:15:24,217
Yes, he certainly did.

720
01:15:24,218 --> 01:15:28,517
I mean, of all the things he created,
what could be more perfect than a woman?

721
01:15:28,518 --> 01:15:31,517
Nothings come to mind.

722
01:15:33,018 --> 01:15:37,017
The curve of their necks,
the small of their backs,

723
01:15:37,018 --> 01:15:39,617
softness of the skin,

724
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:45,217
breasts of the multitude of
the shapes and sizes.

725
01:15:45,218 --> 01:15:50,117
I tell you, Jeremy. If I were
a woman, I'd be a lesbian.

726
01:15:50,818 --> 01:15:53,517
Now, there is a good idea.

727
01:15:53,518 --> 01:15:57,817
Me, too. I think I'll be a lesbian, too.
Is that ok? Can I be a lesbian?

728
01:15:57,818 --> 01:16:01,218
Sure. Sure.

729
01:16:05,217 --> 01:16:08,216
You Wanna know what my problem really is?

730
01:16:08,217 --> 01:16:09,816
I am afraid.

731
01:16:11,517 --> 01:16:12,816
Of what?

732
01:16:14,317 --> 01:16:19,817
Of life, of love. Everything.

733
01:16:21,217 --> 01:16:24,016
I won't mind the vila, Weldon.

734
01:16:24,017 --> 01:16:27,016
one grow grapes and write great novels.

735
01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:30,016
So what's stopping you.

736
01:16:32,017 --> 01:16:33,216
Fear.

737
01:16:34,217 --> 01:16:37,416
Fears. I mean, I have built this whole
for myself in London. I..

738
01:16:37,417 --> 01:16:40,016
I don't think I can just change.

739
01:16:42,017 --> 01:16:43,616
Well, Jeremy.

740
01:16:44,617 --> 01:16:49,616
Most people are perfectly content,
living in their dreary little worlds.

741
01:16:49,617 --> 01:16:54,116
They just clinch to the edge of the toilet bowl,
trying to keep their heads above water

742
01:16:54,117 --> 01:16:57,216
hoping some fool will come along
to pull the chain.

743
01:16:58,117 --> 01:17:01,915
It's only when you hear that flushing sound
and begin to sly down into the abyss

744
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:04,616
that they'd start taking stock at their lives.

745
01:17:10,116 --> 01:17:13,015
What about the people who are so
comfortable in their suffering?

746
01:17:13,016 --> 01:17:15,816
They don't even know that the chain has been pulled.

747
01:17:21,016 --> 01:17:23,215
I know that you wanna write, Weldon.

748
01:17:23,216 --> 01:17:26,715
You just can't leave it alone, can you?

749
01:17:26,716 --> 01:17:29,415
No. No, I can't.

750
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:31,415
But tell me I am wrong.

751
01:17:31,416 --> 01:17:35,415
Weldon, look me in the eye,
and tell me that you don't want to write.

752
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:37,015
I don't want to write.

753
01:17:37,016 --> 01:17:38,615
You know what I think?

754
01:17:38,616 --> 01:17:40,515
I think that you miss it.
No.

755
01:17:40,516 --> 01:17:43,015
I think that all the drinking,
and all the crazniess,

756
01:17:43,016 --> 01:17:45,415
is just your way of covering it up
what's missing in your life.

757
01:17:45,416 --> 01:17:48,715
Right.
And everybody knows it, Weldon. everybody.

758
01:17:48,716 --> 01:17:50,415
Your daughters know it;
Father Moretti knows it;

759
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:53,914
Gustavo knows it; I know it;
but what's worse, is you know it.

760
01:17:53,915 --> 01:17:57,314
Tell me, hot shot.
You think knowing me a couple of weeks,

761
01:17:57,315 --> 01:17:59,414
and living 25 years of a sheltered

762
01:17:59,415 --> 01:18:01,614
existances gives you a right
to tell me how to live my life?

763
01:18:01,615 --> 01:18:05,014
25 years or 25 minutes.
The truth is still the truth.

764
01:18:05,015 --> 01:18:09,914
My life is fine the way it is!
I do what I want when I want.

765
01:18:09,915 --> 01:18:12,614
I pick a few grapes once a year.
That's all I have to do.

766
01:18:12,615 --> 01:18:16,014
I was just a writer, for god's sake.

767
01:18:16,015 --> 01:18:18,214
That's all I was.

768
01:18:18,215 --> 01:18:22,314
I didn't cure a cancer,
I didn't walk on the moon.

769
01:18:22,315 --> 01:18:26,214
The world isn't gonna stop spinning
if there isn't a Weldon Parish's novel.

770
01:18:26,215 --> 01:18:29,614
You are right, it won't.
But maybe yours will start again.

771
01:18:29,615 --> 01:18:31,414
And you are a writer, Weldon;

772
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:34,814
is what you are, and you are
a great one at that.

773
01:18:36,615 --> 01:18:41,714
A great writer knows when
he is not a great writer anymore.

774
01:18:41,715 --> 01:18:44,014
So what? He just gives up?

775
01:18:44,015 --> 01:18:46,614
I didn't give anything up.

776
01:18:46,615 --> 01:18:48,813
20 years ago I lost something,

777
01:18:50,814 --> 01:18:53,313
something more important than my writing.

778
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:57,413
How can I explain it to you?
I can't explain it to myself.

779
01:18:57,414 --> 01:19:00,213
Stop it. Just stop.
Stop what?

780
01:19:00,214 --> 01:19:06,114
If you don't want to write, that's fine.
But stop blaming it on your dead wife.

781
01:19:30,714 --> 01:19:33,513
What do you want from me?

782
01:19:33,514 --> 01:19:35,913
You want to prove I am miserable.

783
01:19:35,914 --> 01:19:40,713
I  rarely see you don't want to write, Weldon.
You write every single day.

784
01:19:40,714 --> 01:19:43,412
You just stopped putting the
pen to the page.

785
01:19:43,413 --> 01:19:47,012
Sometimes I've tortured you
this way, that way,

786
01:19:47,013 --> 01:19:51,112
and you find yourself a place you live...

787
01:19:51,113 --> 01:19:53,812
imaging you being...

788
01:19:53,813 --> 01:19:57,812
If we have realized it...
it's too late to go back.

789
01:19:57,813 --> 01:20:00,812
No, it's never too late.

790
01:20:00,813 --> 01:20:02,412
I don't have anything left.

791
01:20:02,413 --> 01:20:05,112
I don't believe you, Weldon.
I can't do it.

792
01:20:05,113 --> 01:20:07,512
And it's bullshit. You knot it.
I can't.

793
01:20:07,513 --> 01:20:09,112
Why?
Because...

794
01:20:09,113 --> 01:20:12,213
Because why?
Because I am afraid.

795
01:20:17,413 --> 01:20:21,112
But Weldon, you are not afraid of writing,

796
01:20:21,113 --> 01:20:23,512
you are afraid of failing.

797
01:20:23,513 --> 01:20:25,412
We all fail.

798
01:20:28,013 --> 01:20:30,413
Courage is in the trying.

799
01:21:05,212 --> 01:21:07,211
Are you alright?

800
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,211
You should have seen me today, Father.

801
01:21:12,212 --> 01:21:16,511
You would have been proud.
I was very clever.

802
01:21:16,512 --> 01:21:18,211
What happened?

803
01:21:21,512 --> 01:21:25,611
I forced Weldon done a road
hitting when I go.

804
01:21:25,612 --> 01:21:29,311
And I am a little afraid of what
he's gonna find at the end of it.

805
01:21:31,911 --> 01:21:37,811
Sometimes it's you messed up something now,
in order to make the something now.

806
01:21:39,111 --> 01:21:43,610
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe the great Weldon Parish,

807
01:21:43,611 --> 01:21:47,110
just simply does that have anything left to say?

808
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:50,810
You don't really belive that, do you?

809
01:21:54,111 --> 01:21:57,110
I know that you think I am a
salvation, but I am not.

810
01:21:57,111 --> 01:21:59,310
I am just not.

811
01:21:59,311 --> 01:22:03,510
Everynight, I go home and
I struggle to write one paragraph

812
01:22:03,511 --> 01:22:07,910
that tells me that I have something,
anything important to say.

813
01:22:07,911 --> 01:22:10,010
And there is a man, who can do it
standing on his head,

814
01:22:10,011 --> 01:22:12,310
and he chooses not to.
He chooses that.

815
01:22:12,311 --> 01:22:15,610
And I am supposed to feel sorry for him?
Well, I am sorry. I don't.

816
01:22:15,611 --> 01:22:18,710
and I know life is dump dump.
but life dumps on all of us, father.

817
01:22:18,711 --> 01:22:22,610
And we move on, we get pass it.
At least most of us do.

818
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:29,209
Look, I am not responsible for Weldon Parish.

819
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:33,409
I only did what I was sent here to do.
And I told him that right from the very beginning.

820
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:35,009
It's not like I lied to him.

821
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:39,410
If that's true, why are you so upset?

822
01:23:31,909 --> 01:23:37,108
Maura, where is everybody?

823
01:23:37,109 --> 01:23:39,309
Still sleeping.

824
01:25:36,007 --> 01:25:41,907
What are you all gawking at? You acted
as if you've never seen me writed before.

825
01:26:15,206 --> 01:26:16,805
You could stay.

826
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:20,205
And do what?

827
01:26:22,006 --> 01:26:23,505
Write?

828
01:26:26,406 --> 01:26:30,706
Besides, I don't think I'd be
the only sad to see you go.

829
01:26:32,606 --> 01:26:34,405
I don't know about that.

830
01:26:36,806 --> 01:26:40,905
Jeremy, what have you got to go back to?

831
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:45,606
My life, my job.

832
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:53,205
I can't just pull up stakes
and move out here, Weldon.

833
01:26:53,206 --> 01:26:54,804
Why not?

834
01:26:56,405 --> 01:26:58,504
I...

835
01:27:01,205 --> 01:27:03,104
I just can't.

836
01:27:05,605 --> 01:27:06,904
Well.

837
01:27:09,605 --> 01:27:12,104
What about the contracts?

838
01:27:12,905 --> 01:27:17,205
What about them?
I can't sign if you don't give them to me.

839
01:27:26,205 --> 01:27:31,705
You know? why don't you just see how it goes?

840
01:27:33,405 --> 01:27:34,804
Uh?

841
01:27:39,105 --> 01:27:41,804
I want you to write the book for yourself.

842
01:27:42,805 --> 01:27:46,704
There is no need for you to have to deal
with the pressures of editors and publishers.

843
01:27:47,705 --> 01:27:50,803
And if you like what you've written;

844
01:27:50,804 --> 01:27:55,004
Then believe me, we will be
happy to publish it.

845
01:28:17,604 --> 01:28:21,003

Isabella?

In Italy we say a good friend is someone who
is there through with the good and the bad.

Si.
Yeah?

And it's because I can't imagine
doing anything else.

That's why I wanna be a writer.

Because I can't imagine doing anything else.

857
01:29:06,003 --> 01:29:08,203
