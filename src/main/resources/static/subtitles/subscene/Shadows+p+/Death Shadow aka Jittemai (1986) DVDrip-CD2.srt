1
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:28,542
It's becoming more interesting.

2
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:16,291
Sir?

3
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,351
I know you're home.

4
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:30,972
I wanted to drink with you.

5
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,270
Well, come on in.

6
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:41,205
I located Sentaro.

7
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:46,321
I got him to tell me where.
Give me some credit, will you?

8
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,590
I won't buy it until I see his face.

9
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,423
You will soon.

10
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:57,958
So I thought, before you do...

11
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:55,086
Boss Hell, you know, don't you?

12
00:02:59,961 --> 00:03:02,054
I've fallen for you.

13
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:59,543
You fell for me?

14
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:05,783
As you can see, I haven't had a woman lately.

15
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:18,801
I'll accept this treat.

16
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:46,354
Help me. Help me please.

17
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,914
A ladies' man's all messed up.

18
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:54,992
Save me. Sis, spare me.

19
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,131
I beg you.
- I will save you.

20
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:02,664
So you've gotta do what I tell you.

21
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:05,497
There.

22
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,043
You befriended that Hell boy, didn't you?

23
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:52,353
I know what's going on.

24
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,656
You wanna take over Denzo the Fang's job...

25
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:59,093
and reign as the boss of the underworld.

26
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:03,030
Even so, I don't think the
65,000 koku Hamada Clan...

27
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,431
would directly deal with someone like you.

28
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:11,498
There must be a go-between.

29
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:15,642
I wanna know who that is.

30
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,634
Say it!

31
00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:31,889
Hell has what you're after.

32
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:38,725
If you want it so badly,
use your body to get it.

33
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:46,370
You see, I was honestly in love with Denzo.

34
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:53,604
Remember, I'll settle
accounts with you one day.

35
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:38,986
Was it you who wanted to see me?

36
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:42,360
Boss Hell, I presume?

37
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:46,493
Aren't you a foxy woman?

38
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:49,537
Ms. O'Ren sent me.

39
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:52,734
It's about Sentaro, isn't it?

40
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:58,612
Well, before we go further, there's
something I want to ask you.

41
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:00,136
What is it?

42
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:03,918
Once you catch Sentaro...

43
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:07,319
you won't need the obi
fastener any more, right?

44
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,891
It's about this again.

45
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:14,528
Well, won't you give it to me?

46
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:16,291
I see.

47
00:10:16,497 --> 00:10:19,432
I bet it looks good on you.

48
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:23,469
But I can't.

49
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:30,273
Everybody wants it so much that
it makes me wanna hold on to it.

50
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:37,049
I knew you'd say that.
You're a tough one to get.

51
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:40,049
It makes me blush.

52
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:47,021
Look, there's the one
you're looking for - Sentaro.

53
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:51,932
You can take all the credit, Boss Hell.

54
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,661
You brat.

55
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:28,851
For real?

56
00:12:30,064 --> 00:12:31,861
For real?

57
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,328
I'm not gonna die!

58
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,665
I don't die!

59
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,101
It hurts.

60
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:47,948
It hurts, it hurts.

61
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:51,907
Damn it! Don't be stupid!

62
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:10,237
Don't be so scared.

63
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:14,037
Hell's dead and is now a mere corpse.

64
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:17,511
Now, I don't need you anymore.

65
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,741
I'll spare your life.

66
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:22,038
Go wherever you wanna.

67
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:28,888
Who is it? Is it O'Ren?

68
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:34,693
I recognize the sword style.

69
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,030
You're Kano-ya, aren't you?

70
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:05,958
I decided to side with you because of her.

71
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:08,762
When you accomplish your
mission and get your reward...

72
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:13,495
please remember your
promise to give her half.

73
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:18,266
I'm worried about my blind girl's future.

74
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,134
They say love is blind, and that's true.

75
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:25,411
I'll even be your spy.

76
00:14:27,114 --> 00:14:29,049
Please understand.

77
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:34,510
I'd gladly give my life for her.

78
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,227
By the way, who took the other half?

79
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:44,098
Kano-ya did. O'Ren's in the picture too.

80
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,867
Things are getting complicated.

81
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:50,938
Well, I can take care of O'Ren.

82
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:55,637
She doesn't yet know I'm working for you.

83
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:19,057
The bitch O'Cho has come out of hiding,
connected our business with Kano-ya.

84
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:25,568
She killed Boss Denzo.

85
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:32,346
We've gotta make a traitor
see what price she has to pay.

86
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:34,048
I know.

87
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,983
After Boss Denzo died...

88
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:41,355
we've all sworn to look up to you
as the boss of the underworld.

89
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,585
Tell us anything you want us to do.

90
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,166
Senzo, you got a problem?

91
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,769
Well, his speech is so sentimental.

92
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:58,238
I'm so not used to it that it tickles me.

93
00:15:58,273 --> 00:15:59,967
What!?

94
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:04,812
A newcomer like you who drifted
from Aioi Kisaburo's family...

95
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:08,315
would never understand the
way we feel about Boss Denzo!

96
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,340
I see. Is that right?

97
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:18,783
Gin, didn't you get arrested for killing
a waitress in Shinagawa half a year ago?

98
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,394
So what?

99
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:22,162
Isn't that weird?

100
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:24,898
How did you come back out now?

101
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:30,704
Were the cops in Denma-cho
so impressed by your loyalty...

102
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,969
that they decided to dismiss
you with no charges?

103
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,177
Sis, I didn't do anything.

104
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:41,239
Please understand. The truth is I...

105
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:50,858
A spy must be punished.

106
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:53,292
You're a disgrace to Denzo's family.

107
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:55,789
Right, sis?

108
00:16:55,996 --> 00:16:58,632
I don't even wanna see it. Get rid of him.

109
00:16:58,667 --> 00:16:59,826
Yes!

110
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:13,875
I found it where Boss Kakizaki was killed.

111
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:18,642
This emblem is of Kano-ya, isn't it?

112
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:22,689
It sure is our emblem.

113
00:17:22,724 --> 00:17:25,359
It belongs to the owner Genshiro.

114
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:26,693
That's the key.

115
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:31,892
Wait! That's why we
wanna negotiate with you.

116
00:17:32,032 --> 00:17:37,868
We're willing to let things slide
depending on how you wanna play it.

117
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:41,041
Pack up 100.

118
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:44,545
We'll wait for you at
Kakinuki Temple at 6 tonight.

119
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,613
Don't act stupid.

120
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:53,109
Our men are standing by, ready for action
if anything happens to either of us.

121
00:17:54,922 --> 00:17:56,981
Thanks for your time.

122
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,891
Don't underestimate me, Hanji from Osaka.

123
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:30,958
I feel bad about Boss Kakizaki...

124
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:33,393
but thanks to him, we've
come upon a money tree.

125
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:34,294
That's right.

126
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:38,458
We can drink 'til our bellies are full, and
sleep with women 'til we drop dead.

127
00:18:41,268 --> 00:18:45,405
I feel bad about Boss Hell,
but we're going to paradise.

128
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,865
Thank Buddha, thank
Buddha... What a good fortune.

129
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:32,451
He really put his foot into it.

130
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:35,155
How could he lose the pill case?

131
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,123
Leave it to me.

132
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:41,984
I'm sheltering Genshiro at
the House of Tricks in Aoyagi.

133
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:45,265
You don't have to worry
about them ever finding him.

134
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,529
It's not his problem alone.

135
00:19:48,502 --> 00:19:50,800
As the police investigation progresses...

136
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:53,732
this place will eventually be exposed.

137
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:58,812
By the way, are you gonna just
ignore the low rank cops who came?

138
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,042
I have no time to be bothered by them.

139
00:20:02,883 --> 00:20:04,407
O'Ren...

140
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:08,683
Do you wanna run away with me?

141
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:15,254
It's stupid to bet one's life
on a future that's uncertain.

142
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:21,230
Before it's too late, we can take
all the money from the safe...

143
00:20:21,535 --> 00:20:23,230
and together we'll...

144
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:37,407
Aikawa Sanosuke, I presume.

145
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:39,186
You're from the Hamada Clan.

146
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,744
It's Master's order!

147
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:52,892
Wait a minute. Wait a minute now.

148
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,694
I have nothing to do with it.

149
00:20:55,936 --> 00:21:01,568
I'm just... He... he hired me for money.

150
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:06,635
Wait a minute! If you kill me, you'll
never get the exemption license back!

151
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:14,921
I have the paper... only half of it.

152
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:18,220
But I know who's got the other half.

153
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:22,362
I can get it for you.

154
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:29,197
So you killed this man...

155
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:31,438
but as long as the paper's floating around...

156
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:34,032
the clan will be in danger.

157
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:36,533
Am I not right?

158
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:41,203
Hire me.

159
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:45,452
I won't complain as long as I get paid when...

160
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:48,615
I get you both pieces of the paper.

161
00:21:49,222 --> 00:21:54,455
I'm an underworld criminal who'll never
be able to walk in the sun anyway.

162
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:58,291
I'll shut up and vanish from your sight.

163
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:00,577
Welcome.

164
00:25:02,482 --> 00:25:08,250
The flower card hanging from Sentaro's
neck had a butterfly on it, which means me.

165
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:10,624
The card was cut in half...

166
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:14,856
which means you wanted to negotiate
with me for the exemption license.

167
00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:18,231
Denzo the Fang used to
use the riddle all the time.

168
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,062
You got it right.

169
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:23,759
C'mon, give me the license.

170
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:28,704
There's one question I
wanna ask you, though.

171
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:33,903
How did you know to cut a card
in half to mean the license?

172
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:36,140
How do you know it was cut in half?

173
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,519
That was a giveaway.

174
00:25:39,554 --> 00:25:42,147
I want the half of the license you have.

175
00:25:43,857 --> 00:25:53,164
How did you expect me to come
carrying the license with me like a fool?

176
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:56,269
You're quite dumb, aren't you?

177
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,761
We already know where you live.

178
00:26:00,206 --> 00:26:03,266
We lured you out here.

179
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:05,335
What?

180
00:26:24,097 --> 00:26:25,291
Yasu.

181
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:31,563
Save me, please.

182
00:26:32,672 --> 00:26:37,666
If I die, O'Tami will be all alone.

183
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:40,943
I beg you please. Spare me.

184
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:45,842
Your beloved wife's probably
waiting for you in heaven by now.

185
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:49,021
O'Tami.

186
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:04,602
O'Tami.

187
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:10,970
How pitiful.

188
00:27:14,647 --> 00:27:21,815
We can do whatever we want with you now.

189
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:29,126
But it's no fun to kill you too quickly.

190
00:27:30,397 --> 00:27:34,697
I'll show you what kind of
tricks this house comes with.

191
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:37,735
Have yourself a ball!

192
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:52,277
Squirm in pain and dry up like a mummy!

193
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:28,081
What is this?

194
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:33,280
As you see, it's the exemption
license you were dying to get.

195
00:29:34,954 --> 00:29:39,914
Except, it's only half of it that O'Cho had.

196
00:29:42,462 --> 00:29:44,330
Don't worry.

197
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:49,597
The other half has already
been in our possession.

198
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:58,805
When O'Cho killed the Hell Cop,
we took it in the nick of time.

199
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:04,908
O'Cho is dead now, probably fuming in hell.

200
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:48,816
Senior Advisor.

201
00:31:49,322 --> 00:31:51,654
Kano-ya Genshiro...

202
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:56,958
We executed Aikawa Sanosuke by
the Master's order the other day.

203
00:31:57,263 --> 00:32:00,824
Kano-ya no longer exists on earth.

204
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:10,009
You exploited your privilege as the
appointed merchant for the Hamada Clan...

205
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:15,174
engaged in illegal trade of smuggling,
and indulged in profiteering.

206
00:32:16,215 --> 00:32:19,651
We know you're guilty. You
cannot make any excuses.

207
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:21,354
Did you hear that?

208
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:27,122
Now that the license has been recovered,
they have no more need for you.

209
00:32:29,062 --> 00:32:33,700
I did it all for the clan, all for the clan.

210
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:35,395
Genshiro...

211
00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:42,363
We must prove our innocence
to the Shogunate. You must die.

212
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:34,493
As you promised.

213
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:38,889
We have nothing to do with you anymore.

214
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:41,889
I'll shut up and disappear.

215
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:44,628
Do shut up.

216
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:48,707
What the hell are you doing?

217
00:33:48,808 --> 00:33:51,177
I figured it'd turn out this way.

218
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:52,378
What?

219
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:54,175
Guys, come on out!

220
00:35:17,663 --> 00:35:18,994
Sis!

221
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:27,636
C'mon, hurry!

222
00:39:25,277 --> 00:39:27,438
Hanae!

223
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,265
O'Cho.

224
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,258
Be still. Don't let the wound open up.

225
00:39:52,538 --> 00:39:54,529
Why?

226
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:56,972
Why did you?

227
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:03,773
Out of pity, or...?

228
00:40:04,216 --> 00:40:07,208
I really don't know.

229
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:12,816
You served your master loyally,
putting your life at risk.

230
00:40:13,025 --> 00:40:16,119
Yet he abandoned you like a dog.

231
00:40:16,629 --> 00:40:18,824
I couldn't stand it.

232
00:40:57,036 --> 00:40:58,663
What's that?

233
00:40:59,238 --> 00:41:01,103
It's goodbye.

234
00:41:01,373 --> 00:41:03,432
I may not come back.

235
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:06,241
Take it and leave town.

236
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:08,681
Where are you going?

237
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,582
It's none of your business where I go.

238
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:15,445
Your ties with the Hamada Clan are severed.

239
00:41:17,189 --> 00:41:21,285
It isn't. The clan is all I've got.

240
00:41:22,428 --> 00:41:24,293
You gotta be kiddin'.

241
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:27,866
They betrayed you. They abandoned you.

242
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:29,333
Shut up!

243
00:41:31,203 --> 00:41:36,004
My entire life was devoted to the clan.

244
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,875
I even let my wife get killed for my loyalty.

245
00:41:42,314 --> 00:41:47,251
If I lose the clan, what would I be?

246
00:41:51,724 --> 00:41:56,362
If you try to obtain the license, I'll
stop you even if I had to risk my life!

247
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:58,163
Don't be stupid!

248
00:41:58,198 --> 00:42:01,530
What did I save your life for then?

249
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,362
I couldn't watch you die.

250
00:42:05,104 --> 00:42:07,800
I wanted you to start a new life.

251
00:42:09,008 --> 00:42:10,441
O'Cho.

252
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,479
Stop me if you want.

253
00:42:16,649 --> 00:42:19,277
You're no longer my enemy.

254
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:22,921
You're as good as dead now.

255
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:25,151
Wait, O'Cho.

256
00:42:25,591 --> 00:42:29,118
Kill me before you go!
Kill me and you can go!

257
00:42:31,563 --> 00:42:33,832
No matter how many samurai come...

258
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:36,699
they can't touch us 'til
they get the license back.

259
00:43:03,562 --> 00:43:06,429
Here's the 3000 ryo as promised.

260
00:43:11,337 --> 00:43:15,000
You made quite a mess
the other day, didn't you?

261
00:43:15,874 --> 00:43:18,536
Don't underestimate us.

262
00:43:20,112 --> 00:43:21,670
Listen...

263
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:29,886
We could use the license to suck the
blood out of the Hamada Clan if we want.

264
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:32,558
Do you mean to say you want to...

265
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:35,060
become the enemy of the
shogun's blood relations?

266
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:37,551
Yeah, you've guessed it.

267
00:43:38,163 --> 00:43:40,393
That's a foolish act.

268
00:43:40,866 --> 00:43:45,667
If we put our force together,
you're nothing to be afraid of.

269
00:43:46,305 --> 00:43:55,771
You'd be better off taking the money
and handing over the license to us.

270
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:57,678
Really?

271
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:02,253
Since you're so puffed
up, we'll let you have it.

272
00:44:11,397 --> 00:44:14,127
Here, take it.

273
00:44:21,273 --> 00:44:23,400
Serves you right!

274
00:44:26,345 --> 00:44:29,075
It's not about the money any more.

275
00:44:29,882 --> 00:44:34,052
We wanna show you the
pride of Denzo's family.

276
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:35,679
Do it, Senzo!

277
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:15,260
Sis, our plan worked!

278
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,718
It was a good idea to get them
up on a boat. Serves them right!

279
00:45:19,097 --> 00:45:20,566
That's right.

280
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:22,830
The Hamada Clan, my ass.

281
00:45:23,068 --> 00:45:25,637
65,000 koku, my ass.

282
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:29,007
Burn, burn! Die in the flame, all of you!

283
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:31,134
Serves you right!

284
00:45:32,511 --> 00:45:35,446
You'll all turn into ashes.

285
00:45:39,551 --> 00:45:41,246
Senzo!

286
00:45:42,654 --> 00:45:45,316
Sis, hurry!

287
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:48,351
Sis, hurry now!

288
00:45:48,861 --> 00:45:52,957
I'm gonna kill you this time around.

289
00:45:54,032 --> 00:45:56,023
Die!

290
00:46:16,855 --> 00:46:19,688
Sis, hang in there.

291
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:25,154
Senzo... Senzo...

292
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:27,931
Sis...

293
00:46:28,066 --> 00:46:30,933
Senzo, don't die...

294
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:05,564
Give me back the license.

295
00:47:08,607 --> 00:47:13,738
If the Shogunate gets it, then
the Hamada Clan would...

296
00:47:13,879 --> 00:47:15,781
Genshiro...

297
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:19,012
Give me back the license. Give it to me!

298
00:47:20,752 --> 00:47:24,916
If you want it, kill me first.

299
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:41,772
You...

300
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:56,214
Genshiro.

301
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:04,859
It must have been hard for you.

302
00:48:07,866 --> 00:48:09,595
I know how you felt.

303
00:48:12,938 --> 00:48:14,838
Genshiro...

304
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:18,806
Genshiro...

305
00:48:26,685 --> 00:48:29,755
Now, now, now, it's a big scandal!

306
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:33,392
The underworld shogun and
Chief of Senior Advisors...

307
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:37,763
Sir Matsudaira Suo-no-kami, died
a happy death lying on top of...

308
00:48:37,798 --> 00:48:42,393
Lady O'Yo's in his Kaji Mansion
in Shiba at midnight last night.

309
00:49:11,396 --> 00:49:13,591
Good work, O'Cho.

310
00:49:16,134 --> 00:49:20,161
It's over now, all of it.

311
00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:26,333
Thank you, O'Cho.

312
00:49:27,312 --> 00:49:30,213
I'll pay you as promised.

313
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:34,845
Don't fret.

314
00:49:35,353 --> 00:49:39,551
O'Cho, you know too much now.

315
00:49:40,525 --> 00:49:45,588
In order to protect the Shogunate,
to protect its security...

316
00:49:46,531 --> 00:49:51,436
you'll have to lose either
your voice or your life.

317
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:53,666
I refuse either option.

318
00:49:54,706 --> 00:49:57,402
I'm not some bug.

319
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:01,310
At last I've learned.

320
00:50:02,514 --> 00:50:04,243
Finally...

321
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:08,109
Finally, I'm beginning to see the truth.

322
00:50:09,454 --> 00:50:12,321
It's you who killed my dad.

323
00:50:13,325 --> 00:50:15,418
And mom.

324
00:50:16,027 --> 00:50:18,359
And O'Tami, and Genshiro.

325
00:50:19,464 --> 00:50:21,955
You killed them all.

326
00:50:23,535 --> 00:50:25,730
My real enemy...

327
00:50:26,538 --> 00:50:28,563
is you!
