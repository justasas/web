1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:18,560
"Bad memories: be yet welcomed...
you are my distant youth..."

2
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,220
The Army of Shadows

3
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:14,820
October 20, 1942

4
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:39,083
- Do you mind if we stop for a while?
- Not at all.

5
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:11,093
It won't take too long.

6
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:13,095
Just some shopping.

7
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:16,098
You have to sort it out for yourself
these days.

8
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:17,099
It's very understandable.

9
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,090
You will be alright in this camp.

10
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:22,104
The best camp in France!

11
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:23,093
This camp was for Germans.

12
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:26,050
I'm not sure I understand.

13
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:29,100
At the beginning of the war, we were
expecting a lot of german prisoners.

14
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:32,080
But of course there were none.

15
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:35,083
However, this camp is very useful now.

16
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,084
What good luck!

17
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,080
You said it!

18
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:33,097
Always the same; don't know who they
are, or how to treat them.

19
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:37,101
Some of them arrive without being charged
and stay forever.

20
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:42,072
Some, who committed crimes,
get out very quickly and become influential...

21
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:46,077
in the department,
or in the Vichy government.

22
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:51,082
Philippe Gerbier, 41 years old.
Engineer.

23
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:59,005
Vivid and independent mind.
Distant and ironic.

24
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:01,091
To subdue.

25
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:06,097
Seems to be influential.
To be treated gently.

26
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,070
Suspected of Gaullist thinking.
To subdue.

27
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:20,077
Set free by lack of evidence:
influential, to be treated gently.

28
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:30,087
The room you are going to
was for german officers.

29
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,091
I'm honored.

30
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:49,073
Certainly to be treated gently...

31
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:53,077
and certainly with caution.

32
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:05,093
Philippe Gerbier

33
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,095
Colonel Jarret Du Plessis

34
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:12,100
I don't know why you are here
but I'll tell you why I was arrested.

35
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,093
I said in a café that
Admiral Darlant was a bastard.

36
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:22,110
And Marechal Petain is a bastard also,
whose treatment of soldiers is reprehensible.

37
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,101
You, Colonel, have the chance
to suffer for your opinions.

38
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,102
Aubert, a druggist.

39
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:29,117
Do you know, Sir,
what a Mallert Shell is?

40
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:30,118
No.

41
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:35,078
It's a component of a
certain chemical reaction.

42
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:39,083
I am a chemist and I had to keep
a Mallert Shell.

43
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:42,097
I was censured for shell possession,

44
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:44,088
and no one would listen to any explications.

45
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,089
Octave Bonnafous.

46
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:49,104
Business man.

47
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:53,097
I unfortunately stumbled into
a Gaullist meeting...

48
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:56,111
No more laws!
Only bastards!

49
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:57,100
They took my pension away!

50
00:07:58,113 --> 00:08:00,115
Where should I settle in?

51
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:07,112
As the room leader, allow me
to assign you this free mattress.

52
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:18,088
I am Legrain, communist.

53
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,091
Here's Armel, teacher and catholic.

54
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:23,104
Is he sleeping?

55
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:24,105
No, he's very sick.

56
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,108
No infirmary?

57
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:26,099
Already full.

58
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:30,111
Do you play dominos?

59
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,100
I'm afraid not.

60
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:33,114
We'll teach you.

61
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:36,117
Thank you, but I would rather not.

62
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:41,111
Excuse us then, but we must finish playing
before they turn off the light.

63
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,090
The Commandant is not as stupid as he looks.

64
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:49,090
He put me in with three idiots
and two lost children.

65
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:30,105
Going for a walk?

66
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:32,096
I'm working in the power station.

67
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,109
Well done!

68
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:38,102
I don't get paid,
but I like it and wish to practice.

69
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,081
See you later, comrade!

70
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:58,099
Are you communist?

71
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:01,090
No, but we're comrades all the same.

72
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:14,104
There are people here
from every country.

73
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:24,080
Russians.

74
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:29,085
Poles.

75
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:36,092
Algerians.

76
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:54,120
Jews from all over,

77
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,089
Gypsies.

78
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:11,094
Yugoslavians.

79
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:15,099
Romanian, Czech.

80
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:20,115
Germans against Nazism,
Italians against Fascism.

81
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:22,106
Spanish against Franco,

82
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:30,114
And some others,
arrested for smuggling.

83
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:45,094
You alright?

84
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:29,105
I managed the installation
of powerlines in Savoie.

85
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,108
You're an electrician?

86
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:37,150
- Just like you.
- Surely you're more qualified than I.

87
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:41,149
Maybe we could talk about it sometime.

88
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:42,118
Of course.

89
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:45,099
With pleasure.

90
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:53,107
The young teacher died one night,
silently.

91
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:58,101
The Algerians carried his body away.
I never heard him speak.

92
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:41,111
I'm not sad.
He's in a better place.

93
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:05,100
All debts will be paid one day.

94
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:07,103
Mister Gerbier.

95
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:13,110
I wish to speak with you tonight.

96
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:41,093
There are two obstacles to escape;
barbed wire and guards.

97
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:44,107
We can pass under the barbed wire,

98
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:49,115
and I can blind the guards
by turning off all the lights.

99
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:52,115
Why haven't you escaped yet?

100
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:57,120
I didn't want to escape alone,
and leave Armelle.

101
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,089
But I trust you.

102
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:02,101
Why are you telling me this?

103
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:05,125
I think you're needed on the outside.

104
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,100
Turn off the light and go to sleep.

105
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:12,101
Good night.

106
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:11,105
Secretly, between us,

107
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:13,107
the escape plan was taking shape.

108
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:15,098
Little by little.

109
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:58,107
Gerbier, come here.

110
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,109
Get ready.

111
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:11,120
Hurry please.

112
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:49,092
Please salute Legrain for me.

113
00:17:57,111 --> 00:17:58,115
- There are the bastards.
- But...

114
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:00,102
Farewell, Sir.

115
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:34,115
Allow me, please.

116
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:35,104
Thanks.

117
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,119
There's just one chance.

118
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:40,123
I'll ask the soldier for something,

119
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:46,129
and then you'll cross the two gates.

120
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,099
Good luck.

121
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:36,105
Excuse me sir, do you have a cigarette?

122
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,136
What do you want?

123
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I'd like a shave.

124
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:01,137
<i>Marechal has said... Marechal has accomplished...</i>
<i>Marechal keeps his promises.</i>

125
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,109
There you go.

126
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,128
I'll get your change.

127
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:37,117
- No wait...
- Wait for your change.

128
00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:45,127
Take this.

129
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:51,132
Not very much, but it's all I have.

130
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:53,135
Thank you.

131
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:12,121
Paul Dounat received orders
from his organization.

132
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:19,120
He had to be in front of
the Marseilles courts

133
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:23,132
at noon, and wait there
for a friend he knew.

134
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:53,129
Police. Papers please.

135
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:04,151
All right.
But follow me anyway.

136
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:05,118
For a simple check.

137
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:45,113
Dirty job.

138
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:49,129
Felix, put on your hat.

139
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:51,120
No need in the car.

140
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:57,126
This is the guy who betrayed you.

141
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:03,132
I don't think there's any need to question you.

142
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:18,114
We should have refused him.
It's my fault.

143
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:22,129
So much to do,
and such little help.

144
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:24,120
Bison, faster please.

145
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:27,134
They'll notice us.

146
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:32,128
I'm also in a hurry.
I have to repair a radio, 

147
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:38,145
and a young agent's bicycle.
And prepare tonight's reception.

148
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:40,147
Do you have the fake papers?

149
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:43,139
Yes, do you want them now?

150
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,110
The car must stay here.

151
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,150
It might be noticed.

152
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,100
- We'll take a walk.
- I'll come with you.

153
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,147
Not necessary.

154
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,136
Indeed.

155
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,142
I suppose not.

156
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:32,131
I'll pick you up later tonight.

157
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:04,145
One false move, and I shoot you.

158
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:24,151
Hell, when we rented this house,
the other one was empty!

159
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:25,140
Let's go anyway.

160
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:36,129
This way.

161
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,110
Is he the traitor that we're supposed to...

162
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:40,121
Yes, he is.

163
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:42,123
And are you the boss?

164
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:55,148
He is Claude LeMasque.
He's asked for harder assignments.

165
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:58,123
I came one hour earlier
to get everything ready...

166
00:31:58,123 --> 00:32:02,140
and noticed that
some neighbors had arrived.

167
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:04,155
There was nobody yesterday!

168
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:07,160
I called immediately,
but you had already left.

169
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,001
It'll be alright.

170
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:12,122
We can begin the interrogating. 

171
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:14,123
I prepared chairs, desk, paper...

172
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:16,136
This is not a trial.

173
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:18,080
Here's what it's about.

174
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,140
No way!
The neighbors will hear everything!

175
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:23,131
Listen...

176
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:27,147
The walls are paper-thin.

177
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:30,149
The English didn't deliver on
the silenced guns we requested.

178
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:33,142
Let's look for a better place.

179
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,148
How could you do it?

180
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:49,124
There's no better place.

181
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,126
The cellar won't work.

182
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,131
And neither will the attic.

183
00:32:58,145 --> 00:32:59,134
We will need a good knife.

184
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:03,138
Bison has one.

185
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:06,153
A knife? Are you kidding?

186
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:08,042
I can't let you do that.

187
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:12,159
Felix! Go look for something
in the kitchen.

188
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,128
Please don't do this.
It's murder!

189
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:18,120
We are here to kill, regardless.

190
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,135
That's true, but not like this.

191
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:24,126
I know what you mean.

192
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:30,132
I swear I am not scared,
but this is my first time ...

193
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:34,146
This is our first time also,
can't you see?

194
00:33:35,158 --> 00:33:36,150
I didn't find anything.

195
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:41,154
Maybe we could wait for Bison?

196
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:42,155
No, out of the question.

197
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:45,147
We must finish it now.

198
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,148
Bloody hell!

199
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:51,150
We can't just smash his head in, can we?

200
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:56,125
Gag him.

201
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:39,134
We must strangle him.

202
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,139
With our bare hands?

203
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:47,143
No.
There's a towel in the kitchen.

204
00:34:59,132 --> 00:35:03,135
Enough!
You came here for this!

205
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:08,150
You wanted a harder assignment?
Here it is, so don't complain.

206
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,139
Make him sit down.

207
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,141
Felix, go behind.

208
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:44,133
I will hold his hands
and Masque will grab his legs.

209
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:57,145
I promise you won't suffer.

210
00:37:44,164 --> 00:37:45,153
We're leaving.

211
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,155
I'm coming.

212
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:05,140
I could not imagine
this was possible.

213
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:07,141
Neither could I.

214
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:13,148
Get some cyanide pills.

215
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,152
And if you're arrested, eat them.

216
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:20,154
I will.

217
00:39:39,145 --> 00:39:40,134
A glass of rum.

218
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:19,140
- Jean François!
- Felix!

219
00:40:23,156 --> 00:40:26,159
It's been a long time.
Still young and handsome.

220
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,162
What are you doing in Marseilles?

221
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:33,166
I moved my workshop here from Paris.

222
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,155
And you?

223
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:36,157
Nothing special.

224
00:40:39,138 --> 00:40:42,141
I have to go.
Can you walk a bit with me?

225
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:43,130
Alright, let's go.

226
00:40:47,146 --> 00:40:48,147
Can you wait five minutes?

227
00:40:48,147 --> 00:40:50,138
Five minutes.
Not my whole life.

228
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,151
Always lucky!

229
00:41:04,163 --> 00:41:06,154
A bit risky to wear a pilot's jacket?

230
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,155
Fuck them.

231
00:41:09,168 --> 00:41:10,157
- And then?
- And then what?

232
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:13,127
Just fuck them?

233
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,142
What else? Fight?

234
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:18,133
I know some more exciting things.

235
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:20,146
Really exciting?

236
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:21,135
Yes.

237
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:26,141
You'll have to get up early,
sleep on the train, on the road,

238
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:29,155
without reasons or explanations.

239
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:30,144
I'm interested.

240
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:34,159
Come and see me tomorrow,
here's my address.

241
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,010
No, don't write it down.
Just remember it.

242
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:39,165
And never tell a soul.

243
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:40,166
Of course.

244
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:42,100
Everyone says that...
but even a girlfriend...

245
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,040
I don't have one. 

246
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,150
The girl in the bar?

247
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:47,100
I told her 5 minutes...
she'll have to wait a few more.

248
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,142
Parents you like to talk with...

249
00:41:49,142 --> 00:41:51,133
They all died.

250
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:54,136
Just one brother,
who stayed in Paris.

251
00:41:55,148 --> 00:41:59,151
I love him.
But would never confide in him.

252
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,152
<i>Theater and Music Center.</i>

253
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:18,171
Do you have an appointment?

254
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:19,160
With Mr. Russel.

255
00:42:20,173 --> 00:42:21,162
This way, please.

256
00:42:36,155 --> 00:42:37,156
I came as quickly as I could.

257
00:42:37,156 --> 00:42:39,158
It's very urgent indeed.

258
00:42:39,158 --> 00:42:42,150
How many people to board
for Gibraltar?

259
00:42:43,162 --> 00:42:45,164
Two canadian officers,
from Dieppe commando,

260
00:42:45,164 --> 00:42:48,156
three aviators from R.A.F.,

261
00:42:49,168 --> 00:42:52,171
and also two Belgians
sentenced to death by Germans.

262
00:42:52,171 --> 00:42:54,173
Eight including me.

263
00:42:54,173 --> 00:42:58,166
Where will they wait for the submarine?
The doctor's clinic is under surveillance.

264
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,148
Couldn't we send them outside,
a few at a time?

265
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,141
No, too dangerous.

266
00:43:07,153 --> 00:43:12,147
A Canadian officer will want to go into a café
and talk, forgetting his accent.

267
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:18,153
We will be informed of the submarine
arrival just one day in advance.

268
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:22,168
Everyone must go to the Viella farm.

269
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:23,157
Everyone?

270
00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:27,173
It's not very safe...

271
00:43:27,173 --> 00:43:29,164
We are not an insurance company.

272
00:43:30,176 --> 00:43:32,167
On the contrary, indeed!

273
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:36,148
You must choose a real trustworthy man
to supervise everything.

274
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:41,154
I have this man.
You don't know him.

275
00:43:41,154 --> 00:43:45,010
He did a very good job
on several recent missions.

276
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,160
He is now in Paris.
To deliver a new radio to Mathilde.

277
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,145
- When will he be back?
- Tomorrow morning.

278
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:58,171
Contact him immediately.
Everything must be ready by tomorrow night.

279
00:43:58,171 --> 00:44:00,162
I'll be there at the last second.

280
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,177
And take a break.

281
00:44:04,177 --> 00:44:06,005
When you will be gone.

282
00:44:06,005 --> 00:44:09,170
No, now.
There'll be no time after that.

283
00:44:52,158 --> 00:44:59,155
<i>The luggages will be checked</i>
<i>inside the station.</i>

284
00:45:40,173 --> 00:45:41,162
Need some help?

285
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,159
Goodbye.

286
00:46:26,152 --> 00:46:28,143
Open your case.

287
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,161
No smuggled goods?

288
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:36,162
No.

289
00:46:36,162 --> 00:46:37,151
What is this?

290
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:42,168
Just a radio.

291
00:46:42,168 --> 00:46:44,159
Okay, you can go.

292
00:46:52,178 --> 00:46:54,169
Madam, please, luggage check.

293
00:47:23,175 --> 00:47:24,164
Any trouble?

294
00:47:26,178 --> 00:47:29,147
Not really. Stopped twice.

295
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:46,154
Tell Felix we need a new quartz.
The frequency has changed.

296
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:49,157
Alright. May I help you?

297
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:51,158
Certainly not.

298
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:31,150
The second radio is in the case.

299
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,179
Okay. Want something to eat?

300
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:34,168
No, thanks. I'm going to surprise someone...

301
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:30,158
Hello, Saint-Luc!

302
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:33,160
Ah, little Jean!

303
00:49:38,177 --> 00:49:39,166
Still so many books around...

304
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:42,170
And the music instruments...

305
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,171
Nothing's changed.

306
00:49:47,186 --> 00:49:50,189
The temperature has changed!

307
00:49:50,189 --> 00:49:54,148
So I bought this,
in order to avoid freezing.

308
00:49:57,163 --> 00:50:00,166
I stay there when I work at night
or when I eat.

309
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:03,158
But how did you get here?

310
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,171
Hope you have a permit.

311
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:08,174
Oh! Saint-Luc is back to earth.

312
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:12,010
He knows about the permit!

313
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,100
Of course I've got one.
And even...

314
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:18,184
...and I'm even very hungry.

315
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:19,185
We're going to eat.

316
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:20,186
Marie.

317
00:50:20,186 --> 00:50:21,175
Yes, Mr. Luc.

318
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:24,190
What do we have on today's menu?

319
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,158
Some rutabaga like yesterday.

320
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:28,160
And? 

321
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,149
Some unticketed cheese.

322
00:50:31,163 --> 00:50:36,168
A little butter, but no bread.

323
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:38,159
I have tickets for bread,

324
00:50:40,172 --> 00:50:42,163
and I can give all of them to you.

325
00:50:46,178 --> 00:50:49,181
You're not resourceful.
You're still greedy.

326
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:52,184
So I am, but what can I do?

327
00:50:52,184 --> 00:50:55,187
What about smuggling?

328
00:50:55,187 --> 00:50:57,010
Marie is afraid of cops...
And I...

329
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:58,179
And you also...

330
00:51:15,174 --> 00:51:17,165
It's becoming warmer.

331
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:23,100
I felt very warm this morning.
Twice.

332
00:51:25,184 --> 00:51:29,177
So many people on the train or the metro...

333
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:39,155
I was wondering if Mathilde,
that I knew only a little bit...

334
00:51:39,155 --> 00:51:42,168
was not closer to me than you,
my brother,

335
00:51:42,168 --> 00:51:47,100
who I have so much love for,
but with whom I share so few things.

336
00:51:59,185 --> 00:52:01,176
I went back to Marseilles the same day,

337
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:07,148
but today I had a very strange feeling.

338
00:53:08,187 --> 00:53:11,179
Hello Mrs. Vialla.
Your home has become an hotel!

339
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,149
Hello!

340
00:53:18,163 --> 00:53:19,152
- Hello!
- Good evening sir.

341
00:53:26,151 --> 00:53:28,163
The fishing boat will await you
after midnight.

342
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,175
Maybe you can all sail together.

343
00:53:30,175 --> 00:53:35,185
Mrs. Vialla's daughter
will lead you there, surreptitiously.

344
00:53:35,185 --> 00:53:36,190
Perfect.

345
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,005
Am I leaving?

346
00:53:38,005 --> 00:53:41,180
No. There's one more passenger.
Unexpected.

347
00:53:41,186 --> 00:53:43,188
The big boss.

348
00:53:43,188 --> 00:53:46,156
But he will not sail with us.
We're full.

349
00:53:46,158 --> 00:53:48,170
You will board with him.
Somewhere else.

350
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,161
Bison will bring him.

351
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:53,165
You'll wait for my light signal.
Three short and one long.

352
00:53:53,165 --> 00:53:54,154
Got it.

353
00:53:59,171 --> 00:54:03,175
Madame, we will leave.
How much do I owe you?

354
00:54:03,175 --> 00:54:05,166
You can pay later.

355
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:09,181
You already told me that before.

356
00:54:09,181 --> 00:54:11,172
Yet you came back,
so you must like the welcome.

357
00:54:14,186 --> 00:54:16,188
You will walk in single file.

358
00:54:16,188 --> 00:54:20,192
Not too near,
but always keeping watch over each other.

359
00:54:20,192 --> 00:54:25,186
Not a sound, not a word.

360
00:55:12,177 --> 00:55:14,020
Keep quiet, I have a gun!

361
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:17,168
- What are you doing here at night?
- And you?

362
00:55:17,182 --> 00:55:19,173
I'm Mrs. Vialla's brother-in-law.

363
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:21,174
The nurse?

364
00:55:22,187 --> 00:55:25,190
I'm verifying that everything is alright.

365
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,191
And then?

366
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:29,194
It's okay, a police patrol has just departed.

367
00:55:29,194 --> 00:55:34,010
Germans are too few and get lost.
So they trust the customs.

368
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,100
And the customs?

369
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:38,170
The customs? But I am the customs!

370
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:40,182
I am the only one in charge
in this area.

371
00:55:40,182 --> 00:55:41,161
No kidding!

372
00:56:23,182 --> 00:56:24,171
Get on board!

373
00:56:52,177 --> 00:56:53,166
Good luck, boss.

374
00:56:59,184 --> 00:57:03,177
So strange to think the big boss
looks like any other man.

375
00:57:04,189 --> 00:57:09,010
Here in this boat, where base and
tip of the pyramid meet.

376
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:14,199
Strange.

377
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:17,168
I'll have to talk with Saint-Luc
about it after the war.

378
00:57:30,182 --> 00:57:32,174
Watch your steps sir.

379
00:57:58,176 --> 00:58:00,178
I'm so happy to be travelling with you.

380
00:58:00,178 --> 00:58:01,167
I feel the same.

381
00:59:12,184 --> 00:59:14,175
I cannot deliver you all the weapons
you asked me for.

382
00:59:15,187 --> 00:59:20,192
The English don't believe too much in
the efficiency of the French resistance.

383
00:59:20,192 --> 00:59:23,184
They want to keep as many planes
as possible to bomb Germany.

384
00:59:24,196 --> 00:59:26,185
But we will improve 
your transmission equipment.

385
00:59:26,198 --> 00:59:30,168
So we'll send you some radio operators,

386
00:59:30,168 --> 00:59:33,171
and we'll help your agents

387
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:36,163
to improve the landing place

388
01:00:11,863 --> 01:00:14,863
Jardie invited me to the ceremony
just an hour in advance.

389
01:01:43,363 --> 01:01:47,763
The war will be over for the French
when they can see this wonderful movie.

390
01:06:11,376 --> 01:06:14,368
I heard Felix was arrested today.

391
01:06:19,384 --> 01:06:21,375
<i>Free France</i>

392
01:06:23,388 --> 01:06:27,381
I still had many things 
to do in London,

393
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:33,354
but I decided to go back to France
that same day.

394
01:08:06,391 --> 01:08:07,392
Never.

395
01:08:07,392 --> 01:08:11,363
When your feet hit the ground,

396
01:08:11,363 --> 01:08:16,368
don't try to stay upright.
Bend your knees and fall, understood?

397
01:08:16,368 --> 01:08:17,357
I think so.

398
01:16:08,373 --> 01:16:13,367
Mathilde moved to Lyon
during my absence.

399
01:16:14,379 --> 01:16:19,373
She's a great leader.
I made her my assistant.

400
01:16:45,376 --> 01:16:50,370
The boss already told me how
wonderful she was.

401
01:16:51,382 --> 01:16:57,378
But I'm still surprised by her skill
in giving and receiving orders.

402
01:17:00,391 --> 01:17:03,195
She studied the map of Gestapo
headquarters for hours.

403
01:17:03,195 --> 01:17:06,397
She finally discovered where
Felix was imprisoned.

404
01:17:06,397 --> 01:17:11,357
A jail for prisoners that they
absolutely need information from.

405
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:16,363
At first, she wanted to use a bomb.

406
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:23,371
Then she made another plan,
which required a disguise.

407
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:50,364
She arranged for me a new place
for my headquaters.

408
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:01,386
No place is more secure or pleasant.

409
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:08,383
My host is now the Baron de Ferte,
an ex-cavalry officer.

410
01:18:09,394 --> 01:18:10,383
Before the war,

411
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:13,387
the Republic was my enemy.

412
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:18,392
With my tenant farmer, and my servant,

413
01:18:19,404 --> 01:18:22,407
I had created a little army
equipped with guns and pikes...

414
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:24,398
to assault the prefecture

415
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,399
on horseback

416
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:30,381
in the case of royalist insurrection.

417
01:18:34,385 --> 01:18:39,379
This militia still exists,
and is used to protect me now.

418
01:18:42,393 --> 01:18:47,387
The Baron himself suggested use of
his field for landing and dropping.

419
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:51,391
We did as he wished and even more. 

420
01:18:55,406 --> 01:18:57,397
Strange carousel...

421
01:19:30,408 --> 01:19:33,411
While the first airplane is landing...

422
01:19:33,411 --> 01:19:37,382
the second one keeps on flying
at low altitude...

423
01:19:37,382 --> 01:19:42,387
to cover up the sound of the 
first plane's landing and take-off.

424
01:19:42,387 --> 01:19:44,194
And then they switch.

425
01:19:46,164 --> 01:19:51,396
This night, four men left for London,
and four men arrived from there.

426
01:19:51,396 --> 01:19:55,392
Bison, Le Masque, Jean-François
et Mathilde were supervising.

427
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:09,396
Does your husband know 
about your activities?

428
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:11,397
No he doesn't.

429
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:13,399
Nor does my daughter.

430
01:21:21,385 --> 01:21:24,377
Here she is.
17 years old.

431
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:27,379
Don't keep it with you.

432
01:21:29,393 --> 01:21:31,384
You're right. I won't.

433
01:21:32,396 --> 01:21:35,388
Before anything else,

434
01:21:37,401 --> 01:21:41,394
we must talk about Felix.

435
01:21:42,406 --> 01:21:44,419
I know Felix doesn't have
prussic acid pills.

436
01:21:45,411 --> 01:21:50,383
I'm not afraid of him talking,
but he has no way to escape torture.

437
01:21:52,164 --> 01:21:54,374
The Gestapo will not give in.

438
01:21:55,386 --> 01:22:00,380
And he will suffer for days, maybe weeks...

439
01:22:01,392 --> 01:22:02,381
I know that.

440
01:22:03,394 --> 01:22:04,395
There aren't many possibilities.

441
01:22:04,395 --> 01:22:05,384
Did you find one?

442
01:22:06,397 --> 01:22:09,389
Yes. Enter the Gestapo
and leave with Felix.

443
01:22:12,403 --> 01:22:18,409
Mathilde, I want to rescue Felix.
But not at any cost.

444
01:22:18,409 --> 01:22:20,411
I cannot sacrifice anyone.

445
01:22:20,411 --> 01:22:22,380
I don't need many men.

446
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:26,384
With Le Masque, Jean-François,
Bison and me, I can make it.

447
01:22:26,384 --> 01:22:27,373
No problem.

448
01:22:30,388 --> 01:22:31,389
What is your plan?

449
01:22:31,389 --> 01:22:34,392
Bison, can you get three
german officer's uniforms?

450
01:22:34,392 --> 01:22:35,381
Of course.

451
01:22:36,394 --> 01:22:37,383
Do it then.

452
01:22:38,396 --> 01:22:42,389
The problem is how to contact
and inform Felix. 

453
01:22:43,401 --> 01:22:46,393
I haven't figured it out yet,
but I will.

454
01:22:47,405 --> 01:22:51,398
Because he must be ready
when we will come.

455
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:54,378
I have tried to contact him
for a week now.

456
01:22:55,379 --> 01:22:59,372
But that building is very
strictly guarded.

457
01:23:00,384 --> 01:23:02,375
Yes, not so easy to enter.

458
01:23:04,388 --> 01:23:05,377
- Careful it's warm.
- Thanks.

459
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:54,393
<i>Mr. Gerbier</i>

460
01:23:56,407 --> 01:24:01,367
<i>I don't have the courage of
Le Masque nor the strength of Bison.</i>

461
01:24:03,381 --> 01:24:05,372
<i>Nor the skills of Mathilde.</i>

462
01:24:07,385 --> 01:24:09,376
<i>I will not participate in this escape plan</i>

463
01:24:11,389 --> 01:24:17,385
<i>But I'm sure that
my comrades will succeed.</i>

464
01:24:20,398 --> 01:24:22,389
<i>Don't try to find out 
what happened to me.</i>

465
01:25:14,418 --> 01:25:21,381
<i>Mr. Dupont knows much of
the resistance movement.</i>

466
01:25:33,404 --> 01:25:34,393
How did you make it?

467
01:25:35,406 --> 01:25:36,395
Well...

468
01:25:43,414 --> 01:25:46,406
We will use only two uniforms.

469
01:25:47,418 --> 01:25:49,409
I know, Mrs. Mathilde.

470
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,391
I won't let you do it without me.

471
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:41,394
And I won't let you go with us!

472
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:44,397
Remember what you said,

473
01:26:45,409 --> 01:26:47,411
"I cannot sacrifice anyone."

474
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:50,403
Especially if "anyone" is you.

475
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:53,406
But Mathilde, why you instead of me?

476
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:55,407
Listen.

477
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:02,393
Two men won't be noticed.
But three men would.

478
01:27:02,393 --> 01:27:05,396
When Jean-François was still there,
you asked for three uniforms.

479
01:27:05,396 --> 01:27:11,402
But at least, I would have taken
only Le Masque and Le Bison.

480
01:27:11,402 --> 01:27:13,393
Jean-François...

481
01:27:15,406 --> 01:27:16,395
I trusted him.

482
01:27:17,408 --> 01:27:19,399
Me too, that's not what I meant.

483
01:27:21,412 --> 01:27:25,405
But... I could never imagine
he would leave us this way.

484
01:28:40,163 --> 01:28:41,391
<i>Who's that man?</i>

485
01:28:41,392 --> 01:28:43,373
<i>He was denounced by an anonymous letter.</i>

486
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:54,390
You can enter.

487
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:24,401
Naturally, is Dupont your real name? 

488
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:25,402
Of course.

489
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:27,393
Which organization do you belong?

490
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:29,394
I don't know what you mean.

491
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:32,398
Do you understand the consequences?

492
01:29:35,412 --> 01:29:40,405
You will be shot under this name
and no one will know what happened to you.

493
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:22,393
I decided to leave this place.
Perhaps a premonition?

494
01:30:22,393 --> 01:30:28,389
Three days after, Baron de Ferte
and his men were arrested and shot.

495
01:31:30,227 --> 01:31:35,387
We must take a man
named Felix Lepercq to Paris...

496
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,392
to the headquarters of
Oberstufuhrer Bolmerburg.

497
01:31:40,173 --> 01:31:42,406
- Felix Lepercq?
- Yes, a terrorist.

498
01:31:42,406 --> 01:31:44,408
Hurry up, it's urgent.

499
01:31:44,408 --> 01:31:45,397
Get down.

500
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:27,405
One moment, please.

501
01:34:32,409 --> 01:34:36,413
An ambulance from Paris Gestapo...

502
01:34:36,413 --> 01:34:40,417
wants to take terrorist 
Felix Lepercq.

503
01:34:40,418 --> 01:34:44,410
Make an on-duty Doctor come and give
the transfer authorization.

504
01:36:25,422 --> 01:36:27,413
Felix.

505
01:36:31,428 --> 01:36:32,417
Felix can you hear me?

506
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:35,398
Mathilde, Le Bison and Le Masque
are here.

507
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:41,394
I will help you.
Are you in a lot of pain?

508
01:37:29,419 --> 01:37:30,408
It's not possible.

509
01:37:33,423 --> 01:37:34,412
He will suffer a lot,

510
01:37:36,173 --> 01:37:37,415
until he dies.

511
01:38:29,412 --> 01:38:35,408
Impossible. I can't let you 
transfer a dying man. Sorry.

512
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:40,412
Okay, I will report this.

513
01:41:24,421 --> 01:41:25,410
Felix.

514
01:41:26,423 --> 01:41:27,412
I have several prussic acid pills.

515
01:41:28,425 --> 01:41:29,414
Do you want one?

516
01:42:00,423 --> 01:42:02,425
We could have saved Felix.

517
01:42:02,425 --> 01:42:03,414
No.

518
01:42:04,427 --> 01:42:06,418
No one and nothing could.

519
01:42:08,431 --> 01:42:09,420
Not even you.

520
01:42:15,438 --> 01:42:18,408
Besides, every policeman is looking for you.

521
01:42:18,408 --> 01:42:21,400
You should disappear for awhile.

522
01:42:22,412 --> 01:42:24,403
The next airplane is yours.

523
01:42:25,415 --> 01:42:26,404
You're not serious?

524
01:42:27,417 --> 01:42:30,409
Resistance organizations are rising
from everywhere.

525
01:42:31,421 --> 01:42:36,415
We must unite them, train them,
supply them.

526
01:42:38,428 --> 01:42:40,419
There's nobody to replace me now.

527
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:46,425
If you get arrested, we will 
replace you however we can.

528
01:43:06,423 --> 01:43:07,412
Police!

529
01:43:09,426 --> 01:43:12,418
So, is the food good here?

530
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:16,422
You have meat at every meal,
and without tickets?

531
01:43:17,434 --> 01:43:20,426
We will check all papers.

532
01:43:24,441 --> 01:43:25,430
Hurry up, let's go.

533
01:44:42,418 --> 01:44:43,407
I'll keep it, for later.

534
01:46:05,435 --> 01:46:10,440
He says "Finish your smoke. They're
coming and I don't want trouble."

535
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,431
Everyone has his own troubles.

536
01:46:27,423 --> 01:46:28,412
This time is the last one.

537
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:08,413
The word "Love" makes sense to me
only when I think of the boss.

538
01:48:09,425 --> 01:48:11,418
He's more important to me
than anything.

539
01:48:11,425 --> 01:48:14,418
More than everything.
But not more than life.

540
01:48:14,431 --> 01:48:18,164
If Luc Jardie would die,
I would still like to live.

541
01:48:18,174 --> 01:48:20,164
And I'm going to die.

542
01:48:20,427 --> 01:48:22,239
And I'm not afraid.

543
01:48:23,409 --> 01:48:25,430
How is that possible?

544
01:48:26,372 --> 01:48:29,434
It's because I'm too narrow-minded
to believe it.

545
01:48:30,446 --> 01:48:34,406
And if I don't believe it
until the last moment,

546
01:48:34,446 --> 01:48:35,406
I will never die.

547
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:41,212
What a discovery!
The boss would like the idea.

548
01:48:42,425 --> 01:48:44,427
I must explore this discovery.

549
01:48:44,427 --> 01:48:45,416
I must...

550
01:50:34,437 --> 01:50:39,442
You will turn your back to the
machine-gun and face the wall.

551
01:50:39,442 --> 01:50:41,433
And then you will run
as fast as you can.

552
01:50:42,445 --> 01:50:43,446
We will not shoot immediately.

553
01:50:43,446 --> 01:50:45,448
We will give you a chance.

554
01:50:45,448 --> 01:50:50,442
If you get to the wall, you'll
be shot in the next round instead.

555
01:50:51,454 --> 01:50:53,456
We can try anyway.

556
01:50:53,456 --> 01:50:54,445
Nothing to lose.

557
01:50:55,458 --> 01:50:59,417
He knows about my legs.
He's waiting for the show.

558
01:51:00,429 --> 01:51:03,421
And I feel more tied by his certainty
than by my chains.

559
01:51:09,438 --> 01:51:10,427
Go!

560
01:51:14,443 --> 01:51:17,436
I don't want to run.

561
01:51:17,436 --> 01:51:18,436
I won't.

562
01:53:18,434 --> 01:53:22,427
The most important thing was to time
it precisely. Mathilde did.

563
01:53:23,439 --> 01:53:26,431
Oh, it was easy 
with all the information we had.

564
01:53:29,445 --> 01:53:31,436
And if I didn't run?

565
01:53:34,450 --> 01:53:38,443
Something wrong?
Thinking about those who didn't run?

566
01:53:40,456 --> 01:53:43,459
No, thinking about this officer,
was what convinced me to run.

567
01:53:43,459 --> 01:53:45,427
Like a rabbit in panic!

568
01:55:06,442 --> 01:55:07,431
Go on.

569
01:56:49,445 --> 01:56:51,436
It's good to be safe.

570
01:57:07,463 --> 01:57:09,465
Enough for one month.

571
01:57:09,465 --> 01:57:12,356
There is drinking water, but I'll try
to bring you some wine. 

572
01:57:12,468 --> 01:57:14,436
No way, see you in a month.

573
01:57:15,437 --> 01:57:16,426
All right.

574
01:57:22,444 --> 01:57:26,448
I'm gonna leave.
Somebody could spot the car.

575
01:57:26,448 --> 01:57:27,437
Okay.

576
01:57:33,455 --> 01:57:36,447
Treat your arm and your leg.
It might get infected.

577
01:57:39,461 --> 01:57:41,452
I put a shaver on the table.

578
01:58:37,453 --> 01:58:41,446
I'm by myself for three weeks,
like a timid animal.

579
01:58:42,458 --> 01:58:48,454
I write a long report for London,
and try to believe I'm still useful.

580
02:00:03,439 --> 02:00:05,430
I haven't seen Mathilde
or anyone since.

581
02:00:41,443 --> 02:00:46,448
I read the five books Luc Jardie
wrote before the war.

582
02:00:46,448 --> 02:00:48,437
They keep me company.

583
02:01:11,473 --> 02:01:15,466
At night, Jean-François'
disappearance haunts me.

584
02:02:19,474 --> 02:02:21,465
Le Bison or Le Masque?

585
02:02:28,453 --> 02:02:30,442
But it's ... you!

586
02:02:45,467 --> 02:02:47,469
I have to talk to you.

587
02:02:47,469 --> 02:02:48,470
When did you come back?

588
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:52,463
Four days ago.
Since Mathilde was arrested.

589
02:02:55,477 --> 02:02:56,466
Mathilde?

590
02:03:01,450 --> 02:03:03,439
We have to talk about her tonight.

591
02:03:06,455 --> 02:03:07,444
We have to, Philippe.

592
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:15,453
They didn't hurt her.

593
02:03:16,465 --> 02:03:18,456
She got in touch with us.

594
02:03:20,469 --> 02:03:23,461
Gestapo found her real name
very quickly,

595
02:03:24,473 --> 02:03:26,275
and where her family was living.

596
02:03:26,475 --> 02:03:29,467
She had her daughter's picture,

597
02:03:31,446 --> 02:03:32,435
and you can guess what happened...

598
02:03:33,448 --> 02:03:34,437
That picture?

599
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:37,441
This was her only mistake.

600
02:03:38,453 --> 02:03:43,447
The Germans quickly found her weakness.

601
02:03:45,189 --> 02:03:47,461
Why did she keep the picture?

602
02:03:47,461 --> 02:03:49,464
I told her!

603
02:03:49,464 --> 02:03:50,453
Listen to this,

604
02:03:51,466 --> 02:03:53,457
She begged the Germans to give her
the picture back.

605
02:03:54,171 --> 02:03:56,171
What do you mean?

606
02:03:56,471 --> 02:03:59,463
Mathilde sent us an S.O.S.
The Germans gave her two choices.

607
02:04:00,475 --> 02:04:03,478
Tell everything she knows
about the organization,

608
02:04:03,478 --> 02:04:08,438
or they will send her daughter
to Poland as a prostitute.

609
02:04:11,453 --> 02:04:13,444
Now you know everything.

610
02:04:15,457 --> 02:04:17,448
We have to find a solution.

611
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:19,461
Could she escape?

612
02:04:19,461 --> 02:04:23,465
No, she can't escape,
nor commit suicide.

613
02:04:23,465 --> 02:04:25,469
Mathilde will never give up
her daughter to the gestapo.

614
02:04:27,469 --> 02:04:28,458
Can she stall time?

615
02:04:29,471 --> 02:04:31,473
Until when?

616
02:04:31,473 --> 02:04:34,476
It's not a solution.

617
02:04:34,476 --> 02:04:35,465
Here comes Le Bison.

618
02:04:36,478 --> 02:04:39,447
Don't tell him I'm here.

619
02:04:40,449 --> 02:04:41,438
Go in that room.

620
02:05:22,457 --> 02:05:24,459
Here are some new glasses.

621
02:05:24,459 --> 02:05:26,450
Thanks.

622
02:05:40,475 --> 02:05:41,464
Any news from Mathilde?

623
02:05:45,447 --> 02:05:46,448
What's going on?

624
02:05:46,448 --> 02:05:47,449
I know nothing.

625
02:05:47,449 --> 02:05:48,438
What?

626
02:05:49,451 --> 02:05:52,443
I don't. Here's a letter.

627
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:37,454
Mathilde was released yesterday.
And two comrades were arrested today.

628
02:06:38,466 --> 02:06:39,455
Is it so?

629
02:06:41,469 --> 02:06:42,458
If they say it is.

630
02:06:51,446 --> 02:06:54,472
Le Masque, you knew this?

631
02:06:56,484 --> 02:06:58,475
I'm not in charge of this report.

632
02:07:01,456 --> 02:07:04,448
Mathilde is to be killed immediately.

633
02:07:06,461 --> 02:07:07,450
I can't believe it.

634
02:07:10,465 --> 02:07:13,457
I will never hurt Mrs. Mathilde.

635
02:07:14,469 --> 02:07:15,470
I have been working with her.

636
02:07:15,470 --> 02:07:17,472
She saved me once.

637
02:07:17,472 --> 02:07:20,464
This is a great woman!

638
02:07:21,476 --> 02:07:25,469
Men...as many as you want...

639
02:07:27,482 --> 02:07:31,474
But Mrs. Mathilde, never!

640
02:07:32,487 --> 02:07:33,476
We will not discuss about it.

641
02:07:34,456 --> 02:07:36,458
She must disappear and she will.

642
02:07:36,458 --> 02:07:37,459
You won't do it!

643
02:07:37,459 --> 02:07:41,452
We have other killers.
If necessary, I will do it. 

644
02:07:42,464 --> 02:07:45,456
You won't.
You don't have the right.

645
02:07:46,468 --> 02:07:48,459
You could have run as a champion...

646
02:07:49,471 --> 02:07:52,463
you would be dead already
if not for Mrs. Mathilde.

647
02:07:58,480 --> 02:07:59,469
You won't do it.

648
02:08:00,282 --> 02:08:04,475
She can give me to the Gestapo,
she protected me, and you,

649
02:08:05,475 --> 02:08:06,488
and now,
she's protecting her daughter.

650
02:08:06,488 --> 02:08:07,489
Can we blame her?

651
02:08:07,489 --> 02:08:10,458
Enough!
The decision is made.

652
02:08:16,464 --> 02:08:21,458
If you're as cowardly as that,
I'll kill you first!

653
02:08:38,486 --> 02:08:39,487
Stop it!

654
02:08:39,487 --> 02:08:43,458
Shut your mouth! You were still a child
when I started commanding men...

655
02:08:43,458 --> 02:08:45,460
What do you think?

656
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:48,488
Would I let you do that?
Have you gone crazy?

657
02:08:49,464 --> 02:08:51,465
You, get out!
Or I'll kill you both!

658
02:09:04,479 --> 02:09:09,473
You need a few cooler
heads in this room.

659
02:09:13,488 --> 02:09:14,455
My friend, sit down.

660
02:09:17,459 --> 02:09:19,450
Calm down and have a cigarette.

661
02:09:21,463 --> 02:09:22,452
Don't you think, Gerbier?

662
02:09:23,465 --> 02:09:25,456
You heard everything.

663
02:09:26,468 --> 02:09:32,514
Yes, Mathilde is truly a great woman.
Even more than you know.

664
02:09:33,168 --> 02:09:35,416
But we're going to kill her.

665
02:09:35,416 --> 02:09:36,478
I can't believe you.

666
02:09:36,478 --> 02:09:38,480
You will, listen my friend.

667
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:41,472
We will kill Mathilde,
because she asked us to.

668
02:09:43,485 --> 02:09:44,486
She told you that?

669
02:09:44,486 --> 02:09:47,489
No, but it's not difficult to guess.
Think of it like this,

670
02:09:47,489 --> 02:09:50,458
If Mathilde only wanted to save
her daughter, 

671
02:09:50,458 --> 02:09:54,451
she just had to give names
and addresses.

672
02:09:55,463 --> 02:09:59,467
In spite of this, Mathilde told them
we change our address every day,

673
02:09:59,467 --> 02:10:02,459
she must contact some people...
whatever...

674
02:10:03,471 --> 02:10:06,274
So that they set her free.
Clear, isn't it?

675
02:10:06,474 --> 02:10:12,470
Imagine you were in her position.
Forced to betray comrades.

676
02:10:13,481 --> 02:10:15,472
And suicide is not allowed.

677
02:10:20,488 --> 02:10:21,455
I would like to be killed.

678
02:10:23,458 --> 02:10:27,451
Do you find yourself braver
or better than Mathilde?

679
02:10:33,269 --> 02:10:35,169
Please excuse me.

680
02:10:35,169 --> 02:10:39,474
Take a german car. Le Masque will
drive. I'll come with you.

681
02:10:39,474 --> 02:10:41,476
Are you mad?

682
02:10:41,476 --> 02:10:43,467
I'm sure Mathilde would like
to see me.

683
02:10:44,479 --> 02:10:46,470
Please, this is not your place.

684
02:10:47,482 --> 02:10:48,471
This is an order.

685
02:10:50,485 --> 02:10:52,476
You didn't have to do that, boss.

686
02:11:15,477 --> 02:11:18,469
Do you really believe what you said?

687
02:11:19,481 --> 02:11:20,470
I don't know.

688
02:11:24,486 --> 02:11:26,477
Maybe this hypothesis is right.

689
02:11:27,489 --> 02:11:30,453
Maybe she just wanted to see
her daughter again,

690
02:11:30,458 --> 02:11:32,449
and now is finding it harder
to give it all up.

691
02:11:33,461 --> 02:11:35,461
That's what I want to find out.

692
02:11:38,466 --> 02:11:41,267
I had to come back to you
for the hardest job.

693
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:44,459
You, in this car, with killers!

694
02:11:45,373 --> 02:11:47,524
Nothing's sacred now in this world.

695
02:11:54,482 --> 02:11:58,475
February 23rd, 1943, Sunday.

696
02:12:46,467 --> 02:12:47,456
Go.

697
02:12:57,478 --> 02:13:05,476
Nov the 8th, 1943.
Le Masque had just time
to take his prussic acid pill.

698
02:13:10,491 --> 02:13:17,488
Dec the 16th, 1943.
Le Bison was beheaded with an axe
in a German jail.

699
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:29,467
Jan the 22nd, 1944.
Luc Jardie died under torture,
after giving one name: his own.

700
02:13:34,482 --> 02:13:40,478
Jan the 13rd, 1944.
Gerbier decided not to run this time...

701
02:14:27,363 --> 02:14:32,363
André Dewavrin himself.
- Alias Colonel Passy.

702
02:15:08,163 --> 02:15:21,163
From Joseph Kessel's book
"L'armée des ombres"
