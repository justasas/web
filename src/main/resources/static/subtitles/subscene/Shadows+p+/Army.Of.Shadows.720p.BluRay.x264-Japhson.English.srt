1
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,920
"Bad memories: be yet welcomed...
you are my distant youth..."

2
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:57,566
Army in the Shadows

3
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:29,505
October 20, 1942

4
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:54,972
- Do you mind if we stop for a while?
- Not at all.

5
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:28,372
It won't take too long.

6
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:30,460
Just some shopping.

7
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,590
You have to sort it out for yourself
these days.

8
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,634
It's very understandable.

9
00:04:34,634 --> 00:04:36,721
You will be alright in this camp.

10
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:39,853
The best camp in France!

11
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:40,896
This camp was for Germans.

12
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,028
I'm not sure I understand.

13
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:47,160
At the beginning of the war, we were
expecting a lot of german prisoners.

14
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:50,289
But of course there were none.

15
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,422
However, this camp is very useful now.

16
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:54,466
What good luck!

17
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:55,509
You said it!

18
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:53,958
Always the same; don't know who they
are, or how to treat them.

19
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:58,133
Some of them arrive without being charged
and stay forever.

20
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:03,352
Some, who committed crimes,
get out very quickly and become influential...

21
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:07,527
in the department,
or in the Vichy government.

22
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:12,745
Philippe Gerbier, 41 years old.
Engineer.

23
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:21,097
Vivid and independent mind.
Distant and ironic.

24
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,183
To subdue.

25
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:28,402
Seems to be influential.
To be treated gently.

26
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,709
Suspected of Gaullist thinking.
To subdue.

27
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:43,014
Set free by lack of evidence:
influential, to be treated gently.

28
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:53,451
The room you are going to
was for german officers.

29
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,626
I'm honored.

30
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:13,283
Certainly to be treated gently...

31
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:17,458
and certainly with caution.

32
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:32,607
Philippe Gerbier

33
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:34,695
Colonel Jarret Du Plessis

34
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:39,914
I don't know why you are here
but I'll tell you why I was arrested.

35
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:44,088
I said in a café that
Admiral Darlant was a bastard.

36
00:08:45,132 --> 00:08:50,352
And Marechal Petain is a bastard also,
whose treatment of soldiers is reprehensible.

37
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:52,438
You, Colonel, have the chance
to suffer for your opinions.

38
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:54,526
Aubert, a druggist.

39
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,658
Do you know, Sir,
what a Mallert Shell is?

40
00:08:57,658 --> 00:08:58,701
No.

41
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:03,919
It's a component of a
certain chemical reaction.

42
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:08,094
I am a chemist and I had to keep
a Mallert Shell.

43
00:09:09,138 --> 00:09:11,226
I was censured for shell possession,

44
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:13,314
and no one would listen to any explications.

45
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:15,401
Octave Bonnafous.

46
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:18,532
Business man.

47
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:22,707
I unfortunately stumbled into
a Gaullist meeting...

48
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:25,838
No more laws!
Only bastards!

49
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:26,882
They took my pension away!

50
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:30,013
Where should I settle in?

51
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:37,319
As the room leader, allow me
to assign you this free mattress.

52
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:48,800
I am Legrain, communist.

53
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:51,932
Here's Armel, teacher and catholic.

54
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:54,020
Is he sleeping?

55
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,063
No, he's very sick.

56
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:56,107
No infirmary?

57
00:09:56,107 --> 00:09:57,150
Already full.

58
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:01,325
Do you play dominos?

59
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:02,369
I'm afraid not.

60
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:04,456
We'll teach you.

61
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:07,588
Thank you, but I would rather not.

62
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:12,807
Excuse us then, but we must finish playing
before they turn off the light.

63
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,938
The Commandant is not as stupid as he looks.

64
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:21,156
He put me in with three idiots
and two lost children.

65
00:11:02,906 --> 00:11:03,950
Going for a walk?

66
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,037
I'm working in the power station.

67
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:08,125
Well done!

68
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:12,299
I don't get paid,
but I like it and wish to practice.

69
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:26,911
See you later, comrade!

70
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:33,175
Are you communist?

71
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:36,305
No, but we're comrades all the same.

72
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:49,876
There are people here
from every country.

73
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:00,311
Russians.

74
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:05,531
Poles.

75
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:12,837
Algerians.

76
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:31,624
Jews from all over,

77
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:44,149
Gypsies.

78
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:49,368
Yugoslavians.

79
00:12:50,412 --> 00:12:53,543
Romanian, Czech.

80
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:58,761
Germans against Nazism,
Italians against Fascism.

81
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:00,849
Spanish against Franco,

82
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:09,199
And some others,
arrested for smuggling.

83
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:24,856
You alright?

84
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:10,779
I managed the installation
of powerlines in Savoie.

85
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:13,911
You're an electrician?

86
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:19,130
- Just like you.
- Surely you're more qualified than I.

87
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:23,305
Maybe we could talk about it sometime.

88
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:24,349
Of course.

89
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:27,480
With pleasure.

90
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,829
The young teacher died one night,
silently.

91
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:41,048
The Algerians carried his body away.
I never heard him speak.

92
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,929
I'm not sad.
He's in a better place.

93
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:50,979
All debts will be paid one day.

94
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:53,066
Mister Gerbier.

95
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:59,329
I wish to speak with you tonight.

96
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:28,554
There are two obstacles to escape;
barbed wire and guards.

97
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,685
We can pass under the barbed wire,

98
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:36,903
and I can blind the guards
by turning off all the lights.

99
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:40,035
Why haven't you escaped yet?

100
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:45,254
I didn't want to escape alone,
and leave Armelle.

101
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,385
But I trust you.

102
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:50,472
Why are you telling me this?

103
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:53,603
I think you're needed on the outside.

104
00:16:56,735 --> 00:16:58,823
Turn off the light and go to sleep.

105
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:00,909
Good night.

106
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:02,491
Secretly, between us,

107
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:04,578
the escape plan was taking shape.

108
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:06,666
Little by little.

109
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:51,547
Gerbier, come here.

110
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,634
Get ready.

111
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:05,116
Hurry please.

112
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:44,776
Please salute Legrain for me.

113
00:19:53,128 --> 00:19:54,171
- There are the bastards.
- But...

114
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:56,259
Farewell, Sir.

115
00:20:29,658 --> 00:20:31,745
Allow me, please.

116
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:32,788
Thanks.

117
00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:42,750
There's just one chance.

118
00:23:43,794 --> 00:23:45,882
I'll ask the soldier for something,

119
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:52,145
and then you'll cross the two gates.

120
00:23:55,275 --> 00:23:56,318
Good luck.

121
00:25:43,824 --> 00:25:46,955
Excuse me sir, do you have a cigarette?

122
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:54,798
What do you want?

123
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,061
I'd like a shave.

124
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,299
<i>Marechal has said... Marechal has accomplished...
Marechal keeps his promises.</i>

125
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:45,436
There you go.

126
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:52,742
I'll get your change.

127
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:55,872
- No wait...
- Wait for your change.

128
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:04,223
Take this.

129
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:10,485
Not very much, but it's all I have.

130
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:12,572
Thank you.

131
00:29:27,185 --> 00:29:32,404
Paul Dounat received orders
from his organization.

132
00:29:33,449 --> 00:29:39,709
He had to be in front of
the Marseilles courts

133
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:43,884
at noon, and wait there
for a friend he knew.

134
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:15,198
Police. Papers please.

135
00:30:23,548 --> 00:30:26,678
All right.
But follow me anyway.

136
00:30:26,678 --> 00:30:27,721
For a simple check.

137
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:09,473
Dirty job.

138
00:31:10,517 --> 00:31:13,646
Felix, put on your hat.

139
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:15,733
No need in the car.

140
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:21,996
This is the guy who betrayed you.

141
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:28,260
I don't think there's any need to question you.

142
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:43,917
We should have refused him.
It's my fault.

143
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:48,090
So much to do,
and such little help.

144
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,178
Bison, faster please.

145
00:31:51,222 --> 00:31:53,309
They'll notice us.

146
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:58,529
I'm also in a hurry.
I have to repair a radio,

147
00:32:00,615 --> 00:32:04,790
and a young agent's bicycle.
And prepare tonight's reception.

148
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,878
Do you have the fake papers?

149
00:32:06,878 --> 00:32:10,008
Yes, do you want them now?

150
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:37,146
The car must stay here.

151
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:38,190
It might be noticed.

152
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,322
- We'll take a walk.
- I'll come with you.

153
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:42,365
Not necessary.

154
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:43,408
Indeed.

155
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:49,671
I suppose not.

156
00:32:58,021 --> 00:33:01,153
I'll pick you up later tonight.

157
00:33:32,465 --> 00:33:34,552
One false move, and I shoot you.

158
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:55,426
Hell, when we rented this house,
the other one was empty!

159
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:56,470
Let's go anyway.

160
00:34:05,863 --> 00:34:07,952
This way.

161
00:34:08,996 --> 00:34:11,083
Is he the traitor that we're supposed to...

162
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,126
Yes, he is.

163
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,215
And are you the boss?

164
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:27,783
He is Claude LeMasque.
He's asked for harder assignments.

165
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,914
I came one hour earlier
to get everything ready...

166
00:34:30,914 --> 00:34:35,090
and noticed that
some neighbors had arrived.

167
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,176
There was nobody yesterday!

168
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:40,307
I called immediately,
but you had already left.

169
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:42,396
It'll be alright.

170
00:34:42,396 --> 00:34:45,526
We can begin the interrogating.

171
00:34:45,526 --> 00:34:47,615
I prepared chairs, desk, paper...

172
00:34:48,658 --> 00:34:49,702
This is not a trial.

173
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:51,790
Here's what it's about.

174
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,920
No way!
The neighbors will hear everything!

175
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:57,008
Listen...

176
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:01,182
The walls are paper-thin.

177
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,314
The English didn't deliver on
the silenced guns we requested.

178
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:07,446
Let's look for a better place.

179
00:35:13,707 --> 00:35:14,751
How could you do it?

180
00:35:23,102 --> 00:35:24,145
There's no better place.

181
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:26,232
The cellar won't work.

182
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:30,408
And neither will the attic.

183
00:35:33,538 --> 00:35:34,582
We will need a good knife.

184
00:35:37,714 --> 00:35:38,758
Bison has one.

185
00:35:39,801 --> 00:35:41,887
A knife? Are you kidding?

186
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:43,976
I can't let you do that.

187
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,151
Felix! Go look for something
in the kitchen.

188
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:51,282
Please don't do this.
It's murder!

189
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:54,414
We are here to kill, regardless.

190
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:58,588
That's true, but not like this.

191
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:00,676
I know what you mean.

192
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:06,938
I swear I am not scared,
but this is my first time ...

193
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:11,113
This is our first time also,
can't you see?

194
00:36:12,157 --> 00:36:13,201
I didn't find anything.

195
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:18,420
Maybe we could wait for Bison?

196
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,464
No, out of the question.

197
00:36:19,464 --> 00:36:22,594
We must finish it now.

198
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,683
Bloody hell!

199
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,857
We can't just smash his head in, can we?

200
00:36:31,988 --> 00:36:34,076
Gag him.

201
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:18,956
We must strangle him.

202
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:24,175
With our bare hands?

203
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,307
No.
There's a towel in the kitchen.

204
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:44,006
Enough!
You came here for this!

205
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:49,225
You wanted a harder assignment?
Here it is, so don't complain.

206
00:38:19,494 --> 00:38:21,581
Make him sit down.

207
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:23,668
Felix, go behind.

208
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,800
I will hold his hands
and Masque will grab his legs.

209
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:40,368
I promise you won't suffer.

210
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:33,093
We're leaving.

211
00:40:34,136 --> 00:40:35,180
I'm coming.

212
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,967
I could not imagine
this was possible.

213
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:56,054
Neither could I.

214
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,317
Get some cyanide pills.

215
00:41:03,362 --> 00:41:06,492
And if you're arrested, eat them.

216
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,623
I will.

217
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,123
A glass of rum.

218
00:43:12,785 --> 00:43:13,830
- Jean François!
- Felix!

219
00:43:18,003 --> 00:43:21,135
It's been a long time.
Still young and handsome.

220
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:24,266
What are you doing in Marseilles?

221
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:28,442
I moved my workshop here from Paris.

222
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:29,486
And you?

223
00:43:30,528 --> 00:43:31,572
Nothing special.

224
00:43:34,704 --> 00:43:37,835
I have to go.
Can you walk a bit with me?

225
00:43:37,835 --> 00:43:38,879
Alright, let's go.

226
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:44,098
Can you wait five minutes?

227
00:43:44,098 --> 00:43:46,184
Five minutes.
Not my whole life.

228
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:59,753
Always lucky!

229
00:44:00,797 --> 00:44:02,885
A bit risky to wear a pilot's jacket?

230
00:44:03,929 --> 00:44:04,971
Fuck them.

231
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,059
- And then?
- And then what?

232
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,191
Just fuck them?

233
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:13,322
What else? Fight?

234
00:44:13,322 --> 00:44:15,410
I know some more exciting things.

235
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:17,497
Really exciting?

236
00:44:17,497 --> 00:44:18,541
Yes.

237
00:44:19,584 --> 00:44:23,759
You'll have to get up early,
sleep on the train, on the road,

238
00:44:24,803 --> 00:44:26,891
without reasons or explanations.

239
00:44:26,891 --> 00:44:27,935
I'm interested.

240
00:44:30,022 --> 00:44:32,110
Come and see me tomorrow,
here's my address.

241
00:44:33,153 --> 00:44:35,241
No, don't write it down.
Just remember it.

242
00:44:35,241 --> 00:44:37,328
And never tell a soul.

243
00:44:37,328 --> 00:44:38,371
Of course.

244
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:40,459
Everyone says that...
but even a girlfriend...

245
00:44:40,459 --> 00:44:41,503
I don't have one.

246
00:44:41,503 --> 00:44:42,548
The girl in the bar?

247
00:44:42,548 --> 00:44:45,678
I told her 5 minutes...
she'll have to wait a few more.

248
00:44:45,678 --> 00:44:47,765
Parents you like to talk with...

249
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:49,853
They all died.

250
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,984
Just one brother,
who stayed in Paris.

251
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:58,203
I love him.
But would never confide in him.

252
00:45:06,553 --> 00:45:09,685
<i>Theater and Music Center.</i>

253
00:45:15,948 --> 00:45:18,034
Do you have an appointment?

254
00:45:18,034 --> 00:45:19,078
With Mr. Russel.

255
00:45:20,122 --> 00:45:21,165
This way, please.

256
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:37,865
I came as quickly as I could.

257
00:45:37,865 --> 00:45:39,953
It's very urgent indeed.

258
00:45:39,953 --> 00:45:43,083
How many people to board
for Gibraltar?

259
00:45:44,128 --> 00:45:46,215
Two canadian officers,
from Dieppe commando,

260
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:49,347
three aviators from R.A.F.,

261
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:53,521
and also two Belgians
sentenced to death by Germans.

262
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:55,608
Eight including me.

263
00:45:55,608 --> 00:45:59,784
Where will they wait for the submarine?
The doctor's clinic is under surveillance.

264
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:06,047
Couldn't we send them outside,
a few at a time?

265
00:46:06,047 --> 00:46:08,133
No, too dangerous.

266
00:46:09,177 --> 00:46:14,397
A Canadian officer will want to go into a café
and talk, forgetting his accent.

267
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:20,659
We will be informed of the submarine
arrival just one day in advance.

268
00:46:21,703 --> 00:46:24,833
Everyone must go to the Viella farm.

269
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:25,877
Everyone?

270
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:30,052
It's not very safe...

271
00:46:30,052 --> 00:46:32,140
We are not an insurance company.

272
00:46:33,184 --> 00:46:35,271
On the contrary, indeed!

273
00:46:36,315 --> 00:46:39,445
You must choose a real trustworthy man
to supervise everything.

274
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:44,664
I have this man.
You don't know him.

275
00:46:44,664 --> 00:46:48,839
He did a very good job
on several recent missions.

276
00:46:49,883 --> 00:46:53,016
He is now in Paris.
To deliver a new radio to Matilda.

277
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:58,233
- When will he be back?
- Tomorrow morning.

278
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:02,409
Contact him immediately.
Everything must be ready by tomorrow night.

279
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:04,495
I'll be there at the last second.

280
00:47:06,584 --> 00:47:08,671
And take a break.

281
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,758
When you will be gone.

282
00:47:10,758 --> 00:47:13,889
No, now.
There'll be no time after that.

283
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:06,076
<i>The luggages will be checked
inside the station.</i>

284
00:48:48,871 --> 00:48:49,913
Need some help?

285
00:49:21,226 --> 00:49:22,270
Goodbye.

286
00:49:36,883 --> 00:49:38,969
Open your case.

287
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:46,276
No smuggled goods?

288
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:47,319
No.

289
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:48,362
What is this?

290
00:49:51,495 --> 00:49:53,582
Just a radio.

291
00:49:53,582 --> 00:49:55,669
Okay, you can go.

292
00:50:04,019 --> 00:50:06,107
Madam, please, luggage check.

293
00:50:36,374 --> 00:50:37,419
Any trouble?

294
00:50:39,507 --> 00:50:42,638
Not really. Stopped twice.

295
00:50:56,206 --> 00:51:00,381
Tell Felix we need a new quartz.
The frequency has changed.

296
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:03,513
Alright. May I help you?

297
00:51:04,558 --> 00:51:05,600
Certainly not.

298
00:51:46,307 --> 00:51:47,351
The second radio is in the case.

299
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:49,437
Okay. Want something to eat?

300
00:51:49,437 --> 00:51:50,481
No, thanks. I'm going to surprise someone...

301
00:52:46,843 --> 00:52:48,931
Hello, Saint-Luc!

302
00:52:51,019 --> 00:52:52,062
Ah, little Jean!

303
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,324
Still so many books around...

304
00:52:59,368 --> 00:53:01,455
And the music instruments...

305
00:53:04,587 --> 00:53:06,674
Nothing's changed.

306
00:53:06,674 --> 00:53:09,806
The temperature has changed!

307
00:53:09,806 --> 00:53:13,980
So I bought this,
in order to avoid freezing.

308
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:20,242
I stay there when I work at night
or when I eat.

309
00:53:20,242 --> 00:53:23,375
But how did you get here?

310
00:53:24,419 --> 00:53:25,462
Hope you have a permit.

311
00:53:25,462 --> 00:53:28,593
Oh! Saint-Luc is back to earth.

312
00:53:28,593 --> 00:53:32,768
He knows about the permit!

313
00:53:32,768 --> 00:53:35,899
Of course I've got one.
And even...

314
00:53:36,943 --> 00:53:39,031
...and I'm even very hungry.

315
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:40,074
We're going to eat.

316
00:53:40,074 --> 00:53:41,118
Marie.

317
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:42,162
Yes, Mr. Luc.

318
00:53:43,205 --> 00:53:45,292
What do we have on today's menu?

319
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:47,380
Some rutabaga like yesterday.

320
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:49,468
And?

321
00:53:49,468 --> 00:53:51,555
Some unticketed cheese.

322
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:57,819
A little butter, but no bread.

323
00:53:57,819 --> 00:53:59,904
I have tickets for bread,

324
00:54:01,993 --> 00:54:04,080
and I can give all of them to you.

325
00:54:08,255 --> 00:54:11,387
You're not resourceful.
You're still greedy.

326
00:54:11,387 --> 00:54:14,516
So I am, but what can I do?

327
00:54:14,516 --> 00:54:17,649
What about smuggling?

328
00:54:17,649 --> 00:54:19,736
Marie is afraid of cops...
And I...

329
00:54:19,736 --> 00:54:20,780
And you also...

330
00:54:38,524 --> 00:54:40,611
It's becoming warmer.

331
00:54:43,743 --> 00:54:46,873
I felt very warm this morning.
Twice.

332
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,136
So many people on the train or the metro...

333
00:54:57,311 --> 00:55:03,573
I was wondering if Matilda,
that I knew only a little bit...

334
00:55:03,573 --> 00:55:06,704
was not closer to me than you,
my brother,

335
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:11,923
who I have so much love for,
but with whom I share so few things.

336
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:26,536
I went back to Marseilles the same day,

337
00:55:27,579 --> 00:55:32,798
but today I had a very strange feeling.

338
00:56:36,466 --> 00:56:39,598
Hello Mrs. Vialla.
Your home has become an hotel!

339
00:56:43,772 --> 00:56:44,816
Hello!

340
00:56:46,905 --> 00:56:47,949
- Hello!
- Good evening sir.

341
00:56:55,254 --> 00:56:57,341
The fishing boat will await you
after midnight.

342
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:59,428
Maybe you can all sail together.

343
00:56:59,428 --> 00:57:04,648
Mrs. Vialla's daughter
will lead you there, surreptitiously.

344
00:57:04,648 --> 00:57:05,691
Perfect.

345
00:57:05,691 --> 00:57:07,778
Am I leaving?

346
00:57:07,778 --> 00:57:10,910
No. There's one more passenger.
Unexpected.

347
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:12,997
The big boss.

348
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:16,129
But he will not sail with us.
We're full.

349
00:57:16,129 --> 00:57:18,216
You will board with him.
Somewhere else.

350
00:57:18,216 --> 00:57:19,260
Bison will bring him.

351
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:23,434
You'll wait for my light signal.
Three short and one long.

352
00:57:23,434 --> 00:57:24,478
Got it.

353
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:33,873
Madame, we will leave.
How much do I owe you?

354
00:57:33,873 --> 00:57:35,961
You can pay later.

355
00:57:38,046 --> 00:57:40,134
You already told me that before.

356
00:57:40,134 --> 00:57:42,222
Yet you came back,
so you must like the welcome.

357
00:57:45,354 --> 00:57:47,441
You will walk in single file.

358
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:51,616
Not too near,
but always keeping watch over each other.

359
00:57:51,616 --> 00:57:56,834
Not a sound, not a word.

360
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,978
Keep quiet, I have a gun!

361
00:58:47,978 --> 00:58:51,109
- What are you doing here at night?
- And you?

362
00:58:51,109 --> 00:58:53,197
I'm Mrs. Vialla's brother-in-law.

363
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,284
The nurse?

364
00:58:56,329 --> 00:58:59,458
I'm verifying that everything is alright.

365
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:00,502
And then?

366
00:59:00,502 --> 00:59:03,634
It's okay, a police patrol has just departed.

367
00:59:03,634 --> 00:59:08,852
Germans are too few and get lost.
So they trust the customs.

368
00:59:08,852 --> 00:59:09,897
And the customs?

369
00:59:09,897 --> 00:59:13,028
The customs? But I am the customs!

370
00:59:13,028 --> 00:59:15,114
I am the only one in charge
in this area.

371
00:59:15,114 --> 00:59:16,159
No kidding!

372
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,040
Get on board!

373
01:00:30,265 --> 01:00:31,308
Good luck, boss.

374
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:41,746
So strange to think the big boss
looks like any other man.

375
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:48,008
Here in this boat, where base and
tip of the pyramid meet.

376
01:00:51,139 --> 01:00:53,227
Strange.

377
01:00:53,227 --> 01:00:56,358
I'll have to talk with Saint-Luc
about it after the war.

378
01:01:09,926 --> 01:01:13,059
Watch your steps sir.

379
01:01:39,151 --> 01:01:41,240
I'm so happy to be travelling with you.

380
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,283
I feel the same.

381
01:02:56,597 --> 01:02:58,685
I cannot deliver you all the weapons
you asked me for.

382
01:02:59,728 --> 01:03:04,947
The English don't believe too much in
the efficiency of the French resistance.

383
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:08,079
They want to keep as many planes
as possible to bomb Germany.

384
01:03:09,123 --> 01:03:11,209
But we will improve
your transmission equipment.

385
01:03:11,209 --> 01:03:15,385
So we'll send you some radio operators,

386
01:03:15,385 --> 01:03:18,516
and we'll help your agents

387
01:03:18,516 --> 01:03:21,647
to improve the landing place
that we will really need for later.

388
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:37,799
The war will be over for the French
when they can see this wonderful movie.

389
01:10:12,634 --> 01:10:15,763
I heard Felix was arrested today.

390
01:10:20,978 --> 01:10:23,064
<i>Free France</i>

391
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:29,322
I still had many things
to do in London,

392
01:10:30,261 --> 01:10:35,476
but I decided to go back to France
that same day.

393
01:12:09,452 --> 01:12:12,581
Have you ever parachuted before?

394
01:12:12,581 --> 01:12:13,624
Never.

395
01:12:13,624 --> 01:12:17,796
When your feet hit the ground,

396
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:23,011
don't try to stay upright.
Bend your knees and fall, understood?

397
01:12:23,011 --> 01:12:23,950
I think so.

398
01:20:35,315 --> 01:20:40,530
Matilda moved to Lyon
during my absence.

399
01:20:41,573 --> 01:20:46,788
She's a great leader.
I made her my assistant.

400
01:21:13,907 --> 01:21:19,122
The boss already told me how
wonderful she was.

401
01:21:20,165 --> 01:21:26,423
But I'm still surprised by her skill
in giving and receiving orders.

402
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:32,472
She studied the map of Gestapo
headquarters for hours.

403
01:21:32,472 --> 01:21:35,810
She finally discovered where
Felix was imprisoned.

404
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:40,921
A jail for prisoners that they
absolutely need information from.

405
01:21:42,068 --> 01:21:46,240
At first, she wanted to use a bomb.

406
01:21:47,283 --> 01:21:53,541
Then she made another plan,
which required a disguise.

407
01:22:17,531 --> 01:22:21,703
She arranged for me a new place
for my headquaters.

408
01:22:30,047 --> 01:22:33,176
No place is more secure or pleasant.

409
01:22:33,176 --> 01:22:40,477
My host is now the Baron de Ferte,
an ex-cavalry officer.

410
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,563
Before the war,

411
01:22:43,606 --> 01:22:45,692
the Republic was my enemy.

412
01:22:46,735 --> 01:22:50,907
With my tenant farmer, and my servant,

413
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:55,079
I had created a little army
equipped with guns and pikes...

414
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:57,165
to assault the prefecture

415
01:22:58,208 --> 01:22:59,251
on horseback

416
01:23:00,294 --> 01:23:03,423
in the case of royalist insurrection.

417
01:23:07,596 --> 01:23:12,811
This militia still exists,
and is used to protect me now.

418
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:21,155
The Baron himself suggested use of
his field for landing and dropping.

419
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:25,327
We did as he wished and even more.

420
01:23:29,499 --> 01:23:31,585
Strange carousel...

421
01:24:06,004 --> 01:24:09,134
While the first airplane is landing...

422
01:24:09,134 --> 01:24:13,306
the second one keeps on flying
at low altitude...

423
01:24:13,306 --> 01:24:18,521
to cover up the sound of the
first plane's landing and take-off.

424
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:20,398
And then they switch.

425
01:24:22,484 --> 01:24:27,908
This night, four men left for London,
and four men arrived from there.

426
01:24:27,908 --> 01:24:32,080
Bison, Le Masque, Jean-Francois
et Matilda were supervising.

427
01:25:46,134 --> 01:25:49,263
Does your husband know
about your activities?

428
01:25:50,306 --> 01:25:51,349
No he doesn't.

429
01:25:52,392 --> 01:25:53,435
Nor does my daughter.

430
01:26:01,779 --> 01:26:04,908
Here she is.
17 years old.

431
01:26:06,994 --> 01:26:08,037
Don't keep it with you.

432
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:12,210
You're right. I won't.

433
01:26:13,253 --> 01:26:16,382
Before anything else,

434
01:26:18,468 --> 01:26:22,640
we must talk about Felix.

435
01:26:23,683 --> 01:26:25,769
I know Felix doesn't have
prussic acid pills.

436
01:26:26,812 --> 01:26:32,027
I'm not afraid of him talking,
but he has no way to escape torture.

437
01:26:33,904 --> 01:26:36,199
The Gestapo will not give in.

438
01:26:37,242 --> 01:26:42,457
And he will suffer for days, maybe weeks...

439
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:44,543
I know that.

440
01:26:45,586 --> 01:26:46,629
There aren't many possibilities.

441
01:26:46,629 --> 01:26:47,672
Did you find one?

442
01:26:48,715 --> 01:26:51,844
Yes. Enter the Gestapo
and leave with Felix.

443
01:26:54,973 --> 01:27:01,231
Matilda, I want to rescue Felix.
But not at any cost.

444
01:27:01,231 --> 01:27:03,317
I cannot sacrifice anyone.

445
01:27:03,317 --> 01:27:05,403
I don't need many men.

446
01:27:05,403 --> 01:27:09,575
With Le Masque, Jean-Francois,
Bison and me, I can make it.

447
01:27:09,575 --> 01:27:10,618
No problem.

448
01:27:13,747 --> 01:27:14,791
What is your plan?

449
01:27:14,791 --> 01:27:17,920
Bison, can you get three
german officer's uniforms?

450
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:18,963
Of course.

451
01:27:20,006 --> 01:27:21,049
Do it then.

452
01:27:22,092 --> 01:27:26,264
The problem is how to contact
and inform Felix.

453
01:27:27,307 --> 01:27:30,436
I haven't figured it out yet,
but I will.

454
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:35,651
Because he must be ready
when we will come.

455
01:27:36,694 --> 01:27:38,780
I have tried to contact him
for a week now.

456
01:27:39,823 --> 01:27:43,995
But that building is very
strictly guarded.

457
01:27:45,038 --> 01:27:47,124
Yes, not so easy to enter.

458
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:50,253
- Careful it's warm.
- Thanks.

459
01:28:40,318 --> 01:28:41,361
<i>Mr. Gerbier</i>

460
01:28:43,447 --> 01:28:48,662
<i>I don't have the courage of
Le Masque nor the strength of Bison.</i>

461
01:28:50,748 --> 01:28:52,834
<i>Nor the skills of Matilda.</i>

462
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,006
<i>I will not participate in this escape plan</i>

463
01:28:59,092 --> 01:29:05,350
<i>But I'm sure that
my comrades will succeed.</i>

464
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:10,565
<i>Don't try to find out
what happened to me.</i>

465
01:30:04,802 --> 01:30:12,103
<i>Mr. Dupont knows much of
the resistance movement.</i>

466
01:30:24,515 --> 01:30:25,558
How did you make it?

467
01:30:26,601 --> 01:30:27,644
Well...

468
01:30:34,945 --> 01:30:38,074
We will use only two uniforms.

469
01:30:39,117 --> 01:30:41,204
I know, Mrs. Matilda.

470
01:31:30,225 --> 01:31:32,311
I won't let you do it without me.

471
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:35,440
And I won't let you go with us!

472
01:31:36,483 --> 01:31:38,569
Remember what you said,

473
01:31:39,612 --> 01:31:41,698
"I cannot sacrifice anyone."

474
01:31:41,698 --> 01:31:44,828
Especially if "anyone" is you.

475
01:31:45,871 --> 01:31:47,957
But Matilda, why you instead of me?

476
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,043
Listen.

477
01:31:51,086 --> 01:31:57,344
Two men won't be noticed.
But three men would.

478
01:31:57,344 --> 01:32:00,473
When Jean-François was still there,
you asked for three uniforms.

479
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:06,731
But at least, I would have taken
only Le Masque and Le Bison.

480
01:32:06,731 --> 01:32:08,817
Jean-Francois...

481
01:32:10,903 --> 01:32:11,946
I trusted him.

482
01:32:12,989 --> 01:32:15,075
Me too, that's not what I meant.

483
01:32:17,161 --> 01:32:21,333
But... I could never imagine
he would leave us this way.

484
01:33:39,351 --> 01:33:40,602
<i>Who's that man?</i>

485
01:33:40,602 --> 01:33:42,688
<i>He was denounced by an anonymous letter.</i>

486
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:54,162
You can enter.

487
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:25,452
Naturally, is Dupont your real name?

488
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:26,495
Of course.

489
01:34:26,495 --> 01:34:28,581
Which organization do you belong?

490
01:34:29,624 --> 01:34:30,667
I don't know what you mean.

491
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:33,796
Do you understand the consequences?

492
01:34:36,925 --> 01:34:42,140
You will be shot under this name
and no one will know what happened to you.

493
01:35:22,818 --> 01:35:25,947
I decided to leave this place.
Perhaps a premonition?

494
01:35:25,947 --> 01:35:32,205
Three days after, Baron de Ferte
and his men were arrested and shot.

495
01:36:36,664 --> 01:36:42,087
We must take a man named Felix
Lepercq to Paris...

496
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:46,259
to the headquarters of
Oberstufuhrer Bolmerburg.

497
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:49,388
- Felix Lepercq?
- Yes, a terrorist.

498
01:36:49,388 --> 01:36:51,474
Hurry up, it's urgent.

499
01:36:51,474 --> 01:36:52,517
Get down.

500
01:37:35,281 --> 01:37:36,324
One moment, please.

501
01:39:46,701 --> 01:39:50,873
An ambulance from Paris Gestapo...

502
01:39:50,873 --> 01:39:55,045
wants to take terrorist
Felix Lepercq.

503
01:39:54,002 --> 01:39:59,217
Make an on-duty Doctor come and give
the transfer authorization.

504
01:41:44,562 --> 01:41:46,648
Felix.

505
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:51,863
Felix can you hear me?

506
01:41:52,906 --> 01:41:54,992
Matilda, Le Bison and Le Masque
are here.

507
01:41:56,035 --> 01:42:01,250
I will help you.
Are you in a lot of pain?

508
01:42:51,315 --> 01:42:52,358
It's not possible.

509
01:42:55,487 --> 01:42:56,530
He will suffer a lot,

510
01:42:58,408 --> 01:42:59,659
until he dies.

511
01:43:53,896 --> 01:44:00,154
Impossible. I can't let you
transfer a dying man. Sorry.

512
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,369
Okay, I will report this.

513
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:57,363
Felix.

514
01:46:58,406 --> 01:46:59,449
I have several prussic acid pills.

515
01:47:00,492 --> 01:47:01,535
Do you want one?

516
01:47:33,868 --> 01:47:35,954
We could have saved Felix.

517
01:47:35,954 --> 01:47:36,997
No.

518
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:40,127
No one and nothing could.

519
01:47:42,213 --> 01:47:43,256
Not even you.

520
01:47:49,514 --> 01:47:52,643
Besides, every policeman is looking for you.

521
01:47:52,643 --> 01:47:55,772
You should disappear for awhile.

522
01:47:56,815 --> 01:47:58,901
The next airplane is yours.

523
01:47:59,944 --> 01:48:00,987
You're not serious?

524
01:48:02,030 --> 01:48:05,159
Resistance organizations are rising
from everywhere.

525
01:48:06,202 --> 01:48:11,417
We must unite them, train them,
supply them.

526
01:48:13,503 --> 01:48:15,589
There's nobody to replace me now.

527
01:48:17,675 --> 01:48:21,847
If you get arrested, we will
replace you however we can.

528
01:48:42,708 --> 01:48:43,751
Police!

529
01:48:45,837 --> 01:48:48,966
So, is the food good here?

530
01:48:50,009 --> 01:48:53,138
You have meat at every meal,
and without tickets?

531
01:48:54,181 --> 01:48:57,310
We will check all papers.

532
01:49:01,482 --> 01:49:02,525
Hurry up, let's go.

533
01:50:22,837 --> 01:50:23,880
I'll keep it, for later.

534
01:51:49,407 --> 01:51:54,623
He says "Finish your smoke. They're
coming and I don't want trouble."

535
01:51:54,623 --> 01:51:56,709
Everyone has his own troubles.

536
01:52:12,354 --> 01:52:13,397
This time is the last one.

537
01:53:53,526 --> 01:53:57,699
The word "Love" makes sense to me
only when I think of the boss.

538
01:53:58,742 --> 01:54:00,828
He's more important to me
than anything.

539
01:54:00,828 --> 01:54:03,957
More than everything.
But not more than life.

540
01:54:03,957 --> 01:54:07,920
If Luc Jardie would die,
I would still like to live.

541
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:10,006
And I'm going to die.

542
01:54:10,215 --> 01:54:12,092
And I'm not afraid.

543
01:54:13,344 --> 01:54:15,430
How is that possible?

544
01:54:16,473 --> 01:54:19,602
It's because I'm too narrow-minded
to believe it.

545
01:54:20,645 --> 01:54:24,817
And if I don't believe it
until the last moment,

546
01:54:24,817 --> 01:54:25,860
I will never die.

547
01:54:27,946 --> 01:54:31,909
What a discovery!
The boss would like the idea.

548
01:54:33,161 --> 01:54:35,247
I must explore this discovery.

549
01:54:35,247 --> 01:54:36,290
I must...

550
01:56:29,979 --> 01:56:35,194
You will turn your back to the
machine-gun and face the wall.

551
01:56:35,194 --> 01:56:37,280
And then you will run
as fast as you can.

552
01:56:38,323 --> 01:56:39,366
We will not shoot immediately.

553
01:56:39,366 --> 01:56:41,452
We will give you a chance.

554
01:56:41,452 --> 01:56:46,667
If you get to the wall, you'll
be shot in the next round instead.

555
01:56:47,710 --> 01:56:49,796
We can try anyway.

556
01:56:49,796 --> 01:56:50,839
Nothing to lose.

557
01:56:51,882 --> 01:56:56,054
He knows about my legs.
He's waiting for the show.

558
01:56:57,097 --> 01:57:00,226
And I feel more tied by his certainty
than by my chains.

559
01:57:06,485 --> 01:57:07,528
Go!

560
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:14,829
I don't want to run.

561
01:57:14,829 --> 01:57:15,872
I won't.

562
01:59:21,034 --> 01:59:25,206
The most important thing was to time
it precisely. Matilda did.

563
01:59:26,249 --> 01:59:29,378
Oh, it was easy
with all the information we had.

564
01:59:32,507 --> 01:59:34,593
And if I didn't run?

565
01:59:37,722 --> 01:59:41,894
Something wrong?
Thinking about those who didn't run?

566
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:47,109
No, thinking about this officer,
was what convinced me to run.

567
01:59:47,109 --> 01:59:49,195
Like a rabbit in panic!

568
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:14,723
Go on.

569
02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:03,196
It's good to be safe.

570
02:03:19,885 --> 02:03:21,971
Enough for one month.

571
02:03:21,971 --> 02:03:24,891
There is drinking water, but I'll try
to bring you some wine.

572
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:27,186
No way, see you in a month.

573
02:03:28,229 --> 02:03:29,272
All right.

574
02:03:35,530 --> 02:03:39,702
I'm gonna leave.
Somebody could spot the car.

575
02:03:39,702 --> 02:03:40,745
Okay.

576
02:03:47,003 --> 02:03:50,132
Treat your arm and your leg.
It might get infected.

577
02:03:53,261 --> 02:03:55,347
I put a shaver on the table.

578
02:04:53,756 --> 02:04:57,928
I'm by myself for three weeks,
like a timid animal.

579
02:04:58,971 --> 02:05:05,229
I write a long report for London,
and try to believe I'm still useful.

580
02:06:23,455 --> 02:06:25,542
I haven't seen Matilda
or anyone since.

581
02:07:03,090 --> 02:07:08,305
I read the five books Luc Jardie
wrote before the war.

582
02:07:08,305 --> 02:07:10,391
They keep me company.

583
02:07:34,381 --> 02:07:38,553
At night, Jean-Francois'
disappearance haunts me.

584
02:08:45,306 --> 02:08:47,392
Le Bison or Le Masque?

585
02:08:54,693 --> 02:08:56,779
But it's ... you!

586
02:09:12,424 --> 02:09:14,510
I have to talk to you.

587
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:15,553
When did you come back?

588
02:09:15,553 --> 02:09:19,725
Four days ago.
Since Matilda was arrested.

589
02:09:22,854 --> 02:09:23,897
Matilda?

590
02:09:29,112 --> 02:09:31,198
We have to talk about her tonight.

591
02:09:34,328 --> 02:09:35,371
We have to, Philippe.

592
02:09:39,543 --> 02:09:43,715
They didn't hurt her.

593
02:09:44,758 --> 02:09:46,844
She got in touch with us.

594
02:09:48,930 --> 02:09:52,059
Gestapo found her real name
very quickly,

595
02:09:53,102 --> 02:09:54,979
and where her family was living.

596
02:09:55,188 --> 02:09:58,317
She had her daughter's picture,

597
02:10:00,403 --> 02:10:01,446
and you can guess what happened...

598
02:10:02,489 --> 02:10:03,532
That picture?

599
02:10:04,575 --> 02:10:06,661
This was her only mistake.

600
02:10:07,704 --> 02:10:12,919
The Germans quickly found her weakness.

601
02:10:14,797 --> 02:10:17,091
Why did she keep the picture?

602
02:10:17,091 --> 02:10:19,177
I told her!

603
02:10:19,177 --> 02:10:20,220
Listen to this,

604
02:10:21,263 --> 02:10:23,349
She begged the Germans to give her
the picture back.

605
02:10:24,184 --> 02:10:26,270
What do you mean?

606
02:10:26,478 --> 02:10:29,607
Matilda sent us an S.O.S.
The Germans gave her two choices.

607
02:10:30,650 --> 02:10:33,779
Tell everything she knows
about the organization,

608
02:10:33,779 --> 02:10:38,995
or they will send her daughter
to Poland as a prostitute.

609
02:10:42,124 --> 02:10:44,210
Now you know everything.

610
02:10:46,296 --> 02:10:48,382
We have to find a solution.

611
02:10:49,425 --> 02:10:50,468
Could she escape?

612
02:10:50,468 --> 02:10:54,640
No, she can't escape,
nor commit suicide.

613
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:56,726
Matilda will never give up
her daughter to the gestapo.

614
02:10:58,812 --> 02:10:59,855
Can she stall time?

615
02:11:00,898 --> 02:11:02,984
Until when?

616
02:11:02,984 --> 02:11:06,113
It's not a solution.

617
02:11:06,113 --> 02:11:07,156
Here comes Le Bison.

618
02:11:08,199 --> 02:11:11,328
Don't tell him I'm here.

619
02:11:12,371 --> 02:11:13,414
Go in that room.

620
02:11:56,073 --> 02:11:58,160
Here are some new glasses.

621
02:11:58,160 --> 02:12:00,246
Thanks.

622
02:12:14,952 --> 02:12:15,995
Any news from Matilda?

623
02:12:20,063 --> 02:12:21,106
What's going on?

624
02:12:21,106 --> 02:12:22,149
I know nothing.

625
02:12:22,149 --> 02:12:23,192
What?

626
02:12:24,235 --> 02:12:27,364
I don't. Here's a letter.

627
02:13:09,085 --> 02:13:14,300
Matilda was released yesterday.
And two comrades were arrested today.

628
02:13:15,447 --> 02:13:16,386
Is it so?

629
02:13:18,576 --> 02:13:19,515
If they say it is.

630
02:13:28,902 --> 02:13:32,135
Le Masque, you knew this?

631
02:13:34,221 --> 02:13:36,307
I'm not in charge of this report.

632
02:13:39,332 --> 02:13:42,461
Matilda is to be killed immediately.

633
02:13:44,547 --> 02:13:45,590
I can't believe it.

634
02:13:48,824 --> 02:13:51,848
I will never hurt Mrs. Matilda.

635
02:13:52,996 --> 02:13:54,039
I have been working with her.

636
02:13:54,039 --> 02:13:56,125
She saved me once.

637
02:13:56,125 --> 02:13:59,254
This is a great woman!

638
02:14:00,297 --> 02:14:04,469
Men...as many as you want...

639
02:14:06,555 --> 02:14:10,727
But Mrs. Matilda, never!

640
02:14:11,770 --> 02:14:12,813
We will not discuss about it.

641
02:14:13,752 --> 02:14:15,838
She must disappear and she will.

642
02:14:15,838 --> 02:14:16,881
You won't do it!

643
02:14:16,881 --> 02:14:21,053
We have other killers.
If necessary, I will do it.

644
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:25,225
You won't.
You don't have the right.

645
02:14:26,372 --> 02:14:28,354
You could have run as a champion...

646
02:14:29,501 --> 02:14:32,630
you would be dead already
if not for Mrs. Matilda.

647
02:14:38,888 --> 02:14:39,931
You won't do it.

648
02:14:40,766 --> 02:14:45,146
She can give me to the Gestapo,
she protected me, and you,

649
02:14:46,190 --> 02:14:47,233
and now,
she's protecting her daughter.

650
02:14:47,233 --> 02:14:48,276
Can we blame her?

651
02:14:48,276 --> 02:14:51,300
Enough!
The decision is made.

652
02:14:57,663 --> 02:15:02,773
If you're as cowardly as that,
I'll kill you first!

653
02:15:20,609 --> 02:15:21,652
Stop it!

654
02:15:21,652 --> 02:15:25,720
Shut your mouth! You were still a child
when I started commanding men...

655
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:27,806
What do you think?

656
02:15:27,806 --> 02:15:31,039
Would I let you do that?
Have you gone crazy?

657
02:15:32,082 --> 02:15:34,168
You, get out!
Or I'll kill you both!

658
02:15:47,727 --> 02:15:52,943
You need a few cooler
heads in this room.

659
02:15:57,115 --> 02:15:58,053
My friend, sit down.

660
02:16:01,182 --> 02:16:03,268
Calm down and have a cigarette.

661
02:16:05,459 --> 02:16:06,397
Don't you think, Gerbier?

662
02:16:07,545 --> 02:16:09,527
You heard everything.

663
02:16:10,674 --> 02:16:16,932
Yes, Matilda is truly a great woman.
Even more than you know.

664
02:16:17,662 --> 02:16:19,957
But we're going to kill her.

665
02:16:19,957 --> 02:16:21,104
I can't believe you.

666
02:16:21,104 --> 02:16:23,190
You will, listen my friend.

667
02:16:23,190 --> 02:16:26,319
We will kill Matilda,
because she asked us to.

668
02:16:28,405 --> 02:16:29,448
She told you that?

669
02:16:29,448 --> 02:16:32,577
No, but it's not difficult to guess.
Think of it like this,

670
02:16:32,577 --> 02:16:35,602
If Matilda only wanted to save
her daughter,

671
02:16:35,602 --> 02:16:39,774
she just had to give names
and addresses.

672
02:16:40,921 --> 02:16:45,093
In spite of this, Matilda told them
we change our address every day,

673
02:16:45,093 --> 02:16:48,118
she must contact some people...
whatever...

674
02:16:49,265 --> 02:16:52,186
So that they set her free.
Clear, isn't it?

675
02:16:52,395 --> 02:16:58,653
Imagine you were in her position.
Forced to betray comrades.

676
02:16:59,696 --> 02:17:01,782
And suicide is not allowed.

677
02:17:06,997 --> 02:17:07,935
I would like to be killed.

678
02:17:10,022 --> 02:17:14,194
Do you find yourself braver
or better than Matilda?

679
02:17:20,347 --> 02:17:22,329
Please excuse me.

680
02:17:22,329 --> 02:17:26,814
Take a german car. Le Masque will
drive. I'll come with you.

681
02:17:26,814 --> 02:17:28,900
Are you mad?

682
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:30,986
I'm sure Matilda would like
to see me.

683
02:17:32,029 --> 02:17:34,115
Please, this is not your place.

684
02:17:35,158 --> 02:17:36,201
This is an order.

685
02:17:38,287 --> 02:17:40,373
You didn't have to do that, boss.

686
02:18:04,363 --> 02:18:07,492
Do you really believe what you said?

687
02:18:08,535 --> 02:18:09,578
I don't know.

688
02:18:13,750 --> 02:18:15,836
Maybe this hypothesis is right.

689
02:18:16,879 --> 02:18:19,904
Maybe she just wanted to see
her daughter again,

690
02:18:19,904 --> 02:18:21,990
and now is finding it harder
to give it all up.

691
02:18:23,033 --> 02:18:25,119
That's what I want to find out.

692
02:18:28,352 --> 02:18:31,273
I had to come back to you
for the hardest job.

693
02:18:32,524 --> 02:18:34,506
You, in this car, with killers!

694
02:18:35,549 --> 02:18:37,739
Nothing's sacred now in this world.

695
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:49,212
February 23rd, 1943, Sunday.

696
02:19:39,277 --> 02:19:40,216
Go.

697
02:19:50,750 --> 02:19:59,095
Nov the 8th, 1943.
Le Masque had just time
to take his prussic acid pill.

698
02:20:04,310 --> 02:20:11,611
Dec the 16th, 1943.
Le Bison was beheaded with an axe
in a German jail.

699
02:20:16,826 --> 02:20:24,127
Jan the 22nd, 1944.
Luc Jardie died under torture,
after giving one name: his own.

700
02:20:29,342 --> 02:20:35,600
Jan the 13rd, 1944.
Gerbier decided not to run this time...
