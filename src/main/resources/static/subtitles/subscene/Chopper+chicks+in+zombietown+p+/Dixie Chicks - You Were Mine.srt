1
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:51,830
I Can't Find A Reason To Let Go
Even Though You've Found A New Love
And She's What Your Dreams Are Made Of

2
00:00:52,867 --> 00:01:06,467
I Can Find A Reason To Hang On
What Went Wrong Can Be Forgiven
Without You, It Ain't Worth Livin' Alone

3
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:35,935
Sometimes I Wake Up Crying At Night
And Sometimes I Scream Out Your Name
What Right Does She Have To Take You Away
When For So Long, You Were Mine

4
00:01:36,037 --> 00:01:49,303
I Took Out All The Pictures Of Our Wedding Day
It Was A Time Of Love And Laughter
Happy Ever After

5
00:01:50,405 --> 00:02:05,738
But Even Those Old Pictures Have Begun To Fade
Please Tell Me She's Not Real
And That You're Really Coming Home To Stay

6
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:35,480
Sometimes I Wake Up Crying At Night
And Sometimes I Scream Out Your Name
What Right Does She Have To Take Your Heart Away
When For So Long, You Were Mine

7
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:47,709
I Can Give You Two Good Reasons
To Show You Love's Not Blind

8
00:02:48,811 --> 00:03:02,011
He's Two And She's Four, And You Know They Adore You
So How Can I Tell Them You've Changed Your Mind

9
00:03:03,113 --> 00:03:29,545
Sometimes I Wake Up Crying At Night
And Sometimes I Scream Out Your Name
What Right Does She Have To Take Your Heart Away
When For So Long, You Were Mine
10
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:48,147
I Remember When You Were Mine
