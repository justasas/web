- [gun cocking]
- [Zip] Got that John Blaze shit.

3
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,095
Forget about making somebody's day.

4
00:00:26,178 --> 00:00:28,013
These two Desert Eagles here?

5
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:32,685
Fly, pelican, fly.

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,695
Do I even need to say it?

7
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:47,324
[chuckles]

8
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:53,581
[sighs] Come on, Zip.

9
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:56,000
You should find a new profession.

10
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,668
Cottonmouth is done.

11
00:00:58,669 --> 00:00:59,962
You ain't heard?

12
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:04,299
Cottonmouth's getting out,
so you ain't done shit.

13
00:01:04,383 --> 00:01:05,676
Boom!

14
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:33,746
[inaudible]

15
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:41,921
[Audrey] Detective.

16
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:44,757
Remember who you are.

17
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,679
Next time, it would behoove you
to have actual evidence.

18
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:51,221
You know, something besides

19
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:53,641
the dogged harassment
of a misguided beat cop.

20
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:55,184
You calling me a dog?

21
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:58,312
No, I believe the brother said "dogged,"

22
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:00,230
as in determined.

23
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:02,399
Although, true...

24
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:06,486
the word is derived from the description
of a dog's persistence.

25
00:02:08,823 --> 00:02:10,741
See, that's the problem with a bitch.

26
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:15,162
Once they get their mouth on a bone...

27
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:16,622
they can't let go.

28
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:22,169
We'll see who's somebody's bitch

29
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:24,797
when your ass is in prison...

30
00:02:26,173 --> 00:02:27,507
Cornell.

31
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:30,595
[chuckles]

32
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:34,473
[Stokes chuckling]

33
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:40,312
[woman] There he is!

34
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:42,607
[reporters clamoring]

35
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:31,947
[theme music playing]

36
00:04:41,016 --> 00:04:43,686
[newscaster] <i>Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes'</i>
<i>release this morning</i>

37
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:45,354
<i>was a blow to local law enforcement...</i>

38
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:47,522
[Stokes laughing]

39
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:51,318
Mariah ain't gonna like that shit.

40
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,820
Neither should you.

41
00:04:52,903 --> 00:04:55,530
I just shot a cop and walked away free.

42
00:04:56,656 --> 00:04:57,992
What's there not to like?

43
00:04:58,075 --> 00:05:01,620
Zip and Amos picked up the truck
from the docks right after I shot Scarfe.

44
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:05,665
Domingo got his guns back last night.

45
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,626
Everyone else will fall in line.

46
00:05:08,252 --> 00:05:11,213
Jamaicans, Haitians, Dominicans.

47
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:12,381
Hell...

48
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:14,759
even the Koreans.

49
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:16,761
All loyal.

50
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:19,554
We're all good.

51
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:24,059
So...

52
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:27,938
when do I get my Judas?

53
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:30,024
You don't.

54
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:32,234
You're too hot right now.

55
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:35,029
Luke Cage is a luxury, Cornell.

56
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:38,908
He's, uh... he's ice cream.

57
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:41,911
And you need to keep steak on the table.

58
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:45,414
And how do I do that
with Luke Cage around?

59
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:49,751
All he has to do is [shouting] show up

60
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:53,047
and hoods scatter
like roaches with the lights on!

61
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,968
Guns, drugs, all street traffic
is a mess right now because of him!

62
00:05:58,052 --> 00:05:59,887
[breathing heavily]

63
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,475
Niggas act like he can walk on water.

64
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,519
Can he?

65
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,025
I'm done talking, Shades.

66
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:19,031
Tell Diamondback I need
to holler at him.

67
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:22,701
You sure that's the way
you want to play this?

68
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:26,831
Okay.

69
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:45,599
[door closes]

70
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:35,983
So what about all that evidence?

71
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:39,694
Without Scarfe to corroborate,
that ledger is useless.

72
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:41,696
Even the whole thing with Spurlock

73
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,241
and the bodies Cottonmouth
burned there won't stick.

74
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:47,619
Spurlock is going to eat the charge
and take the years.

75
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,330
He won't testify.

76
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:53,250
He'd be his own client. [sighs]

77
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:56,211
[Claire] So that's it?

78
00:07:58,505 --> 00:08:00,049
Setbacks happen all the time.

79
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:02,551
You can still do something about this.

80
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:04,011
Why me?

81
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:08,057
Because you're not afraid of Cottonmouth,
and he's obviously afraid of you.

82
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:10,184
What do you expect me to do?

83
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:13,103
I tried to do things the right way.
Cops let him go.

84
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:15,981
Cops can only do so much.

85
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:17,983
You have the power to do more.

86
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,693
Look at what's happening
in Hell's Kitchen.

87
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,737
You mean that cat running
around beating people up?

88
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:24,031
That's what you want me to be?

89
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:27,784
Sometimes, if you want justice...

90
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:29,369
you have to get it yourself.

91
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:35,667
If Hell's Kitchen's so great,
why'd you run uptown?

92
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,128
Why did you?

93
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:41,215
There is nothing that can hurt you.

94
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:43,758
So what the hell are you afraid of?

95
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,470
[phone ringing]

96
00:08:57,731 --> 00:08:59,233
[Fish] Pop's Barber Shop.

97
00:09:02,902 --> 00:09:04,279
It's for you.

98
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:06,823
[Stokes on phone] <i>Let's parley.</i>

99
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:10,369
Either we can be gentlemen about this...

100
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:13,122
or we can get into some gangster shit.

101
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:15,790
Parley's just fine.

102
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,794
Your gangster shit hasn't worked out
so well for you recently.

103
00:09:19,878 --> 00:09:21,463
[chuckles]

104
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:22,922
Harlem's Paradise.

105
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:25,217
Bring your apron.

106
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:28,303
[laughing]

107
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:32,224
[hangs up phone]

108
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:35,435
What'd he say?

109
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,815
Enough.

110
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:51,076
Might as well take all that down now.

111
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:54,788
No. There's still plenty of work
to be done.

112
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:57,291
Not for me.

113
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,085
They just made it official an hour ago.

114
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:02,671
But you had nothing to do with Scarfe.

115
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:05,424
My shop, my watch.

116
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,594
[inaudible]

117
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:11,721
All right, here we go.

118
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:14,099
You've got to play this smart, Detective.

119
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:16,310
IA's gonna be up your ass
with a flashlight.

120
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:18,437
I can handle Ridley.

121
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,023
She was my lieutenant at the 31st.

122
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:23,775
Listen, you still have
a future here, Misty.

123
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:25,819
My advice to you
is to let go of this board

124
00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:27,737
and everyone you have pinned on it.

125
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:30,782
Cottonmouth needs to be in handcuffs.

126
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:34,536
Don't let this twist you to the point
where you can't see which way is up.

127
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:52,179
[exhales]

128
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:55,224
Mercedes?

129
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,185
Priscilla.

130
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,564
I prefer Inspector Ridley.

131
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:05,692
Priscilla, I heard they started
calling you Inspector Gadget

132
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:08,820
- behind your back once you got promoted.
- [chuckles]

133
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:12,657
This is gonna be fun.

134
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:16,286
[reporters clamoring]

135
00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:21,500
Councilwoman Dillard and I
don't agree on much.

136
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,168
But she's a good woman who loves Harlem,

137
00:11:23,252 --> 00:11:26,380
and I'm a strong believer in party first,
no matter what.

138
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:28,340
I came as a friend in her time of need.

139
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:31,218
Mr. Boone, is it true you're here
to ask the councilwoman to resign?

140
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:33,762
He's here because I asked him here.
Damon.

141
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:35,805
[all clamoring]

142
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:37,015
[Mariah] Let him through.

143
00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:38,725
[clamoring continues]

144
00:11:39,518 --> 00:11:41,270
Wait, wait, wait. First question, go.

145
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:43,980
Was your affordable housing initiative
funded by drug money?

146
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:48,026
My cousin has never been
accused of selling drugs.

147
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:50,529
I thought you all said
he was running guns.

148
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:52,364
- Will you please make up your mind?
- [chuckles]

149
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,659
Councilwoman, have you been questioned
by the NYPD about your cousin?

150
00:11:57,744 --> 00:11:59,329
Family first, Robin.

151
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:02,457
I love my cousin Cornell Stokes.

152
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,752
The charges against him
are categorically false,

153
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:07,796
which is why they let him go.

154
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,132
He is an integral part
of my New Harlem Renaissance

155
00:12:11,216 --> 00:12:15,262
and our movement to rebuild
Harlem for our Harlemites.

156
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:16,346
Okay? That's it.

157
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,016
- Get out of the rain. Go, go!
- [all clamoring]

158
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:23,437
[clamoring continues]

159
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,316
[Mariah] Ah! This is low...
even for you.

160
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,943
[Boone] I wasn't lying.
I'm here as your friend.

161
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:33,322
[Mariah] Pretty boy Stanford Carpetbagger.

162
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:36,408
You've been trying to knock me
off my spot for years.

163
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:39,160
How much of what they're saying is true?

164
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:42,706
Damn.

165
00:12:43,373 --> 00:12:44,541
That bad?

166
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:47,627
You're...

167
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:50,046
tainted.

168
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:53,300
And the infection is contagious.

169
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,011
So what do you recommend, Dr. Boone?

170
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:01,225
You step aside
and let me take your seat.

171
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:04,143
Then I can support your initiatives
on the inside.

172
00:13:04,228 --> 00:13:05,895
And push your permits through.

173
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:07,647
A year from now,

174
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:10,942
all four of your complexes
could be up and running.

175
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,527
That's cute.

176
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,700
You've been trying to knock me
out of my spot for six years, Damon.

177
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:22,787
It didn't work then.
It's not working now.

178
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:24,914
Find a new hobby.

179
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:27,083
You can't stay on top forever, Mariah.

180
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,336
You're gonna fall.

181
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:32,964
And I'll enjoy every second when you do.

182
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:34,966
You need to leave now.

183
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:39,178
Show your Marigny ass out.

184
00:13:55,612 --> 00:13:57,281
[indistinct clamoring]

185
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:00,158
Do you need anything?

186
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:02,577
Scotch. Neat.

187
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,209
[Alex] Mariah?

188
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:15,256
How the hell did you get in here?

189
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,800
We need to talk.

190
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:23,973
Alone.

191
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:30,021
So, this Luke Cage
was a bartender at Harlem's Paradise?

192
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:33,024
Actually, I believe he was the dishwasher.

193
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:34,943
<i>He was filling in for Dante that night.</i>

194
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:36,653
[Ridley] <i>One man is linked</i>
<i>to a criminal,</i>

195
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:39,364
the death of four people,
the destruction of a restaurant,

196
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:40,907
and you don't find him suspicious?

197
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,909
Of course I do.

198
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:45,745
[Ridley] <i>Step back.</i>
<i>Take a look at your board.</i>

199
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:50,792
Who is the one person that is linked
to every single location up there?

200
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,295
It's not just this case
that depends upon on it.

201
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:55,755
Your career is also in the balance.

202
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:01,761
[breathing heavily]

203
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,931
Shit.

204
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:06,015
[bangs]

205
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:10,144
[Stokes playing keyboard]

206
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,827
[indistinct chatter]

207
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:41,134
[playing keyboard]

208
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:43,928
Damn, Cornell, you just playing that,
like, out of thin air like that?

209
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:45,764
You don't need to, uh, write it down?

210
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:47,432
I just see it in my head.

211
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:50,894
[laughing] This boy
is a damn prodigy, Mabel.

212
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:54,523
That prodigy needs to keep it down.

213
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:56,315
Mariah's trying to study.

214
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,442
[scoffs] Like a little music

215
00:15:57,526 --> 00:15:59,694
is gonna disturb all that hoein'
you got goin' on over there.

216
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:02,113
That hoein' is what keeps the lights on.

217
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:03,322
Look, all I'm saying is that

218
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:07,744
Cornell should be in one of them schools
like, um... Juilliard.

219
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:10,705
[Mabel] There's only
one school that matters.

220
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:13,041
- Cornell is really good.
- [Uncle Pete] Mmm.

221
00:16:13,124 --> 00:16:15,419
[smacks lips]
Did I ask you anything, Little May?

222
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:16,670
[Uncle Pete] The girl's got a point.

223
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:19,756
- [Mabel] She don't need you to defend her.
- I know she don't.

224
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,675
Because she's gonna be a lawyer,

225
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:23,843
and she's gonna be able
to defend her damn self.

226
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:25,679
Ain't that right, baby?

227
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:29,724
- Hey, Mariah.
- Snap, crackle, pop!

228
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:32,351
- How you doing, Henry?
- [young Pop] Good, ma'am.

229
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,522
Hey, yo, Cottonmouth.

230
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,231
- You coming?
- [stops playing]

231
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:39,025
You know I hate that name.

232
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:41,319
Well, I could just called you Corny.

233
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:44,573
- Is that better?
- Hey! He's practicing.

234
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:46,866
All right? He needs to stay right here.

235
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,535
He needs to get a little dirt on him.

236
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:50,244
[chuckling]

237
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:54,958
Actually, Pete's right.

238
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,585
You stay here, Cornell.

239
00:16:57,502 --> 00:16:58,878
You can go.

240
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:01,548
You stand right here with me.

241
00:17:08,763 --> 00:17:11,891
My husband, his brother, and me...

242
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:16,395
built this here Harlem game
brick by brick.

243
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,023
Numbers, pussy, guns.

244
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:24,446
But you know good and goddamn well
the one thing I never sell is drugs.

245
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:27,866
So what the hell made you go
and do something so stupid?

246
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,410
- I thought I was helping your ass.
- Helping me?

247
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:35,707
Man, this crack game is blowin' up.

248
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,376
Salvador Colon and all them,
they making mad loot,

249
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,795
and your old ass is getting left...
[yelps]

250
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:42,255
[screaming]

251
00:17:44,007 --> 00:17:45,675
[wailing]

252
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:51,848
Finish your studies upstairs, baby girl.

253
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:56,269
Uh-uh, not you.
You stay right there, Cornell.

254
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:58,980
[Donnie wails and whimpers]

255
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:02,817
And your dumb ass ain't inventive enough
to think of some shit like this.

256
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:06,154
Who gave you this idea, huh?

257
00:18:06,237 --> 00:18:07,947
[Uncle Pete] Who the hell
are you looking at?

258
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:09,115
Hmm?

259
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:11,910
[Mabel] Take out this trash, Cornell.

260
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:13,495
No.

261
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:16,080
Cornell ain't ready
for nothing like this, Maybelline.

262
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:19,543
Well, he need to learn
how to piss standing up.

263
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,712
[sighs]

264
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:26,007
[panting]

265
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:30,512
- [Uncle Pete] Come on, nigga!
- [Donnie yelling]

266
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:32,221
Cornell, you go with your Uncle Pete.

267
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:33,557
[Uncle Pete] Stand up!

268
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,559
- And keep it down.
- [Donnie whimpering]

269
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:38,520
I got white folks in the front room.
I don't want to scare 'em off.

270
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:40,146
[door closing]

271
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:42,065
- [blows landing]
- [Uncle Pete grunting]

272
00:18:42,148 --> 00:18:43,983
[muffled yells and screams]

273
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:53,284
[Donnie] Please! Please! I'm sorry!

274
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:54,452
[Donnie screaming]

275
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,552
[Stokes playing keyboard]

276
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:14,598
[breath trembling]

277
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:22,021
[inhales deeply]

278
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:38,705
[knuckles cracking]

279
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:42,792
[Luke] Even though I hate your ass...

280
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:46,087
I gotta admit...

281
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:48,840
you got talent.

282
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:52,343
You could have been somebody.

283
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,683
This is the first time I've ever seen
you flunky-free.

284
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:03,396
I guess now that you're untouchable...
you don't need them.

285
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:07,025
So, what?

286
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:10,111
You here to take me in or take me out?

287
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:11,279
Hey.

288
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:13,615
You called me.

289
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:17,535
And unlike you, I'm not a murderer.

290
00:20:18,286 --> 00:20:19,913
I'm taking you in.

291
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:23,249
You're gonna sit down with Misty Knight
and you're going to confess...

292
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:24,959
to everything.

293
00:20:25,543 --> 00:20:27,586
That's what you think's about to happen?

294
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:31,800
'Cause last time I checked...

295
00:20:33,176 --> 00:20:35,344
you were no longer a sheriff...

296
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:39,307
Carl.

297
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:41,017
Hmm.

298
00:20:41,893 --> 00:20:43,728
You ain't doing much of anything.

299
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:45,939
Carl Lucas.

300
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:49,901
[laughing] That's a square-ass name, man.

301
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:54,322
Oh, if my mama named me that,
I'd change my name to Luke Cage, too.

302
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:55,657
[chuckles]

303
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:00,328
See...

304
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:04,290
I don't know shit about going to prison.

305
00:21:04,373 --> 00:21:07,501
But I figure if you escaped,

306
00:21:07,585 --> 00:21:10,088
faked your death,
and all that other slick shit,

307
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,215
eventually it's bound
to catch up with you.

308
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:15,259
And you gotta go back.

309
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,138
You're not turning me in.

310
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,141
You wouldn't snitch.

311
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:23,351
Well...

312
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:26,855
there is honor amongst thieves.

313
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:31,484
But you ain't no thief.

314
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:34,946
Gave a speech at a church,

315
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:38,282
knocked down a few doors
in the projects and now...

316
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:40,910
you Harlem's Captain America.

317
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:43,329
Nigga, please.

318
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:46,540
How they gonna feel
about their folk hero

319
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,919
when they find out he ain't nothing more
than a goddamn criminal?

320
00:21:51,295 --> 00:21:54,007
And you act like you better than me.

321
00:21:57,093 --> 00:21:58,427
You ain't better than me.

322
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:04,183
You got caught.

323
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:07,561
I was framed. I'm innocent.

324
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:10,439
[chuckles] Aren't we all?

325
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:12,817
[laughing]

326
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:14,152
Hmm.

327
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:18,782
I'mma keep your little secret.

328
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:23,286
I've got use for bulletproof niggas.

329
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:27,706
I own you now.

330
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:32,045
And if you refuse...
then back to Seagate you go.

331
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:35,965
I'll charter the yacht my damn self.

332
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:42,806
See, you thought I only had
a hand in one of the pies.

333
00:22:43,681 --> 00:22:45,892
But I own the whole goddamn bakery, son.

334
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:59,405
[Stokes laughing]

335
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:25,473
Do you remember me...

336
00:23:26,182 --> 00:23:27,516
from when I was a kid?

337
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:29,435
No.

338
00:23:30,353 --> 00:23:33,689
Are you one of those that used to
follow Cornell around like a puppy?

339
00:23:33,772 --> 00:23:34,815
Hmm.

340
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:37,693
I didn't have shit.

341
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:40,238
I grew up in the street.

342
00:23:41,322 --> 00:23:44,492
But the one name that always rang out...

343
00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:46,870
was "Stokes."

344
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:49,830
You needed a Thanksgiving turkey?

345
00:23:50,498 --> 00:23:53,001
Go see Mama Mabel Stokes.

346
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:54,293
School clothes?

347
00:23:55,211 --> 00:23:56,963
Mama Mabel Stokes.

348
00:23:58,631 --> 00:24:00,383
Your old man put his hands on you?

349
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:02,676
See Mama Mabel Stokes...

350
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,973
and it would never, ever happen again.

351
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:09,808
- Your point?
- Your family name meant something.

352
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:13,729
Harlem's Paradise meant something.

353
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:18,651
Everyone from David Dinkins to Pappy Mason
showed that woman love.

354
00:24:20,111 --> 00:24:22,030
But what does that family represent now?

355
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,159
A washed-up gangsterland?

356
00:24:26,242 --> 00:24:31,205
An empty politician who'll be lucky...

357
00:24:32,123 --> 00:24:34,000
at this time next year...

358
00:24:35,126 --> 00:24:37,503
to be a greeter at the Harlem Hair Expo?

359
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:40,006
You don't talk to me like that.

360
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:42,967
I can talk to you any way I want.

361
00:24:43,051 --> 00:24:47,263
Because you got no power to shut me up.

362
00:24:47,346 --> 00:24:49,057
Do you like how it feels?

363
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:52,518
Being so powerless?

364
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:55,604
Being pushed around by other people?

365
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:00,944
What do you think?

366
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:02,820
I think...

367
00:25:04,697 --> 00:25:06,240
that when you get the nerve...

368
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:10,369
you're gonna be surprised...

369
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:12,913
at just what you're capable of.

370
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:38,689
[Claire] So that's how
you're gonna play this? You're running?

371
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:42,110
There's nothing I can do.

372
00:25:42,193 --> 00:25:44,903
Enough with this defeatist bullshit.

373
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:46,489
What the hell is going on?

374
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,159
Cottonmouth knows about my past, Claire.

375
00:25:51,702 --> 00:25:53,746
If I don't work for him,
he's gonna out me.

376
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:56,124
I'll go back to prison.

377
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,628
I've been through too much hell
to let that happen.

378
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:03,922
Yeah, I... I sympathize. I really do.

379
00:26:04,007 --> 00:26:05,716
But if you run...

380
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,885
you'll be running
for the rest of your life.

381
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:11,430
You think you're the first person
to tell me that?

382
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:13,891
I told Pop I was done running.

383
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:16,269
I stayed and he died.

384
00:26:16,352 --> 00:26:20,481
I didn't run when they came after Connie,
and they lost everything because of me.

385
00:26:20,564 --> 00:26:21,732
Who's next?

386
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:23,651
I'm no good for anyone.

387
00:26:24,902 --> 00:26:27,155
You can't take the blame
for everything that happened.

388
00:26:28,197 --> 00:26:29,407
People need you.

389
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,451
Yeah, well,
sometimes I'm no good for people.

390
00:26:32,535 --> 00:26:36,164
If people see that you're one of them,
that's good.

391
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:38,874
If you stand and fight,
they'll follow you.

392
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:41,919
If I go to prison,
who's gonna wanna follow me?

393
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:47,883
Half the people uptown have fathers,
cousins, uncles, brothers in prison.

394
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:50,469
You're no different than anybody else.

395
00:26:50,553 --> 00:26:53,347
You get your wish. You're not special.

396
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:57,310
Instead of running, if you make a move

397
00:26:57,393 --> 00:27:00,020
and you take him down once and for all?

398
00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:02,231
You stop him, you save this community,

399
00:27:02,315 --> 00:27:04,024
and you free yourself.

400
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:06,777
Or...

401
00:27:15,786 --> 00:27:16,870
[hip-hop music playing]

402
00:27:16,954 --> 00:27:18,497
[Stokes] Turn up the bass.

403
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:32,010
I ain't one to apologize.

404
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:34,097
Then don't.

405
00:27:35,348 --> 00:27:37,266
But I was feeling myself a little earlier.

406
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,726
My bad.

407
00:27:39,768 --> 00:27:41,645
I ain't mean to come at you like that.

408
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:46,234
You're under a lot of stress.

409
00:27:46,984 --> 00:27:48,986
It's that nigga, Luke Cage.

410
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:51,822
I invited him over.

411
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,032
Had to let him know.

412
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:58,036
What'd you do?

413
00:27:58,954 --> 00:28:00,456
I gave him the business.

414
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,833
All that Seagate shit you told me about.

415
00:28:04,543 --> 00:28:05,544
What?

416
00:28:05,628 --> 00:28:09,632
Diamondback didn't want you to do that.
He's got plans for him.

417
00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:12,260
Well, Diamondback ain't my daddy.

418
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:13,636
What's he know about Cage?

419
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:16,472
Did you spook him? Is he gonna run?

420
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:18,641
He will fall in line.

421
00:28:21,227 --> 00:28:22,436
No doubt.

422
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:31,695
[winces] Sometimes pain is the only thing
that gets 'em going.

423
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,698
They can't do that to their wife
so they take it out on you.

424
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:38,827
Where the hell have you been?

425
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:40,788
We needed you an hour ago.

426
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:45,126
Look at what happened.
Sister Boy didn't have any protection.

427
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:49,422
At least the bastard had enough sense
not to hit him in the face.

428
00:28:49,505 --> 00:28:52,591
Maybe Sister needs to learn
how to throw her hands up like a brother.

429
00:28:53,091 --> 00:28:54,510
[breathing heavily]

430
00:28:54,593 --> 00:28:57,054
While you out there in the street
running around with your friends,

431
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:59,265
my people in here getting hurt.

432
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:02,310
You better have a damn good reason
for not being here when I needed you.

433
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:04,437
Pete took me to an audition.

434
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,690
You expect me to believe
that an audition took six hours?

435
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:10,025
He stopped in Spanish Harlem.

436
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,821
Puerto Ricans?

437
00:29:13,904 --> 00:29:18,992
Like that... Tato Lopez and Sal...

438
00:29:19,076 --> 00:29:22,205
I heard Salvador.
That's who Pete talked to.

439
00:29:22,288 --> 00:29:23,539
Where were you?

440
00:29:23,622 --> 00:29:27,668
[sighs] I kicked it
with Salvador's little brother, Domingo.

441
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:29,503
We watched <i>Video Music Box.</i>

442
00:29:29,587 --> 00:29:30,921
What'd they talk about?

443
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:32,548
They were in the back room.

444
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:35,050
They were gone for a while.

445
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:39,222
You done good.

446
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:45,353
[sighs] You done good.

447
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,358
Hey. HD, Blu-ray,
I got all the best angles of the incident.

448
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:52,860
I got everybody in here.
You know you want to see it.

449
00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:55,488
- People actually pay money for that?
- Yo.

450
00:29:55,571 --> 00:29:58,574
- Yo. It's you! You one of them!
- No.

451
00:29:58,657 --> 00:30:00,701
Come on, let's talk. My man's got a RED,

452
00:30:00,784 --> 00:30:03,287
next time you do something,
I could film you.

453
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:04,580
We could both get paid.

454
00:30:04,663 --> 00:30:06,749
For real. 4K for four K,
you know what I'm sayin'?

455
00:30:06,832 --> 00:30:08,209
Hey, hey. I know you hear things.

456
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:13,797
Look, I hear and see everything.

457
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:17,134
The streets know what you've been up to.
Everyone's talking about it.

458
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:18,927
But I ain't no snitch.

459
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:20,679
Not everyone deserves discretion.

460
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:22,681
I'm not asking you to get involved.

461
00:30:22,765 --> 00:30:24,475
I'm not even asking you to speak.

462
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:27,228
I just need to borrow your eyes.

463
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:30,648
All right.

464
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:33,276
Who you looking for?

465
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:36,612
Domingo Colon.

466
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:38,155
[speaking Spanish]

467
00:30:40,283 --> 00:30:41,325
[groans]

468
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:47,331
[Luke] Domingo Colon!

469
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:51,168
I'm guessing that's you.

470
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:54,547
- [man grunting]
- [Luke grunting]

471
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:05,933
- [man groans]
- [guns cocking]

472
00:31:06,892 --> 00:31:09,353
I guess you guys
haven't heard about me, have you?

473
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:11,439
- Take him out.
- [guns firing]

474
00:31:11,522 --> 00:31:12,731
[bullets ricocheting]

475
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:28,872
I'm about sick
of always having to buy new clothes.

476
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:33,961
[man screams]

477
00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:44,638
[Luke] Where are the guns?

478
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:46,098
I don't know what you're talking about.

479
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:48,642
The ones you got back from Cottonmouth.

480
00:31:48,726 --> 00:31:50,227
The ones my friends died over.

481
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:53,230
What, you think you can go after everyone?

482
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,857
I kinda do.

483
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,362
I can pick you up...

484
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:01,489
walk you over to the bridge...

485
00:32:02,406 --> 00:32:04,282
and throw your ass in the Hudson.

486
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,289
And here's the thing.
It's not the fall that kills you.

487
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:13,417
It's the impact against the water.

488
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:17,380
And when the water fills your lungs,
right before you black out,

489
00:32:17,463 --> 00:32:18,922
you'll ask yourself...

490
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:22,718
"Why didn't I just give Luke Cage
what he wanted?"

491
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,096
The guns are downstairs.

492
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:31,059
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

493
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,451
You got this one in a double XL?

494
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:50,037
You'll like this.

495
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,917
I already know what he looks like, Bailey.

496
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,585
But aside from your board...

497
00:32:57,503 --> 00:33:00,756
this is the only photo of him. Anywhere.

498
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:03,258
- Nothing else?
- Nope.

499
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:06,429
Why do you seem so excited by that?

500
00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:10,223
[chuckles] 'Cause he is too damn clean.

501
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:13,018
You know, he's so clean, it's...
it's freaky.

502
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:14,186
In what way?

503
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:17,523
He has, uh, no credit cards.
No email address.

504
00:33:17,606 --> 00:33:19,900
But he has a social security number.

505
00:33:19,983 --> 00:33:23,696
Yeah, but no bank account.
No Facebook. No porn.

506
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:26,364
Why do you find no porn so disturbing?

507
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:27,950
[scoffs]

508
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:30,703
This guy, he doesn't exist.

509
00:33:30,786 --> 00:33:32,538
He was created.

510
00:33:32,621 --> 00:33:34,832
He's the figment
of someone's imagination.

511
00:33:34,915 --> 00:33:38,293
Who the hell is this guy?
And... and who made him?

512
00:33:38,376 --> 00:33:40,713
Yeah. Who you telling?

513
00:33:41,672 --> 00:33:43,716
But he's innocent.

514
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,593
- I give you my word.
- [woman on phone] <i>That may be.</i>

515
00:33:45,676 --> 00:33:47,636
<i>But all this tension</i>
<i>is hurting the council</i>

516
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,680
<i>- and it's harming the party.</i>
- Yeah.

517
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:52,933
When will you make the announcement?

518
00:33:53,016 --> 00:33:56,353
<i>Charlene will send a press release</i>
<i>at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.</i>

519
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:59,982
<i>I'm going to have to ask you to resign,</i>
<i>effective immediately.</i>

520
00:34:00,065 --> 00:34:01,442
I hear you.

521
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,700
You realize that I will fight this
with every ounce of my energy, right?

522
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:10,951
Right?

523
00:34:11,034 --> 00:34:13,411
<i>It's painful for all of us,</i>
<i>but it's necessary.</i>

524
00:34:13,496 --> 00:34:14,538
<i>We have no other choice.</i>

525
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:15,956
- Okay.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

526
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:18,416
[glass shatters]

527
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:20,377
[breathing heavily]

00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:37,144
[sniffles]

530
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:43,316
- Tony.
- [Tony on speakerphone] <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

531
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,528
- Bring the car around.
<i>- Right away.</i>

532
00:34:48,363 --> 00:34:50,323
[sniffles and exhales]

533
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:52,450
[Stokes playing keyboard]

534
00:35:42,918 --> 00:35:44,628
On his deathbed...

535
00:35:46,129 --> 00:35:48,131
what did you promise Buggy?

536
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:56,599
That you'd take care of me and...
our business.

537
00:35:57,725 --> 00:35:59,935
What the hell
are you talking about, Mabel?

538
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:03,438
I've always put this shit
before anything else.

539
00:36:07,776 --> 00:36:10,904
You were my woman before you was his.

540
00:36:10,988 --> 00:36:12,615
But I let that go.

541
00:36:14,074 --> 00:36:15,743
You always protect your family.

542
00:36:17,285 --> 00:36:18,954
No matter what.

543
00:36:19,037 --> 00:36:20,998
So you betrayed me?

544
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:24,542
To some goddamn Puerto Ricans?

545
00:36:24,627 --> 00:36:25,878
This... [grunts]

546
00:36:30,298 --> 00:36:34,136
This shit... should have been mine.

547
00:36:35,763 --> 00:36:37,765
And you know it.

548
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:40,558
[sighs]

549
00:36:41,685 --> 00:36:43,729
Now, Salvador and his brothers

550
00:36:43,812 --> 00:36:46,398
have agreed to let us come in
on the ground floor.

551
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:50,152
We can own this whole goddamn city.

552
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:53,656
I already have everything I need.

553
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:57,993
Pigs get fat...

554
00:36:59,828 --> 00:37:01,121
but hogs...

555
00:37:02,497 --> 00:37:03,999
get slaughtered.

556
00:37:07,878 --> 00:37:09,672
This was all about you.

557
00:37:12,382 --> 00:37:14,009
You know what?

558
00:37:14,092 --> 00:37:16,594
You always stay ready with a plan, bitch.

559
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,557
[smacks lips] So what is it?

560
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:32,861
[breath shuddering]

561
00:37:33,779 --> 00:37:35,405
[gun cocks]

562
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:48,626
You don't have to do this, Cornell.

563
00:37:50,796 --> 00:37:52,756
And all that talent you have?

564
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:02,933
What are you doing?

565
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,020
You're not built for this.

566
00:38:08,313 --> 00:38:11,358
Why do you think
I pay for all those lessons, man?

567
00:38:13,068 --> 00:38:15,738
You can be something
better than all of us.

568
00:38:18,323 --> 00:38:21,659
You deserve this
for what you did to our family.

569
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:24,412
What you did to me!

570
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:26,623
Hey, Little May, don't...

571
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:29,793
What are you talking about?
[stutters] You laughed with me.

572
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:32,087
It was... it was a game.
[chuckles nervously]

573
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,296
Cornell.

574
00:38:35,298 --> 00:38:37,092
I told you what to do.

575
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:40,888
Stand up straight.

576
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:44,349
And do it.

577
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:47,352
- [gun cocks]
- [Uncle Pete] Look at me.

578
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:50,898
[shouts] Look at me!

579
00:38:53,817 --> 00:38:54,818
- Every time...
- [gun firing]

580
00:39:08,957 --> 00:39:12,836
You know the rule, baby. Family first.

581
00:39:13,586 --> 00:39:15,088
Always.

582
00:39:17,841 --> 00:39:19,717
Yes, ma'am.

583
00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:31,313
You could have called first.

584
00:39:31,396 --> 00:39:33,982
Oh, now I need an invite.

585
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:38,862
Can't imagine the kind of pressure
you're under.

586
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,908
Especially after that shit-show
of an interview.

587
00:39:42,991 --> 00:39:45,743
You need to drop this Luke Cage shit.

588
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:48,580
Shut it down.
Get your head back in the game.

589
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:51,374
Don't lecture me about the game.
I was born to this shit.

590
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:55,212
I finally got his bitch-ass in my pocket.

591
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:58,090
My party chairwoman called me tonight

592
00:39:58,173 --> 00:40:00,383
to tell me I had to step down
from the council.

593
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:05,555
The fundraising for my complexes dried up
since you got arrested.

594
00:40:05,638 --> 00:40:07,850
My reputation is in the shithole!

595
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:10,560
Maybe Madam Councilwoman
need to step off her high horse

596
00:40:10,643 --> 00:40:11,769
and get her hands dirty.

597
00:40:11,854 --> 00:40:13,605
We family, Cornell.

598
00:40:13,688 --> 00:40:16,066
- Mama Mabel taught us that...
- Mama Mabel, Mama Mabel!

599
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:17,400
Go on with that shit.

600
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:22,865
All the things
I could've did with my life...

601
00:40:24,032 --> 00:40:25,325
my music...

602
00:40:26,743 --> 00:40:31,123
But who does she send
to that uppity-ass boarding school? You.

603
00:40:32,124 --> 00:40:34,667
She put you in school
and forced me to run the streets.

604
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:36,294
You idiot.

605
00:40:36,378 --> 00:40:39,923
She sent me away
to keep me away from Pete!

606
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:43,426
You know damn well
what that woman made me do.

607
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:46,013
I was 14 years old.

608
00:40:46,096 --> 00:40:47,848
Uncle Pete betrayed us.

609
00:40:47,931 --> 00:40:50,976
Uncle Pete was the only one
who ever had my back.

610
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:57,190
Mama Mabel was always
sheltering you, protecting you.

611
00:40:57,274 --> 00:40:58,275
And for what?

612
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:01,736
All that education,
and you just as shady as me.

613
00:41:01,819 --> 00:41:03,947
Me protected?

614
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:08,826
All I did your whole life was protect you!

615
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:12,956
Your junkie mama dropped you off
at Mabel's and never looked back!

616
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,749
Your daddy didn't want you!

617
00:41:14,832 --> 00:41:19,004
Who was there changing your diapers?
Tending your needs?

618
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:20,422
Dealing with your whining?

619
00:41:20,505 --> 00:41:23,926
I saw the way you used to flirt
with Uncle Pete when I was little.

620
00:41:25,093 --> 00:41:26,094
[laughs]

621
00:41:27,095 --> 00:41:30,098
Running around half-naked all the time.

622
00:41:30,182 --> 00:41:31,892
You wanted it, Mariah.

623
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:34,561
You wanted it and you know it.

624
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,731
[Mariah screams] No!

625
00:41:38,815 --> 00:41:41,318
[screaming] No!

626
00:41:44,612 --> 00:41:48,366
- I did not want it!
- [groaning]

627
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,451
No!

628
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:52,662
You shut up!

629
00:41:52,745 --> 00:41:56,833
- No, I didn't want it!
- [breathing heavily]

630
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:01,088
[grunting]

631
00:42:03,423 --> 00:42:04,882
[bones crunching]

632
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:07,260
I didn't want it!

633
00:42:10,555 --> 00:42:11,974
[gasps]

634
00:42:14,226 --> 00:42:16,103
[Shades] Look at you.

635
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:25,403
You got the nerve...

636
00:42:29,824 --> 00:42:30,867
and you stepped up.

637
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:33,370
I didn't... I didn't want this.

638
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:35,455
[Shades sighs]

639
00:42:35,538 --> 00:42:36,748
[Mariah shudders]

640
00:42:37,457 --> 00:42:38,791
Deep down...

641
00:42:42,045 --> 00:42:43,213
[whispers] I think you did.

642
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:47,800
First time...

643
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,221
is always the hardest.

644
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:01,106
Do you think...

645
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:03,483
they have rubber gloves in the kitchen?

646
00:43:05,527 --> 00:43:07,904
Next to the dishwashing station.

647
00:43:09,322 --> 00:43:11,992
[chuckles] That's a great idea.

648
00:43:16,704 --> 00:43:19,707
Look what Luke Cage did to your cousin.

649
00:43:30,885 --> 00:43:32,345
[Misty] Nice sweatshirt.

650
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:33,971
You box now?

651
00:43:35,223 --> 00:43:37,267
What I do is more like CrossFit.

652
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,188
Always full of surprises.

653
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:45,400
And I hate that.

654
00:43:45,483 --> 00:43:47,777
I don't know shit about you.

655
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:52,199
Nobody does. And that's the problem.

656
00:43:53,741 --> 00:43:58,830
But out of all the people in the world,
Scarfe went to you for protection.

657
00:43:58,913 --> 00:44:02,042
- Why?
- You'd have to ask him that.

658
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:05,087
How convenient for you that I can't.

659
00:44:05,962 --> 00:44:08,005
Look, you texted me. What do you want?

660
00:44:08,923 --> 00:44:10,883
You see that van parked over there?

661
00:44:11,676 --> 00:44:12,969
I bet if you looked inside,

662
00:44:13,053 --> 00:44:15,805
it's filled with all of those
Justin Hammer guns from the heist.

663
00:44:15,888 --> 00:44:19,476
You think being a vigilante
makes this all right?

664
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,313
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you've caused?

665
00:44:23,396 --> 00:44:26,023
Misty, I know what you're going through.

666
00:44:26,108 --> 00:44:27,192
[scoffs]

667
00:44:27,275 --> 00:44:30,945
Finding out your partner was corrupt,
losing him...

668
00:44:31,028 --> 00:44:33,490
- It's messin' with your head...
- Do not talk to me

669
00:44:33,573 --> 00:44:35,825
[voice breaking]
like you know what I'm going through.

670
00:44:37,077 --> 00:44:39,454
I'm gonna take care of Cottonmouth.

671
00:44:39,537 --> 00:44:41,956
You need to be ready
to move on him when I do.

672
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:47,462
What's your big plan? Huh?

673
00:44:47,545 --> 00:44:49,339
You gonna take over Harlem?

674
00:44:49,422 --> 00:44:51,258
- I don't want Harlem.
- Then what do you want?

675
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:52,342
To be left alone.

676
00:44:52,425 --> 00:44:54,219
If that's what you truly want...

677
00:44:55,345 --> 00:44:58,890
then you will give me
all the information you have right now.

678
00:44:58,973 --> 00:45:00,057
On the record.

679
00:45:00,142 --> 00:45:03,561
Tell me everything you have and end it.
Right here.

680
00:45:03,645 --> 00:45:04,937
I'm not going to do that, Misty.

681
00:45:06,105 --> 00:45:08,233
- Then that makes you an accessory.
- To what?

682
00:45:08,316 --> 00:45:10,985
After what happened this morning,
you expect me to trust the system?

683
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:14,364
- The system is not your enemy.
- Really?

684
00:45:15,365 --> 00:45:17,159
How's the system
been treating you lately?

685
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,577
I should kill Cottonmouth.

686
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:22,121
But I won't.

687
00:45:22,997 --> 00:45:24,957
I want him to suffer.

688
00:45:26,501 --> 00:45:28,628
He should know what it feels like
when your life is over,

689
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:31,881
while everyone else's life goes on
as if you don't exist.

690
00:45:31,964 --> 00:45:35,177
You sound like you're speaking
from experience.

691
00:45:36,303 --> 00:45:37,970
You should trust me, Misty.

692
00:45:38,888 --> 00:45:40,014
Like Pop did.

693
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,187
If you gave me one good reason why...
[scoffs]

694
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,438
I would.

695
00:46:00,076 --> 00:46:01,869
Anonymous tip?

696
00:46:03,663 --> 00:46:06,040
Every cop needs a good snitch.

697
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,044
You're not out of the doghouse.

698
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:12,880
Not by a long shot.

699
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:23,808
- [sighs]
- [phone ringing]

700
00:46:30,106 --> 00:46:31,399
Detective Knight.

701
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,487
What?

702
00:46:37,196 --> 00:46:39,073
Oh, shit!

703
00:46:39,907 --> 00:46:42,327
[Claire] Okay, so I'm just trying
to picture it in my head.

704
00:46:43,245 --> 00:46:45,663
Was it mustard yellow? Or canary yellow?

705
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:49,083
[Luke chuckles] It was all I could grab.

706
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:52,295
I couldn't go running around Georgia
looking like a runaway slave.

707
00:46:52,379 --> 00:46:53,671
[Claire clicks tongue]

708
00:46:53,755 --> 00:46:56,090
[laughing] Oh, God.

709
00:46:57,008 --> 00:46:59,010
What did your father say
when he saw you?

710
00:47:01,638 --> 00:47:02,639
Nothing.

711
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:06,393
He doesn't know I'm alive.

712
00:47:09,604 --> 00:47:11,230
He wouldn't want to see me anyway.

713
00:47:12,148 --> 00:47:13,483
I'm his...

714
00:47:14,651 --> 00:47:15,902
shame.

715
00:47:19,406 --> 00:47:22,575
The last thing my father wanted to do
was to raise a black criminal.

716
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,537
He did everything in his power
to give me the kind of life

717
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,163
so that wouldn't happen.

718
00:47:28,205 --> 00:47:29,374
And yet...

719
00:47:30,292 --> 00:47:31,709
I still went to jail.

720
00:47:32,919 --> 00:47:34,962
That wasn't your fault.

721
00:47:35,046 --> 00:47:37,006
He didn't see it that way.

722
00:47:37,632 --> 00:47:39,634
I tried to explain.

723
00:47:39,717 --> 00:47:42,887
I made calls. I sent letters...

724
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,972
and he returned every last one of them.

725
00:47:45,056 --> 00:47:49,477
Then why let your father's last memory
of you be as a criminal?

726
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:51,187
A dead criminal.

727
00:47:51,688 --> 00:47:54,231
I think he'd be very proud
to know who you are now.

728
00:47:58,235 --> 00:47:59,529
Anyway, thank you.

729
00:48:00,488 --> 00:48:01,489
For what?

730
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,619
I can't imagine there are that many people
who know the saga of Luke Cage.

731
00:48:07,704 --> 00:48:09,456
It means a lot that you trust me.

732
00:48:10,582 --> 00:48:13,960
I didn't come to Harlem
to be a hero, Claire.

733
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:16,170
I came because I needed time
to figure shit out.

734
00:48:16,253 --> 00:48:17,422
So did I.

735
00:48:19,341 --> 00:48:20,633
You're right.

736
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:22,844
I can't keep running.

737
00:48:25,012 --> 00:48:27,056
But I want you to know
what you're getting into.

738
00:48:28,766 --> 00:48:30,518
If Cottonmouth talks,

739
00:48:30,602 --> 00:48:35,022
or if anybody connects the dots
that Luke Cage is Carl Lucas...

740
00:48:35,106 --> 00:48:36,566
I go back to Seagate.

741
00:48:36,649 --> 00:48:39,193
You knew the risks
and you did it anyway.

742
00:48:39,276 --> 00:48:41,153
That's what makes you a hero.

743
00:48:42,905 --> 00:48:44,574
Maybe I should get a mask after all.

744
00:48:45,282 --> 00:48:46,451
[groaning] No.

745
00:48:48,285 --> 00:48:50,955
Too much in Harlem
happens in the shadows.

746
00:48:52,374 --> 00:48:54,751
People fear what they can't see.

747
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:57,670
And that's what makes you different.
They see you.

748
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,632
It makes them trust you.

749
00:49:10,892 --> 00:49:12,685
Hey, Carl.

750
00:49:12,769 --> 00:49:15,229
One Judas for another.

751
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:22,278
I may have a lawyer friend who can help.

752
00:49:22,361 --> 00:49:23,780
Oh, really?

753
00:49:26,449 --> 00:49:27,492
[gunshot]

754
00:49:32,622 --> 00:49:33,665
Luke?

755
00:49:41,255 --> 00:49:43,716
- Luke?
- [groans]

756
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,259
- [gunshot]
- Luke?

757
00:49:45,342 --> 00:49:46,428
[Luke groans]

758
00:49:52,058 --> 00:49:54,727
[yelling]
