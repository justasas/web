[screaming]

6
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,474
We are ten feet from the
door. Just bust through.

7
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,603
I can't cover you from every
angle. You're the target.

8
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,272
- Oh, shit.
- Hold this.

9
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:04,357
Claire.

10
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:08,277
[mouthing]

11
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:16,244
- [Shades] What's going on here?
- Cage. Behind the bar.

12
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,873
[bullets ricocheting]

13
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,541
He's bulletproof, ain't he?

14
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:25,253
She ain't. Shoot her first.

15
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,671
[breathing heavily]

16
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:42,937
[groans]

17
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:12,383
- [bullets ricocheting faintly]
- That's not gonna hold 'em long.

18
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,929
- [banging]
- [breathing heavily]

19
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:17,806
No.

20
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:23,061
They barricaded the door and
shit. There's no way through.

21
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,854
Forget Cage.

22
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:26,749
The cops are gonna flood
this place in a minute.

23
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,566
No. We're staying.

24
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,568
Nobody leaves. Not until we have them.

25
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:34,613
- What you talking about, Willis?
- You got jokes? Right now?

26
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:35,865
You're the one who's joking

27
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:37,968
if you think that we're
escaping here without a plan.

28
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:42,038
Later for that pre-written shit.
Sometimes you gotta freestyle.

29
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,999
Look, you got one Judas bullet left.

30
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,251
What are you gonna do if
Luke Cage takes you head on?

31
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:48,878
Do I look worried?

32
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:51,005
No. That's the problem.

33
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,468
Place is airtight.
Back is sealed off, too.

34
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,929
[Shades] So there's no other way out?

35
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,724
- No. Ty caught a straggler.
- [Stryker] Good.

36
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,851
Anybody ain't us is a hostage.

37
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:05,061
Make sure none of them
look me in the eye.

38
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,396
Lopes, Sugar, you're babysitting.

39
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,440
Move 'em up there and
face them towards the wall.

40
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,192
Anybody resists, blindfold 'em.

41
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,986
Too much lip, shoot 'em in the head.

42
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,362
The rest will get the message.

43
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,781
[men talking indistinctly]

44
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,199
Let me go!

45
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,914
Take Diet Obama upstairs, Ty.

46
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:27,083
Keep a gun on him till I get up there.

47
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,584
Take your hands off me!

48
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,463
- You can't do this!
- [Stryker] Yes, we can.

49
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,631
Zip.

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,344
While you're up there, get me my key.

51
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,827
You know the one I'm talking about.

52
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,647
What the hell are you doing
calling me out by my first name?

53
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,357
[Shades scoffs]

54
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,735
You're dreaming if you think
we're getting out of here.

55
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,030
You shot a female cop
in front of 100 people.

56
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,614
All people will remember

57
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:02,410
is Luke Cage going all King Kong with
a bitch and jumping off a balcony.

58
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,747
What they're gonna remember is
Luke Cage running from the bullets.

59
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,666
All they know outside is
that Cage lost his mind,

60
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,960
shots were fired, and it's a standoff.

61
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:13,046
Confusion is our friend.

62
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,964
We kill Luke and Misty,

63
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:18,426
suddenly, we're the heroes
who stopped the Harlem Menace.

64
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,762
For all they know, he killed her.

65
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:23,973
With them dead, we control the story.

66
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:26,350
That's your plan? That's it?

67
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,352
The bigger the stall,

68
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:30,814
the more time we have
for other diversions.

69
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:34,025
Misty will be dead, I'll
have another shot at Cage,

70
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,795
and there's bound to be
another way out of here.

71
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:37,570
We'll cross that bridge soon enough.

72
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,615
Okay. How do we hold them off right now?

73
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:45,119
I'm gonna be Luke Cage.

74
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,331

[weakly] Luke, I'm cold.

78

- I think you nicked an artery.
- What?

79
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,950
[Luke] That's why it's bleeding so fast.

80
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,036
And I ain't gonna lie, Misty.

81
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:10,039
- You're not gonna like this.
- What do you mean?

We should just go out the back.

86

- They've already secured it.
- [groans] How do you know?

87
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:26,930
It's what I would do. The only
way he can win at this point

88
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:28,933
is if he can control who
comes in and who leaves.

89
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,225
Either way, I gotta
get you someplace safe.

90
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,776
[Misty] What the hell?

91
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,279
Lucky Luciano used to own this building.

92
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,442
It still has a lot of
prohibition nooks and crannies.

93
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,366
[Sugar] Sit down!

94
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,493
Turn around. Face the wall.

96
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,841
Hmm? Luke Cage? Or Carl Lucas?

97
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,386
Who is Willis Stryker?

His street name is Diamondback.

101
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,773
He was the hardware connect for
Cottonmouth that you were looking for.

102
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,112
- Mmm.
- He's also my half-brother. [sighs]

What're you doing?

106
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,845
- I love this part.
- What?

107
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,641

[Thembi] It's chaos out here, Pat.

113
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,453
Several people are injured,

114
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:17,081
mostly from the stampede
to escape the club,

115
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:18,916
but a few have gunshot wounds.

116
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,878
Councilwoman Mariah Dillard
was whisked away by her security

117
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,132
<i>and most of the injured protesters
have been rushed to the hospital.</i>

118
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:30,053
<i>Less than an hour after an
anti-Luke Cage rally began,</i>

119
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:32,638
<i>Luke Cage himself entered the event.</i>

120
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,309
According to protesters and
a confidential NYPD source,

121
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:40,896
shots rang out after veteran Harlem
police Detective Mercedes Knight

122
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,773
<i>attempted to arrest Cage,</i>

123
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,859
the dangerous fugitive who
attacked two police officers

124
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,861
<i>on a widely seen dashcam video.</i>

125
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,656
<i>And moments ago, we heard the
sound of what we believe is...</i>

126
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,509
I wanna know if the explosion
came from the inside.

127
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,120
Find out what you can right away.
And somebody get me Misty Knight.

128
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,584
ESU has just arrived.

129
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,422
- We're going tactical in five minutes.
- No, you're not.

130
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,841
- Stand down.
- We're going in.

131
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,926
We got an active shooter
and a hostage situation.

132
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,197
They haven't asked for anything
and one of ours is in there.

133
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:14,722
We need to be careful.

134
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,350
This whole thing goes through me.

135
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:20,186
Inspector, it's the chief.

136
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:22,230
Yes, sir.

137
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:38,563
[Zip] No way he went out the back.

138
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,090
[Stryker] Scour this whole place.

139
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:53,010
Every inch. Even if it's obvious.

140
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,264
We are making way too much noise.

141
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:58,807
They're gonna bust in
that door any minute.

142
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,058
It's getting messy.

143
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:04,105
- Why are you so shook?
- 'Cause I'm clearheaded.

144
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:07,358
And I'm not? Look, I'm
spitting off the dome.

145
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,693
It's true, but I haven't
had a misplaced rhyme yet.

146
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,445
Violence breaks out

147
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,323
at an anti-Luke Cage rally
when Luke Cage shows up?

148
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:17,618
Come on, this shit is poetry.

149
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,413
- Is he worth it?
- Absolutely.

150
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:22,873
Did you talk to Mariah?

151
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,419
- She's on it.
- Good.

152
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:30,631
They're scared of Cage now.
They're afraid people will die.

153
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,135
She'll use that to close the deal. Hmm?

154
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,278
[Chang] We got a call.

155
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,696
- Is it her?
- No.

156
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,073
It's from inside. A landline.

157
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,954
This is Inspector Priscilla
Ridley from the NYPD.

158
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,789
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

159
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,416
This is Damon Boone.

160
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,753
I've been instructed to
tell you to stay away.

161
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,922
Luke Cage has taken us hostage

162
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:16,176
and he warns that he'll start
killing people if the police approach.

163
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:19,430
<i>What does he want?</i>

164
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,639
He...

165
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:26,937
Unpredictability gives us leverage.

166
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,064
[Damon] All you're
doing is scaring them.

167
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,024
Let me help you. What do you want?

168
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,694
Reciprocity.

169
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,991
No one in the department is
going to bow to terrorism.

170
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,993
Oh, I'm counting on that.

171
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,127
Is that even clean?

172
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,879
Clean enough for a tourniquet.

173
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,548
Who were you, a Boy Scout?

174
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:57,510
Force Recon.

175
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:00,304
They had to... hear that blast outside.

176
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:02,180
I should call Ridley.

177
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,892
[groans]

178
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,229
[softly] Oh, shit.

179
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,274
[sighs]

180
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,654
[cell phone vibrating]

181
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,535
- Misty?
- [Misty distorted] <i>Inspector?</i>

182
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,329
<i>- Inspector?</i>
- Misty.

183
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,831
- [distorted] <i>Misty.</i>
- Inspector...

184
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,083
[groans]

185
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,294
Do you have your phone?

186
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:34,129
- I lost mine a long time ago.
- Shit!

187
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:41,595
Look, you gotta go upstairs, okay?

188
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,347
Those people, they need you.

189
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:49,019
I can't leave you. You'll bleed out.

190
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,146
You'll die.

191
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,777
I need to get you stabilized.

192
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,740
Then I'll think of some way to help
Claire and everybody else up there.

193
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:05,786
[breath trembling] You
can't negotiate with him.

194
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,205
I won't.

195
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,335
[voice breaking] I don't wanna...

196
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,548
I don't wanna bleed to death
on the floor, like Scarfe.

197
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,971
Not on my watch.

198
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,227
[sniffs]

199
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,233
I think you deserve a drink, Councilman.

200
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,237
- I don't drink.
- Yes, you do.

201
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,247
[smacks lips] Ah.

202
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,877
Nothing like an aged Scotch.

203
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,128
You know...

204
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,548
there was a time you'd
cross a Scotsman...

205
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:04,052
and he wouldn't think twice about
cutting your head off with a sword.

206
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,056
I like a drink that encourages such...

207
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,267
decisiveness.

208
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:14,897
I can help you negotiate even more.

209
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,357
I can speak for you.
Get you what you want.

210
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,822
You read the Bible, Damon?

211
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,199
Sometimes.

212
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,993
When nothing else makes sense.

213
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,461
I read that every day.

214
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:40,088
Gift from my father to my mother.

215
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,926
My mother left it to
me after she passed.

216
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,262
Please.

217
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,557
Go ahead.

218
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,114
[Damon shuddering]

219
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,847
[Candace inhales sharply]

220
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,186
[softly] Hey.

221
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,271
What's hurting?

222
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,150
I messed up my ankle real bad.

223
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,116
[Sugar] Hey!

224
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,036
Sit your fine ass down.

225
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,413
[sighs] She hurt her
leg. It could be broken.

226
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:56,790
So?

227
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,920
She's my best friend, and I'm a nurse.

228
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,631
Don't you have enough to worry about?

229
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,341
True. Just do it quick.

230
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,866
- Don't help, okay? I'll do all the work.
- [exhales deeply]

231
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,017
- [gasps]
- I'm gonna take your boot off.

232
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,144
- [inhales sharply]
- I see.

233
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,605
[Candace gasping]

234
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:20,939
[whimpering]

235
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:23,400
Move your leg like this.

236
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,611
- Your toes?
- [groans]

237
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:32,325
Yeah, I don't think it's a break.

238
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,037
- But it's a pretty bad sprain.
- [sighs]

239
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,498
[sighs] Were you protesting?

240
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,375
I'm a VIP hostess. And you?

241
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,587
Um... [sighs] I was...

242
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,130
helping a friend.

243
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,387
- This is some bullshit.
- You got Luke Cage?

244
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,683
Please. That nigga's on that
bulletproof Houdini shit for real.

245
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,976
[Sugar] What about downstairs?

246
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,271
There's no way downstairs
from the kitchen.

247
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,107
Is your friend Luke Cage?

248
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,861
- Do you know him?
- Hard to forget.

249
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,405
He used to work here.

250
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:14,076
This whole thing is my fault.

251
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,162
[stuttering] Hey... what's
happening? What's wrong?

252
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,164
[voice breaking] I did
something really bad.

253
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,249
Hey.

254
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,169
What's wrong with her?

255
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,213
[sighs] She's in a lot of pain.

256
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,846
[whispering] Tell me.

257
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:34,989
[whispering] I was so scared.

258
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,725
They paid me to say I
saw Luke kill Cottonmouth.

259
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,018
Who's they?

260
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,479
Mariah Dillard.

261
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:46,066
You wanna help Luke?

262
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,402
Then you tell me how he could
have disappeared from that kitchen

263
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,904
that no one could've escaped from.

264
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:56,284
This is a prewar prohibition building.
There's a storage space underneath.

265
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:59,705
Employees used to go down there to
fool around or sleep between shifts

266
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,999
when we had to prep a big event.

267
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,751
So it's downstairs in
the basement? Where?

268
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,418
By the staff lockers.

269
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,838
Would anybody else know about that?

270
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,965
Not unless they worked in the kitchen.

271
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,134
I'm the only person from
the waitstaff here...

272
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,969
- except Luke.
- [sighs]

273
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:16,722
The only way in or out
of that storage room

274
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,181
is through the kitchen.

275
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:23,020
Luke can make another door. Okay,
I'm gonna need you to pass out.

276
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,397
- What?
- I need you to pass out.

277
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,940
I'm gonna get us out of this.

278
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,652
- [sighs]
- [Claire] Oh... Oh, my God!

279
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:31,403
- Help us!
- [Sugar] What now?

280
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,822
- [Claire] She's diabetic.
- Where's her shit?

281
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,992
[stutters] Uh, it must be in,
uh, the staff locker downstairs.

282
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,537
Yo, Lopes. Escort the
night nurse here downstairs.

283
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:41,830
Thank you.

284
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,041
Will you look after her?

285
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,793
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Uh-huh.

286
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,711
Okay, baby.

287
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,424
Come on. Come on, now.

288
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,302
- Just down here. [grunts]
- Just hurry up.

289
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,220
[Lopes groaning]

290
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,777
You'll live.

291
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,537
Hey.

292
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,961
[sighs]

293
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:32,715
So, what does this brother
of yours want, anyway?

294
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,049
Revenge.

295
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:37,845
He framed me. He sent me to Seagate.

296
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,891
He's trying to pin this
whole hostage thing on you.

297
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,770
Did he set you up for
Cottonmouth's murder, too?

298
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,772
I wouldn't put it past him.

299
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:51,649
You're the only one
that knows the truth.

300
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:54,611
I'll need your help
when we get out of this.

301
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:55,946
You'll have it.

302
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,742
[indistinct chatter]

303
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,086
[siren wailing]

304
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,466
- We need to go in.
- Not until we have a plan.

305
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,094
Cage is super strong and bulletproof.

306
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,847
The longer we sit, the more
entrenched this lunatic gets.

307
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,932
We've had exactly one
conversation with a hostage,

308
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,601
Damon Boone, the politician,
and we got cut off.

309
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,938
Now, I am with you on going
in, but we need a plan.

310
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,982
We've never faced
anything like this before.

311
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,864
Inspector Ridley? Blake
Tower, DA's Office.

312
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,616
- Mr. Tower. What's going on?
- You tell me.

313
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,077
We've been closely
following Cage's activities.

314
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,596
The mayor would like
me to help coordinate.

315
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,581
- The situation is coordinated.
- Really?

316
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,212
- We're on the same side...
- Hmm.

317
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,416
And I'd like to guide you

318
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,734
as how best to achieve an outcome
that's beneficial to all parties.

319
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:58,985
Yeah, the most beneficial outcome

320
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,929
is for me to get those hostages
and my detective out alive,

321
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,680
and Luke Cage in cuffs.

322
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,933
None of which you can give me.

323
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,059
- Inspector?
- Yeah.

324
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,520
We have independent confirmation
that the explosion came from inside.

325
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,773
- Now can we go in?
- We wait.

326
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,192
What if he just shoots
all those people dead?

327
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,401
That is not Cage's MO.

328
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,696
Every encounter we've ever had
with him, he's never used a gun.

329
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,031
He doesn't have to.

330
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:24,576
- Well, he's using one now, isn't he?
- Well, I saw that dashcam video.

331
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,263
He can take out your whole team in
mere seconds and not get a scratch.

332
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,538
I agree.

333
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,624
In order to engage this asshole,
we need to bring the heat.

334
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,669
You got any ideas Mr., uh, ADA?

335
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,464
Look, the mayor is in
a closed-door session

336
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,925
discussing enhanced
weapons for law enforcement.

337
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,176
With who?

338
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,012
Mariah Dillard.

339
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:48,641
[Misty] What's wrong?

340
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,685
It needs to be tighter.

341
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,106
Brace yourself.

342
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,985
- One...
- [yells]

343
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,778
[groaning]

344
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:02,614
[Luke breathing heavily]

345
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:08,120
I feel like getting my
Crispus Attucks on up there.

346
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,622
Mmm, you gotta be smart about this.

347
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:14,167
There are too many innocent people
up there who could end up dead.

348
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,420
I might not have a choice.

349
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,175
I had a choice.

350
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:24,928
I should have trusted you.

351
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,015
I know.

352
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,349
[chuckles]

353
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,560
[scoffs] You didn't make it easy.

354
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:42,237
Don't go doing anything stupid.

355
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,365
Like what?

356
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,492
Be a hero.

357
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,745
I'm not the hero type.

358
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:52,789
Are you sure?

359
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,335
Looks to me like that's
what you've always been.

360
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,095
[faint tapping]

361
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:08,596
You hear that?

362
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,557
[tapping continues]

363
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,648
[tapping continues]

364
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,946
Why the hell didn't you leave the club?

365
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:52,265
When have I ever done as I was told?

366
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,982
[Luke] Misty! Misty!

367
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,027
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

368
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,863
What's going on?

369
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,823
We might have something
to take Luke Cage out.

370
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,534
An experimental weapon that's
never been authorized before.

371
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:12,744
[Tower] Hmm.

372
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:15,663
- Someone's pulling strings. Is that you?
- No.

373
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:19,292
Then it's Mariah Dillard. Did
you put her in touch with someone?

374
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:22,087
It's Boone again.

375
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,886
Mr. Boone. Are you okay?

376
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,971
Luke Cage would like
to give you his demands.

377
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,390
<i>We're listening.</i>

378
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,308
He wants a chopper on the roof.

379
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,995
As a sign of goodwill,
Mr. Cage is willing

380
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,146
<i>to let half the hostages
go at the end of this call.</i>

381
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:44,276
Me and a few others will
remain to ensure his escape.

382
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,985
We will get right on that.

383
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,239
Is Detective Knight still alive?

384
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,202
<i>Yes. Yes, she is.</i>

385
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:56,963
We will need proof of
life before we proceed.

386
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,040
[mouthing] No.

387
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,084
He's saying you're not in
a position to make demands.

388
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:03,295
<i>Well, then we have a problem.</i>

389
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:06,923
He says a few hostages
will be coming out now.

390
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,402
- [woman] Got it!
- He's stalling.

391
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:11,237
I know what he's doing. He
could just want a way out.

392
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,447
We should keep on stalling him
until the new weapons show up.

393
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:16,183
I take my orders from the chief.

394
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,850
What's really going on here?

395
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:20,478
Do I want us to use a weapon

396
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,689
that can take out a
man that's bulletproof?

397
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,899
- Absolutely not.
- I don't understand.

398
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,569
Look, any weapon that
the police or military has

399
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,321
eventually ends up on the street.

400
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,990
You know it's dangerous to
even show that kind of power.

401
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,327
Hey, but I don't see
we got much of a choice.

402
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:40,039
- I don't trust Mariah Dillard.
- Yeah, I don't either.

403
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,418
But she has juice with
people way above our paygrade.

404
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,181
I just don't want this to turn into
the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

405
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:50,383
Frank Castle shot the city to hell,
and he only had regular bullets.

406
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:53,067
Now imagine what he or somebody
like him can do with these things.

407
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:56,098
Yeah, I hear you. Who is the
one person you don't see here?

408
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,100
Hmm. A chief.

409
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:01,436
And what does that tell you?
He wants distance. Deniability.

410
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,896
If this goes wrong, the
blood is on my hands,

411
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,523
- and mine alone.
- [Chang] Inspector.

412
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,525
There's movement at the door.

413
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,491
- [officer 1] Eyes up. He's comingout.
- [officer 2] Hold fire.

414
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:19,496
- [officer 3] Hands! Hands!
- [officer 4] Put your hands in the air!

415
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:22,290
Step forward.

416
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:28,421
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

417
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,508
- Move it, come on!
- That's right. This way! Go, go!

418
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:32,592
We're clear.

419
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,435
- Get them out of here. Come on.
- Follow me.

420
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,609
Well, it went clean through.

421
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,657
- You've lost a lot of blood.
- Mmm.

422
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,161
I handled the situation the best I
could under the circumstances, Claire.

423
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:01,621
[Claire] Yeah, you're lucky
she didn't lose her arm.

424
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,040
That is way too close to the wound.

425
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,335
Me, medical shit. You, bulletproof shit.

426
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,379
Y'all sound married.

427
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,301
- [Claire sighs]
- That's good.

428
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:17,595
I'm gonna get some stuff.

429
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:26,396
[Stryker] Oh, my mama
loved blue-eyed soul.

430
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,066
["Son of a Preacher Man" playing]

431
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:36,448
I wish you could have met Dana...

432
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,867
my mother.

433
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:48,210
- She's beautiful.
- Yes.

434
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:52,505
She was a secretary
for a big-time preacher.

435
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,717
A bold, charismatic man who...

436
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,678
loved to talk loud and dress fancy.

437
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,306
- Like you.
- Exactly.

438
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:04,851
They worked long, stressful hours and...

439
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,896
Well, they had a lot of
laughter in that back office.

440
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,400
Something was bound to happen and...

441
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:14,361
it did.

442
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:16,863
I was born.

443
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:20,199
But he was married.

444
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,872
And everything was good...

445
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,544
until the preacher's wife, two
years later, had a baby boy.

446
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,087
A miracle child.

447
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,508
And everything changed.

448
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:39,844
The great Reverend Lucas

449
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:43,306
wasn't man enough to give
his first son his last name.

450
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,850
You see, I was still Willis Stryker.

451
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,435
But his real son...

452
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,104
was Carl Lucas.

453
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:54,317
But... here's the crazy thing.

454
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,069
Nobody said nothing.

455
00:28:58,238 --> 00:28:59,447
And Carl and I...

456
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:03,159
we grew up best friends, but...

457
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,077
there was all this tension.

458
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,455
You could just feel it

459
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:10,708
like a draft coming
in from under a door.

460
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,880
I just wanted him to see me.

461
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,342
I was a good boy.

462
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,095
I did well in school.

463
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,601
But he always loved Carl more.

464
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:37,234
- [indistinct radio chatter]
- [sirens wailing]

465
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:41,072
Inspector? A word?

466
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:42,490
I'll be right back.

467
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:48,996
Some of the hostages'
statements are not matching up.

468
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,624
Most are saying that they saw
people inside shooting at Cage,

469
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,293
not the other way around.

470
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,253
We might have this all wrong.

471
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:58,756
We might.

472
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,943
We'll have time to get to the
bottom of what's going on later.

473
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:03,111
But right now, we need to
get control of this situation,

474
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,305
and we are not in control yet.

475
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:12,312
[man whimpering]

476
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,981
You! Stop looking around!

477
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:25,241
- The first of the hostages are gone.
- Good.

478
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,135
You're not worried about
what they're gonna say?

479
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,997
By the time anyone figures out the
truth, Harlem's Menace will be dead

480
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,582
or I will.

481
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,084
I ain't testifying. Are you?

482
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,044
[scoffs] Why would I?

483
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,715
Would you really want me to
confirm that you had no plan?

484
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,427
Think about how stupid that
would make both of us look.

485
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:47,347
Have you forgotten
who you're talking to?

486
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,723
Have you?

487
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,521
- What about the helicopter?
- Please.

488
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,689
There's no way they'll agree to that.

489
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,232
- I know.
- Hmm.

490
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,027
[Stryker] What happened?

491
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,530
- Lopes got pushed down the stairs.
- What?

492
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:05,573
One of the hostages passed out,

493
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:07,700
and another one went to
go get her medication.

494
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:11,162
- Which hostage?
- The waitress from VIP.

495
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,205
The West Indian-lookin' chick.

496
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,463
Candace. God...

497
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,050
- Did you find the other one?
- No.

498
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:29,346
Diamondback and I aren't
finished speaking, Sugar.

499
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:31,558
So I'm gonna need y'all to fall back.

500
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:32,892
My bad.

501
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,772
[Shades sighs]

502
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:38,940
What?

503
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:44,862
Candace is the one that Mariah used to
pin Cottonmouth's murder on Luke Cage.

504
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:45,988
The other one...

505
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,032
Is probably the one who
stabbed me at the clinic.

506
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,201
Damn it. I knew she looked familiar.

507
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:51,994
She probably came in with Cage.

508
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,871
- Candace knows what Cage looks like.
- Hmm.

509
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:57,584
The other chick with
him, if she escapes...

510
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,044
Either one of them could
blow our cover story.

511
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:04,298
- They all got to go.
- Take care of it then.

512
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:08,761
You and me, we get out of this...

513
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:12,474
we're gonna have a long talk.

514
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:14,266
Best believe that.

515
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:16,769
Hmm.

516
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:20,482
[Shades] Let's go. Downstairs.

517
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:31,534
Carl, Carl, Carl.

518
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,620
[over PA] <i>Here you go again.</i>

519
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:37,206
<i>Bobbing and weaving because
you're too scared to take a hit.</i>

520
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,584
It's just like I taught you in the ring.

521
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:43,129
No matter how much you duck,

522
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:46,173
eventually, you're gonna
have to knuck and buck.

523
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:50,011
<i>If you don't surrender yourself...</i>

524
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:53,389
and Misty Knight...

525
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:57,977
I'm gonna kill a hostage
every ten minutes...

526
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,689
- starting with Damon Boone.
- [gasps]

527
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,026
He's not bluffing.

528
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:09,531
- I gotta take him out.
- You're walking into a trap.

529
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:11,824
- You know that.
- I'm counting on it.

530
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:15,202
You don't always have to fight to win.

531
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,997
Look, if things go south,
we are surrounded by cops.

532
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,500
I'll make sure that they
know you're innocent.

533
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,669
They'll know the truth, I promise.

534
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:25,337
Don't go dying on me, Misty.

535
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,591
- Not on my watch.
- Hmm. That's usually his line.

536
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:29,676
[sighs]

537
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,928
They used that waitress,
Candace, to frame you.

538
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,305
[Misty scoffs] Lyin' ass.

539
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:35,682
Where is she?

540
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:37,850
[Claire] Upstairs with the others.

541
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,562
Hey.

542
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:43,606
What if he has more of
those special bullets?

543
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,426
That's a chance I'll have to take.

544
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,737
If I don't walk away from
this, you need to lay in the cut

545
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:52,114
until you hear from
me, Bobby Fish or Misty.

546
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,033
No one else.

547
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:56,536
- You know how well I follow orders.
- I'm serious.

548
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,539
Willis plays for keeps...

549
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:02,875
especially with people
I care about the most.

550
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,838
Promise me.

551
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,050
I will.

552
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:13,636
- You have a place in mind?
- Yeah.

553
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:15,847
Be careful.

554
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,183
Always.

555
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:22,019
You're so corny.

556
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:31,320
[inhales sharply]

557
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,739
[groaning]

558
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:40,872
Keep that right there,
okay? Arm turned up.

559
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:43,625
- Shit! [groans]
- Shh!

560
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:45,752
You could've warned me.

561
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,379
Yeah, I could've.

562
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,051
Talk me through what you're about to do.

563
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:59,473
Okay. I am gonna use
this dental floss...

564
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,892
to tie off your...

565
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:04,896
- hosing vein.
- I think I'm gonna throw up.

566
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,564
[inhales sharply]

567
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:09,441
- [groans]
- [Claire softly] There.

568
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:13,404
This is gonna cut the blood supply
to your hand and your forearm.

569
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:15,364
[Misty breathing heavily]

570
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:16,987
The longer this stays in...

571
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:20,369
the higher the chances
of losing your arm.

572
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,081
Look, I want to apologize.

573
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,583
I shouldn't have lost my cool with you.

574
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:29,671
Ah, you can't be to blame
with this kind of crazy.

575
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,506
Well, you're in pretty deep.

576
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,635
Yeah, well, trouble stalks
me like a crazy ex-boyfriend.

577
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:37,219
[chuckles]

578
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,263
I hear you.

579
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:42,767
You and Luke go out for coffee yet?

580
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,520
Uh, we haven't had time.

581
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,231
He doesn't like coffee.

582
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,984
I know.

583
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:56,530
[inhales deeply] All done.

584
00:35:57,782 --> 00:35:59,491
Damn, you're good.

585
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:03,454
You're good at your
job, I'm good at mine.

586
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,751
[man] <i>Mariah talked to the
mayor. The guns are a go.</i>

587
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:09,919
<i>Good luck, brother.</i>

588
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,550
Councilwoman Dillard
never ceases to amaze me.

589
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,011
Pressure...

590
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:22,431
brings the best out of certain people.

591
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,018
So... where was I?

592
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:27,186
Together...

593
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,563
we were bold.

594
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,901
We stole a red Corvette,
just like the song...

595
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:37,321
just... for a joyride.

596
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,906
You see, I was a Prince fan, and...

597
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:41,993
Carl was all about Michael.

598
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:46,205
We were so busy arguing,
we didn't even see the cop.

599
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,791
But Carl was a Lucas.

600
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:51,878
I was a Stryker.

601
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,758
It was over before it even began.

602
00:36:57,884 --> 00:36:59,844
[over PA] When it came
time for sentencing,

603
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:04,390
the preacher convinced the judge to
let his golden boy join the Marines.

604
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:05,725
Me?

605
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,269
Juvie.

606
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,064
Got jumped two days in.

607
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:15,902
Boy drew a shank and...

608
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:18,195
[grunting]

609
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:20,948
I killed him in self-defense.

610
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,742
[grunting continues]

611
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,038
So I got sent away to hard time.

612
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:30,875
<i>And sweet Dana?</i>

613
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:38,174
Oh, her cancer ate her
alive and she died alone...

614
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:41,928
<i>in a shelter...</i>

615
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,890
<i>without a friend in the world.</i>

616
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:49,101
You see, the good Reverend Lucas...

617
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:53,355
well, he stopped caring
for her after I was gone.

618
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,482
<i>He was free of her...</i>

619
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,278
<i>and I was powerless.</i>

620
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,824
But she, oh...

621
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:05,367
Oh, she still loved him...

622
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:10,747
and... well, she wanted me to
have something of my father's.

623
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,627
<i>God had me at hello with Genesis.</i>

624
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,754
<i>The story of Cain and Abel.</i>

625
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:24,345
When God asked Cain where
Abel was after he killed him...

626
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:28,182
Cain asked, "Am I my brother's keeper?"

627
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,934
See...

628
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:34,981
<i>I thought that was some cool shit</i>
<i>Wesley Snipes made up in</i> New Jack City.

629

[grunts]

630
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,738
Turns out...

631
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:45,908
it's real.

632
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:48,244
So...

633
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:51,788
after I kill Luke Cage...

634
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:58,295
I'm gonna stand over
him and say, "Yes, I am."

635
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,896
- Why are you telling me all this?
- [glove powering up]

636
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,694
[grunts]

637
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:28,159
Because you're about to
meet my mother, Damon.

638
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:31,078
Tell her I love her.

639
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:32,246
- [grunts]
- [screams]

640
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,165
[glass shattering]

641
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:45,009
[Stryker] Shades, show
Councilman Boone to the door.

- Door!
- [officer 1] Opening door!

645
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:57,771
[officer 2] Put your hands in the air!

646
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:05,446
Go, go, go. Let's go.
Let's spread in. Move in.

647
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:07,089
Let's go, guys. Get him up. Get him up.

648
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:10,701
Someone grab his feet.

[indistinct chatter]

650
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,420
He's dead.

651
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:24,381
Chest is caved in.

652
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:28,010
Move in now.

<i>It has been confirmed</i>

654
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:35,684

was indeed Harlem's own, Damon Boone.</i>

655

<i>At this time, we still have no
clear idea what Luke Cage wants.</i>

[creaking continues]

00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,797
- [woman] What's going on?
- [Sugar] Turn around.

659
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:00,602
I see Luke Cage was here.

[officer 1] All right.
Still waiting on word.

676
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,056
I hope they know what
they're authorizing.

677
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:21,868
Our main focus should
be freeing the hostages.

678
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:23,852
They shouldn't shoot
unless absolutely necessary.

679
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,980
My men know the job. Stop
meddling and let us get to work.

680
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,149
Hey...

681
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,319
Luke Cage might not be behind this.

682
00:43:33,154 --> 00:43:34,905
I'll ask him when I see him.

683
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:52,423
[Sugar] Nobody move.

684
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:54,090
I ain't playing.

[Stryker] Hey, Carl.

690
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:20,284
What's happening, brother?

691
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:23,787
We have what looks like
more hostages being released.

692
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,207
And ESU Officers are
approaching the building entrance

693
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,042
to allegedly confront Luke Cage.

694
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:33,714
- Let her go.
- Oh, we'll get to that.

695
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,344
Couldn't we have made
amends a long time ago?

696
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:40,429
Couldn't you have
died during childbirth?

697
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:43,765
Easy there.

698
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:45,226

00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,864
I always liked her.

702
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:03,076
I couldn't stand Etta. What a bitch!

703
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,255
- [Banging on door]
- [officer 1] We have lethal rounds, Cage

704
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:16,840
- We will use them.
- [Stryker] Gotta go.

705
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,300
With that hostage you killed,

706
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:20,802
they're gonna shoot first
and ask questions later.

707
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:24,598
Mariah supplied the force
with some Judas 2.0s,

708
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,725
so they won't bounce off of you.

709
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:28,894
- They'll stick.
- [Candace whimpers]

710
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:31,438
You gonna run, Miracle Whip?

711
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:34,358
Or you gonna save the damsel?

712
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:35,817
Willis.

713
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:37,444
Bye, Carl.

714
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:38,737
Bye, Felicia.

715
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,155
[Candace screaming]

716
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,836
- [officer 1] Go, go!
- [officer 2] Get in there!

717
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:56,838
- [banging]
- [indistinct chatter]

718
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:01,718
I'm sorry, Luke.

719
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,759
- [officer 1] Move in!
- [officer 2] We have visual.

720
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:09,685
[officer 1] Hands in the air!

721
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:11,520
[officer 2] You heard him. Don't move.

722
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:16,024
[officer 1] In the air!

723
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:24,032
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What are you doing?

724
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,117
- You want to get out of here, right?
- Yeah.

725
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:29,204
Okay. This way. This way.

726
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,878
[officer] I said in the air, now!

727
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,548
[indistinct radio chatter]

728
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:49,265
- Hey, you got a ride?
- Cottonmouth had three.

729
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,979
[indistinct chatter]

730
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,984
[Ridley] It worked.

731
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:00,902
They got him. Didn't even have to fire.

732
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:03,321
That's all that matters. Those
weapons are a game changer.

733
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:05,866
- Hope we never have to use them.
- [Misty] Inspector.

734
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:09,786
[Ridley] Are you okay?

735
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,955
Listen, Luke Cage is innocent.

736
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:14,750
What you think you saw
is not what happened.

737
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,711
Why don't you focus on getting
fixed up? Let us clean up this mess.

738
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:22,257
This mess is Willis Stryker's
doing. He's the one who shot me.

739
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,760
Listen, his name is Diamondback.

740
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:26,177
I believe you, Misty.

741
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:27,655
There are dozens of
other people to talk to.

742
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:30,641
And Luke is still wanted for
Albini's murder, Cottonmouth's murder,

743
00:47:30,724 --> 00:47:33,309
- and attacking those cops.
- You are not listening to me.

744
00:47:34,645 --> 00:47:38,106
Luke Cage is innocent of everything.

745
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,401
And after we have him in
custody, we'll verify it.

746
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:42,694
Look... I trust you.

747
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:44,154
I do.

748
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,990
But we have to verify.

749
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,328
The only thing that
matters is the truth.

750
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,711
We got you, Detective.
Let me look at your arm.

751
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:03,549
Listen, whatever you need to
do, you need to do it right here.

752
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:07,010
Okay? I'm not going anywhere. Not yet.

753
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,973
[siren wails]

754
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:17,729
[softly] Let's go.

755
00:48:43,714 --> 00:48:46,091
[man] Yo! That's Luke Cage!

756
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:48,218
- Check him out, man!
- [woman] That's him!

757
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:50,303
Yo, B! There go Luke!

758
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:54,349
[man] We know you innocent, Luke!

759
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:08,446
[mouthing] Go.

760
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,801
[funk music playing]

761
