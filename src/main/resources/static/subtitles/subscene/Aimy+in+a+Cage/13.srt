<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

21
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,020
Madam Jiang

22
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,390
Madam, today I will take care of you.

23
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,850
I'm Cai Hong. In the future, let me manage your tasks.

24
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,420
As you are trying to wake up, I will serve you well.

25
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,650
Madam. The weather is really nice today.

26
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,490
It's every fresh.

27
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,490
It's a pity that you can't feel it. Thus, I opened the door wider.

28
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,830
This way, the air from outside will come into the house.

29
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,780
Wu Long.

30
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,530
What are you doing? Why did you leave the door open?

31
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,340
- I wanted to let the air in. <br>- Shut up.

32
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,520
What kind of intentions do you have?

33
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,220
You clearly know that Madam is sick and you let the door wide open?

34
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,540
Are you trying to let her catch a cold?

35
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,230
Bad thing. No wonder, Miss wanted me to keep watch over you.

36
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,580
I am washing Madam's legs.

37
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,710
Look at how dirty this towel is.

38
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,820
Don't you know how to work?

39
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,010
The water in the tub is dirty.

40
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,880
You are going to wash Madam's legs with this?

41
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,100
Are you inconsiderate or brainless?

42
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,720
I have never seen anyone so stupid.

43
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,790
Change the water and wash the towel until it's clean.

44
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,250
I just washed this towel.

45
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,740
Rotten wench. You still dare to talk back to me?

46
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm telling you. If I say it's dirty, it's dirty then.

47
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,240
People like you are not clean in the first place.

48
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,330
You are dirtying my eyes.

49
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,950
What you are saying is really too ugly.

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,470
You still dare to criticise what I said?

51
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,860
If you are someone of substance, don't take advantage of a place.

52
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,160
Get lost and stop harming others.

53
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,800
Fortunately, Miss told me to watch you. If not, I wonder what harm you would have caused Madam.

54
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,940
You are such a bad thing.

55
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,190
Dirty thing.

56
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,990
- You dirty thing. <br>- What are you doing?

57
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,740
Young Master.

58
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,220
Wu Cai Hong doesn't know how to do her work. I'm teaching her.

59
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,780
In the future, if you want to teach your subordinates, do it outside. Don't disturb Madam.

60
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,420
Yes, Young Master.

61
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,850
What are you still doing here?

62
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,270
I didn't let you in here to freeload on us.

63
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,690
If you don't know the rules, study them well.

64
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,860
I will work hard.

65
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,980
Why are you still standing here? Change the water and wash the towel now.

66
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,410
Remember to wash your hands thoroughly.

67
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,370
Don't argue with others. Did you hear me?

68
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,840
If you don't change your personality, let's see how I will handle you.

69
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,550
<i>What is she doing?</i>

70
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:23,780
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

71
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,950
Morning, Madam. How was your sleep last night?

72
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,620
Come. Let me feed you the medicine, okay?

73
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,160
Come.

74
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,030
Wu Cai Hong!

75
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,120
What did you give my mom?

76
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,970
It's a folklore prescription.

77
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,750
Mrs Zhang was right.

78
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,010
Last night, you were secretly making some unclean items.

79
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,690
What did you give my mom?

80
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,540
This is medicine from leeches.

81
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,720
Mom.

82
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,830
Why did you let my mom drink this?

83
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,000
The doctor said that Madam is unconscious because there are blood clots in her brain.

84
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,330
- The leeches can clear blood clots and stasis. <br>-Nonsense.

85
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,240
You are not a doctor. How could you let my mom take this medicine randomly?

86
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,330
I spent a lot of effort to obtain this folklore medicine.

87
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,220
My mom was in the same condition and confined to a bed.

88
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,380
She had blood clots but after drinking this medicine, it helped her.

89
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,620
In any case, I won't allow my Mom to be placed in any danger.

90
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,060
If there are any mistakes, who's going to be responsible?

91
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,660
I think it's still not enough that I taught you a lesson the last time.

92
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,630
Mrs Zhang.

93
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,690
Take her out and punish her.

94
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,510
Come out now.

95
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,240
I'm going to beat you to death for retorting.

96
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,080
I will beat you to death for disobedience,

97
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,360
for not listening and being argumentative.

98
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,580
I will beat you to death.

99
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,170
Don't talk back. Don't talk back.

100
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,960
Enough.

101
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,480
Brother. She was only given a few beatings.

102
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,330
If you do this, she won't change.

103
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,050
If you beat her until she's injured, I will still need to call for the doctor.

104
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,510
I don't want to waste money this way.

105
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,510
The recipe (for the medine) is useful.

106
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,600
You must trust me.

107
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,730
How should I trust you?

108
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,610
Who was the one who pushed my mom down the stairs?

109
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,420
I'm warning you.

110
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,250
In the future, don't make any decisions on your own.

111
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,730
So be it.

112
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,610
Change your personality in the future.

113
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,550
<i>Brother Shao Tian. Are you doing well?</i>

114
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:05,060
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

115
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,720
- Waiter. <br>- Mr Zhou.

116
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,670
- Bring another bottle of wine. <br>- Mr Shao, you have already drank too much. Don't drink anymore.

117
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,080
Why don't I heat up the food for you?

118
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,710
I told you to bring me another bottle of wine.

119
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,110
Go now.

120
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,910
Don't drink anymore. I'm afraid you don't have the money for the wine.

121
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,450
I'm telling you, I have money.

122
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,730
What I have is money.

123
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,660
Being rich is a form of pain.

124
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,400
Bring the wine here.

125
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,680
You already drank enough. You can't drink anymore.

126
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,240
Take the wine away.

127
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,380
What I have is money.

128
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,640
Mr Zhou, you are drunk.

129
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,820
I have money.

130
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,040
I have money.

131
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,800
Go now.

132
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,740
Cai Hong.

133
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,730
Cai Hong.

134
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,020
Madam. When my mom was sick and laid in bed, I massaged her too.

135
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,880
Madam. Can you feel the massage I'm giving you?

136
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,810
If you can feel it, move your hands. Okay?

137
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,770
Or you can blink your eyes.

138
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,310
Looks like you can't hear what I'm saying.

139
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,530
Young Master and Miss miss you very much.

140
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,060
You are a good mother.

141
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,920
You must wake up soon. You shouldn't let them worry.

142
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,850
Isn't that so?

143
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,240
Okay, Madam. I will massage you.

144
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,820
Don't be fooled by her.

145
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,950
Mom's current condition

146
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,240
was caused by the Wu family.

147
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,950
What's this? He is drunk.

148
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,400
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

149
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,770
Mom.

150
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,040
You must pay for it.

151
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,050
Pay me. Are you crazy?

152
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,010
What are you doing, drunkard?

153
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,140
Cai Hong.

154
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,270
Cai Hong.

155
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,960
Don't leave.

156
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,130
Who are you? What are you doing?

157
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,340
Cai Hong, it's me.

158
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,610
♫<i> So long, I have waited for so long... </i>♫ <br>- You are not Cai Hong.

159
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,430

160
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,380
♫<i> Desperately, I was desperately struggling to find... </i>♫ <br>- You are not Cai Hong.

161
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:37,150
♫<i> Yet couldn't find the way to your heart. </i>♫

162
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:43,700
♫<i> Gently, I gently tried to inquire </i>♫

163
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:50,020
♫<i> but did not ask you whether I was your fated love. </i>♫

♫<i> In the end I did not get your heart. </i>♫

166
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,830
What's wrong?

167
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,470
What did you do to my mom?

168
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,890
I was just stimulating her acupuncture points.

169
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,080
She felt pain just now. Perhaps, she has already regained sensitivity.

170
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,980
Perhaps, she may wake up.

171
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,980
What exactly did you do to my mom?

172
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,230
My mom is laying in bed and can't talk now.

173
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,150
She wouldn't know what you have done to her.

174
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,830
Did you take revenge on my mom because we beat you?

175
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,900
I saw this today. What did you do to my mom when we didn't see anything?

176
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,360
I really didn't do anything. I only wanted Madam to wake up soon.

177
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,700
I don't believe you. I only believe what I see.

178
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,130
Mom.

179
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,440
Mom.

180
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,080
I think I had you beaten too lightly. That's why you didn't change your personality, right?

181
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,880
Mrs Zhang.

182
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,810
Drag her out and punish her.

183
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,360
Yes. Come out with me.

184
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,290
Kneel down.

185
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,780
Mrs Zhang. Beat her until she admits her fault.

186
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,380
Yes.

187
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,740
I didn't do anything wrong.

188
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,620
Still dare to argue?

189
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,970
I really have no intentions of harming her.

190
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,990
Nonsense. I don't believe you.

191
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,330
My mom is laying in bed and can't see

192
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,850
but I have eyes. I have been watching you.

193
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,220
I really didn't do anything wrong. I'm doing this for Madam's sake.

194
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,360
You are still not admitting your mistake?

195
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,830
Mr Zhang, continue with the beatings.

196
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,860
Beat her until she admits her mistake.

197
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,200
See if you still dare to argue again.

198
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,880
Open the door.

199
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,890
I want to see Cai Hong.

200
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,400
What are you doing?

201
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,480
- Where is Cai Hong? <br>- Who are you?

202
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,700
- Cai Hong is not here. <br>- Who's stopping me?

203
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,800
- You are a drunkard. <br>- Don't stop me.

204
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,770
- Get lost. <br> - I want to see Cai Hong.

205
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,210
You can't go in. Stop there.

206
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,340
Dare to argue again?

207
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,520
- Enough. <br>- Stop there.

208
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,550
- Cai Hong! <br>- Brother Shao Tian.

209
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,780
Let's beat her together.

210
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,790
Brother Shao Tian.

211
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,210
You dare to come here to create a ruckus?

212
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,450
Since before he was like this.

213
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,810
- Brother Shao Tian. <br>- Beat him to death.

214
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,530
Beat him.

215
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,500
I'm begging you, stop beating him.

216
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,240
Let me go. Brother Shao Tian.

217
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,890
It's all my fault.

218
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,980
Tell them to stop. Don't beat him anymore.

219
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,810
Brother Shao Tian.

220
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,140
Continue with the beatings.

221
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,140
I'm begging you.

222
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,320
Stop beating him.

223
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,980
Leave. You even dare to create a ruckus here?

224
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,950
Get out.

225
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,700
You really don't know what's good for you.

226
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:06,560
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

227
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,140
<br>

228
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,770
I previously made several requests but you rejected them all.

229
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,330
Why are you so free as to visit me today?

230
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,730
Unless you have already thought over my advice.

231
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,740
Miss Lu.

232
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,350
We are understanding people. Let's get to the point.

233
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,270
I will help to start the dye factory that you wanted to set up in Huzhou.

234
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,000
You've finally thought it through?

235
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,150
That's great! I, Lu Man, am also a frank person. Based on our previous arrangement,

236
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:03,030
if you give me the secret recipe, I will set up the factory. You will be the General Manager and have 30 percent of the shares.

237
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,900
I already told you repeatedly. I don't have the secret recipe.

238
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,010
Make it forty percent then.

239
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,710
Even if you give me the entire factory, I really don't have the secret recipe.

240
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,720
Mr Jiang. My time is very precious.

241
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,350
If you don't have the secret recipe, why are you here to see me?

242
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,090
We can change the methods and set up the factory together.

243
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:34,230
I will use my management and technical skills to manage the factory.

244
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,880
Mr Zhou. In this community,

245
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,980
there are many people with management and technical skills.

246
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,910
There are many people who want to work with me.

247
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,810
Why should I hire you?

248
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,240
It's because I have been with Wu Cai Hong for many years.

249
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,430
Ling Long is one of Huzhou's best dyeing factories.

250
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,840
This you should know. Ling Long's

251
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,130
capital, technology, and channel are all here.

252
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,040
I think you should know this.

253
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,170
No matter how great Old Wu is,

254
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,680
didn't he lose to the Jiang family too?

255
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,090
Weren't you forced out by the Jiang family too?

256
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,530
If I didn't guess wrongly,

257
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,850
Jiang Yu inflicted the bodily injuries on you, right?

258
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,760
If you have an escape route, you wouldn't be here looking for me.

259
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,800
Miss Lu.

260
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,370
You have dared to try each method.

261
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,320
Do you really think I'm not a match for Jiang Yu?

262
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,960
If you had the solution, you wouldn't be forced into this state now.

263
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,180
By the way, I seem to have forgotten.

264
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,070
I heard that your girlfriend

265
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,300
has already been sold into the Jiang family as a maid.

266
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,090
Since this is the case, let's change the methods.

267
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,560
We set up a factory together. I will provide the financial backing,

268
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,360
technical skills and experience too.

269
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,700
I will give you thirty percent of the shares. What do you think?

270
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,720
Mr Zhou, are you kidding?

271
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,550
- How could there be such a good deal on earth? <br>- The good deal is in front of you.

272
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:25,750
I have the money. I would like to borrow your name to start the factory.

273
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,340
Miss Lu. You are a smart person. You can probably catch my drift.

274
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:41,720
I get it now. You are thinking of borrowing my name to clear your reputation.

275
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,210
Isn't thirty percent of the shares too insincere?

276
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,260
I want forty percent.

277
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,600
As the saying goes "going bigger does not get you more."

278
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,020
Don't miss out on the offer of thirty percent shares.

279
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:04,270
If you don't take this opportunity, I'm afraid you won't be able to set up a factory here.

280
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,850
I won't ask where you got the money from

281
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,740
but you using this money to clear your name, there is no one else in Huzhou

282
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,310
who can do this except me.

283
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,860
Mr Zhou. You should know who my backer is.

284
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,230
In your condition now, who knows? You may be able to use him.

285
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,910
Fine.

286
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,120
Since you put it this way, make it forty percent then.

287
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,130
I will fund the set up of the factory and provide the technical and management skills. You will be the boss on the front.

288
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:42,120
I will be the General Manager and hold thirty percent of the shares.

289
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,180
How bold. I'm was still satisfied before

290
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,450
when Wu Hong Da shook things up.

291
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,160
How could he easily have lost to Jiang Yu?

292
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,270
The student surpassed the teacher,

293
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:05,630
mastering the tricks and mastering life.

294
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,760
He definitely chose a capable son-in-law.

295
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:18,000
Fine. Congratulations, Mr Zhou, for your comeback in the dye industry.

296
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,810
We have formed an alliance today. I also hope that

297
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,980
you will be able to get ahold of the secret formula.

298
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,430
If you can obtain the secret formula, Huzhou will be our kingdom.

299
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:39,070
I will remember what you said.

300
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:55,690
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

301
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,670
Granny Gu. Let me help you.

302
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:09,730
No need. Madam only likes the fish soup I cook for her.

303
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,140
I heard that you are Madam's nanny.

304
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,860
You are also Madam's trusted person.

305
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,000
Did you come into the Jiang's family with her?

306
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,660
What do you want?

307
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,260
I'm looking for a solution to help Madam to be conscious.

308
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,860
I heard that you pushed Madam down the stairs.

309
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,870
At that time, the situation was very chaotic.

310
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,770
I'm very apologetic about it too. I'm sorry.

311
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,250
You don't need to apologise to me. I can tell that you are feeling a very guilty conscious.

312
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,130
I heard that you used folklore prescriptions and massages too.

313
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,920
It has been hard on you.

314
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,770
I would also like to do my best

315
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,060
to redeem my past.

316
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,900
Granny Gu. Could you tell me

317
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,350
some stories about Madam?

318
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,860
There are many stories about Madam.

319
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,820
I don't know which stories would be of help to you.

320
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,010
Granny Gu. You can tell me any stories.

321
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,460
For example, what is Madam's happiest moment?

322
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,550
Or her favourite song?

323
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,030
You can tell me about these.

324
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:21,480
I think Madam's happiest moment is when she met Old Master.

325
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,990
Both of them loved each other very much and married later.

326
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:33,020
The happiest moment could be when they were together.

327
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,500
Even God was envious.

328
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,780
Old Master passed away at such a young age.

329
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,530
What a pity. Ever since,

330
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:51,330
Madam has never been happy again.

331
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,150
They were so much in love. There must be a special place.

332
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,460
For example, what was their lovers' keepsakes?

333
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,890
Lovers' keepsakes? I don't really know about this.

334
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:15,140
There was a song for it though. It's "Ten Glass Boats".

335
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,080
It's because at that time,

336
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,560
when Madam and her husband went on dates,

337
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,380
she would always sing this song.

338
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,880
When she was singing this song and smiling,

339
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,490
do you know how lovely she was?

340
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,460
In my lifetime,

341
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,700
that was the most beautiful that Madam looked.

342
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,170
Wu Cai Hong.

343
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,190
What right do have you to ask about my parents?

344
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,930
Granny Gu.

345
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,440
Did you forget what the prohibitions for the Jiang family are?

346
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,350
Young Master. Miss Cai Hong only wanted to...

347
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,460
What?

348
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,170
Listen carefully.

349
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,080
You gave me your word.

350
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,350
Don't let me find out that you are checking about my parents again.

351
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,440
Do you remember when I was young and joined the Ling Long Dye factory?

352
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,100
Yes.

353
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:28,500
I heard from them that Ling Long has a secret recipe.

354
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,300
Is there something like this?

355
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,300
The secret recipe was from Jiang Yu's family.

356
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,510
Jiang Yu?

357
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,680
Yes. He...

358
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,290
Shao Tian, what's wrong with you? Did you fight with him?

359
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,080
This doesn't concern you. Tell me about Ling Long first.

360
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,970
Tell me.

361
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,750
Tell me now.

362
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,650
Ling Long originally belonged to the Jiang family.

363
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,370
Later, Old Master Jiang,

364
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,340
that is Jiang Yu's father, committed a crime.

365
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,400
Ling Long then changed hands and became the Wu family's company.

366
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,310
I didn't think that it would fall into Jiang Yu's hands again.

367
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,990
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

368
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,750
Are you sure that Ling Long belongs to Old Master Jiang in the past?

369
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,970
Definitely. Jiang family's Young Master is Jiang Yu.

370
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,910
I met him when he played at the factory when he was young.

371
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:42,610
Shao Tian, it really does not matter.

372
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,770
So to say, Ling Long belonged to Jiang Yu in the first place.

373
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:50,590
Since it was the Jiang family, why did they change the name to Wu?

374
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,310
What exactly happened then?

375
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,560
Tell me.

376
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,830
It happened a long time in the past. Why are you bringing this up again?

377
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,880
You must tell me. It's extremely important.

378
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,990
Shao Tian.

379
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,780
I know that

380
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,300
you've taken to heart the things in the past and can't get over them.

381
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,750
Frankly, I find it hard to accept

382
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,990
but since this happened a long time ago, just let it be.

383
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,470
You are still young. You can move forward.

384
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:46,010
Let's not talk about this now. Stick to my questions. Do you know what the crime was that Old Master Jiang committed?

385
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:51,100
You just said that Ling Long belonged to the Jiang family and later became under the Wu family because of a crime he committed.

386
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,600
I remember Old Master Wu was a government officer then.

387
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,990
He was the one who first announced Old Master Jiang's crime.

388
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,560
At that time, the officials went to the factory to raid for opium.

389
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,390
I was at the scene.

390
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:20,060
I personally witnessed Old Master Jiang jump to his death.

391
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,940
The government said that he committed suicide.

392
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,590
So to say, Wu Hong Da forced Jiang Yu's father to die.

393
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,120
No wonder, every time when Jiang Yu sees Cai Hong,

394
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,060
there is a kind of hatred.

395
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,230
Old Master Jiang's crime was confirmed?

396
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:54,300
The government said that he was guilty. What would commoners like us know?

397
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,220
But Old Master Jiang treated his workers very well.

398
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,170
Our family received help and kindness from him too.

399
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,210
"The unjust are doomed for destruction."

400
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,390
Looks like God is still fair.

401
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,780
There is retribution.

402
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,720
Who are you talking about?

403
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,440
Let's not talk about this first. Tell me about the secret formula.

404
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:33,090
The secret formula is the Jiang family's inheritance. I heard from the ex-workers of the Jiang family that

405
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,070
for Empress Dowager's birthday,

406
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,760
the Jiang family used the secret formula for the textiles

407
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,490
dedicated to the Empress Dowager.

408
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:45,400
Where is the secret formula now?

409
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,940
I don't know.

410
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:54,300
After Old Master's factory went bankrupt, would it still be there?

411
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:13,490
♫<i> The first glass boat made a whistling sound. ♫</i>

412
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:19,310
♫<i>Two oars making a pilgrimage. </i>♫

413
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:24,040
♫<i>Headed to an ultra-long mountain every year. </i>♫

414
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:29,030
♫<i>The smell of incense burning in the ocean. </i>♫

415
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,990
Madam Jiang. Jiang Yu doesn't allow me to talk

416
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,820
but he didn't say that I couldn't sing.

417
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,780
I believe that they miss you very much and want you to wake up soon.

418
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,010
This song will bring back many beautiful memories of you and your husband.

419
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,620
Madam, wake up soon.

420
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:54,550
♫<i>The second post ship gathers as a pair</i>♫

421
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:59,380

♫<i>The waves bring the immortal White Empress</i>♫

428
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,020
Let's see how Brother will handle you.

429
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,840
Brother.

430
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,010
Brother.

431
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,730
Last night, I heard Wu Cai Hong singing "Ten Glass Boats" in mom's room

432
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:57,470
but when I walked there, she had already stopped.

433
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:01,910
Brother. Wu Cai Hong clearly knows that this is a prohibited song for Mom.

434
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:06,420
If she continues to sing, then she is purposely causing you pain.

435
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,470
Brother.

436
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:13,690
♫<i> The third glass boat arrived very fast. ♫</i>

437
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:18,990
♫<i>Two dragons swim in order</i>♫

438
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:24,440
What are you doing? You definitely know that you're singing a prohibited song.

439
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,580
You are singing in front of her. What are you scheming?

440
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,870
- I wanted to stimulate... <br>- Did you forget what I told you yesterday? You are doing this on purpose.

441
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,010
I...

442
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,800
- Madam. <br>- Mom.

443
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,500
- Mom. <br>- Did Madam hear me talking?

444
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,650
Young Master. Doctor Zhao is here.

445
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,950
Doctor Zhao. Check my mom now.

446
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,050
Doctor Zhao. What is my mom's condition?

447
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,480
Madam Jiang's recovery is not bad.

448
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,840
Her breathing, blood pressure and heartbeat are not bad now.

449
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,640
Furthermore, she has been laying down for a long time.

450
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,200
Her complexion is ruddy. She doesn't have an inflammation and her joints are fine.

451
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,220
It looks like she has been taken care of very well.

452
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,240
Why did my mom cry then?

453
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,540
Under what condition did she cry?

454
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,910
When she heard that song, it seemed like...

455
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:41,020
This is a great phenomenon for Madam.

456
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,840
It proves that she can sense what's going out. Perhaps, she will regain her consciousness soon.

457
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,490
If conditions allow, you must stimulate her more.

458
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:53,100
If the song helps, do it then.

459
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:57,250
I understand.

460
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,710
Doctor. I still have a question to consult you with. Let's talk in the living room.

461
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,800
Okay.

462
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,280
This is from Mr Zhou.

463
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,520
Thanks.

464
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,410
Doctor Zhao. I would like to consult you regarding folklore prescriptions.

465
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,110
Using leeches as medicines,

466
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:30,590
will this help my mom's illness?

467
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:35,290
I studied Western medicine but have also done some research on Oriental medicines.

468
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,210
I recall in Shen Nong's Herbal Classic, there was a written account.

469
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,430
It said that leeches can clear blood clots and stasis.

470
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,790
This medicine with regards to your mother's illness,

471
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,450
from a medicinal perspective, it can help your mother.

472
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,730
I understand.

473
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,870
And also, if my mother's acupuncture points were stimulated and she felt pain,

474
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,500
what's going on?

475
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,950
With regards to Madam Jiang's illness, stimulating the acupuncture points and massages

476
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:04,890
these will help her.

477
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,750
This is to prevent stiff joints, muscle atrophy

478
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,470
and to keep blood flowing.

479
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:15,550
If Madam Jiang can feel the pain,

480
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:19,080
this is a great phenomenon.

481
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,550
<i>Cai Hong. I know that you are not having a hard time at the Jiang's home.</i>

482
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:36,050
<i>This medicine can help fight infections. I will go to you soon to save you.</i>

483
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,020
<i>Your family and I are well.</i>

484
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,980
<i>The seven rainbow bracelet is not worth much money. This is my lover's keepsake.</i>

485
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,710
<i>Now that it's in Jiang Yu's hands,</i>

486
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,500
<i>I will think of a way to get it back.</i>

487
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:13,250
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

488
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,420
I have seen enough stupid people

489
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,500
but I have never seen someone as stupid as you.

490
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,480
Idiot.

491
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,550
- Come up. <br>-You realise now that leeches are beneficial?

492
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,920
- Let me do it. <br>- No need.

493
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,830
I'm a maid of the Jiang family. This should be done by me.

494
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:12,240
When I was young, I handled lobsters and prawns. I know how to do this. Let me do it.

495
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,090
This is not the same fish you are used to.

496
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,840
Thus, let me do it instead.

497
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,430
