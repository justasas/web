00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,530
Two little tigers. Two little tigers.

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,220
Ran so fast. Ran so fast.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,110
One doesn't have a mouth. One doesn't have ears.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,950
It's really strange.

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,700
It's really strange.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,120
Two little tigers. Two little tigers.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,400
Ran so fast. Ran so fast.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,680
Two little tigers. Two little tigers.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,080
Ran so fast. Ran so fast.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,500
One doesn't have a mouth. One doesn't have ears.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,040
It's really strange.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,120
Brother Shao Tian. Save me.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,060
Brother Shao Tian. I'm scared.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,710
Two little tigers. Two little tigers.

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,170
Ran so fast. Ran so fast.

18
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,940
One doesn't have a mouth. One doesn't have ears.

19
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,490
It's really strange.

20
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,510
Why did you do that to me?

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,990
You are asking me why?

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,410
What do you think this place is?

23
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,590
Is this the evidence that I killed your father?

24
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,840
You really hoped that I'm the killer of your father?

25
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,810
Jiang Yu. What are you doing?

26
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,450
Ask her. It's late. Ask her

27
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,450
why she is here.

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,560
Yes.
This doesn't concern you.

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,090
It's my fault.

30
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,370
You can't treat her like this.

31
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,210
Don't let me see you bully her again in the future.

32
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,970
If she dares to play tricks,

33
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,520
I will bully her every time I see her.

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,400
If you have the guts, take her away from here.

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,310
Brother Shao Tian.

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,260
I guarantee that

37
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,760
this mistake

38
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,250
will never happen again.

39
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,900
I heard it.

40
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,110
What were you doing most of the night?

41
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,070
Don't talk about this anymore. I wanted to find the evidence.

42
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,660
In the end, I was played by Jiang Yu.

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,300
Cai Hong. In the future, don't do something like this alone again.

44
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,860
You must tell me in advance.

45
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,340
I didn't want you to worry about me.

46
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,000
If you hide this from me, I will be even more worried.

47
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,490
Okay then.

48
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,110
I will confess to you. The next step in my plan

49
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,200
is to find Ling Long's ledger books.

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,410
When your father passed away, the police already checked all the documents.

51
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,000
Everything was disclosed.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,030
A few days ago, the police delivered the documents here.

53
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,910
But now Jiang Yu has them locked up.

54
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,770
Then, do you know where he kept the ledgers?

55
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,260
I don't know but I think

56
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,780
since the police has already investigated,

57
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,490
there should be no problems with the ledgers.

58
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,720
Even so, I still want to take a look at them

59
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,020
and see where the problem lies.

60
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,630
Fei Fei. The Ling Long's ledgers that the police delivered here,

61
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,170
where did you put them?

62
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,780
I let the workers move them to the storage room and lock them up.

63
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,480
Someone must have manipulated the Ling Long's ledgers.

64
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,000
The police couldn't detect anything.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,490
The world is not a perfect place.

66
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,250
Even if the person who manipulated the accounts did a clean job.

67
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,990
In this ledger,

68
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,990
it certainly contains hidden clues.

69
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,950
I don't believe that Old Cai

70
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,120
would dare to touch Wu Hong Da's money on his own.

71
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:59,030
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

72
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,490
You can't leave.

73
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,510
You are burning the ledger?

74
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,020
I didn't burn it.

75
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,060
Someone already burnt it before I came.

76
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,320
You are still trying to deny it? I personally witnessed it.

77
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,060
What did you see? Whether you believe it or not, I didn't do this.

78
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,380
Then why are you in the storage room so late?

79
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,570
If there isn't anything to hide in here

80
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,620
then why do have to burn it?

81
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,950
Have nothing to say anymore, right?

82
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,500
There are only four words to describe this.

83
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,900
Have a guilty conscious.

84
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,860
Okay.

85
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,520
Even if I burned these books, you can't find any proof.

86
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,430
I will find out the truth and get revenge for my father.

87
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,270
Cai Hong.

88
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,410
Where are you going?

89
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,630
Cai Hong, didn't you promise me last night

90
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,930
to not do things alone?

91
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,420
I just want to...

92
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,530
look at Ling Long's old ledgers.

93
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,620
I found it, but I was one step late.

94
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,780
Jiang Yu burned it. He thinks by doing this there would be no evidence.

95
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,420
But he's wrong. The ledgers are burned...

96
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,090
Is he still around?

97
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,090
Are you talking about Old Cai? The police has been looking for him.

98
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,220
I have commissioned a friend to find him.

99
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,760
I'm guessing, he already ran away.

100
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,120
He did business with the temple monks.

101
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,710
I remember Old Cai never missed work and worked many years.

102
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,320
Many workers should know him well.

103
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,640
Ask around about his address.

104
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,650
His hometown may hold more clues.

105
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,060
Cai Hong. I think that Jiang Yu burnt the ledger before you went there.

106
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,650
He is well aware of your actions and

107
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,790
he is watching your every move. He will make things difficult.

108
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,560
He won't do that. I know about the dangers you are talking about

109
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,720
but this is the only way I can investigate my father's death.

110
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,730
I won't give up.

111
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,960
Why are you suddenly taking time off?

112
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,420
Because I'm going to the countryside. My cousin...

113
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,700
She suddenly fell sick. Hence...

114
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,210
Enough.

115
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,410
I don't have the skills to know if you are lying or not.

116
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,380
Just go if you want to.

117
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,350
I will be back soon. Thank you.

118
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:23,260
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

119
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,500
Bookkeeper Cai lived in Xiaoshan.

120
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,920
I went to his home a few years ago.

121
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,630
Go with me on the trip.

122
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,720
Let's go now.

123
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,820
I'm afraid that I can't go today.

124
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,620
I'm taking my mom to the hospital. She is sick.

125
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,500
Why don't we go tomorrow?

126
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,040
Yes. It's important to take care of your mother.

127
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,350
Brother Shao Tian, go back to work first.

128
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,850
Okay then. I will take my mom to the hospital first.

129
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,740
Let's go tomorrow.

130
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,990
Who is there? Coming.

131
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Brother. What brings here here? Today must be a good day.

132
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,530
Come inside and take a seat.

133
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,510
I'm here to see you regarding an urgent matter. I would like to seek your help.

134
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,250
Why are you asking me this? Your business is my business.

135
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,630
Tell me what it is.

136
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,120
Brother.

137
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,550
Brother. Where are you going?

138
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,010
I'm going to settle some stuff.

139
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,170
- I will go with you then.
- No need.

140
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,930
I will be back soon. Don't worry.

141
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,800
Take good care of the factory.

142
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,480
Brother!

143
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,650
Where is he going?

144
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,310
Sir. I would like to ask you a question.

145
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,750
How far is Xiaoshan and what is the cost?

146
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,150
It's not near. It's a silver dollar.

147
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,500
A silver dollar? But I left home in a hurry and didn't bring that much money with me.

148
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,620
Could you charge half the price?

149
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,320
Leave then. Don't hamper my business.

150
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,880
Sir. I would like to inquire.

151
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,460
You don't have a silver dollar, right? I'm not going.

152
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,920
I will take you there for half the asking price.

153
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,640
You are going to take her there for half the asking price?

154
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,660
-I need to go to Xiaoshan.
-I'll go anywhere.

155
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,700
Rascal. What are you trying to do?

156
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,730
What do you mean? It's broad daylight and you don't want to do any business?

157
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,230
Are you serious? How do you run a serious business?

158
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,980
Half of the asking price is not even enough for a meal.

159
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,350
How can you even go out?

160
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,290
Mind your business. I'm happy to take her there.

161
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,710
It's none of your business.

162
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,620
Miss. Get in.

163
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,770
Cheap. Is his child sick?

164
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,330
Regardless, even if she is pretty...

165
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,810
Chances are he doesn't know where to turn.

166
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,100
Is this your first time doing this?

167
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,500
Who says so? I have been doing this for ten years.

168
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,580
Why can't you turn the horse around then?

169
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,850
I do know how to turn a horse. I'll try harder.

170
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,530
Giddy up. See? Aren't we moving?

171
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,880
Be careful.

172
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,740
Are you sure this is the way there?

173
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,480
Miss.

174
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,970
I may not be good at this but I know the way.

175
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,250
Let's just say, I don't need road signs.

176
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,340
How do I feel that we are going the wrong way?

177
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,370
Why don't you find someone to ask for directions?

178
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,200
Ask someone? Who should we ask?

179
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,250
How do I feel that we getting further?

180
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,620
We are not. We will get there soon.

181
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,300
But...

182
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,400
<i>This wench. She clearly took the wrong road.</i>

183
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,880
<i>Even when taking the wrong path, she doesn't look back. </i>

184
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,740
How long will it take for us to reach Old Cai's home?

185
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,100
We will be there soon. It's just ahead.

186
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,430
Ahead? This doesn't seem to be the way to Old Cai's home.

187
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,880
Who says so? Miss, look.

188
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,690
Look we need to just go a little south.

189
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,180
I'm certain it is there.

190
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,850
Isn't the Cai family's home just ahead?

191
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,240
There are not mountains in Xiaoshan.

192
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,490
Are you even a real driver?

193
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,490
It can't be.

194
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,030
It should be just ahead.

195
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,510
You are a dead man!

196
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,920
- Why are you hitting me?
- I'm going to beat you to death.

197
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,530
- Stop hitting.
- You rotten egg.

198
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,270
Stop hitting me. I'm not...

199
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,080
Liar! Bad guy!

200
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,830
Buddy. Did you just transport a young woman

201
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,630
to the Cai family's home?

202
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,730
- Where is she?
- How would I know?

203
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,230
She said I wasn't a real driver.

204
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,010
She even hit me. That wench.

205
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,510
The other drivers said I was crazy going to the countryside...

206
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,290
Where did she go then?

207
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,620
I don't know.

208
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,300
It seems to be over there.

209
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,800
Over there?

210
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,480
Thanks.

211
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,930
You... what are you doing here?

212
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,710
Does your cousin live here?

213
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,970
Is there a problem with your brain?

214
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,310
You clearly took the wrong road and you are still walking ahead.

215
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,180
Also you hired a driver that took you to a remote place.

216
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,530
Aren't you afraid that someone will sell you?

217
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,120
You came a long distance

218
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,030
just to scold me, right?

219
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,120
I have only one reason to scold you. It's because you are stupid.

220
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,340
You are the stupid one instead.

221
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,100
Where are you going?

222
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,810
Mind your own business.

223
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,830
There are many wolves nearby.

224
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,540
Can't you walk slower?

225
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,480
Miss. Based on your progress,

226
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,010
we will first be home next year.

227
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,870
If you haven't taken the wrong road, I would be home earlier.

228
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,580
Are you going to leave or not?

229
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,460
I'm not leaving.

230
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,840
Can't you see that I'm injured?

231
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,510
Come.

232
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,790
I don't need you to carry me. Put me down.

233
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,560
Put me down.

234
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,700
Put me down.

235
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,570
You are extremely noisy.

236
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,840
I don't need you to carry me.

237
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,190
Put me down.

238
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,820
Okay, sit here.

239
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,550
I'm going to find food. I will be back soon.

240
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,250
Be careful.

241
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,440
If your boyfriend knows that you are alone with me

242
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,720
and spent the night in this forest. What would he think?

243
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,060
I don't have a boyfriend.

244
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,070
Don't go too far.

245
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:42,140
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

246
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,150
Be careful.

247
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,050
This fruit has a sour taste.

248
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,140
They are all for you.

249
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,870
I don't feel like eating.

250
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,560
The fourth code of a secretary.

251
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,580
You can't defy the order from your boss.

252
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,200
Whether right or wrong, you must follow and not hesitate.

253
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,530
Finish them.

254
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,930
- Brother.
- Where is Cai Hong?

255
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,420
Didn't I tell you to take her for a ride and then send her back?

256
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,780
I did according to your instruction. I was about

257
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,190
to take her home but talking about this,

258
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,380
I tried to go back but she wouldn't let me say a word.

259
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,010
- She ran off.
- Ran off?

260
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,560
A rascal on a horseback came after her later.

261
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,520
How does that rascal looks like?

262
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,700
One look and one could tell that he's a rich man.

263
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,460
I wanted to wait for them to come back but I fell asleep.

264
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,970
- Where did they head off?
- Over there.

265
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,250
- Brother, I will go with you.
- No need. Stay here and sleep.

266
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,710
- Young Master!
- Brother!

267
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,970
- Young Master!
- Brother!

268
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,600
Young Master!

269
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,000
Young Master!

270
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,020
Young Master!

271
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,900
Young Master!

272
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,630
Young Master!

273
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,500
Young Master!

274
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,620
Young Master!

275
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,550
- Brother.
- Young Master!

276
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,890
Zhou Shao Tian. Stop there.

277
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,040
Where is Wu Cai Hong?

278
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,970
I'm looking for her too.

279
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,150
Our family's coachman has a horse to find them.

280
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,690
Tell me now. Where did they go?

281
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,460
I'm looking for her too.

282
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,240
I'm warning you. If anything were to happen to my brother,

283
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,890
I will never let Wu Cai Hong off.

284
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,170
If anything were to happen to Cai Hong,

285
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,890
do you think I would let Jiang Yu off?

286
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,030
Cai Hong will be lucky to still be alive.

287
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,660
You better stay far away from her.

288
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,670
Miss, there's somebody here.

289
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,810
Young Master!

290
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,970
Young Master!

291
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,150
Young Master!

292
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,360
Wake up.

293
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,490
Young Master.

294
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,260
- We finally found you.
- Brother, are you okay?

295
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,190
- I'm fine.
- Young Master, young master.

296
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,660
- Cai Hong.
- We found them, that's great.

297
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,950
This shirt...

298
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,410
It got dirty, wash it before you return it.

299
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,100
Your leg is injured, I'll carry you.

300
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,520
I'm fine, it's okay.

301
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,340
Are you really okay?

302
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,600
Follow them. Don't let them find out.

303
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,310
Let's go.

304
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,420
I don't think this is the right way.

305
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,250
But it shouldn't be that far from the Cai family's home.

306
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,290
Why don't we check ahead?

307
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,330
Cai Hong, you didn't get to rest last night

308
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,190
and you got injured. How about we go back first?

309
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,640
Let's go the Cai family's home another day.

310
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,630
My leg is fine.

311
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,950
I think I can still go on.

312
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,630
I don't want to wait anymore. I would like to find Old Cai as soon as possible.

313
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,650
That way we'll find out the truth.

314
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,150
Cai Hong, last night...

315
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,200
why were you with Jiang Yu?

316
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,400
I don't know why he appeared either.

317
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,040
Brother.

318
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,310
I looked for you all night long.

319
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:28,150
Don't you think you should let me know what happened?

320
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,700
I'm tired, let's talk next time.

321
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,000
With everything else, there has always been a reason behind it,

322
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,670
but this time...

323
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,710
Do you know why Wu Cai Hong

324
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,360
was out in the wilderness?

325
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,760
She went to look for Lao Cai.

326
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,740
If I didn't guess wrongly,

327
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,570
Wu Cai Hong and Zhou Shao Tian are already at the Cai family's home.

328
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,990
Didn't Lao Cai run away long ago?

329
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,490
She probably got some information from Lao Cai's family.

330
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,030
But sadly, they were still one step late.

331
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,720
Since they're already late...

332
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,370
why did you still need someone to follow them?

333
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,420
Lao Cai fleeing, what does

334
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,920
it have to do with us?

335
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,850
You went through great pains to help.

336
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,000
Are you trying to help her find the killer of her father?

337
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,780
I'm helping myself.

338
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,920
After acquiring Ling Long, not long after,

339
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,250
a fire hollowed out everything.

340
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,800
It left me no choice but to borrow <i>(money)</i> from the east.

341
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,630
Till now, even the ledger

342
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,300
has been burnt by others.

343
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,880
What do you think will happen next?

344
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,290
Come.

345
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,470
I originally thought we found some information.

346
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,850
But who knew we didn't even find anything.

347
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,600
It wasn't all for nothing.

348
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,330
We found a new lead

349
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,200
I believe, regardless of the bad luck we encountered.

350
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,550
His true colours will eventually be exposed.

351
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,880
I will definitely find out the truth.

352
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,460
Cai Hong, don't think too much right now.

353
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,690
You just need to rest right now.

354
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,670
Just leave Old Cai's matters to me.

355
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,760
I'll let you know first thing.

356
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,110
I caused you to worry this time.

357
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,330
You go home and rest too.

358
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,400
What's most important is you.

359
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,570
I'll get going then.

360
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,890
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

361
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,030
<i>There are certain things in this world,</i>

362
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,040
<i>it's best to let it</i>

363
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,000
<i>forever be a mystery. </i>

364
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,910
Sure enough, it wasn't as expected. Someone moved the signs

365
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,370
and caused Wu Cai Hong to take the wrong road.

366
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,150
Things are starting to become more clear.

367
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,710
We need to turn this around.

368
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,990
Help me to check the whereabouts of Old Cai's wife.

369
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,530
I understand, Young Master. Is there anything else?

370
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,480
How is Wu Cai Long's leg injury?

371
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,190
It seem like it's not a major injury.

372
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,750
Okay, go back to work.

373
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,470
What's wrong, Ah Li?

374
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,620
It's because that lady hit me.

375
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,020
The girl does not play around <i>(go easy)</i>

376
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,170
instead she took advantage and kept hitting me.

377
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,070
Ah Li, sorry. Blame me for this.

378
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,930
I asked for your help and you even got beaten up.

379
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,600
Take this.

380
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,540
Go and buy some medicines.

381
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,720
Brother. How could I accept your money?

382
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,960
I didn't even complete the task you assigned to me.

383
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,730
I even lost her.

384
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,180
I didn't help you at all. I can't accept this money.

385
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,070
You must accept this money. You helped me with the task.

386
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,900
Take this as the expenses for the medicines.

387
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,050
Take it.

388
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,440
I will accept this then.

389
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,830
In fact, regarding yesterday's matter, you could not rely on me.

390
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,140
I thought there would be time to get to know my brother's future wife.

391
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,710
She kept asking me questions along the way.

392
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,320
Don't be blinded by the fact that she looks like Lin Daiyu*, she's more like a dominatrix!
(*Lin Daiyu was a beautiful actress)

393
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,490
She used her shoes to hit my face.

394
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,600
Well... frankly...

395
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,580
when she isn't violent, she is a warm and beautiful person.

396
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,640
When she is violent, that is also like

397
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,900
the female hero, Mulan!

398
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,940
Could she be the one in your heart?

399
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,500
Really? I'm so stupid.

400
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,110
Why didn't you tell me she will be my sister-in-law?

401
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,670
When are you going to invite me to your wedding banquet?

402
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,640
It's still too early.

403
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,260
In Huzhou, my brother is such a great person.

404
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,240
You can't even find someone like that if you tried.

405
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,100
There are ladies in queue behind her. Why isn't she anxious?

406
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,270
I hope so too.

407
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,030
Oh right brother, yesterday I led the small white horse back,

408
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,490
how do you think I should give it back?

409
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,810
That horse isn't missed, it's yours now.

410
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,880
-Mine?
-Yours.

411
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,660
I guess it's like Robin Hood. I'll accept it.

412
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,840
Ah Li. I have something on. I'm leaving first. Take care.

413
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,310
- Then do you need anything else?
- Let's drink together sometime.

414
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,700
Invite me to your wedding banquet.

415
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,020
<i>If you didn't take the wrong road, I could have gone home earlier.</i>

416
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,970
<i>- Are you going to leave or not?
- I'm not leaving.</i>

417
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,980
<i>Can't you see that I'm injured?</i>

418
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,150
<i>I don't need you. Put me down.</i>

419
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,710
<i>Be careful.</i>

420
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,610
What's wrong?

421
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,510
What is with you and Wu Cai Hong?

422
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,970
What do you mean?

423
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,580
She is the daughter of your enemy. That night...

424
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,600
Do you know how worried I was over you?

425
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,830
If something were to happen to you,

426
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,710
what are mom and I going to do?

427
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:49,090
If you are worried about this, I have already explained what I need to.

428
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,260
I'm not just worried about this.

429
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,980
Brother. Did you forget about revenge for Dad?

430
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,420
I have never forgotten about it.

431
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,220
Kick Wu Cai Hong out of Ling Long tomorrow then.

432
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,350
Why?

433
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:10,370
Because she is Wu Da Hong's daughter. She is our enemy.

434
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,430
The devil is always dressed as an angel.

435
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,910
But you must not be lured in by the devil.

436
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,240
As she pulls you in,

437
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,640
you must not forget about Dad's death.

438
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,120
You must never forget the more than twenty years of sufferings that we went through.

439
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,680
You must not be touched by our enemy's daughter.

440
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,680
I have never forgotten about my Dad's death.

441
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,980
I won't let Cai Hong do this.

442
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,190
This is my intent.

443
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,670
Are you really going to be this way?

444
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,210
If not then?

445
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,570
Fine. I hope that you will keep your word.

446
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:36,010
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

447
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,890
Strange. Where did I leave it?

448
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,560
Mom.

449
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,280
- Madam.
- Mom.

450
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,110
Give it to me.

451
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,130
Let go.

452
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,170
Madam, what's wrong?

453
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,310
What's wrong?

454
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,300
Mom, don't scare me.

455
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,290
Everything's fine.

456
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,130
Blood!

457
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,880
Let's go to the hospital. Get the car ready.

458
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,130
Young Master, it's here.

459
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,340
Mom, what's wrong? What happened?

460
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,710
Wu Da Hong is back.

461
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,930
Wu Da Hong is back. He is going to harm our family.

462
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,450
Wu Da Hong is already dead.

463
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,820
He won't harm us.

464
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,940
- He's back.
- Don't be afraid.

465
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,830
He is already dead.

466
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,950
- Impossible.
- He won't harm us again.

467
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,920
He is already dead.

468
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,180
- Are you telling me the truth?
- Yes.

469
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,130
It's really true. Mom, Wu Da Hong is already dead.

470
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,020
We didn't want to tell you so you wouldn't be upset.

471
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,450
He is really dead.

472
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,980
It's true. Mom. No one will dare to bully us again.

473
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,970
Everything's fine.

474
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,610
Impossible, he is not dead.

475
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,980
He won't let go, even if he is dead.

476
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,540
HIs daughter will harm us.

477
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,530
Listen to me. It's already in the past.

478
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,920
Everything is already in the past.

479
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,560
Young Master.

480
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,310
Mom. Let's go to the hospital now.

481
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,120
Come, quick.

482
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,670
Quick.

483
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,160
He is not dead.

484
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,790
Why did you let my mother see this?

485
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,810
Take this away and burn it.

486
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,990
So many years, even with mom's illness, she has had good times.

487
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,230
But with you and the house,

488
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,100
it's causing too great a damage to mom.

489
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,460
Brother. Mom is old.

490
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,490
She really can not take much more.

491
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,090
This should end now.

492
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:18,580
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

493
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,040
It's time for you to leave.

494
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,820
Let me send you home, okay?

495
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,380
Come in.

496
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,730
Miss is here?

497
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,710
Young Master is not here?

498
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,600
He went out. If there is anything, you can tell me.

499
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,900
Previously, Young Master told me to check on the whereabouts of Old Cai's wife.

500
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,650
I found out where she lives. I'm here to report it to him.

501
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,290
Give me the address. I will pass it to him.

502
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,620
- Thank you, Miss.
- You can go back to work.

503
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,640
I'm leaving first.
