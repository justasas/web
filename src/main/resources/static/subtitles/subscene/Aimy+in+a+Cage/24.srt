<i>Mom.</i>

29
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,300
<i>Mom. Your dress is very pretty.</i>

30
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,100
<i>Your dress is just like the pretty flowers in the garden.</i>

31
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,100
<i>You are just as beautiful as the flowers.</i>

32
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,300
<i>Xiao Man. You are such a good girl.</i>

33
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,200
<i>In my heart, you are the prettiest flower.</i>

34
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,700
<i>You are the flower which I will use my life to protect.</i>

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,600

36
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
<i>and when I look like you,</i>

37
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,800
<i>give this dress to me, okay?</i>

38
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,600
<i>Fine. Since you like it,</i>

39
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,400
<i>I will leave the best for you.</i>

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,300
<i>You are the best. I love you the most.</i>

41
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,700
<i>I love you too.</i>

42
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,100
Mom.

43
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,200
I know that you are in pain.

44
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,600
Sorry.

45
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
I didn't

46
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,680
protect you.

47
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,000
I couldn't even tailor

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,200
your favourite dress.

49
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,300
But don't worry,

50
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,800
now that I have the secret formula,

51
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,900
I can tailor the same dress for you now.

52
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,400
I will be able to do it soon.

53
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,000
Miss.

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,800
Miss. Mr Zhou is here.

55
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,000
Please invite him to the guest lounge.

56
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,800
Mr Zhou.

57
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,400
I waited for you for a long time. You are finally here.

58
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,500
I'm afraid that you were not waiting for me.

59
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,000
You are waiting for this secret formula.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,100
Isn't it the same whether I'm waiting for you or the secret formula?

61
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,300
To add further, I'm not the only one who obtained the secret formula.

62
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,700
It's our combined efforts.

63
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,800
You are giving me the secret formula easily.

64
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,500
Shouldn't I be suspicious that you have tampered with it?

65
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,800
It's only just a secret formula.

66
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,660
Even though it will bring lots of money, to me,

67
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,800
it's not worth betraying you for this.

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,200
I have already helped Cai Hong find the killer.

69
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
As for you, you have gotten the secret formula.

70
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,570
Thus, there is already no value to it.

71
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,800
To add further, whether it's genuine or fake,

72
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,400
try it and you will know.

73
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,100
Yes. Under the eyes of ordinary people like us,

74
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,100
the secret formula is precious.

75
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,200
But in your heart,

76
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,400
Miss Cai is still more valuable.

77
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Of course, you look down on people like us.

78
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,500
You don't need to praise me.

79
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,800
You have already gotten the secret formula.

80
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Jiang Yu was arrested.

81
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,400
We are considered even.

82
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,800
Fine.

83
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Congratulations. You eventually got your wish.

84
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,600
Jiang Yu will be executed.

85
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,390
He is not set to be executed yet.

86
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,800
He is like Sharenchangming, right and proper. <br><i>He is a tricky/cruel.</i>

87
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,100
Jiang Yu is too sly and he thinks that the police are too stupid.

88
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,000
Thus, I only borrowed your hands

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,300
to push him.

90
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,200
Fine then. Let's not talk about this now.

91
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,700
Let's try the secret formula and see if it's genuine.

92
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,300
If it's genuine, what do you plan to do?

93
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,000
I used a lot of effort to obtain this secret formula.

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,200
Of course, I can't let it go to waste.

95
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,800
I am ready for mass production.

96
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,200
After going through this silk contest, I believe that

97
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,000
we could use this recipe to expand.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,600
I want Rong Da to become the nation's biggest dyeing factory.

99
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,300
Miss Lu, you have great ambition.

100
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,400
I still need your help.

101
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Let's go.

102
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,700
Miss Wu.

103
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,200
I... would like to visit Jiang Yu.

104
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,000
Please let me go in.

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,600
Of course Miss Wu. Please feel at ease here.

106
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,200
Open the door.

107
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,800
Thank you.

108
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,200
Detention room.

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

110
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,000
During the silk contest,

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,200
you used the secret formula.

112
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,200
This is a fact

113
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,400
but I still don't believe that

114
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,800
you killed my father.

115
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,900
Jiang Yu. I want to personally hear this from you.

116
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,000
You already obtained so much evidence.

117
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,900
Why don't you still believe that I killed your father?

118
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,100
I remember you said that

119
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,600
if you use evil methods to take revenge on evil people,

120
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,800
you will become like them.

121
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,200
You also said that in a dirty pond,

122
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,100
even clean and pure flowers will grow in it.

123
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,600
For the sake of revenge,

124
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,000
you turn yourself into a killer.

125
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,800
If you let yourself get to that state,

126
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,200
you will allow your family to be in pain too.

127
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,800
This is the most stupid method that only causes suffering.

128
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,400
Thus, you would never do this.

129
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,800
You are full of life. (resuscitation)

130
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,600
How could you still laugh?

131
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,000
- Did you harm my father or not? <br>- I didn't.

132
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,500
I didn't kill your father.

133
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,000
Even though I hated him, I didn't kill him.

134
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,600
Is there anything else?

135
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,800
If there isn't anything else, go back now.

136
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,100
I... would like to ask you...

137
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,000
My stepmom remembered that

138
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,200
when my father passed away,

139
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,800
he took the secret formula with him before he left the house.

140
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,000
But after the incident, the secret formula went missing.

141
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,800
How are do you explain why the secret formula is with you?

142
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,600
The secret formula that I had

143
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
was not your father's secret formula.

144
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,600
There are two sets of the same secret formulas.

145
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,400
What's going on?

146
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,800
That secret formula belongs to the Jiang family.

147
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
It was a family heritage

148
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,200
from generations to generations.

149
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,800
Thus, when I was young, I already memorised it

150
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,600
but I didn't know about the last step.

151
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,000
It's because the last step would have to wait for the successor to be eighteen years old

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,600
before it can be passed down to him.

153
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,200
But when my father passed away,

154
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,600
I wasn't eighteen years old then.

155
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,600
Sorry.

156
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,800
Even though it's too late

157
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,200
but on behalf of my father,

158
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,100
I would like to apologise to you.

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,200
The portion that Fei Fei gave to Zhou Shao Tian

160
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,400
was not the secret formula that was passed down to the Jiang family.

161
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,000
Furthermore, the one which I wrote on it later,

162
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,300
it lacked the last step for the secret formula.

163
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,200
So to say,

164
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,400
you didn't know the last step of the secret formula at all?

165
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,600
That's right.

166
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
Then, at the silk contest,

167
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,600
how did you use the missing last step of the secret formula to dye the cloth?

168
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,800
The last step involves

169
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,700
a method of straining.

170
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,000
Just add some water to my cloth and it will discolour.

171
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,700
Really?

172
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,000
If what you are saying is true,

173
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,160
will this prove that you are not guilty?

174
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,000
Try it and you will know.

175
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,800
<br>

176
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,800
- Ma Li. <br>- Miss Wu.

177
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,000
Why are you in such a rush? Are you looking for Brother Shao Tian?

178
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
- He is not here. <br>- I would like to ask you.

179
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,700
Do you still remember the two clothes from the silk contest?

180
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,200
Did you keep them?

181
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,300
Brother Shao Tian told me to keep them. They are in the drawer.

182
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,700
I would like to borrow them for a while. Can you get them for me?

183
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay, please wait.

184
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,800
Is this the one?

185
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,300
Miss!

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,800
It's really very beautiful.

187
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
It's gorgeous.

188
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,200
The dye is really magical.

189
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,100
Enough. Stop looking, go back to work.

190
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,400
Let's go.

191
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,200
Hurry up.

192
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,400
It's exactly the same.

193
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,600
It's really exactly the same.

194
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,400
Thank goodness.

195
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,200
My wish has finally come true.

196
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,000
Miss Lu, the cloth is not dry yet.

197
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,000
Just now, you said that you are familiar with this silk.

198
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,900
You even said that it's exactly the same.

199
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,500
I remember

200
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,600
I was not born as nothing. <i>idiom</i>

201
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,000
In the past, I could have been considered a rich person.

202
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,400
I would feel forced to show of all my nice things.

203
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,400
I finally understand now.

204
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,400
When I helped Cai Hong to buy her family mansion,

205
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,500
you were very supportive of it.

206
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,600
This piece of silk, to you, is just like what the Wu mansion meant to Cai Hong.

207
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,880
They hold your beautiful memories in them.

208
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200
I just remembered

209
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,200
it was also the most tender moment.

210
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,300
I can now understand why you desired the secret formula.

211
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,400
Sometimes, I really envy Cai Hong.

212
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,800
Because of her, you don't hesitate in the price

213
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,200
to help her keep her memories.

214
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
There is also this tender moment.

215
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,700
But I...

216
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,600
only feel pain now

217
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,020
and to want to snatch it.

218
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,700
Don't you already have it?

219
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,700
Zhou Shao Tian.

220
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,500
I have something to ask you.

221
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,900
Can you answer me truthfully?

222
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Speak.

223
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,400
Where am I lacking compared to Wu Cai Hong?

224
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,600
Why can't I meet a man

225
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,500
like you?

226
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,400
Someone who is willing to risk his life for my tender memories.

227
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,700
Don't you have the Military Governor?

228
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,500
In this rotten man's eyes,

229
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,400
I'm not a human being.

230
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,800
I'm just a part of his many women.

231
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,400
Someone to get rid of with as I age.

232
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,600
I wonder how I got through all these years.

233
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,200
In the past,

234
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,400
I was also from a noble family.

235
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,600
You could even say that I held a higher status than Wu Cai Hong.

236
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,400
But I had no choice.

237
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,500
I was forced.

238
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
When my parents died,

239
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I could only depend on myself

240
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,200
to slowly

241
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,100
become like who I am today.

242
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,200
Don't say that.

243
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,000
You also used your own capability

244
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,800
to get what you want?

245
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,200
Isn't that so?

246
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,900
Yes.

247
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,400
I have already gotten what I wanted.

248
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,600
I don't care about the others.

249
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,200
Mr Zhou.

250
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,400
Now that I have gotten the secret formula,

251
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,700
congratulations. You should congratulate me too.

252
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,200
Jiang Yu, that rascal, is very sly

253
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,700
but he can't escape this time.

254
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,700
What a beautiful piece of cloth.

255
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,200
Mr Zhou.

256
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,400
Let's try it one more time.

257
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,900
If there is no problem, let's start production in the factory.

258
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:33,910
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

259
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,800
Jiang Yu didn't lie to me. What he said was true.

260
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,700
What should we do in the future?

261
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,800
We need to feed our families. I have children and elders to take care of.

262
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Where do you plan to go? I will go with you.

263
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,800
Miss Fang is here.

264
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,400
Miss Fang is here.

265
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Miss Fang.

266
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,600
Miss Fang. What should we do? We need to survive.

267
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,500
There is something we need to tell you. We are preparing to resign.

268
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,300
- Resign? <br>- Yes.

269
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,200
You are doing fine. Why are you resigning?

270
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,600
We heard Mr. Jiang got pulled into a lawsuit.

271
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,200
This is not a small matter.

272
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,600
How long can I last here? Ling Long will fold soon.

273
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,400
That's right.

274
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,100
Miss Fang. We are commoners.

275
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,400
We need to take care of our children and elders.

276
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
We can only back out.

277
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Miss Fang, please don't blame us.

278
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,600
My apologies. Let's go.

279
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
Wait. Don't leave first.

280
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,600
Listen to me first.

281
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,000
My brother was framed. He didn't kill anyone.

282
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,600
He will be cleared and back soon.

283
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,400
Miss Fang, Mr Jiang has treated us very well.

284
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,600
We know that he is a good person

285
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,200
but being locked up by the law is not a game.

286
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,000
We already heard that many clients want to cancel their orders.

287
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,400
If no one works with us, we will lose our business.

288
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,300
What the point of us staying here?

289
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,840
That's right, Miss Fang.

290
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,400
We are saying our goodbyes to you based on our good relationship.

291
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Please take care of yourself.

292
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,800
Everyone, listen to me. Don't leave.

293
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,200
Wait. Listen to me. My brother was framed.

294
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,000
He really didn't kill anyone.

295
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,600
Listen to me. Don't leave.

296
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,000
Don't leave.

297
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,100
My brother was framed. He didn't kill anyone.

298
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,700
Come back.

299
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,200
My brother didn't kill anyone.

300
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,800
What should I do?

301
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,700
<i>Brother, it's all my fault.</i>

302
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,000
<i>I harmed you and Ling Long.</i>

303
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,200
<i>What should I do now</i>

304
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,900
<i>to protect the Ling Long that you worked so hard to reclaim?</i>

305
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,600
- Brother Shao Tian. <br>- What's wrong?

306
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,800
Brother Shao Tian. Jiang Yu is not my father's killer. He didn't kill my father.

307
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,200
Cai Hong, don't be anxious. Take your time to tell me.

308
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
Let me prove it to you.

309
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,100
What are you doing? What is she doing?

310
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,000
What's wrong?

311
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,700
- Is she crazy? <br>- That's right. What is Miss Wu doing?

312
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,000
Cai Hong. What are you trying to do?

313
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,200
I only want to prove to you...

314
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,600
What's going on?

315
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,500
What is this for?

316
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,600
I don't know what is going on.

317
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Why is the colour running? What's going on?

318
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,000
The colour in our cloths have never run.

319
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,800
Jiang Yi used his memories to write down the formula

320
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,800
but he didn't have the last step.

321
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,800
With Jiang Yi's final step,

322
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,400
the colour ran

323
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,800
because he didn't know the last step.

324
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,800
The complete secret formula is with my father.

325
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,200
So to say, Jiang Yu didn't get this secret formula.

326
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,600
He didn't kill my father either.

327
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,100
Fang Fei Fei gave me this secret formula

328
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,870
which was written by Jiang Yu himself?

329
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,800
- Yes.

330
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,400
Miss.

331
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,800
Jiang Yu said that he memorised the secret formula when he was young.

332
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,900
It's just that the last step was recorded in the last formula.

333
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,400
It will only to be passed down to him when he turned eighteen years old.

334
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,200
- The secret formula is missing one last step. <br>- Jiang Yu really doesn't have the secret formula?

335
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Jiang Yu didn't have the secret formula in the first place.

336
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,400
Where is the secret formula?

337
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,600
Brother Shao Tian. Let's find Director Chen

338
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,400
and tell him that Jiang Yu is innocent.

339
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,600
Cai Hong. Let the police investigate this first.

340
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,400
If Jiang Yu is really innocent, they will release him.

341
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,200
We don't need them to investigate. Since we already know the truth,

342
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,800
we just need to explain to them and let them release him first.

343
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,700
- But it's a bit complicated now. We don't know anything yet... <br>- I don't have time.

344
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm going to save him.

345
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,400
Cai Hong!

346
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Zhou Shao Tian!

347
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,200
We have more important task to do.

348
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,800
What do you think of this incident today?

349
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,000
Does Jiang Yu really not have the secret formula

350
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,080
or did he give us a fake secret formula?

351
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,700
What happened today was an accident.

352
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,200
Jiang Yu is very sly.

353
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,000
Let's not talk about this first.

354
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,400
The guard at Jiang Yu's cell is my informant.

355
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,500
He overheard Jiang Yu's conversation with Wu Cai Hong.

356
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,200
Jiang Yu merely told her that he didn't have the secret formula.

357
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,600
Cai Hong still went to see Jiang Yu.

358
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,100
Can't you set aside your feelings for that woman first?

359
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,800
Is this important now?

360
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,600
What's important to me now is to know whether Jiang Yu is telling the truth.

361
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,600
And whether he is holding the secret formula?

362
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,100
Wait a minute.

363
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,600
I'm looking for Director Chen.

364
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,200
Director Chen has gone out. He probably won't be back today.

365
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,000
But I need to see him for something very urgent.

366
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,600
Just wait and tell him tomorrow.

367
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,400
Jiang Yu has been framed. Could you release him?

368
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,800
Whether Jiang Yu has been framed or not, we will investigate it ourselves.

369
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,800
If everyone is like you came here to handle the case,

370
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,200
what would you need the police for?

371
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,900
But I'm telling the truth. He didn't kill my father.

372
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,600
Please release him.

373
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,400
Why are you creating a fuss here. This is the police station.

374
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,800
Go home now. If he is not guilty, we will definitely release him.

375
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,400
He was really framed.

376
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,200
Leave.

377
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
This is Miss Lu's instructions

378
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,300
but you must keep watch of security and don't make any mistakes.

379
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,300
Did you hear me?

380
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,000
Okay. Please tell Miss Lu not to worry. We will do as we are told.

381
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,700
Let's go.

382
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,900
What are you doing?

383
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,800
Are you really going to punish me?

384
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,800
Let me tell you.

385
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,200
Whatever we ask you now, you better tell us the truth

386
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,400
-otherwise you will feel the pain on your flesh.<br>-I do not know who gave you the right to hurt me,

387
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,800
Who put you up to this? Who wants to harm me?

388
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,400
It's useless for you to call for help now.

389
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,000
If you don't want to suffer, answer whatever we ask you.

390
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,500
Perhaps, we may even spare your life.

391
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,200
I already told you many times that I didn't kill Wu Hong Da.

392
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
We don't care about who killed Wu Hong Da.

393
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,800
We only want to find out where Wu Hong Da's secret formula is.

394
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,900
I don't know. I didn't take the secret formula.

395
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,500
It seems you are trying to play tough guy.

396
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,800
Speak!

397
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,800
Speak!

398
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,200
Where is the secret formula?

399
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Aren't you going to talk or not? If you don't, I will beat you to death.

400
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Let's see who will last longer.

401
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,400
Talk!

402
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,800
Father, I have wronged the Jiang family.

403
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,200
I have wronged you and mother.

404
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,200
You raised and treated me like your own daughter.

405
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,700
I caused brother to be jailed now.

406
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,300
I caused Ling Long to go bankrupt.

407
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,200
Brother said that he didn't blame me

408
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,800
but the more he tells me this,

409
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,900
I find it harder to accept in my heart.

410
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,400
Mom still doesn't know anything about this.

411
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,600
Someone needs to take care of the family

412
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,200
but

413
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,900
I don't know how to face this.

414
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,300
Father, tell me.

415
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,600
What should I do?

416
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,400
I'm giving you water to let you come to your senses

417
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,800
to think carefully over where you keep the secret formula.

418
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,600
Do you know who I am?

419
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,300
If you have the guts,

420
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,600
just beat me to death.

421
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,200
Only you and us know about this incident tonight.

422
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,600
If you die, we will just report tomorrow that you committed suicide.

423
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,800
You better think about yourself and don't worry about us.

424
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
Mr Jiang.

425
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,200
Heroes don't feel immediate loss. We don't want to kill you.

426
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,700
We only want the secret formula. I'm going to ask you one more time.

427
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,700
Where is the secret formula?

428
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,500
Since you are using so much energy to find out where the secret formula is,

429
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,900
you must definitely know about the grudges between the Wu and Jiang families.

430
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,100
Let me tell you this now.

431
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,200
When Wu Hong Da died that day, other than me,

432
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,600
Zhao Shao Tian and Old Cai met him too.

433
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,800
Thus, if the secret formula is not with me,

434
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,600
it's possible that it could be with Zhou Shao Tian or Old Cai.

435
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,200
Did you hear what he said?

436
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,700
You aren't looking in the right spot.

437
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
If there was really a secret formula,

438
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,000
why would I keep it secret? Jiang Yu is scheduled to be executed.

439
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,400
If this is the case, wouldn't I be a fool?

440
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,900
Since we do not know it, how can we judge?

441
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,200
I think I heard him say they were going to beat him with a bar.

442
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,700
He is only simply just saying it.

443
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,200
Fine, let's just watch.

444
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,800
Mr Jiang.

445
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,600
If you don't tell the truth, you will really lose your life.

446
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,400
The secret formula is really not with me.

447
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,800
It's useless even if you beat me to death.

448
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,000
Father.

449
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,100
I just realised that Jiang Yu is not the killer.

450
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,100
This is considered good news too. Right?

451
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,100
In any case, the grudges between our families can be resolved.

452
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,000
I have decided to find Director Chen tomorrow

453
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,800
to release Jiang Yu as soon as possible.

454
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,100
Our Wu family already owe the Jiang family a lot.

455
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,000
I misjudged them unjustly.

456
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,200
But father, don't worry.

457
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,090
I will definitely

458
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:35,000
find the person who harmed you as soon as possible.

459
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,700
You must help me.

460
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:55,100
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

461
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Miss Lu.

462
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,100
What are you waiting for? Do it!

463
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,000
Wait.

464
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's getting late. We should pack up now.

465
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,200
Jiang Yu has already been beaten into this state.

466
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,400
If he really has the secret formula, he would have spilled it out earlier.

467
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,800
If you continue to beat him, he will really lose his life.

468
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,500
What you want is the secret formula, not to kill him.

469
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,600
Miss Lu. You must not beat him to death.

470
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,200
Mr Jiang is also an influential person in the community.

471
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,400
Moreover, he has a very good relationship with Police Chief Ting.

472
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,000
Let him go or things will end badly.

473
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,400
Huzhou has already lost Wu Hong Da.

474
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,830
If Jiang Yu died without any known reasons,

475
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,400
I'm afraid the entire community won't be able to let it go.

476
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,500
Jiang Yu has been beaten into this condition and he's still not talking.

477
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,400
Could it be that the secret formula is really not with him?

478
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,600
I was skeptical before

479
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,560
but now I believe Jiang Yu.

480
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,600
Don't tell me that Jiang Yu really didn't kill Wu Hong Da?

481
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,100
But what we can be sure of is that the secret formula was with Wu Hong Da on the day of the incident.

482
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,000
He was definitely upstairs when he fell.

483
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,400
The secret formula must have been with him.

484
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,200
But it went missing.

485
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,100
Don't tell me that Jiang Yu didn't do it.

486
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,400
The day that Wu Hong Da died, he only saw three people.

487
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,900
Jiang Yu, Old Cai

488
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,200
and you.

489
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,600
I really didn't take the secret formula.

490
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,400
Looking at the other options, there is only one possibility.

491
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,700
The secret formula is with Old Cai.

492
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,900
I'm asking you now. Where is Old Cai?

493
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,500
How would I know where he is?

494
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,100
I say, Shao Tian. Stop pretending.

495
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:45,400
You and Old Cai first stole the money from Ling Long.

496
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,600
I helped you to launder the money.

497
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,000
You trick others but not me.

498
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,800
Since you have hidden Old Cai that well,

499
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
even Director Chen and Jiang Yu can't find him.

500
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,400
But if I want to call Old Cai out,

501
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,000
you only just need to tell me.

502
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,100
That won't work. Old Cai won't show up.

503
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,800
You don't want to find Old Cai?

504
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,100
But if you don't hand over Old Cai,

505
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,700
I may tell Wu Cai Hong that

506
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,600
you are the real owner of Rong Da.

507
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,400
The money that you used to established Rong Da was from Long Ling.

508
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,500
Are you threatening me?

509
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,600
When we first started to be friends, you should have already known that

510
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,700
a day like this would definitely come.

511
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,500
Thus, I will advise you to be smart.

512
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,180
You should also know that

513
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,600
I only care about the secret formula and not about Old Cai.

514
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,000
As long as you are willing to help me, Old Cai's recipe can be yours too.

515
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
We both get what we need,

516
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,700
I can give you a deadline.

517
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,900
Go in.

518
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,700
You asked for it.

519
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,600
Stop. What are you doing?

520
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,200
I'm here to see Jiang Yu. Please let me go in.

521
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,400
Who are you? Jiang Yu is our criminal. He is guilty of murder.

522
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,200
You can't just see him whenever you want.

523
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,300
But I went in yesterday.

524
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,400
That was because it was yesterday. You could enter because I wasn't on duty.

525
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,000
Let me tell you, I'm fair and transparent.

526
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,800
Jiang Yu is not a killer.

527
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,300
He was framed.

528
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,600
Nine out of ten people here were framed,

529
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,000
but the truth is that no one was framed.

530
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,400
Don't waste your time talking to me.

531
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Mr Policeman. Will this do?

532
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Please let me go in for a while.

533
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,000
If you had the money, just give it to me. Why waste my time?

534
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,400
Go in.

535
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,500
Jiang Yu! What's wrong with you?

536
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,400
What's wrong?

537
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,800
Don't you have any laws here? How could you beat him into this state?

538
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,000
Jiang Yu, wake up.

539
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,200
How could he have been injured like this? I'm going to report to my superior.

540
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,800
Go now!

541
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Jiang Yu.

542
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,000
How could you be beaten into this state?

543
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,500
It's my fault. I should have saved you yesterday.

544
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,400
I clearly knew that you were framed.

545
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,100
Jiang Yu. How do you feel now?

546
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,900
- I'm fine. <br>- You are still saying that you are fine?

547
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,600
You have been beaten up until you became in this condition

548
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,200
Why did the police beat you up?

549
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,000
- It wasn't them. <br>- Who then?

550
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,600
It's those people who wanted the secret formula.

551
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Brother Shao Tian?

552
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,200
Don't move. Jiang Yu.

553
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,400
Jiang Yu. What you told me yesterday,

554
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,200
I already did the test. You didn't lie to me.

555
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,600
I will definitely find a way to get you out of here.

556
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,900
I'm going to find Superintendent Li. Wait for me.

557
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,400
Okay, get this done.

558
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,200
Superintendent Li. Please save Jiang Yu.

559
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,100
Miss Wu.What's wrong with Jiang Yu?

560
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,000
Jiang Yu was tortured last night.

561
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,400
He has injuries all over his body now. Please save him.

562
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,400
What? I only locked Jiang Yu in the detention cell.

563
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,800
Who had the guts to torture him in my station?

564
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,200
Jiang Yu was framed. He really didn't have the secret formula.

565
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
He didn't use it at the silk contest.

566
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,600
Those people who tortured him wanted to force him to hand over the secret formula.

567
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,500
Enough, Miss Wu. Let's go to the detention cell to save him now. You can tell me about the rest on the way there.

568
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,800
Let's go.

569
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,400
- Police Chief. <br>- Chen Zhi Jie.

570
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,500
What's going on?

571
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,300
It was under my management. The guards on duty for last night went missing

572
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,200
but I will definitely catch them and bring them back.

573
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,260
Enough. Send men to protect Jiang Yu now.

574
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:39,200
Report to me later about the incident today.

575
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,600
Both of you, keep guard here.

576
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Director Chen.

577
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,200
- Director Chen. <br>- Miss Fang.

578
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,200
How is my brother?

579
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,400
Miss Fang. Don't panic.

580
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,400
Your brother's life is not in danger. The doctor is administrating medicine now.

581
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,000
Thank you.

582
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,820
Wu Cai Hong.

583
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,400
What wrong did the Jiang family do to you?

584
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,800
Why must you keep harming us?

585
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,400
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

586
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,060
Sorry.

587
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,000
What's the use of apologising?

588
