The Cage of Love

19
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,710
<i>Episode 31</i>

20
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:08,000
On one hand, she cannot accept such brutal facts,

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,270
on the other hand, she feels guilty about the victims.

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,490
This was her father's fault. What has it to do with Cai Hong?

23
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,570
The Cai Hong that Cai Hong thinks,

24
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,950
it shows she is mature and considerate young lady.

25
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,990
But this young lady cannot shoulder all this burden alone.

26
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,700
Yu Er. You must be good to her in the future.

27
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,960
I know.

28
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:30,360
I wanted to confess to Madam today

29
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,540
about your family grudge, but I couldn't.

30
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,910
You are already very brave.

31
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm really afraid that she won't forgive me.

32
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,880
Let it go.

33
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,460
<i>If you tell the truth, it will be chaos.</i>

34
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,120
<i>It is better not to reopen old wounds.</i>

35
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,060
<i>It is better to keep silent about the truth.</i>

36
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,120
Madam Jiang, let me serve you.

37
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,490
Cai Hong, just let the maids do this.

38
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,370
I already told Yu Er,

39
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,810
you went through so many hardships, you must be exhausted, mentally and physically .

40
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:36,030
Starting now, stay at our home and take a good break.

41
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,320
Madam, I have more things to do for you.

42
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,220
And maybe when I am occupied

43
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,030
I might think less about it.

44
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,780
Child. Don't keep the issues regarding your father in your heart.

45
00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:00,020
You are still young. If you keep such things in your heart, you will grow even more depressed.

46
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:10,320
When my husband passed away, I kept thinking

47
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,810
until I was sick.

48
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,950
There were many times when I wanted to join him.

49
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,080
I hated all those ignorant people.

50
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,850
Hated them with all my might.

51
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,770
That hatred couldn't be forgotten.

52
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,100
That's the most stupid thing on earth one could do.

53
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,890
I know.

54
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,180
But some things one just cannot let go.

55
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,440
There is a no way to forget them.

56
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,640
Child. I have experienced how you feel.

57
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,490
That's why, I want to advise you.

58
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,090
Don't act like me. Such life will only trap you into the same tragedy.

59
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,160
- Madam. <br>- What are you doing?

60
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,270
I do not want my life to be trapped inside the same tragedy.

61
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,350
So I want to atone for my father's sins.

62
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,690
Please teach me what I should do.

63
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,840
Child, I can understand your need for atoning for your father's sins.

64
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,660
But wouldn't it be better if we devise a good plan on how to do it first?

65
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,310
Come, get up now.

66
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,990
No, Madam. I need to beg you for forgiveness, beg you for mercy.

67
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,570
I'm willing to do anything for the Jiang family

68
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,930
to wash away my father's crimes.

69
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,210
Cai Hong. What are you talking about?

70
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,430
Madam. I...

71
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,860
My father is Wu Hong Da.

72
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,030
It was my father who wronged the Jiang family, you and Jiang Yu.

73
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,900
I'm willing to be your slave

74
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,620
as long as you are willing to forgive me.

75
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,210
What did you say?

76
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,700
Who was your father?

77
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,930
Get lost now!

78
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,740
You are Wu Hong Da's daughter. Get out now!

79
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,490
Wu Hong Da's daughter is here to harm us.

80
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,960
- Get lost? <br>- I'm sorry. It's all our fault.

81
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,160
- She is Wu Hong Da's daughter. <br>- Mom. What's wrong?

82
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,190
- Madam, I'm very sorry. <br>- She is here to harm us.

83
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,770
Men! Take Madam to the hospital now!

84
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,390
I'm not going to the hospital. I want to stay here to protect Fei Fei and Yu Er.

85
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,760
- With me here... <br>- I'm not going to the hospital.

86
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,830
- Are you happy now? <br>- Don't be like this, Mom.

87
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,110
Tell her to get lost!

88
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,690
Men. Drag Wu Cai Hong out now!

89
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,600
- Madam. <br>- Mom.

90
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,210
Madam, I'm sorry.

91
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:44,470
- Let's go. <br>- Jiang Yu. Please tell Madam that I never wanted to harm her.

92
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,570
Leave now. Take her away!

93
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:52,070
Madam. I'm very sorry.

94
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,240
- Wu Hong Da's daughter. <br>- Everything's fine, Mom.

95
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,140
Leave!

96
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,880
Please let me see Madam. I still have many things to tell her.

97
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,560
Just give up. Our Madam will never forgive you.

98
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,140
Miss already told us to tell you to stay far away from us.

99
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,080
Don't let the Jiang family see you again.

100
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,330
Don't shut the door.

101
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,440
Don't shut the door. Let me go in to see Madam Jiang.

102
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,020
Let me see Madam Jiang.

103
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,370
<i>I don't believe it would just end like this.</i>

104
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,120
<i>In this world,</i>

105
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,590
<i>as long as there is a cause, there will be an effect.</i>

106
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,560
<i>As long as there is an effect, there must be a cause too.</i>

107
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,040
<i>If there is a sin, there must be a way to eliminate it.</i>

108
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,530
Young Master.

109
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,390
- What's wrong? <br>- Young Master.

110
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,950
Miss Cai Hong is crying and refuses to leave. She keep kneeling and bowing at the main door and seeks Madam's forgiveness..

111
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,630
Persuade her to leave.

112
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,950
Yes.

113
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,380
- Mom. <br>- Is she okay?

114
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,180
I told you many times that

115
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,610
Madam Jiang must not suffer any trauma.

116
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,690
I gave her some sedatives. Her condition is stable now.

117
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,890
Let her rest and don't give her any more shocks.

118
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,780
- I know. <br>- I'm leaving.

119
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,540
Thanks.

120
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:13,230
Yu Er. Is Wu Cai Hong really Wu Hong Da's daughter?

121
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,390
Who allowed her to enter the Jiang's home?

122
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,260
Mom. I remember you telling me that

123
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:30,690
the criminal was Wu Hong Da and not Wu Cai Hong. We must not pin her father's mistakes

124
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,080
on her head.

125
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,620
Mom.

126
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,260
You...

127
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,120
You already knew that she was Wu Hong Da's daughter.

128
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,020
Yu Er. Did you forget how your father died?

129
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,680
Did you forget the crimes that were committed towards the Jiang family?

130
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,120
How could you let a wolf into the house?

131
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,450
Wu Cai Hong is a good girl.

132
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,290
She didn't come here with an ulterior motive.

133
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,060
She only wanted to obtain your forgiveness.

134
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,440
I will never forgive her.

135
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,130
- Mom. <br>- Cai Hong is innocent.

136
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,880
We can't continue our grudges into the next generation.

137
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,360
Mom. You are such a kind person. Why can't you forgive Wu Cai Hong?

138
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,290
There is no forgiveness for evil deeds.

139
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,940
What evil deed did she do?

140
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,160
She lost her parents and her family went bankrupt.

141
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,690
A well brought up lady came to work as a servant in our family

142
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,000
and suffered so many hardships and punishment. What was all that for?

143
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,770
It was so

144
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,020
we could forgive her.

145
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,750
Mom, I remember that

146
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,210
since childhood you always advised us to improve ourselves.

147
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,500
Wu Cai Hong came to redeem for her father's mistakes.

148
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,480
Is this wrong?

149
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,000
Brother. You are saying this

150
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,020
because you fell in love with Wu Cai Hong, right?

151
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,690
You fell in love with Wu Cai Hong?

152
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,980
You fell in love with Wu Hong Da's daughter?

153
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:25,680
When I didn't know that she was Wu Hong Da's daughter, I already fell in love with her.

154
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,570
When I found out later that

155
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,740
Wu Hong Da was her father,

156
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,500
I wanted to let go of this feeling...

157
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,990
but I couldn't do it.

158
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:49,280
- Mom. <br>- Dear, I have wronged you.

159
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,020
How could we have such an unfilial son?

160
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,880
- What a misfortune.<br>- Mother.

161
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,130
Is Wu Hong Da taking revenge on us again?

162
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,040
- Mom. <br>- Don't call me Mom.

163
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,440
Go to your father's tablet now and reflect on yourself.

164
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,490
Starting from now, if you still dare to bring Wu Cai Hong here,

165
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,090
I will die in front of you.

166
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,570
Miss Cai Hong. Do you need to do this?

167
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,110
Young Master and Miss will never let you in.

168
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,360
Please let me in to see Madam Jiang. I really have a lot of things to tell her.

169
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,400
Please leave. Madam fell ill because of you.

170
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,870
Young Master is now kneeling down in front of his father's table to do self reflection. If you still don't leave,

171
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,310
you will really cause the entireJiang family to be in an uproar.

172
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:05,280
But this doesn't concern Jiang Yu. If Madam wants to punish anyone, she should punish me. Please help me

173
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,530
and let me seek forgiveness from Madam.

174
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,560
Leave now.

175
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,090
Leave.

176
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,110
Young Master, sorry. Madam has instructed this.

177
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,990
Dad, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have made Mom sick.

178
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,900
Please forgive me.

179
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,070
Dad, I'm sorry. I'm here today to tell you that

180
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,940
starting tomorrow, I have decided

181
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,060
to face my feelings.

182
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,980
I will not be a coward anymore.

183
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:55,620
Cai Hong knows very clearly the problems that we will be facing.

184
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,100
She is using her courage to redeem the grudges between the two families.

185
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,750
As for me,

186
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,090
I have always been running away from this.

187
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,260
I did it to deny my feelings

188
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,020
and intentionally hurt her.

189
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,860
I can't keep doing this.

190
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,900
I know very well that she is Wu Hong Da's daughter but she is a very good lady.

191
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,030
Your son likes Cai Hong very much.

192
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,720
I really want to be with her forever.

193
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,950
Dad. I promise you that

194
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,200
I will do my utmost best

195
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,060
and wait with Cai Hong for mother's blessing.

196
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,110
Dad, I hope that you will give me your support.

197
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,460
Mom, I know that your appetite is not good.

198
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:31,290
I instructed the kitchen to cook porridge for you. Have some.

199
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,230
When I think about my disobedient son, my appetite vanishes.

200
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,610
Mom. Everything is Wu Cai Hong's fault.

201
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,570
It has nothing to do with brother.

202
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,450
Please don't punish brother anymore.

203
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,980
Okay?

204
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,970
Fei Fei. You don't understand.

205
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,970
This love is just wishful thinking.

206
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,360
I won't let him rebel.

207
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,950
Anyway, I will definitely never forgive her.

208
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,480
<i>Mom. Who says I don't understand?</i>

209
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,980
<i>But in this world, is there really such a wishful love?</i>

210
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,280
- Miss. <br>- What is it?

211
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,070
Everything has been prepared. When should we take action?

212
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,080
The police have been keeping watch on me.

213
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,050
The Military Governor is very concerned about his image. He's protecting me for the time being.

214
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,840
But I know that

215
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,930
he is already beginning to suspect me.

216
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,330
So many eyes are watching me.

217
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,200
It won't be easy to do it.

218
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,130
What should we do now?

219
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,000
No matter how bright the moon is, it will be still covered by darkness.

220
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,680
Let's take action tonight.

221
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,880
As long as I get ahold of the secret formula, I will never let them find me.

222
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,670
Yes. I will make the arrangement now.

223
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,210
Tell our men to watch Jiang's house. When the secret formula shows up again,

224
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,920
we must be the first ones to get it. Make sure that our tracks are covered.

225
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,130
I understand.

226
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:27,640
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by <br>Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

227
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,440
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

228
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,010
<i>Are you doing well at the Jiang's home?</i>

229
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,970
<i>Did Fang Fei Fei and Madam Jiang give you a hard time?</i>

230
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,700
<i>Cai Hong, I can't be with you</i>

231
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,570
<i>but you must live well.</i>

232
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,700
<i>If you cry or are in pain</i>

233
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,030
<i>let my heart suffer first.</i>

234
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,630
Fire!

235
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,040
Fire!

236
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,330
Fire! Wake up!

237
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:13,710
Fire! Help us!

238
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,130
Fire! Take her out now!

239
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,490
Let's go.

240
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,120
- Come here, quick.

241
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,500
Mom.

242
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,470
Open the door.

243
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,610
Open the door.

244
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,010
Come out. Everyone in there, come out now.

245
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,970
- Where is Madam? <br>- I don't know.

246
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,600
- Where is Madam? <br>- She seems to be in there.

247
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,930
Over there.

248
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,960
Is anyone in there?

249
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,990
Men!

250
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,980
Is anyone here?

251
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,710
Madam, don't be afraid. Let's go.

252
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,960
Run now!

253
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,930
Let's go.

254
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,020
Madam. Don't be afraid.

255
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,920
Madam, quick.

256
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,310
- Quick! <br>- Mom.

257
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,550
Madam, quick.

258
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,380
Mom.

259
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,910
Take her out now. Let's go.

260
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,910
Who isn't out here yet?

261
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,740
Where is Madam?

262
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,550
Mom, are you okay?

263
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:43,200
Where is Yu Er?

264
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,040
- Yu Er! <br>- Mom.

265
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,420
Yu Er!

266
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,390
Jiang Yu!

267
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,300
Young Master is out!

268
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,370
- Brother. <br>- Mom.<br>- Is everyone okay?

269
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,870
Yu Er. Cai Hong went in to find you. Didn't you see her?

270
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,220
- Cai Hong. <br>- Yu Er, it's too dangerous.

271
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,710
Fei Fei, take care of Mom.

272
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,910
Brother, don't go. It's dangerous.

273
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,020
Jiang Yu.

274
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,940
Cai Hong!

275
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,070
Cai Hong.

276
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,960
Cai Hong!

277
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,300
- Why isn't Young Master out yet? <br>- Did something happen to him?

278
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,190
What should we do? The fire is so big.

279
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,110
Young Master.

280
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,440
Young Master is out.

281
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,990
- Young Master. <br>- That's great. Young Master is finally out.

282
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,870
Yu Er, are you okay?

283
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,250
- Are you okay? <br>- I'm fine. Take Cai Hong to the hospital now.

284
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,030
Quick.

285
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,070
Cai Hong.

286
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,070
Cai Hong, wake up.

287
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,010
There are still many things I haven't told you.

288
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,860
Hurry up.

289
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,520
Cai Hong.

290
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,980
Hurry up!

291
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:44,680
<i>God, I don't know what your plans are</i>

292
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,600
<i>but I'm willing to use my life to pray to you.</i>

293
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,570
<i>Let Cai Hong be safe.</i>

294
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,470
<i>Give half of my life to her.</i>

295
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,940
<i>I want to grow old and die together with her.</i>

296
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,570
Brother.

297
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,520
Brother, are you okay?

298
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,090
Yu Er. How is Cai Hong?

299
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,960
She is still in there.

300
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,450
Mom, are you okay?

301
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,800
Let the doctor run tests on you now.

302
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,930
- Go now. <br>- Young Master, you should go too.

303
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,990
Don't worry about me now.

304
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,800
Take my mom there first. Go now.

305
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,940
Yu Er. Cai Hong will be fine, right?

306
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,170
Brother, don't worry too much.

307
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,930
Heaven helps good people. She will be fine.

308
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,040
Yes, I know.

309
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,720
Enough, take mom there now.

310
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,980
Go now.

311
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,270
Doctor, what is the situation?

312
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:07,310
Miss Wu's injuries are not serious. We have already applied medicine to her wounds,

313
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,950
- but... <br>- But what?

314
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:14,630
She inhaled a lot of smoke during the fire which caused asphyxia. She has not awakened yet.

315
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,090
We can't confirm if there is any damage to her brain.

316
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,320
What do you mean?

317
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,530
If there is no brain damage due to the lack of oxygen, she could wake up at any time,

318
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,890
but if she has brain damage,

319
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,890
perhaps, she may never regain consciousness.

320
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,750
Mr Jiang. Currently, this is only what we can do.

321
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:41,700
That's to leave it to God. What we can only do is to wait.

322
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,030
Please keep calm.

323
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,290
Cai Hong.

324
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,590
How is she?

325
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,010
Doctor said she has asphyxia and that she cannot wake up.

326
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,950
Cai Hong.

327
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,800
Cai Hong.

328
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,730
Wasn't she at your home?

329
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,040
How did this happen?

330
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,370
Cai Hong.

331
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,360
Sister. Wake up.

332
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,880
Talk to me, sister.

333
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,480
Cai Hong. Nothing must happen to you.

334
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,570
If anything were to happen to you, how am I to explain to your father?

335
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,160
Sister.

336
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,440
Jiang Yu. What's going on?

337
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,900
Didn't you say that your home was safe?

338
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,530
- Didn't you say that you wouldn't hurt her? <br>- I'm sorry.

339
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:10,680
Why is your entire family fine except her?

340
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,450
You bastard!

341
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,660
Brother Shao Tian, don't do this.

342
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,370
Tell me!

343
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,990
Are you dumb!

344
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,640
I'm warning you. If anything serious happens to her,

345
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,900
I will never let you off!

346
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,520
Enough!

347
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,630
Stop fighting!

348
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:33,520
Jiang Yu. What are you still doing here?

349
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,100
Get lost!

350
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,350
I'm warning you. If anything happens to Cai Hong,

351
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,480
I will never let the Jiang family have any peace!

352
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,660
Get lost!

353
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,690
She is still not conscious?

354
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,310
How could this happen?

355
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:45,530
They said she inhaled a lot of smoke and that her brain might has suffered from lack of oxygen.

356
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,740
Oh my god.

357
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,330
How could this happen?

358
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,580
Dear.

359
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,350
I really can't forgive Wu Hong Da

360
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:05,060
but Cai Hong is a good girl.

361
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,670
I pray that she will wake up soon.

362
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:16,640
Dear, help her from heaven.

363
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,320
Mom.

364
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,520
How many such containers did you find?

365
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,050
We already found four filled up with petrol.

366
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,120
It's very obvious that someone started the fire.

367
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,640
Furthermore, it was an inside job.

368
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,070
Call all the staff of the Jiang family. Don't miss a single one.

369
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,900
Yes.

370
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,490
- Where is the secret formula? <br>- Jiang Yu didn't take the secret formula at all.

371
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:13,510
I really didn't get the secret formula. Uncle Lai, please believe me. I really didn't get it.

372
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,120
- You really didn't? <br>- I really didn't. Please believe me.

373
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,730
You can search me.

374
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,340
It has been hard on you then.

375
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,930
I really didn't get it.

376
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,270
<i>- Get up now. <br>- Mom.</i>

377
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,000
<i>Stop there!</i>

378
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,040
<i>Stop there!</i>

379
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,100
<i>Mom.</i>

380
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:47,020
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

381
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,170
<i>Mom.</i>

382
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,910
<i>Mom.</i>

383
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,810
<i>Mom.</i>

384
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,400
<i>Mom.</i>

385
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,060
<i>Fu Ching.</i>

386
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,590
<i>Mom.</i>

387
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,360
<i>Fu Ching.</i>

388
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,970
<i>Take Xiao Ge with you now.</i>

389
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,160
<i>Come.</i>

390
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,780
<i>Mom.</i>

391
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,810
<i>Let's leave now.</i>

392
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,910
<i>Let's leave now.</i>

393
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,790
<i>Mom.</i>

394
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,370
<i>Let's leave now, Ge Ge.</i>

395
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,060
Don't!

396
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,940
Miss! Miss!

397
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,460
Enter.

398
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:25,940
Miss. Did you dream of Fu Ching again?

399
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,520
How is the Jiang family?

400
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,040
Wu Cai Hong was badly injured and hovers between life and death.

401
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,930
As for the rest, they are okay.

402
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,920
Looks like this time,

403
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,070
we have to add another murder to our list to get the recipe.

404
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,950
Jiang Yu will not escape so easily again.

405
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,770
Miss. You must find the secret formula.

406
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,840
You must start anew

407
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,990
and create our flag dress.

408
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,550
Find a way to find someone

409
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,410
to kidnap Madam Jiang.

410
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,430
I want to use Madam Jiang to threaten Jiang Yu.

411
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,000
Yes.

412
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,990
I already know what you did.

413
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,030
Why are you so foolish?

414
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:04,020
Risking your own life for a dead man's tablet.

415
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:11,040
Look at the state you are in now.

416
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,170
Cai Hong. Do you know that

417
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,760
when you let go of my hand

418
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,020
and wanted to go to the Jiang family as a servant,

419
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,990
I knew that Jiang Yu had a place in your heart.

420
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,680
But do know that

421
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,170
in my heart,

422
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,070
your life is more important than mine?

423
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,500
You must wake up.

424
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,080
You must get well.

425
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,180
You haven't eaten anything today.

426
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,810
I brought your favourite food. Have more of these.

427
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,620
I'm not hungry.

428
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,300
Brother, don't be like this.

429
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,450
Looking at how you are,

430
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:41,070
I find it very hard to accept it.

431
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,040
Tell me why Cai Hong hasn't still regained her consciousness.

432
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,380
Brother, don't worry too much about it.

433
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,150
Cai Hong is a good girl.

434
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,550
God will definitely take care of her.

435
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:04,020
She may wake up tomorrow.

436
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:10,100
Yes.

437
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,710
She will definitely wake up.

438
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,030
She definitely will.
