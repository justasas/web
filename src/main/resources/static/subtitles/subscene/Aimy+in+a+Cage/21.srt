<i>Episode 21</i>

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,350
If Wu Hong Da is dead,

21
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,980
the hidden place for the secret formula will be gone.

22
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,770
<i> In addiction to your workshop, as well as equipment,</i>

23
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,370
<i>is there something like...erm...</i>

24
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,890
<i>a secret formula?</i>

25
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,090
<i>That's right.</i>

26
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,450
<i>On the morning of Old Master's incident, I saw him take out a piece of paper from his safe and keep it with him.</i>

27
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,030
<i>I think it was that secret formula.</i>

28
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,340
<i>If I were Master Jiang, I would definitely find Wu Hong Da for the secret formula</i>

29
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,140
<i>but I'm afraid Wu Hong Da won't give it to him that easily.</i>

30
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,330
<i>Wu Hong Da is dead.</i>

31
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,760
<i>The secret formula may have been lost.</i>

32
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,980
Brother Shao Tian. I have decided to work at Rong Da.

33
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,880
But I want to find the secret formula too and the proof that Jiang Yu is the killer.

34
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,030
Just like what you said,

35
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,170
if Jiang Yu did it,

36
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,950
I will leave it to the police to take care of it.

37
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,680
But if it's not him,

38
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,740
I will sever all ties with him.

39
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,970
Fine.

40
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,760
I will definitely help you.

41
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,350
Headline!

42
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,600
Cao Kun was elected the fifth president of the Republic of China.

43
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,710
There will be an extravagant celebration showing off the best made silk fabrics.

44
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,940
Headline!

45
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,360
Headline!

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,760
Kiddo, give me one.

47
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,680
Here.

48
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,920
Mr. Zhang, on behalf of the president, we welcome you to our office.

49
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,080
Your first stop was at Ling Long. We are very grateful.

50
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,360
Now that the president has taken office,

51
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,160
he is in need of a lot of silk.

52
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,980
I heard that the silk at Huzhou is second to none.

53
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,830
Your Ling Long also has a hundred year old history in Huzhou.

54
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,780
Hence, I came here especially to visit you.

55
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,780
It's just that I didn't know there was a change of ownership.

56
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,380
The owner may have changed but the product is still superior.

57
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,990
Is that so?

58
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,960
Looking at how confident you are, I can be reassured.

59
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,000
But...

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,570
President Cao is not an ordinary person.

61
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:01,470
Don't worry. Our products are not ordinary products.

62
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,900
Mr Zhang. Let me show you around the factory.

63
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,400
Okay.

64
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:29,890
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

65
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,610
Hello, General Manager Zhou.

66
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,120
Cai Hong. Why are you making yourself suffer? I didn't let you come here to do such tasks.

67
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,100
I just knew you would be like this.

68
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,310
Give me some time.

69
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,850
I will get back everything for you here.

70
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,800
We will live happily just like in the past.

71
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,370
Previously I watched casually.

72
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,420
It was my father who created this palace <i>success</i>.

73
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,880
I did not know he would one day collapse.

74
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,600
But now, I can use my own hands

75
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,280
to work honestly.

76
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,800
This is also another kind of happiness.

77
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,340
It has been hard on you.

78
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,730
By the way,

79
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,230
since the President has come into office, he has come to Huzhou to buy silk.

80
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,650
Of course, everyone is talking about this.

81
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:46,020
I heard that he has gone to Ling Long. I was thinking, should't Rong Da compete with him?

82
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,070
Of course, we should.

83
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,720
Furthermore, I think this is the best opportunity for Jiang Yu to use his secret formula.

84
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,530
What has this to do with Mr Zhang?

85
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,340
- A silk contest. <br>- What?

86
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,980
Let's have a silk contest.

87
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,010
Silk contest?

88
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,690
For the presidential celebration let's hold a silk competition

89
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,390
to choose the best silk in Huzhou.

90
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,900
You and I know the implication of the silk contest.

91
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,360
The party who loses will have to withdraw from the dyeing industry in Huzhou.

92
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,690
We can use this as contest. As long as Jiang Yu is willing to take part,

93
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,570
he will have to use his secret formula.

94
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,330
As long as he uses the secret formula,

95
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,290
he won't be able to disassociate himself from my father's death.

96
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,710
But this is just my own views.

97
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,980
I can't let Rong Da take on such a big risk.

98
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,100
If we lose, we will have to withdraw from this industry in Huzhou.

99
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,050
My Rong Da is also your Rong Da. Miss Lu has given me free rein.

100
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:49,010
After all, Rong Da is exquisite and has potential. Ling Long will have to leave the community. It'll be one less rival.

101
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,600
I can tell that you are determined to get the proof of your father's killer.

102
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,280
I'm very happy that you are willing to trust me.

103
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,210
I would also like to help you find the evidence that I didn't misjudge Jiang Yu.

104
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,040
- But what if Rong Da loses... <br>- There are not buts.

105
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,850
Cai Hong. You should know very well how my skills are. I won't lose to Ling Long.

106
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,500
We can force the secret formula out from Jiang Yu.

107
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,930
Okay. Even if we bring up the silk contest,

108
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,960
Jiang Yu is such a sly person. He won't take the bait so easily.

109
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,590
Unless Miss Lu is willing to help us fully.

110
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,500
Let's go and see her now.

111
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,600
Silk contest?

112
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,950
This is a good idea.

113
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,110
I also wanted to know who is better. Rong Da or Ling Long.

114
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,930
But the risk is extremely high.

115
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,150
The loser will have to withdraw from the industry in Huzhou.

116
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,580
Even more so, I don't want to drag Rong Da down because of this.

117
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,380
This is not a problem. It's more important to find the killer of your father.

118
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,120
Don't worry. I will definitely help you with this.

119
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,960
To add further, don't you trust Mr Zhou?

120
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,230
Miss Lu, I would like to thank you first.

121
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,850
Don't thank me. I didn't really help you much.

122
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,620
By agreeing to the silk contest, you have already helped me a lot.

123
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,910
Brother Shao Tian. I will go back first and notify the reporters

124
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,020
and tell them to go to Ling Long.

125
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,120
Thank you for just now.

126
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,170
What is there to thank me for? Stop pretending to be clueless.

127
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,960
Rong Da is not my company, it's yours.

128
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,740
As for me, I'm only just acting along with you.

129
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,040
I'm thanking you for playing along with me.

130
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,780
Frankly, there is something I don't understand.

131
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,330
Tell me.

132
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,680
With your talent, you can work anywhere where people are considered top.

133
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,740
What is the secret charm of Miss Wu?

134
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,620
Unless you'd rather be King Zhou in a war drama saving your princess.

135
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,720
It's not that complicated. Cai Hong only wants to find out her father's killer.

136
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,030
I'm only doing my best to help her.

137
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,620
As long as I can fulfill her wish,

138
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,550
I will be satisfied.

139
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,920
<i>Zhou Shao Tian is clearly an amazing person.</i>

140
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,730
<i>Actually, he's a major fool.</i>

141
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,750
<i>As long as I use his weakness for Wu Cai Hong, I will be able to control him.</i>

142
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,950
<i>Yet would a woman want such a fool like him?</i>

143
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:59,390
<i>What a pity that not everyone is just Wu Cai Hong.</i>

144
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,000
Be careful.

145
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:18,070
You said you are a very shrewd woman, yet you seem to be envious of others.

146
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,320
My shrewdness was forced, so I have no choice but to be shrewd.

147
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,720
But if there is someone to rely on, which woman wouldn't want to be a princess

148
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,050
and be protected?

149
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,530
Not bad. Ling's Long's silk is beyond comparison.

150
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,960
With this, the President will be satisfied.

151
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,570
I think I don't need to visit the other companies.

152
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,230
Congratulations, Mr Jiang.

153
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,280
The people of the President will take an extreme fancy to your product. You have really good luck.

154
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,100
At the same time, it's also great advertisement for Ling Long.

155
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,020
What you said is extremely right.

156
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,960
I am also extremaly grateful to you, Mr Zhang, for giving us this opportunity.

157
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,150
Let's do this.

158
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:20,740
If you are not in a rush, why don't you stay a few more days in Huzhou and let me show you around.

159
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,020
Fine.

160
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,370
Welcome Mr Zhang to Huzhou.

161
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,830
Mr Zhang, please look over here.

162
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,520
I heard that President Hang came to our area to buy silk,

163
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,810
but you only visited Ling Long.

164
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,420
It seems like there is only one dyeing factory in Huzhou and that is Ling Long.

165
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,110
I say, Governor Liu,

166
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:49,980
by making this arrangement, you are making the other dyeing factory envious and not be of service.

167
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,190
It's like this. I brought Mr Zhang to Ling Long dyeing factory

168
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,900
because Ling Long is our long standing dyeing factory.

169
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,000
I didn't intentionally want to be biased.

170
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,300
How may I address you?

171
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Let me do the introductions. This is Miss Lu Man, the boss of Rong Da.

172
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,570
She is also a good friend of the Military Governor.

173
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,530
Miss Lu.

174
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,360
Nice to meet you.

175
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,050
Let me do the introductions too.

176
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:26,430
She is the daughter of Huzhou's biggest dyeing factory, Boss Wu Hong Da,

177
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,770
Wu Cai Hong.

178
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:34,740
So this is Miss Wu. I still remember your father was very famous in the capital.

179
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,960
It's such a pity.

180
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,110
Miss Wu. Shouldn't you be working at Ling Long?

181
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,190
I'm working with Miss Lu now.

182
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,020
Rong Da?

183
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:51,230
Yes. Zhou Shao Tian is our General Manager at Rong Da. He was also my father's most capable man.

184
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,230
Moreover, our goods are very cheap.

185
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,140
Mr Zhang. Why didn't you consider us too?

186
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,060
What are you trying to do? You even come here to steal our business.

187
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,420
Isn't this too much?

188
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,900
Fei Fei.

189
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:14,720
Dear reporter friends, Mr Zhang's came to buy the finest silk in our area.

190
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,090
It's a blessing to Huzhou.

191
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,960
Our company also wants to participate in this event.

192
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,590
Is there anything wrong in this?

193
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,590
<i>There is nothing wrong.</i>

194
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,650
Mr Zhang, since you have come here to buy the finest silk,

195
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,940
the procurement of goods should be preferential.

196
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,350
Don't you think I'm right?

197
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,060
It's logical.

198
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,870
Ling Long is the biggest dyeing factory in Huzhou and it has also been established for a hundred years.

199
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:54,150
Our Rong Da might be just a beginner, but I do not want to lose such a good opportunity to offer the President our goods as well.

200
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,970
Thus, I would like to invite the reporters to be our witness.

201
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:03,170
We want to compete openly and fairly with Ling Long.

202
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,220
Compete opening and fairly with Ling Long?

203
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,940
What should we compete in?

204
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,040
Silk contest.

205
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,780
The seniors in Huzhou know that any dyeing factory

206
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,730
can compete with each other.

207
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,750
The losing party will lose the business

208
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,930
and withdraw from the industry.

209
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,880
But I wonder if the other party is willing.

210
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,920
Do you really want to use this method?

211
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,770
If we don't use this method, how would we know

212
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,310
how could we know who has the best silk in Huzhou?

213
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,420
Fine. In front of all the reporters now,

214
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,420
I challenge Ling Long to a contest. If Rong Da loses,

215
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,060
we will withdraw forever from the Huzhou dyeing industry.

216
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,810
Mr Jiang. Do you dare to accept our challenge?

217
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,420
Miss Lu is a true heroine.

218
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,170
Ling Long will accept the challenge.

219
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:37,310
Okay. If Ling Long wouldn't show this courage,

220
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:41,960
how could it maintain its old name and fame, huh?

221
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,560
<i>Silk contest? I have heard of it but have never seen it.</i>

222
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,980
- Are you okay? <br><i>- We have never seen or heard of this.</i>

223
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,390
<i>This is something we haven't seen for a long time.</i>

224
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:05,940
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

225
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Brother. Wu Cai Hong has gone overboard.

226
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,960
She chose to go against us.

227
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,490
Brother. Why did you accept Rong Da's challenge for a silk contest that easily?

228
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,330
They definately have bad intentions.

229
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,060
I know.

230
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,050
They are using this to go against Ling Long.

231
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,430
Lu Man is an outsider. How could she possibly know about the silk contest?

232
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,320
Wu Cai Hong must be behind this.

233
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,370
And that Zhou Shao Tian, what the devil is he up to?

234
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:45,630
He even got the reporters there to stir the fire and gave us no chance to back out.

235
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,030
Enough. I already know this.

236
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,460
Are you okay?

237
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,150
What could happen to me?

238
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,690
Brother. You are not cold towards Wu Cai Hong.

239
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,020
She is going against you by doing this. I'm afraid that you won't come to your senses and would feel hurt.

240
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,880
Why would I think of that?

241
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,740
Ever since her father caused the death of my father,

242
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,030
we have both decided to be mere acquaintances.

243
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,900
It's good that you think this way.

244
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,440
Brother. You must win the silk contest.

245
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,520
Miss Lu said that if you lose, you will withdraw from Huzhou.

246
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,490
She is just an outsider. If she loses, she loses

247
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,010
and can just leave but we can't lose.

248
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,930
The brand of Ling Long is due to father's blood, sweat and tears.

249
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,270
I have my own solution.

250
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,890
Enough, go back to work.

251
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,760
I would like to be alone.

252
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,780
Okay, I'm going out first.

253
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,070
<i>Jiang Yu. Why did you do this?</i>

254
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,330
<i>Why did you do this?</i>

255
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,940
<i>Why did you kill my father?</i>

256
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,600
<i>Why? It's fine if you take revenge on me</i>

257
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,350
<i>but why did you do that?</i>

258
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,170
<i>I hate you. Return my father to me.</i>

259
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,240
<i>Return my father to me.</i>

260
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,890
<i>Jiang Yu, I hate you!</i>

261
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,280
Miss Lu is great.

262
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,450
You forced Jiang Yu into a corner

263
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,420
and obediently agreed to accept our silk contest.

264
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,470
I have already set the stage for you.

265
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,990
How we force him to use his secret formula will depend on you.

266
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,960
I have only one motive. Get the secret formula for me.

267
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,670
I will do my best.

268
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,330
I never imagined that Wu Cai Hong could think of such a cruel tactic

269
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,870
to let him take out the secret formula and leave the industry.

270
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,950
Beautiful.

271
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,320
But our security pledge is too big.

272
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,880
We have pledged everything.

273
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,860
Do I help you with this before the contest?

274
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,360
Thanks.

275
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,790
I was fifteen years old when I joined Ling Long. Just like then, I followed my teachers

276
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:48,080
and learned how to dye. If I didn't even have confidence in this,

277
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,230
Wu Hong Da wouldn't have kept me by his side as his right hand man.

278
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,320
Don't worry. I will use the fairest methods

279
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,870
to force Jiang Yu to take out his secret formula and lose badly.

280
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,240
Fine. Even though I didn't personally fund Rong Da

281
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,760
but since I have shares in it, even if we can't get the secret formula, we can't lose.

282
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,880
If we won't be able to quadruple our profit,

283
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,590
my own name will be on stake.

284
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,060
Don't you live up to the trust I have in you?

285
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,600
But of course.

286
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,760
<i>It can't be that your father shouldn't die?</i>

287
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,760
<i>He did so many unethical things.</i>

288
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,060
<i>Even death is too good for such person.</i>

289
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,740
What do you want now?

290
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,900
I know that you don't want to see me here.

291
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,760
I didn't want to come here either.

292
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,770
I only wanted to tell you to come to discuss the rules for the contest at Drunken Fairy restaurant tomorrow.

293
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,010
There are so many people at Rong Da. Why did they send you instead?

294
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,220
I already said what I needed to say.

295
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,310
You forced Ling Long and Rong Da into a situation which we both can't back out from.

296
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,990
Do you think I don't know what you are trying to do?

297
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,910
I'm going to kick you out of Huzhou.

298
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:18,320
Twelve years ago, your father kicked us out of Huzhou.

299
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,030
This time,

300
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,430
don't even dream about it.

301
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,360
Brother Shao Tian. I would like discuss the rules for the contest with Ling Ling tomorrow.

302
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,840
What's wrong, Cai Hong? Did something happen?

303
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,840
Why do you look so bad today?

304
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,920
It's nothing.

305
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,750
I only just want to find my father's killer as soon as possible.

306
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,320
Don't worry. I will do the preparations immediately.

307
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,890
Headline. Rong Da competes with Ling Long.

308
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,500
- Headline. <br>- Give me one.

309
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,330
Headline. Rong Da competes with Ling Long.

310
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,450
Wait.

311
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,630
You want a newspaper too?

312
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,060
Give me one too.

313
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,350
Here.

314
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,840
I can't read. Could you read it to me?

315
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,320
Look. Ling Long is going to compete with Rong Da in a silk contest.

316
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,250
The rule is that the loser will withdraw from the dyeing industry.

317
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,910
Madam. Go back and read it slowly.

318
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,730
Headline!

319
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,910
Everyone is talking in the street that you and Ling Long are having a silk contest. What is going on?

320
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,810
This doesn't seem to concern you.

321
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,310
Miss Wu is already back.

322
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,690
Why do you still want to pressure Jiang Yu

323
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,960
especially when the Jiang family was our saviour?

324
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,760
Old Master Jiang helped us. It was his business.

325
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,950
Jiang Yu stepped over our heads everywhere. I was even framed for murder.

326
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,020
I need to prove my innocence.

327
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,090
I know that you are innocent. You don't need to prove anything.

328
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,670
I'm doing this to prove my innocence to Cai Hong.

329
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,820
Mom, take your medicine.

330
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,640
Why haven't I seen Cai Hong for the past few days?

331
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,400
Where did she go?

332
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,110
Did something happen to her family?

333
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,080
She and her friend started a factory recently.

334
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,210
Now that she has money, I sold her contract.

335
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,380
So to say, she's going to marry someone?

336
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,830
She won't be back anymore?

337
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,890
She won't be back again.

338
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,350
Cai Hong, seriously.

339
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:21,410
She left without telling me first.

340
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,820
It's such a pity.

341
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,830
Frankly, I have an affinity to her.

342
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,280
If you don't find it funny,

343
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,020
I wanted to marry her off to you.

344
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,220
Everyone must have already heard.

345
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,880
The silk contest is in three days.

346
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,330
This is an opportunity.

347
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:56,360
We must use our best flowers to create the best silk

348
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,520
We must show off Rong Da's great product.

349
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:08,130
But don't worry. We will redouble your wages for your hard work.

350
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,810
All right?

351
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,370
The dyes are here.

352
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,070
Your hands are stained.

353
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,980
I'm going to wash them now.

354
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,670
Pull it up.

355
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,890
So beautiful.

356
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,590
That's great.

357
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,710
So beautiful.

358
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,930
Brother, are you tired? Let me wipe off your sweat.

359
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,520
No need.

360
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,170
Hold this properly.

361
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,730
- How could you suddenly change? <br>- My bet is on Rong Da.

362
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,160
- Rong Da! <br>- Ling Long!

363
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,520
My bet is on Ling Long.

364
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,020
Come.

365
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,590
It's a rare sight.

366
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,700
Okay, thanks.

367
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,030
It has been a long time since we saw such a major silk contest.

368
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:27,310
So many people! Were it not for the President wanting to buy silk, we would not have such treat.

369
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,400
Hurry up.

370
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,350
Let me through.

371
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,040
The bet is not small. Rong Da.

372
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:40,060
I want to bet on Rong Da. Rong Da looks good. Although I have not won at the auction before,

373
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,650
I won't be wrong this time.

374
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,320
Come. Do you have any money?

375
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,340
My bet is for ten dollars.

376
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,080
I'm betting on this. Thanks.

377
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,820
Bet on Rong Da.

378
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,780
Second Miss. Madam Wu.

379
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,360
Madam Wu.

380
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,050
You also...

381
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,290
Madam Wu. You look extremely good today.

382
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:06,510
Is that so? How about Shao Tian today?

383
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,750
He is also extremely good.

384
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,530
That's great too. I bet with quite a big sum.

385
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,790
Mom. Do you only know about money

386
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,880
and others?

387
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,870
Second Miss is right.

388
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,480
What did you say? My daughter and I are talking. How dare you butt in?

389
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,270
Tell me where to go now.

390
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,310
When you go through the door, it's on the right...

391
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,570
What did you say? How could we hear you if you cover your mouth?

392
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,920
Where is it?

393
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,090
Once you enter the door, keep walking to the right

394
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:38,380
and you will see the stage. Next to it is Rong Da's seat.

395
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,070
You can just sit over there.

396
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,070
Where is it? Take us there.

397
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:46,120
I can't do that. I'm waiting for Miss Lu Man. She will be here soon.

398
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,140
Okay, let's go then.

399
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,470
Madam Wu, take care.

400
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,530
Brother Ma Li, see you later.

401
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,010
Brother Ma Li?

402
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,730
See you later.

403
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,490
What are you looking at? Where are the entrance tickets?

404
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,450
Why were you smiling at that idiot?

405
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,340
- I find him interesting. <br>- He is an idiot.

406
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,760
- He is not. <br>- He keeps looking at you.

407
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,940
He must have bad thoughts in his mind. I have seen enough of such men.

408
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,400
- Understand? <br>- Ma Li is not that kind of person.

409
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,160
Have you seen many people?

410
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,540
Because of you I had to walk even further.

411
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,620
Which side is it?

412
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,250
We came in from that way.

413
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,920
Where did we exactly come in from?

414
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,690
Ma Li seems to have said that it's on the right.

415
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,590
- Seriously, you. <br>- I'm right.

416
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,080
You can't even tell the difference from left and right.

417
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,730
You dragged me to the wrong place. If I didn't call you, you would have brought me to the wrong place.

418
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,320
Isn't it over there?

419
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,480
You were the one who dragged me along.

420
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,150
It's clearly you who were the one who dragged me instead.

421
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,420
Enough, let's sit over there.

422
00:31:49,440 --> 00:32:01,930
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

423
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,370
You two. Are there any problems with cloth appliances?

424
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,440
- No problem. <br>- No problem.

425
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,160
Fine. Since this is the case, please take a rest in the rooms next door first.

426
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,140
We will call you out later.

427
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,570
It's such a big event. Did they need to do this?

428
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,180
Did you buy it?

429
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,530
- Yes. <br>- Show it to me.

430
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,660
- It's $50 on Ling Long. <br> - Okay, leave.

431
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,210
Governor.

432
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,970
You bought it too?

433
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,660
Yes. So what if I bought it?

434
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,930
Don't tell me that you didn't buy it?

435
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,540
I wanted to but I'm keeping guard on this. How could I go out?

436
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:31,150
Governor. Please get someone to watch this. I will be back soon.

437
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,170
You, seriously.

438
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,800
We have already checked the items here and you want someone else to keep watch over them?

439
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,550
Bet less.

440
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,810
If you bet too much, you will lose a lot.

441
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,140
What will you do if your wife runs off with someone else?

442
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,440
You must keep guard over these items carefully.

443
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,260
Yes.

444
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,680
Bet less?

445
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,570
For the past nineteen years, I haven't even gambled once.

446
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,090
I must bet on this.

447
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,320
Victory to Rong Da!

448
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,450
Victory to Rong Da!

449
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,560
Victory to Rong Da!

450
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,860
Governor Liu.

451
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,860
Madam Wu. You are here too?

452
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,470
- And Miss Wu too? <br>- Hello, Governor Liu.

453
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,440
Madam Wu. You are really blessed. Your second daughter is tall and pretty.

454
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,730
These youngsters still need a lot of guidance from you.

455
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,170
Who says so?

456
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,920
By the way, where are Cai Hong and Shao Tian?

457
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,970
They are at the room behind. When the contest starts, I will call them out.

458
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,730
It has been hard on you.

459
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:39,020
Madam Wu. Sorry, I need to take my leave.

460
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,870
Governor Liu is a good man. He is very upright.

461
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,060
- How do you know? <br>- Of course, I do.

462
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,430
I played mahjong with him. He is a nice man.

463
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,310
- Stepmom, Cai Yun. <br>- Sister.

464
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:55,430
Cai Hong. Why did you come out? What are your preparations?

465
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:58,060
We are almost done.

466
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,990
Warlord Lu, President Zhang, thank you for coming.

467
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,230
Please pardon me.

468
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,290
Miss Lu, you worked had.

469
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,960
It has been hard on you.

470
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,710
Governor Liu is known for his heartwarming speeches at General Assembly.

471
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,160
Guilty as charged, isn't it?

472
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,430
I'm here for the fun of it.

473
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:19,040
Yes. To be able to have such competition,

474
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,480
is really an eye-opener.

475
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,240
By the way, Governor Liu,

476
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,480
do you mind if I watch this?

477
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,940
How could I have any objections. It's my honour to have you both here.

478
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,320
- Warlord Lu, please. <br>- No need.

479
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,090
I will only stay a while.

480
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,370
Mr Zhang, please make yourself at home.

481
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,090
I will, it's Governor Liu to you.

482
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,800
Yes. Mr Zhang, this way, please.

483
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,470
Look. There are already many people ahead. This way, please.

484
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,950
After you.

485
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,070
This rascal, Zhou Shao Tian, has already given you a lot of trouble.

486
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,520
What is he doing with this silk contest?

487
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,910
General Du, don't you know about this?

488
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,420
The silk contest is to force Jiang Yu to take out his secret formula.

489
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,970
As long as the secret formula shows up, it proves that Jiang Yu killed Wu Hong Da.

490
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,860
When that time comes, wouldn't the secret formula belong to us?

491
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,860
You can do this

492
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,540
but you also put me into the spotlight.

493
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,190
If there are any troubles, I will not let you of the hook.

494
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,280
General Du, how could you say this?

495
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,320
I have been with you for a long time.

496
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,290
Have I ever let you down?

497
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,110
That's good then.

498
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,870
The President is responsible before the Hong people.

499
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:05,930
He even received personal orders to get the silk from here.

500
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:11,010
I also hope that Rong Da will get this business.

501
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,900
Don't worry. I will definitely do my best.

502
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:40,660
Welcome everyone to the silk competition.

503
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,530
We are very honoured that

504
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:48,340
Warlord Lu, as well as President Zhang graced us with their presence.

505
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,020
We are very thankful.

506
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,020
Great.

507
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,140
The silk competition is the biggest event in Huzhou's weaving and dyeing industry.

508
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,020
Even though silk is a so-called light good,

509
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,280
the event cannot be taken lightly.

510
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,500
I, Governor Liu, am very honoured to be the host of the silk contest again.

511
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,130
The last silk contest was sixteen years ago.

512
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:24,530
At every silk contest, there will always be a losing competitor who has to leave the industry.

513
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,490
Sixteen years ago, Ling Long factory was the one who remained.

514
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,800
Sixteen years later, the one who was challenged to the contest

515
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,160
was the Ling Long factory.

516
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,470
Let's invite the contestant from Ling Long, Boss Jiang Yu

517
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,960
to the stage.

518
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,230
<i>Great.</i>

519
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,910
<i>Ling Long!</i>

520
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,970
<i>Victory for Ling Long.</i>

521
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:58,930
Today, the owner of the exquisite Lin Long factory is challenging

522
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,710
Rong Da factory. Their contestant is

523
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:08,100
their General Manager who is also someone we are familiar with in the industry.

524
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,330
Mr Zhou Shao Tian.

525
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,680
<i>Great.</i>

526
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:20,280
<i>Victory to Rong Da.</i>

527
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,400
<i>Go, Rong Da!</i>

528
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,850
<i>Go, Rong Da!</i>

529
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,070
<i>Great.</i>

530
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:46,840
Both Lin Long and Rong Da are the pride of our district.

531
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,750
I hope that both of you, as well as our audience will behave gracefully.

532
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,480
This silk contest will take place in three parts.

533
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,740
This Sunday we will have the first round.

534
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,510
Both parties need to, before the incense stick burns out,

535
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,520
produce a textile that is second to none.

536
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,100
The time is the time it takes the incense stick to burn.

537
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,520
When it ends, everyone here will vote.

538
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,340
The one who receives the most votes is the winner.

539
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:49,120
Everyone, when you entered the door, you were given a lily. It's for you to use as votes.

540
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:55,030
Great.

541
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,510
Great.

542
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:03,310
Okay, I will now announce

543
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,910
the start of the silk contest.

544
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:20,060
Brother.

545
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,390
What are you doing? Why are you doing anything?

546
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:25,090
Everything's fine. Go back.

547
