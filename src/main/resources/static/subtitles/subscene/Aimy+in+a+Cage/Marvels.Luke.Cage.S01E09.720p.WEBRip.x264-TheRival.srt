00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:14,659
I should be out there doing my job.

3
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:19,038
[Krasner] Your job is out there
waiting for you, Detective.

4
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:21,373
The question is,
how badly do you want it?

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,879
You work for the department?
You a shrink?

6
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:28,964
[Krasner] I was on the job for 15 years.

7
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:30,925
I left to become a psychologist.

8
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:32,301
[scoffs]

9
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:35,095
I'm with the peer assistance program.
I'm a volunteer.

10
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,765
Well, how about I volunteer
my way out of this chair,

11
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:41,518
tell you to kiss my ass,
and talk to my union rep?

12
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:44,188
Well, you could do that, sure.

13
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:49,109
But your inspector would guarantee
that you'll be at your desk,

14
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:52,321
and the only time you'll see the street
is in the parking lot,

15
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:55,783
or if you go to get coffee, or...
look out the window.

16
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:03,457
- This is voluntary, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

17
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,668
- And off the record?
- Absolutely.

18
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:09,463
So why are we doing this
in an interrogation room?

19
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:13,718
You'd be more candid at a Starbucks?
Really?

20
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:18,681
Mmm... Maybe at M&G's, after a shift.

21
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:21,767
Still can't believe
that place went out of business.

22
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:23,518
I miss Copeland's.

23
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:25,938
[chuckling] Who doesn't?

24
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:33,403
Whatever.
[inhales sharply] Let's do this.

25
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:40,577
Detective Mercedes Kelly Knight,
badge 3-0-9-3-5.

26
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,371
You know, you're not being recorded.

27
00:01:43,288 --> 00:01:44,749
Of course I am.

28
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:49,920
You know this is bullshit, right?

29
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:52,006
Things got rough with a hostile witness.

30
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:54,759
You think that's the first time
this has ever happened?

31
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,596
You lost control.

32
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:03,558
[inhales] And it's all about control
with you, isn't it?

33
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:06,145
I mean, that's why you were a point guard.

34
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:08,647
You wanted to be the one
to distribute the ball, right?

35
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:10,565
It's 'cause I was short,

36
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,360
and it was the only way
I could get on the court, so...

37
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:16,113
- 'Cause you had to play the game.
- It's not a game for me.

38
00:02:16,196 --> 00:02:17,572
Then why get benched

39
00:02:17,656 --> 00:02:20,910
for something as stupid
as getting physical with Claire Temple?

40
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,933
[Stryker echoing] Do you love?
Do you love?

41
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:45,267
Hmm?

42
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:48,103
[Stryker] Oh, come on.
You're not gonna beg?

43
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:50,439
Oh, come on. Not even a little bit?

44
00:02:50,522 --> 00:02:51,690
[crying]

45
00:02:52,524 --> 00:02:55,235
If you gonna kill me, then just do it.

46
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:14,088
What shook you?

47
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:17,007
Was it losing your gun to one suspect

48
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:19,718
while trying to arrest another
without backup?

49
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:21,636
Was it the extra eyes because of Scarfe?

50
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,763
Was it this Luke Cage guy?

51
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:27,101
What pushed you towards career suicide?

52
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:31,188
[chuckles]

53
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:35,359
You know how many times
I've been in this same goddamn box

54
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:37,194
on the other side of the table?

55
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:42,574
You think you are gonna break me?

56
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:45,785
Bring it.

57
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,915
Like I said,
this is not an interrogation.

58
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:52,501
I'm not here to break you.

59
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:56,213
You've already done that yourself.

60
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:59,967
The question is, how broken are you?

61
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:02,427
And can you be fixed?

62
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:07,599

68
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,267
Sweet Christmas.

69

[drumming]

71
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:11,556
Hold up, hold up.
Somebody ain't playing that thing right.

72
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,518
Tighten up over here.
Tighten up over here, all right?

73
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:17,437
Let's do this, man. We rehearsed it.
Let's get this done.

76
00:06:56,017 --> 00:07:00,980
[Shades] So we've checked every truck,
every landfill in every borough.

77
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:03,900
And for all of that, we've got...

Nothing yet.

80
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:16,121
[Shades] Nothing yet. Nothing yet.

81
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:18,457
[Stryker] Y'all can't find Luke Cage?

82
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,044
What, he just dissipated?

83
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:25,505
Like smoke?

84
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:31,761
See, that's the thing.

85
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:37,892
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

86
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:40,062

00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:41,396

[Darnell gasping]

89
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:51,615
- There's nothing magical about it.
- [groaning]

90
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:53,533
Follow the smoke.

91
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,663
Or the damn garbage truck.

92
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:07,214
[chuckles] Well...

93
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:10,175
you ain't Houdini.

94
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,390
And you ain't Rick
from <i>Casablanca,</i> neither.

95
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:19,309
What?

96
00:08:20,477 --> 00:08:23,647
You thought you could
whisper in Mariah's ear...

97
00:08:24,648 --> 00:08:26,441
have her do your dirty work...

98
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:29,736
then you're the new king
with the big desk?

99
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:31,780
Hmm...

102
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:41,706
You killed my friend, Shades.

103
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:45,335
He was my number one seller.

104
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,630
Who do you think gave him
that Barron Claiborne there?

105
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:53,092
You don't have any friends.

106
00:08:53,177 --> 00:08:56,680
"A man of too many friends
comes to ruin,

107
00:08:56,763 --> 00:09:02,186
but there is a friend
who comes closer than a brother."

108
00:09:05,063 --> 00:09:07,191
Proverbs 18:24.

109
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:11,278
Cornell Stokes was that friend for me.

110
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:17,033
And I could trust him
like I could my own brother.

111
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:20,412
Cornell was losing it.

112
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,623
You trusted me to take care of him.

113
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:27,544
I trusted you to take care of it,
not him.

114
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,716
What? Did you think I was just gonna
give it all to you?

115
00:09:35,802 --> 00:09:37,179
[cocks gun]

116
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:42,184
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't splatter

117
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:44,853
this pristine desk
with your brain matter.

118
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:50,066
[Zip] Because it won't help you find
Luke Cage any faster?

119
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:55,572
[laughing]

120
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:02,078
You're smarter
than your name implies, Zip.

121
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:06,458
Two rule books
got me through the darkness.

122
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:10,337
The Bible...

123
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,884
and <i>The 48 Laws of Power.</i>

124
00:10:18,262 --> 00:10:20,138
Do you want to know what the 49th is?

125
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:27,979
Luke Cage ain't dead
until you find his goddamn body.

- [Krasner] You had it rough recently.
- Where do you want to start?

142
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:54,023
Who do you talk to when things get bad?

143
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:56,109
I... [sighs]

144
00:11:57,819 --> 00:11:59,696
I used to talk to Scarfe.

145
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:03,492
[stammers] No husband. A boyfriend?

146
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,374
The last time somebody set me up,
I ended up arresting the guy at the table.

147

- No.
- Yeah.

148
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,876
I did a background check,

149
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,670
and he was wanted for robbery
in three different states.

150
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:18,632
They gave the dude a nickname
at my precinct.

151
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:21,175
- Yeah?
- Called him the Love Bandit.

152

So who's the last person you dated?

- That's personal.
- That's why we're here.

158
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,792
I met a guy at a bar.

159
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:57,962
I wasn't nice to him, at all.

160
00:12:58,046 --> 00:13:00,632
[scoffs] But he didn't care.

161
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,259
He was funny.

162
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:05,554
He wasn't wearing a ring.

163
00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:11,810
And the first time he spoke to me,
even in a low cut dress,

164
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:13,352
he looked at my eyes...

165
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,480
not my breasts.

166
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:19,693
- So?
- So, we talked.

167
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:22,070
I could be myself.

168
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:24,823
He thought I was pretty
and he told me so.

169
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:27,241
We had coffee.

I feel a "but" coming on.

172
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:36,417
- But he wasn't who I thought he was.
- Just like Scarfe?

173
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:39,713
How does that make you feel?

174
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:43,800
How do you think it makes me feel?

00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:53,226
I didn't want it!

176
00:13:56,104 --> 00:14:00,066
[Mariah] You don't remember Jazmine.
How could you?

177
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:04,946
She was fly. So damn fast.

178
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,909
She used to drive Mama Mabel crazy
with all her boyfriends.

179
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:14,122
Malik was special, though.

180
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:16,875
He was talented.

181
00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:22,881
Played drums on a lot of those
Sugar Hill Records. The old ones.

182
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:28,720
I really liked him.

183
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:33,182
I thought they were good together.

184
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:37,812
Mama Mabel couldn't stand him.

185
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:42,066
She knew he was dabbling.

186
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,944
Coke, smack.

187
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:56,956
Malik wanted you, Cornell.
He did. But he OD'd.

188
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,585
And then Jazzy ran off.

189
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:04,548
She told me, "I'm not ready
to be nobody's mama."

190
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,216
And she just left.

191
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:10,887
She left you, and there you were,

192
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,515
[stammering] wrapped in a blanket
in a basket.

193
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,478
Mama Mabel put you
in my hands that very day.

194
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:26,110
You always thought
I called you Mo for Cottonmouth.

195
00:15:27,236 --> 00:15:28,947
Mo was for Moses.

196
00:15:38,748 --> 00:15:40,917
I wasn't ready
to be nobody's mama, neither.

197
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:49,050
I did try to protect you from
[stutters] all the shit.

198
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:54,513
I tried... I tried to protect you
from yourself...

199
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,018
but I didn't.

200
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:02,856
[sniffles]

201
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:05,108
[stammering] I'm...

202
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:17,746
You did what you had to do.

203
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,374
I don't know how this happened.

204
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,754
You made a choice... [sighs]

205
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,257
and now we have to pay the price.

206
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:33,552
Diamondback is here to collect.

207
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:36,555
Diamond-what?

208
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,726
He's not happy
that Cornell is dead, and...

209
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:42,687
Luke Cage is still alive.

210
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:48,777
Cage is in the wind right now,
and I need your help to find him.

211
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,361
Our frame doesn't work...

212
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:54,282
if he's not there to take the blame.

213
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:56,993
[stammers] What, you want me
to call the police?

214
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:59,120
If it comes to that, sure.

215
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:00,872
But right now...

216
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:04,250
we have more pressing concerns.

217
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,877
You keep saying "we."

218
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,299
[chuckling] Well, you.

219
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:15,428
Like it or not...

220
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,848
the business is yours now.

221
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:22,101
I have nothing to do with all of that.

222
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:24,478
You are the face now.

223
00:17:24,562 --> 00:17:28,399
And nature abhors a vacuum.

224
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:35,198
You have to ensure a smooth transition
for all of Cornell's clients,

225
00:17:35,281 --> 00:17:38,534
or it is going to be
straight up chaos for you.

226
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:44,207
- [radio static]
- [officer] Dispatch, car 77-0-5.

227
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,625
Sighting possible drunk.
Should we engage?

228
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,044
[dispatcher] <i>Is it our suspect?</i>

229
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:50,296
[officer] We've a black male,
but need verification.

230
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:51,881
[siren wailing]

231
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:57,762
[breathing heavily]

232
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:07,105
Good morning. Is there a problem?

233
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:10,066
No. You tell me. What's your name, son?

234
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:15,154
[panting] I'm just taking a walk.
Minding my business.

235
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:17,490
I need to see some ID.

236
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:18,908
To walk?

237
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:21,703
Turn around, take down your hoodie.

238
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:26,040
- May I ask why?
- Because I said so.

239
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:35,424
[sighs]

240
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:40,805
[phone beeps]

241
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:46,435
- Oh, shit. It is him!
- On the ground, now!

242
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:50,231
Hands behind your back.
Get on the ground, now!

243
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,448
I'm really sorry, guys.

244
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:02,076
[officer] You're under arrest!

245
00:19:13,462 --> 00:19:14,505
[groans]

246
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,800
[dispatcher] <i>Car 7-7-0-5, come in.</i>

247
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:26,309
<i>Car 7-7-0-5, come in.</i>

248
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,690
[screaming]

249
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:36,402
[panting]

250
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,214
Lemonade?

251
00:19:58,257 --> 00:20:01,177
- Popular drink.
- And it still is.

252
00:20:03,304 --> 00:20:05,139
That story in my file, too?

253
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:08,101
What story?

254
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:13,982
You know,
I don't believe everything I read?

255
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:19,904
I wanna hear you tell it.

256
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:32,182
[Misty] Summer of '95,

257
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:38,313
and every other car was playing either
"Shook Ones" or "Ice Cream."

258
00:20:40,148 --> 00:20:42,693
I was hanging out
with my cousin, Cassandra.

259
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:49,825
My mother told us never to walk around
the neighborhood by ourselves...

260
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:53,954
but it was hot, and I was thirsty.

261
00:20:55,706 --> 00:21:00,085
And she was taking way too long
talking to some cute boy.

262
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:02,129
So...

263
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:09,052
I went to Ruiz Bodega by myself
and got a lemonade.

264
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,097
When I got back, she was gone.

265
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:17,478
It took the cops two weeks
to find her body.

266
00:21:18,436 --> 00:21:21,314
Disfigured, beaten.

267
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:28,739
The boy, Mike Jones,
ran a train on her with his crew.

268
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:33,786
Nobody snitched.

269
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:37,164
Cops didn't push.
They didn't really give a shit.

270
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:44,630
She was just another poor, worthless bitch
from the Polo Grounds.

271
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:47,340
[breathing heavily]

272
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:50,468
So that's why you became a cop?

273
00:21:50,553 --> 00:21:52,596
I apply foot to ass,

274
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,849
and match lead for lead.

275
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:58,101
I put murderers in handcuffs.

276
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:02,898
I don't just seek justice, I stalk it.

277
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:06,151
And that much should go in my record.

278
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:11,824
With your resume,
you could've been downtown years ago.

279
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:15,869
Hell, you could've been a fed,
but you chose to stay in Harlem.

280
00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:19,540
I know this place, I know the players...

281
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,543
and I can make a difference here.

282
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:25,045
Or use some
of those old school connections

283
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:27,673
to make a little money on the side,
like your partner.

284
00:22:27,756 --> 00:22:29,800
I didn't know anything about Scarfe.

285
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:32,636
Or anything he was doing.

286
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,963
He didn't buy new clothes,

287
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:39,717
no new watch, no new girlfriend,
no loose talk, nothing.

288
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:42,095
But he'd been working
for Cottonmouth for years.

289
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,306
And I trusted him...

290
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:46,934
so I didn't see it.

291
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:50,145
And neither did anybody else
in this damn department.

292
00:22:50,228 --> 00:22:52,439
So why do I get singled out for it?

293
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:53,941
Because you were the closest to him.

294
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:58,736
It's written all over your face.
Not seeing it bothered you, didn't it?

295
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:02,074
'Cause seeing is my thing, right?

296
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:05,410
That's what made me
such a good point guard.

297
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:08,080
'Cause I could see everything in my head.

298
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:11,708
I knew exactly where people were gonna be,

299
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,169
so I put the ball
right where it needed to go.

300
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:16,379
But you couldn't see Scarfe
for what he was.

301
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,924
Or were you blinded by your emotions?

302
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:21,301
[scoffs] You wouldn't say that
if I was a man.

303
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:23,553
- Oh, that is not true.
- Bullshit!

304
00:23:24,554 --> 00:23:27,099
Male cops can screw cop groupies

305
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:28,892
in the back of their unmarked
or their RMP,

306
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:31,269
and you guys cheer.

307
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,023
They get drunk
and fight each other in the parking lot,

308
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:37,234
and it's called blowing off steam.

309
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,278
There's always a double standard.

310
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:42,822
[inhales] And you never screwed anyone

311
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:45,783
that you shouldn't have
while you were on the job?

312
00:23:47,035 --> 00:23:48,078
No.

313
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:50,788
But you choked out a witness.

314
00:23:51,706 --> 00:23:53,000
Own your shit.

315
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:58,671
You went renegade
when you went after Luke Cage alone.

316
00:23:58,755 --> 00:24:00,715
And it got... [scoffs]

317
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:02,592
way deeper than it should have.

318
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:08,181
And this guy took the control
away from you when he took your gun.

319
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:10,725
[gasps]

320
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:12,519
Then you're in a room
alone with Miss Temple,

321
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:14,854
and she insults you,
and you lost control...

322
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:17,065
and you know it.

323
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:24,948
I need a break.

324
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,460
[exhales deeply]

325
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,307
[indistinct chatter]

326
00:24:55,312 --> 00:24:56,939
[saw whirring]

327
00:24:58,065 --> 00:24:59,274
[Mariah] What happened in here?

328
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:03,987
You know what happened here.
Same as you.

329
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,577
Sorry to hear about Cornell.

330
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,371
Hope they get that bastard.

331
00:25:13,455 --> 00:25:14,914
He's bad for business.

332
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:18,376
Well, yeah, I'm not here
to talk about Luke Cage.

333
00:25:19,836 --> 00:25:22,672
Well, it took a lot for you to walk
through those doors without your people.

334
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:25,842
<i>Chico,</i> please.

335
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:29,429
I was from around here
long before you even knew what that was.

336
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:36,853
Besides, we all contribute to this city,
one way or another.

337
00:25:37,562 --> 00:25:39,106
Contribute?

338
00:25:41,524 --> 00:25:45,820
I never trusted your cousin...
and I trust you even less.

339
00:25:47,286 --> 00:25:49,579
Pretending to rise
to the right side of the law.

340
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,552
Girl, I know where you're from.

341
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,970
That stank don't come off too easy.

342
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,019
The thing my cousin built
needs to continue.

343
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,271
And you're gonna be the one to run it?

344
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:07,442
No. I need help.

345
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:10,820
Me?

346
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,572
Not just you.

347
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,659
Cornell had steady customers.

348
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,786
[Domingo chuckles]

349
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,163
Not everybody liked your cousin.

350
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,665
I mean, God respect the dead.

351
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:26,461
Yeah, he got it done
without a lot of needless violence.

352
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:32,132
I want everybody to come to the table
so I can discuss a transition.

353
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,594
Maybe even a buyout.

354
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,058
There was something dangerous
behind your eyes...

355
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,895
and this is it, huh?

356
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,023
Cornell was who he was.

357
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,650
I want something different.

358
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:54,989
I don't want to have
to look over my shoulder, Domingo.

359
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,492
Gather all the bosses.

360
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,620
I have a proposition
that will benefit us all.

361
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,375
[inhales sharply]
So who gets an invitation?

362
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,378
[breathing deeply]

363
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,464
Jacques Alef with the Macoute...

364
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:16,260
Neville Barnwell with the Yardies.

365
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,554
Juan Carlos Castro with the Cubanos...

366
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:23,267
And the Chinese, they got their own thing
going on downtown,

367
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,936
but Peter Hong with the Koreans...

368
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,939
he might wanna holla.

369
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,274
When?

370
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,068
Oh, that's gonna take me a few days.

371
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,070
Tonight.

372
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,682
[softly] Abalone shells.

373
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,494
[sighs]

374
00:28:40,878 --> 00:28:42,963
[Luke whispering] Claire. Claire.

375
00:28:43,047 --> 00:28:45,382
[groaning]

376
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:49,053
[softly] Everybody's looking for you.
How did you not get caught?

377
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:51,847
- He shot you again?
- [groans]

378
00:28:54,684 --> 00:28:55,851
Ugh!

379
00:28:56,686 --> 00:28:59,354
Why in the hell is this guy
trying to kill you so bad?

380
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,483
He's even going through the trouble of
using bullets that could actually do it.

381
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:06,737
Willis was my, uh...

382
00:29:06,821 --> 00:29:08,072
my best friend.

383
00:29:08,864 --> 00:29:11,659
He's, uh... He's delusional.

384
00:29:11,742 --> 00:29:14,619
Delusional and pissed. Let me see.

385
00:29:17,414 --> 00:29:18,791
[groaning]

386
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:20,459
[police sirens wailing in distance]

387
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:24,463
[Claire] Ugh, your wound
is getting infected.

388
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:25,881
- [grunts]
- This looks bad.

389
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:32,304
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?

390
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:34,807
[sighs] I should say, "What are you?"

391
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:40,730
I'm looking at your cells
and I've never seen anything like it.

392
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:44,817
I've been looking up sea shells to better
understand the structure of your skin.

393
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,402
Like I said...

394
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,905
you're amazing.

395
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:52,282
Only one man knows the science.

396
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,370
And I am not going back to prison.

397
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,623
And is his name Dr. Noah Burstein?

398
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,962
[sighs] You gave me Reva's hard drive,
remember?

399
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,173
- Do you talk to him?
- No.

400
00:30:08,257 --> 00:30:10,175
Reva kept tabs...

401
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,220
just in case someone got cute.

402
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,893
But I am not ready to reopen that door.

403
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,731
I don't think that you have
very much choice.

404
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:25,983
We need to get you out of here.

405
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:29,694
My mom has a car.

406
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:31,196
And we haven't totaled that one yet.

407
00:30:32,156 --> 00:30:34,283
[chuckles and groans]

408
00:30:36,744 --> 00:30:38,037
[Alex] Excuse me.

409
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:42,416
Excuse me? Madam Councilwoman?

410
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:44,334
Not anymore.

411
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:48,630
Have you seen the emails?
The interview requests?

412
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,507
Even Thembi Wallace
wants another sit-down.

413
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:52,634
Never.

414
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,679
Can I show you something?

415
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,268
Hit the news about 20 minutes ago.

416
00:31:01,351 --> 00:31:04,396
He attacked two cops and stole their cars.

417
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:07,149
- Cage?
- The cops are alive.

418
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:11,361
They GPS'd the car,
but someone leaked the footage.

419
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:13,447
It was too hot to hold back.

420
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,158
- [man screaming]
- [thuds]

421
00:31:18,285 --> 00:31:19,787
Huh. [chuckles]

422
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:22,915
It's amazing.

423
00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:26,585
I know it's tough seeing the man
that killed your cousin.

424
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:30,464
[Mariah sighs]

425
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:35,594
They'll get him, Alex.
Justice will prevail.

426
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:43,010
You know, Cornell taught me to be strong,
so I will be strong.

427
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:45,930
People understand the threat...

428
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:49,767
the kind of person you're up against.

429
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:53,146
They're not talking about the money,
or where it came from.

430
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:56,441
I think if you play this right,

431
00:31:56,524 --> 00:31:59,069
you could have supporters
with even deeper pockets behind you,

432
00:31:59,152 --> 00:32:01,363
who see this as a political issue,

433
00:32:01,446 --> 00:32:05,492
and see your cousin as a brave man
who stood up to a freak.

434
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:10,955
You would use my personal tragedy
for strategic political advantage?

435
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:16,503
- Madam Councilwoman, I...
- I taught you well.

436
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:23,176
Go home, Alex.
I'm letting you off early.

437
00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:27,305
[Alex] Thank you.

438
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:49,452
What happened out there...
that bothers you the most?

439
00:32:50,995 --> 00:32:52,122
I lost my gun.

440
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:54,081
Other than that,
I wouldn't say it bothered me.

441
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:58,503
I saw your hand shake the first time
you looked at this photo. Why?

442
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:13,643
Because I remembered
seeing myself see myself...

443
00:33:14,894 --> 00:33:17,314
wondering what I would look like
in a casket.

444
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,819
I mean, how the hell did I get there?

445
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,864
He got the drop on me.
How in the hell did he do that?

446
00:33:26,948 --> 00:33:29,409
I could have disarmed him,
like, ten different ways.

447
00:33:29,492 --> 00:33:32,537
Why didn't I do any of that?

448
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,832
I couldn't help anybody,
not even my damn self.

449
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:41,045
He shoved my gun in my face...

450
00:33:41,128 --> 00:33:42,630
and I froze.

451
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,426
And you know what I thought about?

452
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:51,348
I thought about Pop's funeral.
I thought about my own funeral.

453
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:53,850
I thought about my father,

454
00:33:53,933 --> 00:33:56,394
and what people would think about me.

455
00:33:57,645 --> 00:33:59,439
And this guy...

456
00:34:02,817 --> 00:34:06,196
this guy was smiling...

457
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,158
[voice breaking]
while he was toying with my life.

458
00:34:11,243 --> 00:34:13,035
It was fun for him.

459
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:19,792
I didn't have control,

460
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:23,255
and maybe I never did.

461
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:26,924
And when Claire
was talking sideways about me,

462
00:34:27,008 --> 00:34:30,345
all I wanted to do
was take my control back.

463
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:45,902
Oh, my God.

464
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:47,820
[exhales] What have I done?

465
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:49,113
[inhales sharply]

466
00:34:50,532 --> 00:34:51,533
[sniffles]

467
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,119
It's like anything else
you've learned on the job.

468
00:34:55,995 --> 00:34:57,455
It's ugly...

469
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:00,207
but you can't move your gaze.

470
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:03,878
You have to look... and learn.

471
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,299
That's how you get answers.

472
00:35:11,093 --> 00:35:12,970
That's how you win.

473
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:20,978
[sighs heavily]

474
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:11,488
[groaning]

475
00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:16,283
[Luke breathing heavily]

476
00:36:17,994 --> 00:36:20,497
- [Luke] It's getting harder to breathe.
- [exhales]

477
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,290
- [groans] These wounds are kicking my ass.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

478
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,043
You know, it passed before,
it's gonna pass again, okay?

479
00:36:26,127 --> 00:36:27,504
I promise.

480
00:36:27,587 --> 00:36:29,756
Can I get that
with the money-back guarantee?

481
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,924
- [both chuckle]
- [grunts]

482
00:36:32,008 --> 00:36:33,343
Breathe.

483
00:36:33,426 --> 00:36:35,094
[breathing deeply]

484
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:38,765
See? You got this.

485
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:46,356
What if this is a one-way trip?

486
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:48,941
Hey, hey, you are gonna make it.

487
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:52,028
You hear me?
You're gonna make it just fine.

488
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:54,364
We're gonna fix this.

489
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:55,782
Don't even.

490
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:58,325
- You're not dying in my mom's car.
- [chuckles]

491
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,786
Okay?

492
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:02,705
[sighs]

493
00:37:09,128 --> 00:37:11,506
It's the part you can't fix
that's bothering me.

494
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:14,258
What do you mean?

495
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:16,302
Willis.

496
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:19,889
Willis Stryker.
He thinks he's my brother.

497
00:37:21,808 --> 00:37:23,267
Diamondback.

498
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:29,732
He's... he's gotta be lying
about my father. He's...

499
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:33,528
He's... He can't be my brother.

500
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,851
[knocking on door]

501
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:16,070
[Claire] Hi. Sorry to ring so late.

502
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:18,490
My name is Sandra Lopez.

503
00:38:18,573 --> 00:38:22,785
I'm currently majoring in prison studies
at Boston University, and, uh,

504
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:24,328
I was just wondering if I could ask you

505
00:38:24,411 --> 00:38:26,664
a few questions
about your time at Seagate.

506
00:38:26,748 --> 00:38:28,750
My friend said that you worked there?

507
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:30,535
Your friend was mistaken.

508
00:38:31,453 --> 00:38:34,289
- What friend?
- Carl Lucas.

509
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,167
I don't know anybody by that name.

510
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:41,393
He's alive, Doc.

511
00:38:41,511 --> 00:38:44,056
- That's impossible.
- Your experiment worked.

512
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:46,141
It changed him.

513
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,186
Changed how?

514
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:52,106
You should see for yourself.

515
00:38:52,857 --> 00:38:54,900
- He's here?
- Yes.

516
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:58,863
Where is he?

517
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:16,171
What's up, Doc?

518
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:19,091
I've always wanted to say that.

519
00:39:20,384 --> 00:39:21,676
Let's get him out of here.

520
00:39:22,344 --> 00:39:24,263
- [groaning]
- Put him on the couch.

521
00:39:24,346 --> 00:39:26,015
[Claire] Come on. Just a few more steps.

522
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:28,017
- [Luke groaning]
- [Claire] Easy, easy.

523
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,560
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

524
00:39:31,478 --> 00:39:32,771
Breathe.

525
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,191
Breathe. Okay.

526
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:38,277
[Luke sighs]

527
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,697
You've got no scars. Nothing.

528
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:45,367
That lab was totally destroyed.

529
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,827
You mean it worked?

530
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:51,831
Yes... and no.

531
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,961
Until last night... [breathing heavily]

532
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:59,798
I was bulletproof.

533
00:39:59,882 --> 00:40:03,552
Jesus Christ, kid. What did this to you?

534
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:07,722
They shot me with some crazy bullets.

535
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,724
They exploded inside of him.

536
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,726
[Burstein] He should be dead.

537
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:15,147
My skin is now tough... like armor.

538
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,107
I think maybe what makes him stronger

539
00:40:17,191 --> 00:40:19,818
is also pushing the shrapnel
deeper into his organs.

540
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:24,739
Trust me, it is impossible
to cut into his skin.

541
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,494
Look, I don't know what it is
that you think I can do for you.

542
00:40:29,578 --> 00:40:32,872
My lab is not my lab anymore.
I wouldn't know where to begin.

543
00:40:32,957 --> 00:40:34,666
What if we can help you with that?

544
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:36,710
Reva took this.

545
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:39,088
[Burstein gasps]

546
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,508
She shouldn't have done that. [sighs]

547
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:48,680
Can you unlock it?

548
00:40:55,312 --> 00:40:56,730
[sighs]

549
00:41:02,236 --> 00:41:03,737
[Burstein] Oh, my God.

550
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,157
It's all here. Everything.

551
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:08,742
Everything you need?

552
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:12,537
Everything I lost. So much more....

553
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:14,081
[Claire sighs]

554
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:17,042
Reva died for this, didn't she?

555
00:41:18,918 --> 00:41:20,920
Luke refuses to talk about it.

556
00:41:21,671 --> 00:41:23,382
[coughing]

557
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:27,052
[Claire] You okay?

558
00:41:31,348 --> 00:41:32,349
[gasps]

559
00:41:33,642 --> 00:41:35,185
[Luke groans] They're killing me.

560
00:41:36,603 --> 00:41:39,231
Doc, you figure this shit out.

561
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,375
[Luke groaning]

562
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,959
[Burstein] Watch your step.

563
00:42:02,671 --> 00:42:05,757
- All right. Can you stand a second?
- [Claire] I got him.

564
00:42:09,511 --> 00:42:11,555
- [Claire] Okay.
- [Luke] All right.

565
00:42:14,224 --> 00:42:16,643
[breathing heavily]
What is all this stuff?

566
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:19,729
[Burstein] During the cover-up,
I stole whatever I could.

567
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,066
[Luke] What cover-up?

568
00:42:22,149 --> 00:42:24,151
They couldn't advertise Rackham's death,

569
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:25,985
or the explosion
that supposedly killed you,

570
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,613
or Reva's data dump,
so they... they killed the whole thing.

571
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,035
- Here, let's set him down.
- [breathing heavily]

572
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:34,203
I was so close to a breakthrough.

573
00:42:34,286 --> 00:42:36,205
That all ended when they thought
you were dead.

574
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:39,624
- [all groaning]
- [Burstein] I started again from scratch,

575
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:43,087
but never came close
to replicating the Seagate incident.

576
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,797
[stammers] I'm a nurse.
I know the drill. I can help.

577
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:48,592
[Luke groans]

578
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:50,719
Why me?

579
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:53,222
Why did you pick me?

580
00:42:54,181 --> 00:42:56,516
Because you were strong.
Stronger than most.

581
00:42:57,434 --> 00:42:58,935
[Luke] That's not what Reva said.

582
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:02,021
She said she begged you to do it.

583
00:43:03,607 --> 00:43:06,151
There's more to it than that,
and you know it.

584
00:43:06,235 --> 00:43:09,488
She begged me, but you were
already tabbed for the program.

585
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:14,826
- Didn't Reva tell you about this?
- No.

586
00:43:16,035 --> 00:43:17,496
That's not gonna do anything.

587
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:21,541
- [Burstein grunts]
- [scalpel snaps]

588
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:24,253
Oh, my God.

589
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:28,798
Look, I gotta get a blood sample
to cross check with Reva's data.

590
00:43:28,882 --> 00:43:32,010
Your DNA may be the X factor
that made this whole thing work.

591
00:43:32,094 --> 00:43:35,347
- You mean, it could only work for Luke?
- [Burstein] Yeah, maybe.

592
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,808
This wound is too septic
to get a decent sample.

593
00:43:38,892 --> 00:43:40,935
Are you saying
you can't recreate what you did?

594
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:44,773
It's not as straightforward as that.
You know, penicillin, the X-ray machine...

595
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:46,358
[groans]

596
00:43:46,441 --> 00:43:49,403
[Burstein] ...the smallpox vaccine,
pacemaker, even... even...

597
00:43:49,486 --> 00:43:50,529
even Viagra.

598
00:43:50,612 --> 00:43:53,823
Those were accidents.
It's the same with Carl.

599
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:04,293
This could work.

600
00:44:05,252 --> 00:44:07,254
If you go down his throat...

601
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:11,591
We can puncture his mucus membrane.

602
00:44:11,675 --> 00:44:13,385
- Exactly.
- I like the way you think.

603
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,055
I don't.

604
00:44:18,265 --> 00:44:19,558
Sorry.

605
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:23,728
All right. Put your head back.
Just open your mouth.

606
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,981
I'll try to make this quick.

607
00:44:29,568 --> 00:44:30,777
Breathe through your nose.

608
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,576
[groaning]

609
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:40,912
[Burstein] Easy, easy. Oh, here we go.

610
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:43,373
[Burstein] It's working.

611
00:44:57,554 --> 00:44:58,847
[Ridley] You see that?

612
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:04,603
- That's my shield.
- No, no, no.

613
00:45:05,979 --> 00:45:07,564
That's not your shield.

614
00:45:07,647 --> 00:45:10,567
That shield belongs
to the city of New York and its people.

615
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:13,820
And when you lose control,

616
00:45:13,903 --> 00:45:16,740
go upside somebody's head
because you had a bad day...

617
00:45:17,741 --> 00:45:19,534
or you feel powerless...

618
00:45:20,494 --> 00:45:23,872
- or you screw the wrong person...
- I didn't screw anybody.

619
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:25,290
Come on, now.

620
00:45:32,381 --> 00:45:35,509
You don't deserve to represent
the people of New York,

621
00:45:35,592 --> 00:45:37,176
let alone protect them.

622
00:45:37,261 --> 00:45:39,721
That's not true and you know it.

623
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:40,847
I do.

624
00:45:42,557 --> 00:45:46,311
Look, we're wired differently.

625
00:45:47,896 --> 00:45:49,356
We run towards gunfire.

626
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,066
We drink when we're sad.
We screw when we're mad.

627
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:56,738
And people hate us until they need us.

628
00:45:58,532 --> 00:46:00,241
And I hate that.

629
00:46:03,787 --> 00:46:05,830
But I love it, too.

630
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,713
[Ridley] We walk a higher path.

631
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,760
It's not simple. It's very hard.

632
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:22,347
And that is why
people will always need us.

633
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:35,902
Hero of Harlem, my ass.

634
00:46:38,655 --> 00:46:39,823
[sighs]

635
00:46:42,283 --> 00:46:46,204
Look, if we're talking about a right path,
it's not just about Luke Cage.

636
00:46:47,956 --> 00:46:52,126
You haven't even acknowledged the guy
that held a gun to my head last night.

637
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,795
We will find out who that is.

638
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:55,630
And we still need
to talk about Mariah Dillard.

639
00:46:55,714 --> 00:46:57,716
She is not innocent in all this.

640
00:46:57,799 --> 00:47:00,552
Look, Mariah's not on the run for murder,
assaulting two police officers.

641
00:47:00,635 --> 00:47:06,140
I need you to focus
on bringing in Luke Cage.

642
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:13,022
Bullets bounce right off of him.

643
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,693
Reason is the only thing
that's gonna work.

644
00:47:18,027 --> 00:47:21,072
And it has to come
from somebody he trusts.

645
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:22,824
[Ridley chuckles]

646
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:25,369
[laughs]

647
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,251
Go get him.

648
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:53,980
You ready for this?

649
00:47:54,063 --> 00:47:57,191
Like I said, ready as ever.

650
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,277
You need to understand where you are here.

651
00:48:00,194 --> 00:48:04,282
If they sense any weakness,
any hesitation...

652
00:48:04,365 --> 00:48:06,785
you're not just done politically...

653
00:48:06,868 --> 00:48:08,495
you're done permanently.

654
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:24,511
You're late.

655
00:48:25,178 --> 00:48:28,723
I'm not. Looks like I'm right on time.

656
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:30,434
Wagwan?

657
00:48:33,352 --> 00:48:37,524
Now that my cousin is gone,
I'm making a few changes.

658
00:48:37,607 --> 00:48:41,402
I loved my cousin,
but I didn't like what he did.

659
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:42,987
Until he stopped serving you.

660
00:48:43,905 --> 00:48:47,033
Cut the crap, lady.
What do you want to tell us?

661
00:48:49,118 --> 00:48:50,369
I'm out.

662
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:57,418
My family is no longer to be associated
with what you all do.

663
00:48:58,336 --> 00:49:00,839
I need to move
in a more legitimate direction.

664
00:49:00,922 --> 00:49:01,923
[Jacques] Need?

665
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:03,758
That's a weak hand you're playing.

666
00:49:03,842 --> 00:49:07,261
My cousin has valuable assets
and connections.

667
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:11,390
I'll give them to you... for a price.

668
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:17,271
- And you walk away?
- I walk away.

669
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:19,566
Why do I find that hard to believe?

670
00:49:19,649 --> 00:49:23,528
Because you're smart and stupid
at the same time.

671
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:27,115
Diamondback, what are you doing here?

672
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:28,700
You invited me...

673
00:49:28,783 --> 00:49:30,619
by not inviting me.

674
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:38,877
- Excuse me?
- Now, Peter...

675
00:49:39,794 --> 00:49:42,171
when you don't buy my wares,
or Jacques...

676
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:46,801
when you get them at a cheaper price
from my competitors,

677
00:49:46,885 --> 00:49:48,762
you're messing with my money.

678
00:49:48,845 --> 00:49:50,722
And that pisses me off.

679
00:49:50,805 --> 00:49:52,807
- [gunshot]
- [Jacques] Hey, man!

680
00:49:54,433 --> 00:49:55,644
[grunting]

681
00:50:00,273 --> 00:50:03,818
[Stryker] Anybody else not made it
to confessional this week?

682
00:50:03,902 --> 00:50:07,238
- [men breathing heavily]
- Your men outside are dead.

683
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:10,033
Your greed superseded your common sense.

684
00:50:10,116 --> 00:50:14,287
So now, I have the pulpit.

685
00:50:17,123 --> 00:50:20,627
Rich men, camel and needles.

686
00:50:21,545 --> 00:50:22,879
What do you want?

687
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:25,214
Hey, Neville...

688
00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:28,009
[in mock Jamaican accent]
if you wanna test me...

689
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:31,220
[stammering] Ease up, man.
I got no hackle with you now.

690
00:50:31,304 --> 00:50:34,599
- We'll listen what you have to say.
- Don't bother.

691
00:50:34,683 --> 00:50:37,561
Just by being here, you're already dead.

692
00:50:37,644 --> 00:50:39,813
- [gunshot]
- [groans]

693
00:50:40,564 --> 00:50:42,398
Two for the price of one.

694
00:50:42,481 --> 00:50:44,275
[Domingo] What are you doing, man?

695
00:50:45,193 --> 00:50:46,903
You're gonna start a war.

696
00:50:47,987 --> 00:50:50,281
"And then many will fall away,

697
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:55,662
and they will betray each other
and hate one another.

698
00:50:55,745 --> 00:51:00,416
And many false prophets will arise
and lead many astray.

699
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:04,629
But the one who endures to the end...

700
00:51:06,047 --> 00:51:07,757
he will be saved."

701
00:51:08,758 --> 00:51:10,176
[Domingo] You're crazy.

702
00:51:15,765 --> 00:51:20,103
Crazy would be leaving you alive
to run a very profitable drug business.

703
00:51:21,104 --> 00:51:25,108
But I got no beef with your cousins
down south of the border...

704
00:51:26,192 --> 00:51:28,152
so today is your lucky day.

705
00:51:30,446 --> 00:51:31,656
But you...

706
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:33,908
You...

707
00:51:35,034 --> 00:51:36,786
you're full of crazy.

708
00:51:38,246 --> 00:51:40,999
I just killed four people, and...

709
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:44,252
you didn't even flinch.

710
00:51:46,212 --> 00:51:47,839
You don't scare me.

711
00:51:49,382 --> 00:51:50,591
No...

712
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:53,094
I don't think I do.

713
00:51:55,304 --> 00:51:57,724
Tell me why we should be friends.

714
00:52:04,605 --> 00:52:06,024
Luke Cage.

715
00:52:07,025 --> 00:52:09,360
Clearly, we both have issues with him.

716
00:52:09,986 --> 00:52:14,073
I heard he killed your cousin.
Allegedly.

717
00:52:14,157 --> 00:52:18,452
Rest assured, I will end him
when the time is right.

718
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:20,664
But the time is not right.

719
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:25,376
Have you even seen the dashboard footage
that's all over the news?

720
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,171
You don't you see the opportunity?

721
00:52:29,172 --> 00:52:32,759
You see a man you want dead who won't die.

722
00:52:33,843 --> 00:52:36,095
I see a marketer's dream.

723
00:52:37,138 --> 00:52:39,223
Why spend all your time

724
00:52:39,307 --> 00:52:42,936
killing and intimidating
your criminal customers in the dark

725
00:52:43,019 --> 00:52:47,440
when you should be selling guns
to police departments in the light?

726
00:52:47,523 --> 00:52:50,484
Guns that can handle these new threats.

727
00:52:56,115 --> 00:52:57,533
Go on.

728
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:05,249
Word is you have a weapon
that can take him down.

729
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:07,794
Kill Luke Cage.

730
00:53:08,669 --> 00:53:12,716
But if you do, and you go big,

731
00:53:12,799 --> 00:53:16,010
everyone else will come to you

732
00:53:16,094 --> 00:53:18,722
to help take down
the rest of these super-freaks

733
00:53:18,805 --> 00:53:22,100
that are upsetting
the natural order of things.

734
00:53:22,183 --> 00:53:24,560
You gotta go big pharma on this shit.

735
00:53:25,644 --> 00:53:29,899
You invent the disease,
then you sell the cure.

736
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:31,985
[chuckles]

737
00:53:33,152 --> 00:53:36,906
Oh, Shades, now I see you were right.

738
00:53:40,994 --> 00:53:43,747
I like how she thinks.

739
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,415
And who better to broker the deals, hmm?

740
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,460
No. No, I'm out of this.

741
00:53:49,543 --> 00:53:51,880
[Stryker] No... You're in...

742
00:53:53,089 --> 00:53:55,716
way into this...

743
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,386
until I decide otherwise.

744
00:53:59,595 --> 00:54:00,679
Domingo.

745
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:05,059
Sorry about the mess, <i>hermano.</i>

746
00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:09,147
But I have no doubt...

747
00:54:10,148 --> 00:54:11,941
you have people that can clean up.

748
00:54:12,025 --> 00:54:14,068
Why am I still alive, man?

749
00:54:15,779 --> 00:54:18,031
[Stryker] 'Cause no one's coming at me.

750
00:54:19,115 --> 00:54:21,200
They'll ask around, so tell 'em...

751
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:24,788
I'll murderize everything in sight.

752
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:28,792
'Cause I don't care and I won't quit.

753
00:54:29,793 --> 00:54:32,253
You can't bargain with me.

754
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:36,007
You buy or you die.

755
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:40,053
[Stryker sighs]

756
00:54:41,054 --> 00:54:43,264
You think Peter Luger's is still open?

757
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,742
[R&B song playing]

758
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:12,585
[singing]

759
00:55:49,788 --> 00:55:51,332
[inaudible]

760
00:56:01,425 --> 00:56:06,097
That footage of Cage and the cops?
It went viral.

761
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,515
What do you want to do about it?

762
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:10,935
That's great... That's great.

763
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:13,687
He's got nowhere to run now.
We'll find him.

764
00:56:14,898 --> 00:56:17,233
- It's all coming together.
- But there's gonna be a...

765
00:56:17,316 --> 00:56:18,567
Shh!

766
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:21,862
I like this song.

767
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:23,864
[R&B song continues]

768
00:56:41,257 --> 00:56:42,883
[song continues]

769
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:25,718
[Burstein] We were working on creating
this artificial skin for burn victims.

770
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:28,471
We used a process called CRISPR

771
00:57:28,554 --> 00:57:31,849
to fuse the subject's DNA
with another DNA to gain its attributes.

772
00:57:31,933 --> 00:57:34,268
The foreign DNA
was abalone shell, wasn't it?

773
00:57:34,352 --> 00:57:37,021
Uh, yeah.
Where did you do your residency?

774
00:57:38,606 --> 00:57:43,402
145th Street. Um...
and my fellowship in Hell's Kitchen.

775
00:57:45,488 --> 00:57:47,115
Well, you're correct.

776
00:57:47,198 --> 00:57:51,660
We already used abalone to build
better combat equipment for soldiers.

777
00:57:51,744 --> 00:57:55,456
And to genetically enhance
the durability, pliability,

778
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:57,750
and healing properties of human epidermis.

779
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:01,795
Okay, so why are these bullets
penetrating his skin then?

780
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:03,131
Are they dipped in something?

781
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:06,550
Uh, well, perhaps.

782
00:58:06,634 --> 00:58:08,261
But more likely
because of what they were made from.

783
00:58:08,344 --> 00:58:10,888
You see, uh,
abalone is nearly impenetrable, but...

784
00:58:10,972 --> 00:58:11,973
[Claire] Right.

785
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:14,517
...its stacked plates can be pushed apart
under the right circumstances.

786
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,227
[Luke] Like what?

787
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,686
Hey.

788
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:21,565
[stammers] During the experiment,
your skin cells were bonded

789
00:58:21,649 --> 00:58:25,236
with hydrogen covalent bonds
at the exact point of acidity,

790
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:28,656
- temperature and saline concentration...
- English, please.

791
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:32,035
Well, see, I can replicate
exactly the acidity

792
00:58:32,118 --> 00:58:34,412
and the saline portions of the experiment

793
00:58:34,495 --> 00:58:36,664
with the information
that's on the Reva drive that you brought.

794
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:39,750
But the...
the wild card is the temperature.

795
00:58:40,793 --> 00:58:43,296
Because of what Albert Rackham did,
turning up the heat on the bath,

796
00:58:43,379 --> 00:58:47,966
I have no gauge as to the temperature
that catalyzed the experiment.

797
00:58:48,051 --> 00:58:51,720
How are you going
to get this stuff out of me?

798
00:58:51,804 --> 00:58:53,139
Right. Uh... [sighs]

799
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:57,685
Imagine that your skin
works like a form of Velcro,

800
00:58:57,768 --> 00:59:00,354
uh, under a sort of lock and key.

801
00:59:00,438 --> 00:59:03,107
And in order to cut through it,
he's got to weaken the lock and key,

802
00:59:03,191 --> 00:59:05,484
so we can remove the shrapnel.

803
00:59:05,568 --> 00:59:07,528
- How do you plan to do that?
- [Claire sighs]

804
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:10,823
Uh, I'm going to dip your skin
in boiling acid,

805
00:59:10,906 --> 00:59:13,034
and then, uh, remove the shrapnel.

806
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:23,127
What? I've tried it with animals.

807
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:25,046
He's putting me in a rotisserie spit?

808
00:59:26,004 --> 00:59:27,715
Um...

809
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,675
I think he wants to deep fry you...

810
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:33,011
like a turkey.

811
00:59:33,096 --> 00:59:36,099
Now, look, we're only gonna have
a short window to do this, uh,

812
00:59:36,182 --> 00:59:38,184
before your skin closes up again.

813
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:43,397
Just so we're clear,
what could go wrong?

814
00:59:44,565 --> 00:59:47,443
[Burstein] Well, your... your skin
could peel off like wax paper, and, uh,

815
00:59:47,526 --> 00:59:49,862
after about ten seconds,
you'd beg me to put a bullet in your head

816
00:59:49,945 --> 00:59:51,322
because the pain would be so bad.
But your...

817
00:59:52,115 --> 00:59:55,534
your head looks fine, so I... I guess
the bullet would ricochet off your skull.

818
00:59:55,618 --> 00:59:56,994
[Claire sighs]

819
00:59:58,537 --> 01:00:00,456
Sweet Christmas.

820
01:00:13,552 --> 01:00:15,429
If the procedure gets too painful,

821
01:00:15,513 --> 01:00:18,432
just raise your hand in a fist
and I'll shut it down, okay?

822
01:00:18,516 --> 01:00:19,808
Like this?

823
01:00:20,934 --> 01:00:22,728
- Right on.
- [Luke chuckles]

824
01:00:26,064 --> 01:00:27,358
You trust this dude?

825
01:00:28,234 --> 01:00:29,277
Hell no.

826
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,694
[breathing heavily]

827
01:00:30,778 --> 01:00:35,073
If anything happens to me,
if anything goes wrong,

828
01:00:35,158 --> 01:00:37,743
make sure he doesn't keep Reva's data.

829
01:00:37,826 --> 01:00:40,329
It cannot fall into the wrong hands.

830
01:00:40,413 --> 01:00:42,581
I don't care if you have to kill him.

831
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:47,044
I got you. But let's not go there, okay?

832
01:00:47,128 --> 01:00:48,837
I'm serious.

833
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:51,257
- It's too dangerous.
- [sighs]

834
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,552
We can't have guys like me
running around on every corner.

835
01:00:54,635 --> 01:00:56,970
What are you talking about?

836
01:00:57,054 --> 01:00:59,557
There's nobody like you.

837
01:01:04,978 --> 01:01:07,273
All right, let's go.

838
01:01:07,356 --> 01:01:08,899
[Claire] Okay, okay.

839
01:01:16,657 --> 01:01:18,492
[air hissing]

840
01:01:20,578 --> 01:01:23,080
Good? Okay.

841
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:33,257
Good.

842
01:01:41,224 --> 01:01:43,892
[Burstein] Keep your hands clear.
[Claire] Yeah.

843
01:01:43,976 --> 01:01:46,103
[Burstein] All right. Down.

844
01:01:52,235 --> 01:01:53,319
Hang in there.

845
01:01:54,737 --> 01:01:56,280
It's going to be okay.

846
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:58,366
[muffled screaming]

847
01:02:13,005 --> 01:02:15,048
How long do we keep him down?

848
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:19,094
I don't know.
Just have to let the acid do its work.

849
01:02:22,681 --> 01:02:24,642
- Now?
- Not yet.

850
01:02:24,725 --> 01:02:26,184
[muffled screaming continues]

851
01:02:26,269 --> 01:02:28,186
- [beeping rapidly]
- [alarm blaring]

852
01:02:29,938 --> 01:02:31,774
What are you doing?

853
01:02:35,611 --> 01:02:36,987
He's not ready yet.

854
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:41,575
All right. Hold on.

855
01:02:53,128 --> 01:02:54,380
Damn it.

856
01:02:56,173 --> 01:02:57,925
- Dip him again.
- What?

857
01:02:58,008 --> 01:03:00,344
Again! Again!

858
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:06,767
One more.

859
01:03:07,518 --> 01:03:09,812
[muffled screaming]

860
01:03:18,737 --> 01:03:20,489
- [rapid beeping]
- [alarm blaring]

861
01:03:20,573 --> 01:03:22,991
- [Claire] We're losing him.
- It's not working.

862
01:03:23,075 --> 01:03:24,327
[muffled screaming]

863
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:25,494
Why isn't it working?

864
01:03:25,578 --> 01:03:28,372
[Claire] We're losing him!
[Burstein] It's not working!

865
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:30,165
[beeping continues]

866
01:03:30,248 --> 01:03:33,043
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

867
01:03:38,256 --> 01:03:39,257
- [flatlining]
- Shit!
