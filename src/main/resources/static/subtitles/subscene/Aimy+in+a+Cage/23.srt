♫<i> So long, I have waited for so long... </i>♫

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,270
♫<i> Waited for your love to bloom. </i>♫

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:29,080
♫<i> Yet couldn't find the way to your heart. </i>♫

5

The Cage of Love

19
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,090
<i>Episode 23</i>

20
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,960
- Wait for me. <br>- Okay, Boss Jiang.

21
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,960
I know you don't want to see me here.

22
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,030
I will ask you one last time.

23
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,000
Did you harm my father?

24
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:02,050
Aren't you already determined to kick me out of Huzhou?

25
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,170
As long as you tell me that you didn't harm my father,

26
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,770
I will talk to the Governor about this contest.

27
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,600
This way, you and Shao Tian don't have to withdraw from the dyeing industry.

28
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,160
You are that worried about him?

29
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,510
He only lost one round of the contest and he wants be to withdraw from the contest?

30
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,060
What did you take the silk contest as?

31
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,930
Was it to make you happy? Was it a game for you?

32
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,280
You wanted me to take part, I took part. You want me to withdraw and I should withdraw?

33
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,720
Miss Wu.

34
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,700
Don't think too highly of yourself.

35
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,090
Are you hoping that you can force me to use my formula by taking part in this contest?

36
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,430
Stop dreaming.

37
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,980
Fine.

38
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,690
Since you are that confident,

39
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,910
let's see how you are going to win the third round.

40
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,350
If you lose, what I want is

41
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,570
is not as simple as your withdrawal.

42
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,710
After putting in such a high stake, the loser will escape?

43
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,050
It's not that easy.

44
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,960
<i>Wu Cai Hong did so many disadvantageous things to you.</i>

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,570
<i>Why can't you just forget her?</i>

46
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:43,580
<i>As for me, I have always been by your side and you have never noticed me.</i>

47
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,030
Young Master, Miss. You are back.

48
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,030
Young Master, Miss. Please have your tea.

49
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,560
We are now even at the silk contest.

50
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,130
The third round must be a victory.

51
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,150
Brother. What should we do next?

52
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,770
What else can we do except to win.

53
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,090
If Zhou Shao Tian loses,

54
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,190
would Wu Cai Hong leave Huzhou with him?

55
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:38,930
Zhou Shao Tian wants to kick me out of Huzhou so that he can get Wu Cai Hong.

56
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,990
In any case, anyone who goes against me, I will make him pay for it.

57
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,950
What do you mean?

58
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,370
Even if it's Ling Long

59
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,330
or Wu Cai Hong,

60
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,160
Zhou Shao Tian wants them both.

61
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,170
Brother, don't forget that

62
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,100
Wu Cai Hong is Wu Hong Da's...

63
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,200
Don't think too much. I'm only saying that I won't let him have Wu Cai Hong.

64
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,060
I didn't say that I wanted Wu Cai Hong.

65
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,960
I'm very clear that

66
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,940
it's impossible for her and me.

67
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,510
Okay then.

68
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,100
I'm going back.

69
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,590
Why didn't you knock before you came in?

70
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,820
Sorry, Miss. I forgot.

71
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,300
You don't observe the rules at all. Leave now.

72
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,950
Yes, Miss.

73
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,970
She is not even the young mistress of the house or a real lady.

74
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,770
She is only someone who was adopted from the street. What kind of airs is that?

75
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,480
Who knows? She may be the future Young Mistress of this family.

76
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,620
- Our Young Master doesn't have her in his heart. <br>- How do you know?

77
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,660
I can see that Young Master usually treats her very well.

78
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,370
That's because he is very kind.

79
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,970
I heard the women in the kitchen saying that

80
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,720
our Young Master likes Miss Wu Cai Hong.

81
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,130
Furthermore, Miss Wu Cai Hong can't get along with our Miss.

82
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,170
If she were to join our house as the Young Mistress, she may kick her out.

83
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,750
Even she can't be compared to her.

84
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,030
What are you talking about?

85
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,860
You are getting braver and braver.

86
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,080
You dare to badmouth me?

87
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,040
Who taught you to be more and more disobedient?

88
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,710
Get lost now. Don't let me hear you badmouth me again.

89
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,670
Get lost.

90
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,860
Let's leave now.

91
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,290
Boss Zhou. Did I do it right?

92
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,460
Extremely well.

93
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,290
You did extremely well.

94
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,470
I'm leaving then.

95
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:46,970
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

96
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,440
<i>She is not even the Young Mistress of the house nor is she a true lady.</i>

97
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,060
<i>She is only someone who was adopted from the street. What kind of airs is that?</i>

98
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,120
<i>Our Young Master doesn't have her in his heart.</i>

99
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,130
<i>If she <i>Cai Hong</i>were to join our house as the Young Mistress, she may kick her out.</i>

100
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,170
<i>She can't be compared to a real lady.</i>

101
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,160
<i>It can't be that I will really lose Brother one day.</i>

102
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,690
<i>I will lose my family.</i>

103
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,330
<i>I already don't have anything in this world.</i>

104
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,050
<i>This is only what I have left.</i>

105
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,960
Isn't Wu Cai Hong back with you now? Why did you call me here again?

106
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,290
I called you out here to ask a favour from you.

107
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,320
Why would I help my brother's rival?

108
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,900
Unless if you want your brother to be together with Cai Hong.

109
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,380
What do you mean?

110
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,700
You should know very well what I meant.

111
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,960
Don't tell me that you can see that your brother has feelings for Cai Hong.

112
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:44,020
Did you forget about how your brother saved Cai Hong during the Ghost Festival?

113
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,930
If what your brother felt for Cai Hong wasn't love,

114
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,440
why would he risk his life to save someone he has a grudge against?

115
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,070
That's because...

116
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,470
Frankly, I don't really care about the silk contest,

117
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,380
I originally wanted to use this opportunity to defeat your brother.

118
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,660
It won't be that easy.

119
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,240
You are right. It won't be that easy.

120
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,010
Perhaps, this is the only way

121
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,250
for Cai Hong and your brother to never see each other again.

122
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:17,090
It's also only through this way that Cai Hong will slowly forget your brother.

123
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,900
Even though I had a fair contest with your brother twice

124
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:28,380
you know very well that I will lose in the last round.

125
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,620
- Why don't you admit defeat then? <br>- If I lose,

126
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,210
it's fine with me if Rong Da withdraws from Huzhou.

127
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,630
It's just that...

128
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,370
It's just that Cai Hong...

129
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,450
What's wrong with her?

130
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,590
Do you think your brother can give up Cai Hong?

131
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,860
He even resorted to such a tactic as to make Cai Hong his servant.

132
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,940
Do you believe that?

133
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,970
Miss Fang. Does your family lack any servants?

134
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,930
I'm afraid that, this time, he will think of another reason to make Cai Hong stay.

135
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,760
You are wrong.

136
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,390
My brother kept Wu Cai Hong by his side to torment her and let her suffer.

137
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,160
He will never forget the deep grudge between our families.

138
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,910
He has also personally guaranteed that

139
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,000
he will never have any connections with the Wu family again.

140
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,970
Fine. Let's give it a try then.

141
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,970
If I were to win and Ling Long withdraws from the dyeing industry,

142
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,980
this way, you can be with your brother.

143
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,750
But you will wrong your deceased father.

144
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,140
If I lose,

145
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,250
Jiang Yu will definitely take Cai Hong along with him.

146
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,940
I think you don't want these two conclusions.

147
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,180
<i>It's okay if it's Ling Long and Cai Hong too.</i>

148
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,820
<i>Zhou Shao Tian wants both of them.</i>

149
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,690
It won't happen.

150
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,720
Impossible.

151
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,910
I will never let Wu Cai Hong step into the Jiang family again.

152
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,020
Can you be the decision maker?

153
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,790
What do you mean?

154
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,440
Do you think that I'm only just a girl that the Jiang family has adopted and I don't have the right to make decisions?

155
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,580
This is what you mean now. Right?

156
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,030
Miss Fang.

157
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,990
I hope that you can face the reality of the Jiang family.

158
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,280
Yes. What could I do?

159
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,720
As long as it's a fair contest between your brother and I in the final round,

160
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,220
everything will be resolved.

161
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,120
No one needs to leave the dyeing industry in Huzhou.

162
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,070
No one needs to lose any face.

163
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:48,030
When that time comes, I will take Cai Hong far away from here.

164
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,120
I guarantee that your brother will never see her again.

165
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,490
Really?

166
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,740
Yes.

167
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,080
As long as it's a fair contest between your brother and me in the final round.

168
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,950
How can I help you then?

169
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:07,420
I know that Jiang Yu wants to win. For the last round,

170
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,920
he will use his secret formula.

171
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,610
Yes, he has plans to do this. He said that as long as he uses the secret formula, he will definitely win.

172
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,510
Give me the secret formula then. Let me have a fair contest with your brother.

173
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,400
I will then sell Rong Da

174
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,950
and use the money to leave for a distant place with Cai Hong.

175
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,050
We will not appear again.

176
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,090
Miss Fang. You are a smart lady.

177
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,120
I won't trick you.

178
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,730
That secret formula is very important

179
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,980
but no matter how important it is, it can only make money for us, it won't bring us happiness.

180
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,870
When Cai Hong and I leave, you will be able to get Jiang Yu.

181
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,990
You will have a family with warmth.

182
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,960
Will you guarantee that after this contest ends, you will never touch Ling Long

183
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,940
and take Cai Hong far away from here, never appearing again?

184
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,090
I guarantee it.

185
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,890
Where is it?

186
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,030
Brother.

187
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,600
What's wrong?

188
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,540
Nothing.

189
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,120
It's just that...

190
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,330
do you still remember that day when you talked to me about the secret formula?

191
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,210
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

192
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:27,640
Because I heard those people there talking about it as if it was a legend.

193
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,830
Thus, I would like to take a look at it and see what it's like.

194
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,340
Forget it if I can't take a look. I'm not insisting that I should look at it.

195
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,110
No problem.

196
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,020
Come with me.

197
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,970
This is the Jiang family's secret formula?

198
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,730
Then, with this secret formula, we will win for sure, right?

199
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,800
That's right.

200
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,350
That's great. With this secret formula, we will definitely not lose.

201
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,070
We also won't need to withdraw from Huzhou.

202
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,950
Father.

203
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,430
I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.

204
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:20,650
You also don't seem to see Wu Hong Da's family entering the Jiang family.

205
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,140
I don't want to see brother in pain again.

206
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,760
I'm not only doing this for myself

207
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:33,100
but also for brother, for mother and for the security of the Jiang family.

208
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,430
Stop looking, I personally copied it.

209
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:49,060
Jiang Yu will definitely use the secret formula on the day of the contest.

210
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,990
Of course. My brother will never let you defeat Ling Long.

211
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't forget what you promised me.

212
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,200
As long as in the final round,

213
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,950
Jiang Yu uses the secret formula, he will never be able to see Cai Hong again.

214
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,390
Fine.

215
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,240
<i>It is indeed the secret family recipe. I have never seen such a sophisticated process. </i>

216
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,890
<i>Jiang Yu.</i>

217
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,880
<i>Let's see how you are going to overturn this.</i>

218
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,950
Is the secret formula in your hand?

219
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,580
Miss Lu. Why are you here so late in the evening?

220
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:55,760
You are really amazing. Congratulations. Since you have gotten the secret formula,

221
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,530
what do you plan to do next?

222
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:04,970
I already told Fang Fei Fei that Jiang Yu must use his secret formula for the final round.

223
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:10,930
When I first chose to help you, you weren't willing. You are now using this method.

224
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,300
Looks like you have come to your senses.

225
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,170
I'm not like you.

226
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,320
I'm doing this for Cai Hong.

227
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,940
Okay, I know that you are doing this for Cai Hong.

228
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:31,000
You are forcing Jiang Yu to use his secret formula to prove your innocence and also help Cai Hong find the killer.

229
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,680
Since you have already gotten it, give it to me.

230
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,450
I will let you have it after the contest.

231
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,690
- Why? <br>- I already talked to Superintendent Chen.

232
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,720
When Jiang Yu uses the secret formula at the contest, the police will arrest him.

233
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,020
Moreover, this secret formula is very important evidence.

234
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,330
You must remember to use the secret formula during the contest.

235
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,090
We can only win with this.

236
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,610
Didn't you use to advise me how to be so anxious?

237
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,350
Because I'm very worried. I'm worried that if we lose,

238
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,170
we will need to leave Huzhou.

239
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,590
All our hard work here would be over.

240
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,590
In any case, don't worry.

241
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,580
I guarantee that we won't lose.

242
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,890
Let's go.

243
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:50,750
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

244
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,470
Do you think Jiang Yu will use the secret formula?

245
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,910
Do you hope that he will use the secret formula or do you hope that he won't?

246
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,590
If Jiang Yu uses the secret formula, we will have the evidence of the killer.

247
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:18,010
Even if he wins the contest, he will go to jail.

248
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,030
If...

249
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,060
if he doesn't use the secret formula, I will definitely win.

250
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,620
Let's set off.

251
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,000
Brother. Let me see what it is.

252
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,700
It's such an important item. Of course, we should leave it to the last.

253
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:08,030
Brother, I'm your sister and not an outsider. Let me take a look at it.

254
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,890
You will know when the time comes.

255
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,510
Miss Lu. You are here. Why don't I see General Du here today?

256
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,640
He has something going on. He won't be here.

257
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,740
Official matters are more important. Miss Lu, please go upstairs.

258
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,220
- Governor. <br>- Did you buy it?

259
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,050
Yes. I bought $200 for Ling Long.

260
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,450
Okay, you may leave first.

261
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,070
This time, I must win back everything.

262
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:36,550
Everyone. The third round of the contest starts now.

263
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,900
We will invite our only judge for today.

264
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,720
President Mr. Zhang.

265
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,990
Let's give him an applause to welcome him.

266
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,970
What is this contest turning into?

267
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,660
How could there only be one judge?

268
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,520
What do you know? Shut up.

269
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,040
President Mr. Zhang, himself was the one who placed and order before. This is perfect.

270
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,110
He will be personally judging today.

271
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,190
Stop worrying and relax.

272
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,520
Everyone. During the first and second rounds of this contest,

273
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,020
Boss Jiang and Boss Zhou came to a draw.

274
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,920
Thus, this third round will be the most crucial.

275
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,780
Whoever wins, will break the tie.

276
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,700
Also, the winner will also gain

277
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,010
this prestigious Presidential plaque as a gift.

278
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,300
Great!

279
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,120
Mom. This is a gold ingot board.

280
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,610
Whoever wins this, won't have to be afraid that they won't have any business in Huzhou.

281
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,090
But of course.

282
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,370
But they will still have to keep to their earlier words.

283
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,960
Whoever loses,

284
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,130
they must admit defeat and according to the agreed upon rule,

285
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,950
they must withdraw from the dyeing industry of Huzhou.

286
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,570
They must never do any dyeing business in Huzhou again.

287
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,590
They should also never show up within Huzhou again.

288
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,070
Here are the bosses to show off their work.

289
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,290
Great.

290
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,120
Victory to Rong Da!

291
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,230
Cai Hong.

292
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,150
Don't worry.

293
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,200
Rong Da!

294
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,000
You must win, Rong Da!

295
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,350
Rong Da! Victory to Rong Da!

296
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,300
Victory to Rong Da!

297
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:50,000
Rong Da!

298
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,890
<i>This rascal, Zhou Shao Tian,</i>

299
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,120
<i>is really talented.</i>

300
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,720
Mom. This silk piece is really very beautiful.

301
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,100
Of course, I have good taste.

302
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,780
I just know that Shao Tian will definitely win.

303
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,350
Look, I placed my bet on this.

304
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,990
Mom. You gambled again?

305
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,340
It's definitely dyed very well.

306
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,040
No wonder, Wu Hong Da thought that highly of him.

307
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:35,060
Brother. Will we be able to win?

308
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,270
Let's invite Boss Jiang of Ling Long.

309
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,720
Great.

310
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,490
Victory to Ling Long!

311
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,830
Victory!

312
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,970
Excellent.

313
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,380
It's really great!

314
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,920
So, this is the silk dyed using the secret formula.

315
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,930
Great.

316
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,130
It's really great.

317
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,810
<i>This is the cloth. Mom, I finally found it.</i>

318
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,890
<i>It's this piece of cloth.</i>

319
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,970
I need to pay up.

320
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:09,130
Let's invite Mr Zhang to judge the most beautiful cloth.

321
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,980
Everyone, let's give him a warm applause.

322
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,990
Great.

323
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,350
The silk of Huzhou

324
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,640
is definitely a legend.

325
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,940
It's definitely a great piece of silk.

326
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:03,080
Everyone. The result of the silk contest is already very obvious.

327
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,950
Boss Zhou's silk piece has a really good reputation.

328
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,590
It's exquisite technique is centuries old. It is unique to the world.

329
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:18,900
Right now, with the power given to me,

330
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,550
appoint...

331
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:32,960
Ling Long's delicate weaving and dyeing Factory as the winner of the silk contest.

332
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,370
Great!

333
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,900
I'm doomed. My money.

334
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,980
Why are the police here?

335
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:25,110
What happened?

336
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,450
Who are they arresting?

337
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,750
Isn't that Superintendent Zhen?

338
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,150
Stop talking.

339
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,360
What's going on? What has happened?

340
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,900
We have reasons to believe that Jiang Yu is connected to Wu Rong Da's death.

341
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,520
According to gathered evidence,

342
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,320
on the day of Wu Hong Da's incident, he took out his secret formula.

343
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,870
But after the incident, the secret formula went missing.

344
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:55,450
Thus, the reason for today's silk contest was to force Jiang Yu to take out the secret formula.

345
00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:00,710
That piece of cloth that he just took out was definitely created using the secret formula.

346
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,500
It can't be.

347
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,660
Jiang Yu.

348
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,690
Your sister personally handed this secret formula to me.

349
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,870
This certificate is evidence.

350
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,830
All here.

351
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,040
You can't escape.

352
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,850
Zhou Shao Tian, you are a conman. You are a despicable and small minded person.

353
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,740
Brother. It's not like this. You have been framed.

354
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,690
- Brother, listen to my explanation. <br>- Take him away now.

355
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,970
Brother! Don't take away my brother.

356
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,710
Let me go.

357
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,930
It's not like this. Let him go. Brother!

358
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:49,150
It really wasn't like that. Brother!

359
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,330
- Let my brother go. <br>- We should kick him out of the city.

360
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,700
- He is a killer. <br>- Let my brother go. Let me explain.

361
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,280
Great.

362
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,510
Today was a great day.

363
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:39,440
Fortunately, you and Cai Hong thought of a great idea this time.

364
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,820
You forced that rascal Jiang Yu to take out the secret formula.

365
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,040
We also forced the killer out.

366
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,190
I think the police will find him guilty soon.

367
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,500
Thanks for our Old Master's protection, he can finally rest in peace now.

368
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,320
And also, Old Master had good taste.

369
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,450
He chose Shao Tian as his son-in-law.

370
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,160
Not only are you talented, you are good in doing business and are a good person too.

371
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,550
I have nothing bad to say about how you treat Cai Hong.

372
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:15,330
Aunt. You and Cai Yun can continue to live here.

373
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,110
I will take good care of Cai Hong.

374
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:20,250
- Don't worry about Cai Hong and me. <br>- Don't worry.

375
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,020
I definitely won't.

376
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,650
Cai Hong. Did you hear that?

377
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,600
Cai Hong.

378
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,270
- Did you hear that? <br>- Hear what?

379
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,160
I was talking about you and Shao Tian.

380
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,570
Sister, congratulations.

381
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,350
Let's talk about this later.

382
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,320
Cai Hong.

383
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:48,710
Look. She is so thin-skinned.

384
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,730
As for you, find a good time,

385
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,100
bring flowers,

386
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,370
and talk to her nicely.

387
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,940
Thank you, Aunt.

388
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,410
Is this any business of yours? Let's go back to our rooms.

389
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,430
Let's go.

390
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,700
Brother Shao Tian.

391
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:44,780
There is something I wanted to tell you for a long time.

392
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:52,360
You are really a very, very good person

393
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:57,040
but I don't deserve you being so good to me.

394
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,820
Thus...

395
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,170
Cai Hong.

396
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,130
Do you know why I brought you here?

397
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,550
Why?

398
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:13,330
There is a legend about this small place.

399
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:18,580
Once you encounter unhappy events, as long as you circle this once,

400
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,890
all the unhappy things will disappear.

401
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,630
- You believe in this? <br>- Yes, I do.

402
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,510
When I was young and encountered unhappy events, I would circle here.

403
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:33,600
After a long time, it became a habit.

404
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,930
After you have made a circle here, things really got better?

405
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:48,430
Since young until now, I have experienced many unhappy things

406
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,960
that I don't disregard instead overcome them

407
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:58,280
See? Aren't I standing in front of you safe and sound now?

408
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,160
To feel at ease...

409
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,230
Come, give me your hand.

410
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,380
Let's circle it once.

411
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,500
I believe that this will improve your mood.

412
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,860
Give it a try.

413
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,680
You said that after making a circle, everything would go back to the way it was.

414
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,900
Will my heart go back to the way it was too?

415
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,030
Of course.

416
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:48,770
With me here, no matter what happens, I will always be with you.

417
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,980
Everything will go back to the way it was. Your heart will too.

418
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:15,010

419
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,820
Brother. So how?

420
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:30,380
- Are you okay? <br>- I'm fine.

421
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,680
Sorry. I caused you to be in this state.

422
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,090
Don't worry. I will think of a means to get you out.

423
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,380
I didn't kill anyone. Nothing will happen to me.

424
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:47,150
I know you didn't kill anyone. You were framed by Zhou Shao Tian.

425
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:52,150
Blame me for believing in Shao Tian's words. I stole the secret formula

426
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,000
and caused you to be jailed.

427
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,910
Sorry.

428
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,680
I know.

429
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,570
I know you were used by him.

430
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,020
I don't harbour any resentments.

431
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,020
Mr Jiang. Miss Fang told me about your situation.

432
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:16,110
I carefully studied your case. Although the secret formula was in your hands,

433
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:21,570
the police can't prove that whoever has the secret formula is the killer.

434
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,280
This is because of the secret formula that you hold in our hands.

435
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,140
That's why, they think you are the suspect.

436
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,280
Boss Jiang, I'll help you apply for bail as soon as possible.

437
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,860
You will have to suffer for the time being.

438
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,110
Let's do this. Don't get involved in this matter first.

439
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,770
- Why? <br>- Listen carefully to me.

440
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,880
Also, I won't be going back to Ling Long for the next two days.

441
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,910
Help me to take care of the factory. I will be back soon.
