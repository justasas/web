<i>Episode 28</i>

19
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,300
Cai Hong?

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,300
You father really gave you a nice name.

21
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,800
After the storm is gone and all clouds disappear,

22
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,670
you are able to see the rainbow.

23
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,600
Are you comforting me?

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Can everything dissapear

25
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,900
and the sky clear after the rain?

26
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,800
If this is the case,

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,000
once I find Old Cai,

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,600
and save Brother Shao Tian,

29
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,100
the grudge between the Jiang and Wu families,

30
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,940
will it

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
also be lifted?

32
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,500
I will do my best

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,300
to find Old Cai.

34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,200
As long as we can end the grudges between our families,

35
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,600
I will do my best.

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,600
Why are you still not sleeping? You are going to die soon and you are still reflecting?

37
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,800
Forget it. He is going to die the day after.

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,000
Let him do whatever he wants.

39
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,200
<i>Cai Hong,</i>

40
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,000
<i>from far away you share this moment with me.</i>

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,200
<i>I have only two days left.</i>

42
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,100
<i>How could I possibly sleep?</i>

43
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,200
Miss. Zhou, Shao Tian's man, Ma Li is here to see you.

44
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,800
Can he just see her like this? Where is the rule?

45
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,600
Miss. We already taught him a lesson just now,

46
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,000
but he said that he has a very important news to tell you.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,200
Please see him.

48
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,000
Miss.

49
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,000
Aren't you Zhou Shao Tian's confidante?

50
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,600
Why are you looking for me?

51
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,700
Miss Lu.

52
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,400
Ever since my brother was caught,

53
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,100
I haven't been living well.

54
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,000
I would like to follow you.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,510
I would like you to employ me.

56
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,400
You are already beaten in such a state and you still want to follow me?

57
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,600
It's truly touching.

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,400
But I don't lack any staff here.

59
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,800
I already have enough staff.

60
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,200
What I lack is someone who can get things done.

61
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,300
Someone who is smart.

62
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,200
Miss Lu. I have a very important news

63
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,200
which I would like to tell you.

64
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,000
After you have heard me out,

65
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,670
you can consider whether you want to take me in or not.

66
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,700
Speak.

67
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,000
Frankly, I know that you are looking for the secret formula.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,700
I know where it is.

69
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,600
Where is it?

70
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
It's with Old Cai's wife, Madam Lin.

71
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,400
Why should I believe you?

72
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,900
My brother and I grew up together.

73
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,200
I'm his most trusted person. He doesn't hide anything from me.

74
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,400
When he was caught by the police,

75
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,900
my brother went to visit him in jail.

76
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,200
He had a condition for saving him.

77
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,600
That's how he forced Old Cai to reveal the whereabouts of the secret formula.

78
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,600
The secret formula is with Madam Lin but it was a pity that

79
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
before my brother could get it,

80
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,800
he was caught by the police.

81
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,800
Do you know

82
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,500
what will happen to you if you lie to me?

83
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,600
I know.

84
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,200
I wouldn't dare lie to you.

85
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Frankly speaking, if my brother wasn't caught,

86
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,400
I would rather take the knife to my neck,

87
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,200
than ever reveal the whereabouts of the secret formula.

88
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,800
But it's a pity that it's useless for my brother to have the secret formula now.

89
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,200
I want to survive.

90
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,900
Thus, I'm exchanging this news for a way out.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,200
Jiang Yu has been looking for me for the past two days.

92
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,800
He wants to know where the secret formula is.

93
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,300
He promised to give me lots of money

94
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,200
but I didn't tell him about this.

95
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,500
It's because, in the past, I helped my brother to go against him

96
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,300
and did a lot of things.

97
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,600
Even if I were to tell him this,

98
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,000
he would never let me off.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,700
I could only ask you for help.

100
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,700
You are still considered smart.

101
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,000
Miss Lu. You must use this time now.

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,400
With Jiang Yu's slyness, it won't be long

103
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,800
before he finds out that the secret formula is with Madam Lin.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
Zhang Xun.

105
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Take Ma Li out.

106
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,000
Give him some money as he goe.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,600
Thank you, Miss Lu.

108
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,600
Thank you.

109
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,400
Miss. Did you believe what Ma Li just said?

110
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't believe him entirely.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,400
I only believed eighty percent.

112
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,800
We are also not in rush to take any actions. Let's keep watch on Jiang Yu and Wu Cai Hong first.

113
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,400
Miss. Do you really want to retain Ma Li?

114
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,700
Of course not.

115
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,000
This kind of person, he betrayed Zhou Shao Tian today.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,600
He will betray me tomorrow.

117
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,800
What I want is only the information that he's holding.

118
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,700
Uncle Lai.

119
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,600
Find someone to watch Ma Li. Don't let him to see or hear anything.

120
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,300
If not, we might be bitten by him later.

121
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,100
Also, find out the address of Madam Lin as soon as possible.

122
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,030
- Just in case. <br><i>(lit. just for a rainy day - when needed)</i><br>- Yes.

123
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
If you need to order anything, please call me.

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,100
Okay.

125
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,000
Would you like to order something?

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,200
Our homemade snacks are really good.

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,600
We will call you later.

128
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,200
Please have tea first.

129
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,000
Please enjoy.

130
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,200
Miss Lin.

131
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,300
Please sit here.

132
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,200
Waiter.

133
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,600
Please sit.

134
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
What would you like to order?

135
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,800
Miss Lin. What would you like to drink?

136
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,300
No need.

137
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,510
- A pot of Longjing (tea) is good. <br> - Yes.

138
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,000
By the way, why are you looking for me?

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,200
Regarding Old Cai,

140
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,600
you must be very sad and worried.

141
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,100
Frankly, me too.

142
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,400
I asked you here because I would like to get back

143
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,200
the secret formula that Old Cai took from my father.

144
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,600
Secret formula?

145
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I didn't know that Old Cai had this secret formula.

146
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,320
I don't know what you are talking about.

147
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,800
Miss Lin.

148
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,600
This secret formula belonged to my father.

149
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,100
Even more so when my father treated him very well.

150
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,700
Regard this as compensation for his crime.

151
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Miss Wu.

152
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,600
I know that Old Cai

153
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,000
stole the money from Ling Long.

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He was wrong. He has committed a big crime.

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He has wronged the Wu family and Old Master Wu

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,500
but I really didn't know that he had the secret formula.

157
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,200
Thus, even if I really want to give it to you,

158
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't have it.

159
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,100
Since this is the case, I won't insist on it.

160
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,000
But I would like to advise you.

161
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Even if you don't want to do this for Old Cai, you should think for yourself.

162
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,000
The Zhou Shao Tian, who has been taking care of your family,

163
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,200
has already been betrayed.

164
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,300
Have you thought of what you are going to do in the future?

165
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,200
I guarantee that as long as you return the secret formula to me,

166
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,900
you won't have to worry about you and your son's living expenses.

167
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,300
I know what you mean.

168
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,840
I also would like to thank you for thinking on my behalf

169
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,900
but regarding the secret formula, I really don't have it.

170
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
What happened?

171
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,160
I met Miss Lin. She has already gone back

172
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,500
but someone was following me this morning.

173
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,200
Looks like we have hooked Miss Lu.

174
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,300
But Brother Shao Tian will be sentenced to death tomorrow.

175
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,100
What should we do?

176
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,200
It will be my turn to set the stage now.

177
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,600
Watch my performance next.

178
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,000
Your injury...

179
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Is your injury much better?

180
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not big deal. It will be fine soon.

181
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,600
Be careful too.

182
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:35,960
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

183
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Miss!

184
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,600
Miss!

185
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,600
Is there any news?

186
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
I followed Wu Cai Hong and saw her meeting with Madam Lin.

187
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,000
I found out her address.

188
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,400
What did Wu Cai Hong say to her?

189
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,600
I overheard Wu Cai Hong asking her

190
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,400
to hand over Old Cai's secret formula.

191
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,540
Madam Lin didn't admit that she had the secret formula.

192
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,800
Even Wu Cai Hong has gotten in the scene too.

193
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,000
Could the secret formula really be with Madam Lin?

194
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,200
But...

195
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,400
Madam Lin insisted that she didn't know about the secret formula.

196
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,900
Of course, she wouldn't admit it.

197
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,000
If she were to admit it,

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
it would mean that Old Cai could be even more implicated.

199
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm afraid that in the murder's case

200
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,400
he would not be able to escape anymore.

201
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,100
That's right.

202
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,200
Indeed, there are so many connections in this case.

203
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,900
Uncle Lai. Prepare the rickshaw for me.

204
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,400
I'm going to visit Madam Lin.

205
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,500
We must not let Wu Cai Hong and Jiang Yu

206
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,700
snatch it first.

207
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,000
She is here. Keep this now.

208
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,000
Madam Cai. As long as you hand over the secret formula, you can name the price.

209
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,200
Mr Jiang.

210
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,400
I already said many times that

211
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,600
I really don't have the secret formula.

212
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,100
Think about this carefully.

213
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,400
The secret formula is useless to you.

214
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,500
You can't use it to dye textiles nor would you dare to take it out.

215
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,600
As long as you are willing to hand over the secret formula to me,

216
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
I can give you a big sum of money

217
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,600
to let you and your son spend it for the rest of your lives.

218
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,000
You don't have to embarrass me. No matter what you say,

219
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,800
I will still reply the same thing.

220
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,600
I... really don't have the secret formula.

221
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
This is not about money. Old Cai already said that

222
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,800
he wouldn't sell it at any cost.

223
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,700
What I meant is that

224
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,200
Old Cai said that we really don't have the secret formula.

225
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,800
Let's do this then, Mrs Cai.

226
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,300
Reconsider carefully what I just told you.

227
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,380
I will come again tomorrow with the cash.

228
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,500
Miss Lu?

229
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,200
What a coincidence.

230
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,000
What a coincidence.

231
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Madam Cai.

232
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,800
I really hope that you will seriously think about it.

233
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,400
I'm taking my leave.

234
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,000
Miss. You are...

235
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,700
You are Mrs Cai, right? I'm Lu Man.

236
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,000
I also run a dyeing factory.

237
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,400
I'm here for the same thing as that gentleman just now.

238
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,000
I... I really don't have the secret formula. Don't come here anymore.

239
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,400
This is your husband's knotted button, right?

240
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,000
This... You...

241
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Do you get it now?

242
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,200
I'm here not to talk nonsense with you.

243
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,600
I only want to exchange the secret formula with Old Cai.

244
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,200
If you are agreeable, your husband can go home soon.

245
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,100
If you don't,

246
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,950
I guarantee that you will never see him again.

247
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Okay, I will do whatever you want

248
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,930
as long as you don't hurt my husband.

249
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,000
Fine.

250
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
How are you going to make me believe that you are holding the secret formula now?

251
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,000
My husband gave me this textile which was dyed according to the secret formula.

252
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,200
So, the secret formula is really with you.

253
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,700
You caused me to waste so much energy on others?

254
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,000
Give me the secret formula.

255
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,400
Give me the secret formula and I will release Old Cai.

256
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,000
The secret formula is already in my head.

257
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,200
I want to ensure my husband's safety first

258
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,000
before I hand it over to you.

259
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,300
You even know how to talk terms.

260
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,000
Fine.

261
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,600
I will send someone to pick you up tonight

262
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,200
to see your husband.

263
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,900
How is my husband now?

264
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,000
He is fine.

265
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,170
Won't you be seeing him this evening?

266
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,600
Uncle Lai.

267
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,000
Once you have gotten the secret formula,

268
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,900
don't let them live.

269
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,600
I'm not going anymore.

270
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,000
Once the task is completed, bring the secret formula to me.

271
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,000
You must not make any mistake. Understand?

272
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,100
Miss, don't worry.

273
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,600
I will complete everything.

274
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm taking you to see Old Cai.

275
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,300
Let's go.

276
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,400
Dear.

277
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,500
Dear.

278
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,800
Madam Lin. You have seen your husband.

279
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,400
You can hand over the secret formula now.

280
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,800
We don't have the secret formula at all.

281
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,800
How could the secret formula of the Jiang family be with us?

282
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,200
Just because of a piece of secret formula,

283
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,600
you beat my husband into such a state.

284
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,990
Are you humans? I'm going to beat you.

285
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,200
If you don't hand over the secret formula today,

286
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,200
I will send you to see the King of Hades.

287
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,800
The secret formula has never been with us.

288
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,700
Jiang Yu gave me this piece of cloth.

289
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,000
This is all part of the plan by Jiang Yu and the police.

290
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,400
Just wait for the police to catch you.

291
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,690
You beat my husband into this state.

292
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,800
- You will get your retribution. <br> Police!

293
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Don't move!

294
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,800
Men, take cover!

295
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,300
Let's go.

296
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Quick, let's go.

297
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
What now, Doctor? Is he awake?

298
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,600
The patient's injuries are very serious. He has many broken bones.

299
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,800
Not only does he has many injuries, they even cut off three of his fingers.

300
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,000
He has excessive bleeding that was full of infection.

301
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,600
Even though we have already tried our best to do a blood transfusion and patch up his wounds

302
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,400
but when he will he conscious,

303
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
it will depend on God.

304
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,200
His injuries are very severe. You must be mentally prepared.

305
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,400
Okay, doctor. It has been tough for you. Thank you.

306
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,200
It's okay. This is what I should do.

307
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,400
Cai Hong.

308
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,600
Take a break first.

309
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
Old Cai is still unconscious.

310
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,600
If he doesn't regain his consciousness, everything will be too late.

311
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,000
What should we do about Brother Shao Tian? We are running out of time.

312
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,600
We have already tried our best.

313
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,500
We can only depend of Old Cai now.

314
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,100
It's time to eat.

315
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,800
Zhou Shao Tian. This is your last meal.

316
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Director wanted me to prepare some nice food for you.

317
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Once you have eaten, have a good journey.

318
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,000
Do not have any worries.

319
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
If you have any last words, I will help you to relay them.

320
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,600
Even more so when you have known Director Chen for a while.

321
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,200
If there is anything, he will help you to do it.

322
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:47,100
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

323
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,200
Old Cai. Wake up.

324
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,800
What can be so important that you can't wake up.

325
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,200
Brother Shao Tian is running out of time.

326
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,200
- Cai Hong. <br>- Old Cai, please wake up.

327
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,400
I'm begging you, Old Cai.

328
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,600
- I'm begging you. <br>- Old Cai, don't be like this.

329
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,900
Jiang Yu. What should we do? I can't see Brother Shao Tian die this way.

330
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,800
Help me to think of a solution.

331
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,200
If Old Cai doesn't wake up, Brother Shao Tian will really lose his life.

332
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
I'm begging you.

333
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,800
I really don't want him to die.

334
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,600
Old Cai. Did you hear what I said?

335
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,400
I'm begging you to save Brother Shao Tian.

336
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,200
Old Cai.

337
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Wake up, Old Cai.

338
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,000
Old Cai.

339
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,800
Wake up.

340
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,400
<i>No.</i>

341
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,000
<i>I must save Brother Shao Tian.</i>

342
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,400
Hello, Police Chief Li. It's me, Jiang Yu.

343
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,800
It's like this. Old Cai is still in a coma.

344
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,000
Can you postpone Zhou Shao Tian's execution?

345
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,400
I say, Brother Jiang.

346
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,200
Don't make it difficult for me. How can this be possible?

347
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,400
Many reporters and citizens are watching this.

348
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,600
If there is no evidence, we can't suspend the execution of Zhou Shao Tian.

349
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,200
We have no legal authority.

350
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,500
How are we going to face the people of Huzhou?

351
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,120
No.

352
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
Old Cai is the most important witness in this case.

353
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,800
His testimony is extremely important.

354
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,800
It could take weeks (for Old Cai to recover), but Zhou Shao will.

355
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,600
Brother Jiang. Zhou Shao Tian's case has already been closed.

356
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,400
He showed the people with the case that he had no objections.

357
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,200
Do you need to do this?

358
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,500
We really can't just simply reverse the case.

359
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,400
Just because there was a real haste in investigating the case in the past,

360
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,600
there were so many grievances.

361
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
This can't carry on.

362
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,400
What the world needs now is fairness.

363
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,800
Okay, Brother Jiang. It's not that I don't want to help you

364
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,400
but I really can't do anything.

365
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,500
Cai Hong.

366
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,200
Don't be sad.

367
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,600
Ever since I was born,

368
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,200
I have been plagued by poverty.

369
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,800
When I was young,

370
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,300
I personally saw my father killed.

371
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,200
When I grew up, because of revenge,

372
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,900
I bit the bullet. <i>made bad choices</i>

373
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,000
There was no light in my life.

374
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,200
Until I met you.

375
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,300
During the darkness in my life,

376
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,600
you were the rainbow.

377
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,700
I have had you long enough.

378
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,900
Sorry.

379
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,200
I'm apologising on behalf of my father.

380
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
You don't need to apologise.

381
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,300
You are not in the wrong at all.

382
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,000
Cai Hong.

383
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,600
As long as you are willing to believe me,

384
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,900
even if I die, I won't have any regrets.

385
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,000
You won't die.

386
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,500
Do you know that

387
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,300
there still is a word in this world.

388
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,400
It's called a 'miracle.'

389
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,700
Jiang Yu

390
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,400
has already gone to find other evidence.

391
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,700
Perhaps, Old Cai may regain his consciousness.

392
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,600
No need.

393
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,200
Don't let him waste any more time.

394
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,800
Since I have committed a crime,

395
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,700
I don't need any miracles to happen.

396
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,000
Zhou Shao Tian. It's almost time. We should be on the way.

397
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Cai Hong.

398
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You were willing to visit me

399
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,700
and being able to see you,

400
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,300
I don't have any more requests.

401
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,600
At the final moment,

402
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,300
being able to see you,

403
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,190
I feel very blessed.

404
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,200
<i>Kill him!</i>

405
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,600
<i>Kill him!</i>

406
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,800
<i>You cruel and ungrateful thing.</i>

407
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,600
<i>Zhou Shao Tian, you murderer.</i>

408
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,800
<i>Kill him!</i>

409
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,200
<i>Scum!</i>

410
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,800
<i>God has eyes.</i>

411
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,200
<i>Scum! Kill him!</i>

412
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,200
<i>Zhou Shao Tian. How could Huzhou have such a beast like you?</i>

413
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,200
<i>Old Master Wu was so kind to you and you murdered him.</i>

414
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,100
<i>You are really ungrateful!</i>

415
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,300
<i>Ungrateful!</i>

416
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,800
Where is Miss Wu?

417
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,900
She went out and didn't say when she would be back.

418
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,600
Old Cai.

419
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,800
Your wife died while trying to save you.

420
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,000
We can't let those bad people get away.

421
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Wake up now.

422
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,000
<i>Shao Tian. Mom will see you off.</i>

423
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
<i>When I'm gone,</i>

424
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,500
<i>I will look for you and father soon.</i>

425
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,000
<i>Our family will be reunited</i>

426
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,100
<i>and will never separate again.</i>

427
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,000
<i>Shao Tian, don't be afraid.</i>

428
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,800
<i>Mom is here with you.</i>

429
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,800
Sorry, let me through.

430
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,600
Get ready.

431
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,700
- Wait! <br>- Stop!

432
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,500
Executioner. Chief Police Li has issued an order.

433
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,400
Stop the execution of the death penalty on Zhou Shao Tian.

434
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,300
Wait.

435
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,800
He said to stop the execution of the death penalty on Zhou Shao Tian?

436
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,000
Where is Chief Police Li's order?

437
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,700
He told me to verbally tell you.

438
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,600
Sorry. Without his order, we can't do that.

439
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,440
Even more so, who are you?

440
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,200
To add further, even if there is an urgency,

441
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,600
and Chief Police Li wanted to verbally relay the order,

442
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,200
he would't send you here. He would send his subordinate.

443
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,200
This order is faked and made up. Stop interfering.

444
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,000
Human's life depends on it!

445
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,600
You said that I faked his order? If what I said is true,

446
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,400
once you kill him, you won't be able to revive him.

447
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,800
I can't let you just disregard a human life.

448
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,200
You dare to say that the police disregard a human life?

449
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
This is a brave accusation.

450
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,400
Do you know that you are interfering with the police enforcement right now?

451
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,800
I think you must be tired of living. Men!

452
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,200
- Pull her away so her insolent gaze will not disrupt the execution! <br>- Yes!

453
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,500
- Miss. <br>- Don't shoot. I'm telling the truth.

454
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,800
- Retreat. <br> - I'm telling the truth.

455
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,000
Wait!

456
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,200
<i>Zhou Shao Tian was the fiancee of Miss Wu.</i>

457
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,600
Wait!

458
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,800
<i>What is this? Hidden secrets?</i>

459
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,100
<i>She even doesn't want her father because of this man.</i>

460
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,100
This important witness has something to say.

461
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,100
Wait.

462
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,400
What do you have to say?

463
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,200
I can be the witness.

464
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,800
Zhou Shao Tian didn't kill Wu Hong Da.

465
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,900
Don't worry. Chief Police Li's order will be here soon.

466
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,000
Old Cai. Can you speak?

467
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,500
I know that your injuries are very serious but

468
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,600
you are a very important witness to us.

469
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,400
I hope that you will think carefully first before you answer my questions.

470
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,600
Whatever I know,

471
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,000
I will tell you.

472
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,200
On the day of Wu Hong Da's incident,

473
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,600
Zhou Shao Tian said that you were with him at 12 noon.

474
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,200
Is this true?

475
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,000
Yes.

476
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,800
That day, when Boss wanted to talk to me,

477
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,000
I felt that something was wrong.

478
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,800
I went to find Zhou Shao Tian

479
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,400
and wanted to escape with him.

480
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,900
But I didn't imagine that he wouldn't want to leave.

481
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,600
Because of this,

482
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
I quarreled with him.

483
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,700
When it was 12 noon, on the street, I saw

484
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,600
many people running towards Lin Long.

485
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,900
It was very chaotic and they were shouting,

486
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:40,000
"Someone died."

487
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,300
Based on your testimony, Zhou Shao Tian wasn't at the scene.

488
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,100
Yes.

489
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:50,300
But on the day of Old Master's incident,

490
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:55,800
other than me, Zhou Shao Tian and Mr Jiang,

491
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,200
he saw another person.

492
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,830
Who was it?

493
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,000
Who was that person?

494
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,700
I don't know.

495
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,800
It is just that when master answered the phone

496
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,000
he was very polite.

497
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,600
He said that he was waiting for the other party.

498
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,200
I felt that

499
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,900
that person on the phone must be a big shot.

500
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,600
Big shot? So prominent that even Wu Hong Da would treat her politely?

501
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,650
Who would it be?

502
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,400
Old Cai. Do you still remember who kidnapped you?

503
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,200
I didn't see that person clearly.

504
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,000
One of them covered her face.

505
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,300
She even threatened me

506
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,200
to hand over the secret formula.

507
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,400
I only know that she was a young woman.

508
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,000
Young woman?

509
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
Director Chen.

510
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,700
I think we should talk to Zhou Shao Tian.

511
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
<i>At this time,</i>

512
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,510
<i>Zhou Shao Tian should already be dead.</i>

513
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,400
<i>Don't blame me for being cruel.</i>

514
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,600
<i>Blame yourself for loving the wrong person.</i>

515
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,400
Miss. Someone just came with news that Zhou Shao Tian didn't die.

516
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,190
What? How could this be possible?

517
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,400
Leave first.

518
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,800
I heard that Old Cai regained his consciousness.

519
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,900
Jiang Yu brought him to the execution site. Not long after that,

520
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,200
the orders from Chief Police Li arrived.

521
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,000
It said that there was an important witness and testimony.

522
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Now that Zhou Shao's excution was postponed temporarily

523
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
everyone is asking about the real culprit.

524
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,600
Miss.

525
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,800
What should we do now?

526
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,200
Zhou Shao Tian didn't die?

527
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,800
Miss. We should get ready soon.

528
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,200
If the police find out that Zhou Shao Tian didn't kill Wu Hong Da,

529
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,400
they will definitely suspect others.

530
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,600
He said, that on the day of Wu Hong Da's death, he met three people.

531
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,400
They were Jiang Yu, Zhou Shao Tian and Old Cai.

532
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,000
In the past, the police didn't get their testimonies

533
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,200
but it's different now.

534
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,000
If they collect all three testimonies,

535
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
- it wouldn't be advantageous to us... <br>-Enough, don't say anymore!

536
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,300
Uncle Lai. Sorry, I was too anxious just now.

537
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,000
Don't keep this in your heart.

538
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,300
I understand.

539
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,000
Zhou Shao Tian's fate is still undecided.

540
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,800
God is helping him.

541
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,000
Let's not panic.

542
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,990
Even if they suspect us, they can't find any evidence now.

543
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,980
Furthermore, I'm the Military Governor's woman.
