The Cage of Love

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,310
<i>Episode 27</i>

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,200
Zhou Shao Tian.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,980
Do you have anything else to defend yourself with?

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,210
Shao Tian. Say something.

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,390
Didn't you swear to me that by using your father's name that you didn't kill Old Master Wu?

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,120
You didn't kill him. You are not a killer. Say something.

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,990
If you create a scene again, I will kick you out of the court.

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,870
Zhou Shao Tian. Based on the allegations by the police

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,050
the court will conclude the present case.

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,550
Is there anything that you need to explain yourself?

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,700
Zhou Shao Tian. Since you have nothing to say,

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,150
with that, the court will move the case for sentencing.

14
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,190
We will announce the verdict now.

15
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,750
Ling Long's weaving and dyeing factories original owner and Secretary Zhou Shao Tian

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,130
used his position

17
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,350
together with Old Cai, the original Ling Long Treasurer,

18
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,150
embezzled RMB$10 million.

19
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,960
After that, Zhou Shao Tian killed Boss Wu of Ling Long.

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,070
There is very clear evidence,

21
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,170
for the court to sentence Zhou Shao Tian with murder charges

22
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,130
and subject the death sentence three days from now.

23
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,080
Why did he faint? Old Cai!

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,810
- Stay calm.
- What's wrong?

25
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,530
In regards to the Rong Da weaving and dyeing factory and the Wu home,

26
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,190
because Zhao Shao Tian acquired these through illegal means,

27
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,340
the court judgement

28
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,510
is to return everything to the Wu family.

29
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,170
Court dismissed.

30
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,770
We can still save him. Send him the the emergency department of the hospital now.

31
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,160
Don't delay. Go with me to the hospital now.

32
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,660
You both, guard here.

33
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,230
Yes.

34
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,250
<i>Hello. What do you think of your son being a killer?</i>

35
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,320
Don't ask me. I don't know.

36
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,660
<i>Don't leave. Please say a few words.</i>

37
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,950
<i>Please comment.</i>

38
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,240
Stop.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,830
Where is the ambulance?

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,730
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

41
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,090
<i>I really can't believe this. </i>

42
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,690
God finally opened his eyes.

43
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,930
Old Master can rest in peace now.

44
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,940
Mom. Let's go.

45
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,010
<i>I really never imagined this.</i>

46
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,160
May I ask, you are...

47
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,650
We are doctors from Fu Yan hospital. We just received a call from the police.

48
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,750
We heard that someone fainted in court.

49
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,900
We came as fast as we could.

50
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,620
But a doctor already came just now.

51
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,160
- He took the patient away.
- How could this be?

52
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,990
We have limited hospital staff. Another doctor couldn't have come.

53
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,170
-Director.
- What's wrong?

54
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,770
Old Cai has been taken away.

55
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,130
What?

56
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,670
Don't tell anyone. Find him and get him back immediately.

57
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,360
Yes.

58
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,060
Hello.

59
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,550
Boss Jiang. The verdict has been announced.

60
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,290
Zhou Shao Tian has been sentenced to death.

61
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,960
- I get it.
- But Old Cai has been taken away by someone.

62
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,870
<i>Zhou Shao Tian, goodbye.</i>

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,360
Headline! The Wu Hong Da case has finally been solved.

104
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,410
Perfect son-in law receives death penalty! Execution follows in 3 days!

105
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:55,090
- Give me one.
- Headline.

106
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,990
He will sentenced to death in three days.

107
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,600
Miss Wu.

108
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,930
Aunt, please get up now.

109
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,620
I'm begging you. Please help Shao Tian.

110
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,240
- I don't know how to help him.
- Shao Tian would never kill anyone.

111
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,090
I'm begging you. Please help him.

112
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,890
Aunt. You also saw

113
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,010
the statements by others.

114
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,920
The court also found him guilty.

115
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,270
Brother Shao Tian didn't want to defend himself.

116
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,000
I really can't help him.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,760
Shao Tian didn't defend himself. He must have his reasons.

118
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,690
Shao Tian would never kill anyone.

119
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,530
I have something to tell you.

120
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,250
Please let me finish talking first.

121
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,820
Aunt. Let's go in and talk.

122
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,910
Aunt, please sit.

123
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,810
Have some tea.

124
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,860
Aunt. What do you have to say to me?

125
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,080
Miss Wu. The police said that Shao Tian stole Ling Long's money.

126
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,830
I believe this.

127
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,060
Moreover, I knew about it. He planned it for a long time.

128
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,890
There are certain things you may not know.

129
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,410
Ling Long belonged to the Jiang family ten years ago.

130
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,020
I know.

131
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,730
My father framed Old Master Jiang

132
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,200
and closed down Ling Long.

133
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,040
I know that my father caused the death of Old Master Jiang.

134
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,540
But there are certain things that you don't know.

135
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,780
Shao Tian probably didn't tell you.

136
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,990
What is it that I knew nothing about it?

137
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,610
Many years ago,

138
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,120
I was working at Ling Long factory.

139
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,750
Shao Tian's father was very sick.

140
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,280
Fortunately, with Old Master Jiang's help,

141
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,450
we had some money to let my husband see the doctor.

142
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,380
Later, something happened at the factory,

143
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,280
your father had Ling Long searched.

144
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,580
He fired all Ling Long's original workers.

145
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,360
Our family was going to starve to death.

146
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,470
I could only just watch Shao Tian's father

147
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,580
suffer in pain in bed on that day.

148
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,910
We didn't have money to buy medicine.

149
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,030
I didn't have any choice.

150
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,100
It was me who personally used my hands to strangle him to death.

151
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,850
To help him ease the pain.

152
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,160
It was also to let Shao Tian have food and survive.

153
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,020
Shao Tian personally witnessed everything.

154
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,890
Aunt... What you mean is that...

155
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,370
if my father didn't frame Old Master Jiang,

156
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,180
and didn't search Ling Long, you wouldn't have lost your job

157
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,870
and nothing like that would have happened?

158
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,440
No. Miss Wu. I didn't mean that.

159
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,330
I don't blame Old Master Wu.

160
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,060
This is my fate as a poor person.

161
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:08,110
But this matter affected Shao Tian a lot.

162
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,920
Subsequently, your father took over Ling Long.

163
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,410
Shao Tian schemed to get into Ling Long and get close to your father.

164
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:25,950
I think he stole your father's money to make him feel what it was like to be penniless.

165
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,990
But no matter what,

166
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,520
even if he did not kill my father, he fancied the idea to do so.

167
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,070
Shao Tian would never kill anyone, Miss Wu.

168
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:47,000
Shao Tian joined Ling Long to get close to your father as part of his plan for revenge.

169
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,350
But...

170
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,790
he fell in love with you.

171
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,890
He couldn't control it.

172
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,440
This wasn't part of his plan.

173
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,700
All these years, he has been living in pain.

174
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,010
As his mother, I could see that.

175
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,780
I'm not speaking on behalf of my son.

176
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,500
Miss Wu. Think about it.

177
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,920
If he killed Old Master Wu, why didn't he leave then?

178
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,220
It's because he couldn't give up on you.

179
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,020
He would never kill anyone.

180
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,940
Why then, when Brother Shao Tian was in court,

181
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,560
didn't he defend himself?

182
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,010
He didn't even say anything.

183
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:43,910
This must be a misunderstanding. Shao Tian must be in some difficulties.

184
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:51,560
Previously, when Master Jiang brought the fountain pen to my house, I asked him about it.

185
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,970
He swore on his father's name.

186
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,100
He said that he didn't kill anyone.

187
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,770
I believe my son.

188
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:08,040
Miss Wu, don't be so haste in naming Shao as the murderer.

189
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:14,500
Think about his sincerity for you. Think about how good he was to you.

190
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,100
I'm begging you, Miss Wu.

191
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,220
Aunt, please get up now.

192
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,530
What you have said,

193
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,010
I will think carefully about this.

194
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,680
Thanks.

195
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,300
<i>Shao Tian joined Ling Long</i>

196
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,100
<i>to get close to your father. It was part of his plan.</i>

197
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,050
<i>But he fell in love with you.</i>

198
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,570
<i>Furthermore, he couldn't control it.</i>

199
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,200
<i>This wasn't part of his plan.</i>

200
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,460
<i>If he killed Old Master Wu, why didn't he leave then?</i>

201
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,240
<i>He couldn't give up on you.</i>

202
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,110
<i>He would never kill anyone.</i>

203
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,180
<i>He swore on his father's name.</i>

204
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,300
<i>He said that he didn't kill anyone.</i>

205
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,910
<i>I believe my son.</i>

206
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,790
What brings you here?

207
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:48,020
I'm very confused. I don't know how I got here.

208
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:58,060
Aunt Zhou told me a lot of things I didn't know today.

209
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,130
I have not imagined that my father's greed would cause so much tragedy.

210
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,090
What should I do?

211
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,280
What did Aunt Zhou tell you?

212
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,780
Uncle Zhou's death was connected to my father.

213
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,100
It was my father who took away Ling Long and caused Aunt Zhou to lose her job.

214
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,410
Because of this, she didn't have the money for medical fees.

215
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,430
At that time, Brother Shao Tian personally witnessed everything.

216
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,680
His mother strangled his father to death.

217
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,110
So Zhou Shao Tian, all these years, just was taking revenge for his father?

218
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,620
Aunt Zhou said that Brother Shao Tian stole Ling Long's money as part of his plan.

219
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,080
He wanted my father to experience what it was like without any money.

220
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,990
But he didn't kill my father.

221
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,500
I have known Brother Shao Tian for seven or eight years.

222
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,300
I can't accept that he killed my father.

223
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,330
I can't believe it either

224
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,980
but he didn't say anything.

225
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,030
He didn't defend himself himself and he's going to be executed soon.

226
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,750
Jiang Yu. You are very smart. You must have a way to save him.

227
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,050
Please help me to save Brother Shao Tian.

228
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,570
Ever since Old Cai got taken away,

229
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,300
I find that everything feels strange.

230
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,030
Zhou Shao Tian has already been found guilty. Who else would do that?

231
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,450
Who else wanted Old Cai?

232
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,110
I think it's possible that someone wants the secret formula.

233
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,120
They think that the secret formula is still with Old Cai.

234
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,570
I heard from Director Chen that there was someone else who was looking for Old Cai.

235
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,340
If that person is connected to the secret formula,

236
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:16,050
then wouldn't they had something to do with your father's death?

237
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,760
Let's look for Brother Shao Tian and check with him.

238
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,060
Could you go with me?

239
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:49,130
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

240
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,270
Aunt Zhou came to look for me.

241
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,050
She doesn't believe that you are the killer.

242
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:21,040
Brother Shao Tian. I don't believe that you killed my father either.

243
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,220
I would like to hear this personally from you.

244
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,840
The court has already given the verdict.

245
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,120
Do you need to ask again?

246
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,150
You have been with my father for ten years.

247
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,420
How could you have done it?

248
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,040
No matter what,

249
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,150
I still don't believe it.

250
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,190
You are going to die in two days.

251
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,890
Such a refined gentleman as you will probably say there is nothing to be afraid of.

252
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,330
What is there for me to be afraid of?

253
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,410
Since you want me to tell the truth, I would like to ask you something and you should answer truthfully too.

254
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,800
Before we exchange the truths...

255
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,110
I am a dead man walking.

256
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,710
I have nothing to lose. Would you dare?

257
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,700
Why wouldn't I dare?

258
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,980
Fine.

259
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:32,070
Let me ask you then. When Wu Hong Da died, was the secret formula with you?

260
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,790
Give me an honest answer and I will tell you the truth.

261
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,230
You are right.

262
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,910
The real secret formula was with me

263
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,750
but I already burnt it.

264
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,480
So, the secret formula was with you.

265
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,750
Jiang Yu. You are very sly. You tricked so many people.

266
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,820
Wu Hong Da personally gave me the secret formula.

267
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,860
It's not what everyone thought so, that I killed him for it.

268
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,360
Why didn't you tell me then?

269
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,680
You said that you waited 18 years for making the final steps in getting the formula.

270
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,250
Did you lie to me?

271
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:20,330
I did this to flush out the real killer of your father.

272
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,820
The Jiang family's secret formula

273
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,850
is being passed from generation to generation orally.

274
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,390
My father told me it when I was young. It's all in my memory.

275
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,460
And your father sharing the formula with me was the second step.

276
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,120
As for that secret formula, I still had to wait till I was eighteen years old before I could get it.

277
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,390
Okay, it's your turn.

278
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,000
Did you kill Wu Hong Da or not?

279
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,080
I didn't.

280
00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:01,440
I know that I committed a lot of wrong things but I really didn't kill your father.

281
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,030
I didn't do that.

282
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,180
If it wasn't you,

283
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,080
why didn't you deny?

284
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,970
If I denied it, would you believe me?

285
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:16,890
So to say, you took Ling Long's money

286
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:21,240
and used the fountain pen to injure him but you didn't kill him.

287
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,820
- Is this the case?
-Yes.

288
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,730
When Wu Hong Da discovered that his money was transferred out,

289
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,650
he suspected me and Old Cai.

290
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,870
<i>Bye.</i>

291
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,590
<i>Enter.</i>

292
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,020
<i>Boss. You are looking for me?</i>

293
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,640
<i>Explain each and everything to me.</i>

294
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,720
<i>Boss. I...</i>

295
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,570
<i>I only borrowed a bit money for another company.</i>

296
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,390
<i>- As for the other, I really don't know anything about it.
- A bit of money?!</i>

297
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,480
<i>You call the lion share of Lin Long's profit for so many years a bit of money?</i>

298
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,910
<i>You loaned the money out?</i>

299
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,770
<i>Do you know that this will affect Ling Long?</i>

300
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,460
<i>Boss.</i>

301
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,720
<i>I swear that I really don't know anything.</i>

302
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,830
<i>That company said that they were in urgent need of cash and they would give me five percent interest.</i>

303
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,190
<i>I also wanted Ling Long...
- Five percent?</i>

304
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,860
<i>For all those years you have been feeding your private acount! Do you really want me to believe this story?</i>

305
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,740
<i>Let me tell you. This is not a lapse.</i>

306
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,720
<i>It's a conspiracy.</i>

307
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,820
<i>Boss. You must believe me. I have been loyal to you.</i>

308
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,340
<i>You must believe me.</i>

309
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,390
<i>I... I was also tricked by others.</i>

310
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:53,080
<i>Okay, tell me who tricked you then.</i>

311
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,860
<i>Speak.</i>

312
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,370
<i>Boss. Cai Hong said to pick you up and go back together.</i>

313
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,560
<i>I thought you already settled your work.</i>

314
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,080
<i>Go back first.</i>

315
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,930
<i>Wait for me in the office tomorrow morning.</i>

316
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,100
<i>Yes.</i>

317
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,940
<i>Boss. Can we leave now?</i>

318
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,440
<i>I still want to meet a</i>

319
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,990
<i>very important client.</i>

320
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,370
<i>Okay.</i>

321
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,950
<i>Shao Tian.</i>

322
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,790
<i>Don't you have anything else to tell me?</i>

323
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,990
<i>- Boss. Is there still something else?
- Speak now!</i>

324
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,170
<i>Why did you conspire with Old Cai?</i>

325
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,230
<i>and scam Ling Long of its money.</i>

326
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,810
<i>Was I lacking in warmth with you all these years?</i>

327
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,050
<i>Why did you do this?</i>

328
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,340
<i>Speak. Old Cai is an outsider.</i>

329
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,010
<i>I won't find it strange that he did this. As for you,</i>

330
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,490
<i>I have always regarded you as my son.</i>

331
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,290
<i>I regarded you as family.</i>

332
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,430
<i>publicly and secretly.</i>

333
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,190
<i>I already told you many times.</i>

334
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,120
<i>I thought of you as my successor.</i>

335
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,000
<i>Ling Long will be yours sooner or later.</i>

336
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,990
<i>What else are you still unhappy with?</i>

337
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,120
<i>Are you complaining that I have lived too long?</i>

338
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,050
<i>You wanted me to die earlier, right?</i>

339
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,310
<i>Frankly, this is not what you think it is.</i>

340
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,280
<i>Okay. Tell me then. What is it all about?</i>

341
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,960
<i>I will listen to you now. Speak.</i>

342
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,970
<i>You have nothing to say?</i>

343
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,040
<i>God, Zhao Sheng. In vain I have told you many times that growing a business is painstaking.</i>

344
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,170
<i>You still want to marry my daughter now. Dream on!</i>

345
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,550
<i>Okay, if you don't want to talk. Don't say anything at all.</i>

346
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,970
<i>Ungrateful person. Wait here, I'm going to call the police.</i>

347
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,080
<i>Get lost.</i>

348
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,190
<i>Let go.</i>

349
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,380
<i>You...</i>

350
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,050
<i>I'm going to call the police now.</i>

351
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,040
<i>Give it to me.</i>

352
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,430
<i>You ungrateful brat. Why did you do it?</i>

353
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,490
<i>I was forced to do it.</i>

354
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,090
<i>You were forced you to do it?</i>

355
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,520
<i>What do you mean?</i>

356
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,590
<i>You stubborn...</i>

357
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,870
In the midst of the confusion, I used the fountain pen to injure him.

358
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,040
<i>Are you trying to kill me?</i>

359
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,310
In the end, I rushed out

360
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,710
I wounded his shoulder,

361
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,610
but it wasn't life threatening.

362
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,160
I didn't kill him.

363
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,900
Who killed my father then?

364
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,990
When he died,

365
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,490
where were you?

366
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,740
I was with Old Cai. I tried to console him.

367
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,530
He was extremely scared and wanted me to leave with him.

368
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,640
<i>If we don't leave, it will be too late. We will really go to jail.</i>

369
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,910
<i>When I quarreled with the boss, I injured him.</i>

370
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,970
<i>- I didn't want to do that.
- Leave with me then.</i>

371
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,380
<i>Wu Hong Da will never let you off.</i>

372
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,240
<i>No. I must explain to Cai Hong.</i>

373
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,410
<i>If I leave now, I won't be able to explain myself.</i>

374
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,070
<i>I... You are a man.</i>

375
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,040
<i>Why are you so indecisive over a woman?</i>

376
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,910
Cai Hong. You said that when you rushed downstairs,

377
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,990
you heard a noise around Maifu hospital at noon.

378
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,940
At that time,

379
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,370
Old Cai and I heard the alarm too.

380
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:33,290
Looks like only Old Cai can prove your innocence.

381
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:37,030
Hence, what we need to do now is to find Old Cai.

382
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,840
Did you already know who took away Old Cai?

383
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,540
You also figured this out now?

384
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,760
Old Cai has no value on his own.

385
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,600
I suspect now that she is the killer.

386
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,990
That's what I think too.

387
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,960
That person is...

388
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,010
- Lu Man.
- Lu Man.

389
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,340
You are finally conscious.

390
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,910
You... who are you?

391
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,540
Why did you tie me up here?

392
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,650
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

393
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,730
If you know who I am,

394
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,000
do you think you will stay alive?

395
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,420
Okay, I won't ask

396
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,930
but why did you capture me and bring me here?

397
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,310
I brought you here because I wanted to find out where the Jiang family's secret formula is.

398
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,750
As long as you hand over the secret formula, not only will I guarantee your safety,

399
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,610
I can also guarantee that you will live comfortably for the rest of your life.

400
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,080
What secret formula?

401
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,030
I don't know anything about this. I don't have the secret formula.

402
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,700
You are playing dumb with me.

403
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,490
Let me tell you. If you don't hand over the secret formula,

404
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,120
you will die.

405
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,230
Miss. I'm begging you.

406
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,060
I really don't have the secret formula.

407
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,130
Fine.

408
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:29,080
Since I talked to him nicely and he doesn't want to talk,

409
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,660
let him try some of your torture then.

410
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,960
I'd like to see if he will still fool around after being hellishly whipped.

411
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,370
Beat him cruelly.

412
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,510
Miss. I'm begging you.

413
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,850
I'm begging you to let me go.

414
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,720
I really don't have the secret formula.

415
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,810
It's useless even if you beat me to death.

416
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,330
Beat him cruelly.

417
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,510
Beat him until he hands over the secret formula and then contact me.

418
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,970
Yes.

419
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,860
What are you thinking of?

420
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,710
I was thinking of using the secret formula in exchange for Old Cai.

421
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,290
Secret formula?

422
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,960
Are you referring to Jiang family's secret formula?

423
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,380
You are really willing to use it to exchange for Old Cai?

424
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,840
What I mean is to use the secret formula as bait,

425
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,520
to find out where Old Cai is.

426
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,030
But if you hand over the secret formula and Lu Man denies it, Old Cai will die in her hands.

427
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,400
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

428
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,220
Let's find Zhou Shao Tian and think of a solution.

429
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,940
A bad person will know another bad person better.

430
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,680
This plan won't work. Lu Man, that wench,

431
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,370
has gone crazy over the secret formula.

432
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,170
In order to get it, she's capable of doing anything.

433
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:07,970
Let's think together about how we can make Lu Man admit that she is holding Old Cai.

434
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,420
Seek her out at the refuge at her brother's house.

435
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,070
Tell her that the secret formula is with Old Cai's wife.

436
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,850
This is not a bad idea.

437
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,530
If she deals with Madam Lin, Lu Man will be more assured.

438
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,080
Furthermore, if we say that the secret formula is with Madam Lin, it's more believable.

439
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,240
Whether Lu Man will believe this or not,

440
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,980
what happens next will depend on you.

441
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,500
No problem. Leave this to me.

442
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,580
- Young Master.
- Spread this.

443
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,770
Let everyone in Huzhou know that I'm looking for Old Cai's wife's whereabouts.

444
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,390
Yes.

445
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,890
By doing this, you are letting Lu Man believe that the secret formula is with Old Cai's wife.

446
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,490
So how? Did Old Cai hand over the secret formula?

447
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,640
He is still saying that he doesn't have the secret formula

448
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,340
but...

449
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,330
But what?

450
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,700
But Jiang Yu's men are also looking around frantically for Old Cai's wife. We heard about this.

451
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,010
It seems like Old Cai got his hands on the secret formula.

452
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:43,090
Looks like the secret formula is definitely with Old Cai.

453
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,730
Uncle Lai.

454
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,400
Find someone to watch Jiang Yu.

455
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,430
Also, continue to torture Old Cai.

456
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,090
I don't believe that

457
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:59,390
even if he dies, he won't hand over the secret formula.

458
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,020
Yes.

459
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,140
Still not talking?

460
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,580
I'm begging you.

461
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,000
I really don't have the secret formula.

462
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,020
I really don't have the secret formula.

463
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,440
Just kill me.

464
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,020
Stop torturing me.

465
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:29,000
Miss. This rascal has a tight mouth. He still won't hand over the secret formula.

466
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,240
You just said that it's better to be dead, right?

467
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,380
Let me tell you. You are still far away from death.

468
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,450
Even if you want to die, it's not that easy.

469
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:47,710
I will capture your family and slowly torture them.

470
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,780
Thus. before you die, you should think of them first.

471
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,410
No.

472
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:57,910
Miss. I already sent men to find his family.

473
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,060
Finding them is not such a difficult task.

474
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,140
Don't.

475
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,240
I'm begging you. Let my family go.

476
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,320
They really know nothing. I really don't have the secret formula.

477
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,080
If you are worried about your family, hand over the secret formula now.

478
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,530
Don't waste your time with him. Break his limbs.

479
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,440
- See whether he will talk or not.
- Don't!

480
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,080
I'm begging you. I really don't have the secret formula.

481
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,980
I'm begging you to let me go.

482
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,930
Throw water on him to revive him and question him again.

483
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,590
If he still doesn't talk, cut off his limbs.

484
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:41,040
I want to see how high his tolerance level is.

485
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,270
Who's there?

486
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,010
It's me.

487
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,470
Jiang Yu?

488
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,340
Is it convenient to talk?

489
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,140
Come in.

490
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,990
Jiang Yu. It's late in the night. Why are you looking for me?

491
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:16,000
Zhou Shao Tian wanted me to look for you to do him a favour.

492
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,370
My brother will be sentenced to death in two days.

493
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,300
Weren't you behind all this?

494
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,880
He didn't kill anyone.

495
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,990
I know. I don't need you to tell me this.

496
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,380
I looked for you today to prove his innocence.

497
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,520
He has already been sentenced to death. Could there be anything worse than this?

498
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,030
Why would I still need to harm him?

499
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,290
What do you want me to do?

500
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,650
The only one who can prove Zhou Shao Tian's innocence now

501
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,230
is Old Cai but he has been taken away by someone.

502
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,870
Zhou Shao Tian thought of a plan to find Old Cai

503
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,910
but he needs your help.

504
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,980
Okay, I will do it for my brother.

505
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,070
It's really very beautiful.

506
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,110
It's really very beautiful.

507
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:52,520
It's already so late. Why are you still dyeing the textile?

508
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,190
Come here.

509
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,230
Only if we have this textile, Lu Man would then believe that

510
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,980
the real secret formula is with Old Cai's wife.

511
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,670
Brother Shao Tian went against you in the past.

512
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,290
Even while in locked up,

513
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,960
he shied not from lynching you.

514
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,690
Thank you

515
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,990
for helping him this way.

516
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,100
I'm not helping him.

517
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,060
Isn't it the same for you?

518
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:38,100
You clearly know that Zhou Shao Tian stole Ling Long's money and caused it to go bankrupt.

519
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,020
But ultimately, you are still willing to believe him.

520
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,990
All of this happened because of my father's greed.

521
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,420
It was my father who had wronged the Jiang family.

522
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,130
Furthermore, he even harmed Brother Shao Tian's family.

523
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:06,150
The mistakes keep repeating.

524
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,470
The night of the incident,

525
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,260
Brother Shao Tian told me that

526
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,750
if he could start anew,

527
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,020
he doesn't know

528
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,890
if he should go back to the way it was or start anew.

529
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:32,050
I think I finally understand now

530
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,610
how helpless he was

531
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:39,070
and what kind of torment he has suffered everyday.

532
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,070
Blame my father for this.

533
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:51,990
He personally planted a poisonous seed.

534
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:57,530
That's why it grew into a poisonous flower.

535
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,860
And prickly fruit.

536
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,040
Due to the previous generation's race to power,

537
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,970
next generation has to bear the consequences.

538
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,250
Your father may have been wrong

539
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,020
but he had such a good daughter like you.

540
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,380
Your appearance

541
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:28,070
was the greatest gift of god given to him.

542
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,770
I'm not that good as you think I am.
