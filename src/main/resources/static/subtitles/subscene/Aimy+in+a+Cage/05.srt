<i> Episode 5 </i>

20
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,880
I want to tell you,

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,300
regardless if whether you are a heiress or a poor man's daughter,

22
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,850
I will always be with you.

23
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,770
My heart will always be with you.

24
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,980
Thus, I will only leave if you leave. If you stay, I will stay too.

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,460
Cai Hong.

26
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,290
Why are you here?

27
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,890
Why are you two together at night

28
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,490
meeting in this room together?

29
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,580
Spread out. Don't be close together.

30
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,780
Mrs. Wu, I'm sorry. It was thoughtless of me.

31
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,950
Since it is late, I will leave.

32
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,640
Go. Go. Go.

33
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,070
Do you feel better?

34
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,570
Cai Hong, listen to me.

35
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,890
From now on, don't be so close <br> to Zhou Shao Tian.

36
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,610
Our family was rich,

37
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,650
your father let him chase you,

38
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,840
that was because he was nice <br>and could help us.

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,680
He could even be our son-in-law but it's different now.

40
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,150
Look at him, he doesn't have money or power.

41
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,290
You'd better not get so close to him.

42
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,280
I see people distancing themselves from me.

43
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,900
In the past, there were lots men who wanted to the Wu family's son-in-law.

44
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:44,030
But now, only Brother Shao Tian treats me the same as in the past.

45
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:51,940
Aunt. Brother Shao Tian is my most trusted friend.

46
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,740
You are really silly.

47
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,600
How can a man and a woman

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,560
be friends?

49
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,470
I don't believe it, he must want something from you.

50
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,800
Would he really treat you so well unconditionally?

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,860
You should marry a rich guy as you <br> are young and beautiful now.

52
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,600
Your head and face. <i>(are beautiful)</i> Well surprise your aunt

53
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,880
and make the second half of your life better.

54
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,340
Am I right?

55
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,900
What has it got to do with money? Marriage is for life.

56
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,300
Yup.

57
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,270
What you said is true.

58
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,480
It may not be necessarily good if one is rich

59
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,480
but it's definitely not good to be without any money.

60
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,400
Do you know? Think about it.

61
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,340
What we talked about it to you previously, I wonder what are your views.

62
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,050
I'm very sorry. I'm afraid that I have to reject your kind gesture.

63
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,230
Are you not happy with my bringing up the topic of revenge for you?

64
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,420
If so, I can...

65
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,670
No, it's not about money.

66
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,080
Maybe Master Zhou is still reluctant to express his feelings towards the person he loves.

67
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,950
If this is the case, I will offer a leeway for you,

68
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,940
otherwise I would feel sorry for you.

69
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,870
But I cannot bear Master Zhou' talents wasted.

70
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,870
What should I do?

71
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,410
Or let's do it in this way.

72
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,810
I will keep the position for you.

73
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,690
You are welcome to join us any time.

74
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,010
Thank you, Miss Lu, for thinking so highly of me.

75
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,220
I would like to invite you for a meal another day.

76
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,020
Please show me face.

77
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,990
Of course.

78
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,960
I even invited the Mayor of Huzhou so he could personally talk to Mrs Jiang.

79
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,390
She still refused.

80
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,140
Brother, what can I do? Two days have passed.

81
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,170
Whether Ling Long can deliver the goods or not, it will depend on Mrs Jiang.

82
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,970
Can I try?

83
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,890
You?

84
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,030
My brother can't even do it,<br> how can you manage it?

85
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,180
I don't think you forgot that

86
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,940
It was Marshall Zhang who fought for orders.

87
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,030
Okay.

88
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,060
I want to see how you can manage it.

89
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,080
If I can persuade Mrs Jiang,

90
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,340
could you let Uncle Fu stay?

91
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,840
If you can really do it,

92
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,150
I won't ask Uncle Fu to compensate but he will need to leave.

93
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,350
It's because he definitely did something wrong.

94
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,750
If it were you, you also wouldn't

95
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,470
retain someone who betrayed you.

96
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,770
But on the contrary, if you can't do it,

97
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,360
not only will I demand that Uncle Fu compensate,

98
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,980
as for you, you should get lost with him too.

99
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,490
Okay.

100
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:06,090
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

101
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,630
Brother. You are really not going to take me along?

102
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,490
If we want to persuade Mrs Jiang, we may take some time.

103
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,960
If the both of us go,

104
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,060
what if something happens to Mom when she is home and she needs someone to take care of her. What are we going to do?

105
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,690
Okay, come back soon.

106
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,220
I get it, don't worry.

107
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,050
Cai Hong, Cai Hong...

108
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,950
-Shao Tian.<br>-Are you really going with him?

109
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,430
Yes and don't worry about it.

110
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,990
He did not embarrass you, right?

111
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,990
Of course not.

112
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,710
By the way, Brother Shao Tian,

113
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,580
Mrs Jiang is very protective of her flowers. If we were to pluck them,

114
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,950
she definitely won't be happy. Thus, we need to think of a way

115
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,390
to make her heart feel at ease.

116
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,230
Leave this to me. I will think of a way.

117
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,850
Wu Cai Hong.

118
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,030
It is getting dark and you are still flirting.

119
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,910
I am not flirting!

120
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,990
You will find out later.

121
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,860
Be careful.

122
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,430
Let's go!

123
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,960
Sorry, sorry.

124
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,700
I... I... I... didn't

125
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,950
Boatman, hand me a cloth.

126
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,980
Okay, thank you.

127
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,990
I am sorry.

128
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,590
From now on, sit here

129
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,030
and don't move around.

130
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,660
Is anyone here?

131
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,000
Mrs Jiang.

132
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,690
Hello, Mrs Jiang.

133
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,500
Hello, Mrs Jiang.

134
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,150
I am Wu Cai Hong from Ling Long.

135
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,940
I want to talk about something with you.

136
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,670
Mrs Jiang, wait for me.

137
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,020
Mrs Jiang, Mrs Jiang...

138
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,490
Mrs Jiang,

139
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,800
I will be waiting for you here.

140
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,220
I will wait even though you won't come out.

141
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,890
You came out, Mrs Jiang.

142
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,090
-Mrs Jiang, where are you going ?<br>-I don't want to talk to you, I am going to the bathroom .

143
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,040
Then... I will come with you.

144
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,500
How can you come with me? It's only for one person.

145
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,060
-You...Get your hands off.<br> -Can you please talk to me?

146
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,070
Okay, I will. <br>Get your hands off me!

147
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,710
Why are you laughing?

148
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,560
I hate him by his look. Let him go!

149
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,040
Let him go. Otherwise I won't talk to you.

150
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,240
Mrs Jiang, that person

151
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,380
has left.

152
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,680
Don't be so mad.

153
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,990
Did you think about it?

154
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,650
See, we...

155
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,550
Okay, let's just ignore him.

156
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,820
Let's go, Mrs Jiang.

157
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,800
Why didn't he come back?

158
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,690
Are you done?

159
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,530
Yup.

160
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,690
-What? <br> She has agreed.

161
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,780
-How? <br>-Hey! I am telling you that my garden is so huge.

162
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,370
Go to the village and find help to pluck the flowers.

163
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,110
If not, you won't be able to pluck the roses before it gets dark.

164
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,040
Okay. I got it.

165
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,320
Thank you so much! Mrs Jiang.

166
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,090
Aren't you going to look for people?

167
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,490
Oh yeah.

168
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,850
How did you convince Mrs Jiang?

169
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,050
Mrs Jiang planted the rose garden

170
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,280
for her daughter who, as you saw, passed away.

171
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,720
I promised her that even though she is a hundred years old, I will still help her to look after the rose garden.

172
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,220
Thus, she let me pluck them.

173
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,370
So, this is her weak point.

174
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,330
I'm different from you. What you were looking for was her weak points.

175
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,690
As for me , what I looked for was her needs.

176
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,490
Treat others well and their heart bends.

177
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,610
Thus, she also uses her sincerity to handle me.

178
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,890
Cai Hong!

179
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,810
Brother Shao Tian, over here.

180
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,790
Why is he here?

181
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,140
To help us.

182
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,570
Brother Shao Tian.

183
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,340
-Brother Shao Tian. <br> -Yes.

184
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,920
This place is not bad.

185
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,690
I knew that you could do it.

186
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,680
Let me explain things to you.

187
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,480
What is this?

188
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,080
Look.

189
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,630
So how? It looks actually like the real rose, right?

190
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,090
Why are you so smart?

191
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,250
But it must have cost a fair bit of money to buy this.

192
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,330
You should be repairing the house.

193
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,870
- Didn't you spend it all? <br>- What about the money?

194
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,980
I will just put on winter clothes.

195
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,170
This place is so hot and you are still wearing autumn clothes?

196
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,580
Cai Hong. With you by my side, everything is warm.

197
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,890
It's so cold.

198
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,120
Come, let me wipe your perspiration.

199
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,600
Cai Hong.

200
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,900
Mrs Jiang.

201
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,100
Cai Hong. The boatman just came to tell me that all the boats have already left.

202
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,280
I think you won't be able to leave today.

203
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,710
We won't be able to leave? What should we do then?

204
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,290
You will have to suffer tonight

205
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,980
and spend the night at my home.

206
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,800
Don't say that we will suffer.

207
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,890
- We are troubling you. <br>- None at all.

208
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,040
But I only have two rooms.

209
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,840
Let's do it like this. I will give you the room of my daughter, Cai Hong.

210
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,530
You both can stay at the guest room.

211
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,030
So how? Let's go and take a look.

212
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,920
I think

213
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,820
you should sleep on the ground.

214
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,730
Who gives you the right? You are not my boss now.

215
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,610
It's because I snore when I'm asleep.

216
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,900
When I'm asleep, I'm dead to the world.

217
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,110
Don't talk about snoring. I can't even feel the earthquake.

218
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,480
Your thinking is too simple and immature.

219
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,000
When I snore, I'm not like just anyone.

220
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,060
I rank higher than anyone else.

221
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,990
Just don't regret it.

222
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,570
This is really interesting.

223
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,990
Is there any regret medicine in this world?

224
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:42,920
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

225
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,870
Mutant.

226
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,980
It's late. Why aren't you asleep yet?

227
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,890
They say that the stars in the sky

228
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,070
are the eyes of our loved ones.

229
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,600
About my parents,

230
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,080
which pair of eyes are theirs?

231
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,140
Are they watching me?

232
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,480
Regardless of which pair of eyes they are,

233
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,930
you must know that they are looking at you from above

234
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,030
and keeping watch over you.

235
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,020
Cai Hong. You are tired from the long day.

236
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,030
Sleep early.

237
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,150
I still want my parents to watch over me for a while longer.

238
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,070
Okay then.

239
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,750
It is not too late.

240
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,060
I will stay and watch the stars with you.

241
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,870
Hey, Zhou guy.

242
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,510
Why aren't you sleeping?

243
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,460
If you are not going to sleep, I will lock the door.

244
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,350
You have finished talking?

245
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,380
It's good tea.

246
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,120
Take your time drinking it.

247
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,910
Mrs Jiang. Thank you for helping Ling Long.

248
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,910
I'm not helping Ling Long. I'm helping Cai Hong.

249
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,020
Thank you. I will visit you often in the future.

250
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,420
Have a safe journey then.

251
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,430
Bye.

252
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,980
You have so many goods. How are you going to sit?

253
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,240
But we are in a hurry to use the goods.

254
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,900
The boat should be able to take the three of us, right?

255
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,560
Could they bend the rules?

256
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,680
Why is there only one boat?

257
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,920
There is only boat here and that's mine.

258
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,870
Who's getting on board?

259
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,100
We are all getting on board.

260
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,940
This boat can only take two passengers now. You have so much goods.

261
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,100
- I can pay you much. How much do you want?

262
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,720
It's not the problem about money. It's too dangerous.

263
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,950
I think the boss should get on board.

264
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,350
Let's do this instead.

265
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,090
Deliver these goods back for me.

266
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,870
These goods are extremely important to Ling Long.

267
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,450
If Ling Long doesn't have these,

268
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,930
and something happens on the way there,

269
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,620
Cai Hong and I will not take responsibility.

270
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,580
- How will you go back then? <br>- It's getting late.

271
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,730
Cai Hong and I will wait for the next boat. We may need to stay here for the night.

272
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,890
But we are not in a hurry. Boss, please go first.

273
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,670
I was just short of finding

274
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,870
the whereabouts of the large sums of missing money. Then

275
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,710
I will be able to find evidence of the killer then.

276
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,760
What evidence did you find?

277
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,870
I got this from Jiang Yu.

278
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,990
Mister Zhang placed some orders. He gave good feedback.

279
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,380
He was extremely happy.

280
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,030
He also promised to place future orders and

281
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,530
they will come to us.

282
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:17,300
Of course, we were able to overcome our obstacle this time to complete the order.

283
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,190
- This is because of the hard work by the staff. <br>- Boss Jiang.

284
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,750
Cold water, warm water and water. Which kind would you like to drink?

285
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,770
Warm.

286
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,450
It's not hot enough.

287
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,470
I have prepared it so the water can be mixed.

288
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,670
If the temperature is not enough, there is still the cold water.

289
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,030
Boss Jiang. I already wrote this document.

290
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,270
If you still need more, there are still two copies in the office.

291
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,490
Looks like I should be well prepared too.

292
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,960
Continue.

293
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,050
Brother.

294
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,990
- Brother. <br>- What's wrong?

295
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,520
Look at this.

296
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,470
This is missing information. The file contained Ling Long information about the liquidation.

297
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,980
But with our research...

298
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,000
I already knew about this. Don't panic.

299
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,710
This is just a duplicate.

300
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,820
Brother. Wu Cai Hong definitely stole it.

301
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,010
I already said that she's here for an ulterior motive.

302
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,050
She's only trying to find evidence concerning me about Wu Hong Da's death.

303
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,700
Fei Fei.

304
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,390
I remember that was a big sum of money missing from the previous Ling Long.

305
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,530
Help me to investigate where that money went to.

306
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,030
What has that old accounts got to with us?

307
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,610
Why should we bother about this?

308
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,130
Just investigate when I tell you to do so.

309
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,540
But Cai Hong stole the documents.

310
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,650
Enough. If she do anything wrong, I will punish her.

311
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,370
Forget about it.

312
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,940
<i>Could it be that there is Brother has something to do with Wu Hong Da?</i>

313
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,780
<i>He won't do something like that.</i>

314
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,600
<i>He won't.</i>

315
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,100
Are you trying to help me carry some of this stuff because I'm struggling with it?

316
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,440
You are really thick skinned.

317
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,640
I told you before not to even think about playing tricks.

318
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,210
Otherwise you will get into more troubles than you'd be able to handle.

319
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,630
I think the one who is looking for trouble is you instead.

320
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,320
Don't think that by pretending to be pitiful,

321
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,600
others will take pity on you.

322
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,940
Your pretense may trick others but you can't trick me.

323
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,770
You don't need to come with me.

324
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,510
This is the second code of a Secretary.

325
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:06,150
The secretary must be close by.

326
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,510
I already told you that regardless of whether the boss is right or wrong,

327
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,440
you must do what you are told.

328
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,110
- But... <br>- I even said that

329
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,150
if you dare to defy the codes,

330
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,060
I will kick you out immediately.

Nothing.

It's no matter.

341

I'm used to this. Maybe I'll do nothing at all.

<i>Where should I find you? Where do you live? What is your name? </i>

352
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,610
<i>I have never seen such a rude, stingly and mannerless man like you! </i>

353
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,890
<i> I find him very good looking. </i>

354
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,230
<i>You see, he has a strikingly handsome face. </i>

355
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:47,850
<i>He has a Grecian nose, strong brows and bright-eyed, with an uncommon demeanor. </i>

356
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:52,090
<i>No matter how you look at him, he is smoothing to look at, a handsome man. </i>

357
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,630
<i>I already know your name. </i>

358
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,970
<i>It's Jiang Yu. </i>

359
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:21,970
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

360
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,330
I have a dinner party tonight, you do not have to accompany me.

361
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,540
You can knock off work now.

362
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,550
<i>It's after office hours. Let's go.</i>

363
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,690
<i>Let's go and have drinks.</i>

364
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,390
<i>Go home and rest more.</i>

365
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,990
Use mine. I will cut for you.

366
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,670
Thank you very much.

367
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,580
If I didn't have you here now,

368
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,510
I wouldn't be able to eat my steak.

369
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,680
Miss Lu. You are good at joking.

370
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,130
But I'm greedier. Not only do I hope that you will cut my steak for me,

371
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:55,100
but also that you will help me in getting the dyeing factory.

372
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:03,050
I know that you are preoccupied with the issues connected to Ling Long.

373
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:08,420
It may be wishful thinking but I am looking forward to this meal and hopefully you having a change of heart.

374
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,090
Everything is difficult following right after a disaster.

375
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,350
I don't have anyone now and I also don't have many skills.

376
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,270
Even if I don't have someone like you to help me,

377
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:23,040
even a cloud can be a secret ingredient

378
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,790
in the Huzhou weaving and dying business. Even the earth has a seat. <br>(Things out of our control can play a part.)

379
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:34,130
By the way, I heard that Ling Long has a secret recipe.

380
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:38,020
The recipe was provided for royal use. Even you know it too.

381
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,760
I joined Ling Long when I was nineteen years old. I have been with Ling Long for ten years.

382
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,010
I have never heard of any secret recipe.

383
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,930
It could be that the reporters

384
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,540
have spread ridiculous news.

385
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,120
It's okay. Come.

386
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,500
I raise this cup (toast) to you today.

387
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,290
Being able to dine with Miss Lu

388
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,480
who is a beauty,

389
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,830
not everyone would have this honour.

390
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,550
Talking about beauty,

391
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,580
if one has money, one can get anything.

392
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,610
If Mr Zhou were to prosper,

393
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,030
he may get the beauty that has always gotten away.

394
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,420
There are insects there.

395
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,170
Insects!

396
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,440
There are insects.

397
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,540
Open the door.

398
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,370
Open the door.

399
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,900
Because of a Wu Cai Hong, you are suffering at Ling Long. Is this worth it?

400
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,600
Miss Lu. I think you are mistaken.

401
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,780
I, Zhou Shao Tian, don't need to spend 300won to

402
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,950
to drink a cup with Cai Hong.

403
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,920
But women like men who are strong.

404
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,930
Because a strong man can gives security to a woman.

405
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,460
As you know, Jiang Yu was suppressed.

406
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,920
That is not a good thing.

407
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,090
It's only a matter of time before I leave Ling Long.

408
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,990
It's just not now.

409
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:27,880
Then, let's celebrate your early departure.

410
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,500
Madam.

411
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,320
Is Cai Hong here?

412
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,640
You scared me. Why are you here so late in the evening?

413
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,770
You reek of alcohol.

414
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,320
Cai Hong is not back yet.

415
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,670
Where did she go?

416
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,050
For a young and beautiful woman,

417
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,510
it's common for her to dine and chat with her friends after work.

418
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,170
Furthermore, Cai Hong is now working and experiencing life.

419
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,270
She knows what kind of friends are good for her.

420
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,440
Brother Shao Tian. It's late. Are you here to look for sister?

421
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,310
She is not back yet.

422
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,370
Brother Shao Tian.

423
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,880
Again and again, I keep telling him.

424
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,530
- Mom. <br>- He scared me just now.

425
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,910
Two little tigers, two little tigers.

426
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:00,020
Ran so fast. Ran so fast.

427
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,670
One doesn't have a mouth,

428
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,610
one doesn't have ears.

429
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,310
It's really strange.

430
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,060
It's really strange.

431
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,100
Two little tigers.
