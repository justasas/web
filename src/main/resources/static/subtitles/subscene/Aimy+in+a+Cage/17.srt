The Cage of Love

19
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,430
<i>Episode 17</i>

20
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,600
Wu Cai Hong.

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,870
Are you okay? Let me take a look.

22
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,830
I'm fine.

23
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,010
- Let me do it. <br>- Don't tidy up.

24
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,100
Come here, quick.

25
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Does it hurt?

26
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,520
Is it painful?

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,690
I'm fine.

28
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,680
You are still thinking about Zhou Shao Tian.

29
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,890
I don't know what his place in my heart is.

30
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,510
I remember when my father was alive,

31
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,680
our home was filled with visitors.

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,650
My father would always praise Brother Shao Tian,

33
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:37,180
but in my heart, he was just a good friend and like a brother.

34
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,180
When my father passed away, all my relatives and friends

35
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,880
pretended not to know me.

36
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,120
They ignored me too.

37
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,520
I only had Brother Shao Tian. No matter who abandoned us,

38
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,500
he would think of ways to help us.

39
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,970
At that time, I really didn't know what to do.

40
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,640
During that period of time,

41
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,620
if it wasn't for Brother Shao Tian, I don't know how we would have gotten through.

42
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,330
If Brother Shao Tian took the money from Ling Long

43
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,820
and killed my father, then, in this world,

44
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,960
I really don't know who to trust.

45
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,100
Sometimes, you need to face the truth.

46
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,980
By the way, why are you looking for me?

47
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,770
Have you ever seen Zhou Shao Tian's Parker fountain pen?

48
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,970
Why would Brother Shao Tian have a Parker fountain pen? What do you mean?

49
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,590
Never mind.

50
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,950
Mr Jiang. This is the oversea's address of the fountain pen that you wanted.

51
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,320
Thanks.

52
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,460
Don't mention it, Mr Jiang. If you need anything, please let us know. Our shop can also order goods for you.

53
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,220
No need for the time being.

54
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,560
Fei Fei, please see Boss Fu out.

55
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,840
- Okay. <br>- Mr Jiang, I'm taking my leave first.

56
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,920
Bye.

57
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,630
- Hello. <br>- I would like to trouble you.

58
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,130
Please send a telegram to this address.

59
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,030
Okay.

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,170
What is the message of the telegram?

61
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,360
Please keep it short.

62
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,530
Dear Sir or Madam. How are you?

63
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,300
I previously purchased a Parker fountain pen from you.

64
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,450
There is a problem with it now. May I ask if I can use the warranty for repairs?

65
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,430
- Is that all? <br>- Yes.

66
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay. Your name, please.

67
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,630
Zhou Shao Tian.

68
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,950
Zhou Shao Tian.

69
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,920
Why are you day dreaming in front of me instead of working?

70
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,490
I would like to take some time off to go out for a while.

71
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,550
Take time off?

72
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,390
Why are you taking time off when my brother has gone out?

73
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,270
Are you going for a rendezvous and are afraid that my brother will find out?

74
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,550
I will be back soon.

75
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,770
I hope that you never come back ever.

76
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,430
I will be back soon.

77
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,440
Okay, go.

78
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,990
I will take it as I didn't see this

79
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,930
but if my brother were to find out,

80
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,990
and he beats or scolds you, it's your problem then.

81
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,860
Thank you.

82
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,050
Hello, Miss Lu.

83
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,910
Miss Wu. What brings you here?

84
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,180
It's such a surprise. Come, take a seat.

85
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,630
No need.

86
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:56,190
I would like to ask you if Brother Shao Tian borrowed $500,000 from you.

87
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,120
Regarding this matter,

88
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,740
yes, he did.

89
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,910
He said that he used his life in exchange for it. Is this true?

90
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,150
How could you use someone's life in exchange?

91
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:15,770
I'm a business woman. There is nothing that can't be traded with business transactions.

92
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,230
What are you going to use Brother Shao Tian's life for?

93
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:25,280
I don't want Zhou Shao Tian's life but you should know that there is chaos in the military now.

94
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,090
There will always be someone who would trade his life for a task.

95
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,700
Where is he? I want to see him. We will return the money to you.

96
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,800
I'm afraid it's already too late.

97
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,760
He should already be on the way there.

98
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,650
Are you joking with me now?

99
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,530
What did you task him with?

100
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,300
Miss Wu. I think you already read the newspapers.

101
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,540
The Yao Jiangsu and Zhejiang War has already broken out. <i>War between two providences.</i>

102
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,010
The army and Shanghai's army are allies.

103
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,310
Shao Tian is taking cloth on through to the frontline

104
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,620
to give to the General in Shanghai.

105
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,970
Why did you send him there?

106
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:08,240
It's because this is a very important mission. He must not make a mistake. If he doesn't do it well,

107
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,310
Mr Zhou is an important part of the business.

108
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:18,310
Of course, a smart person will not go but there is no one as brave as Zhou Shao Tian.

109
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,810
Zhou Shao Tian is the most suitable person that I know.

110
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,600
Especially, when he needed a big sum of money to buy the house.

111
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,570
Who are you to him? It is like you forced him to go.

112
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,920
I really didn't force him. He went willingly.

113
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,250
He really wanted to buy the house back for you.

114
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,980
Instead you should thank me for helping him fulfill his wish.

115
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,080
I don't need the house.

116
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,130
I don't need him to risk his life either.

117
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:56,300
It's already too late now. The plan is at 12 noon. He should have already left.

118
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,340
Even if Zhou Shao Tian didn't tell you that he's going to the frontline,

119
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,340
it looks like he really loves you very much.

120
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,010
He only doesn't want you to worry.

121
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,940
Frankly, I did ask him why he wanted to buy the house.

122
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,930
He said that it was not just a house.

123
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:29,540
It contains all your childhood memories. It contains the memories of your mother and her garden.

124
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:36,360
Also, when he was nineteen years old,

125
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,110
he saw you for the first time. You were reading a book.

126
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:50,070
<i>It's a pity that there aren't any men in this world who can help me to find my memories that I lost.</i>

127
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,990
<i>Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to this point.</i>

128
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,110
Stepmom!

129
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,030
Stepmom!

130
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,960
Stepmom!

131
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,150
Stepmom!

132
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,870
Coming.

133
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,710
Stepmom!

134
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,090
What's going on? Why are you so anxious? Look at her.

135
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,400
Is Brother Shao Tian still here?

136
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,740
He left after he brought Cai Yun here.

137
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,560
Why would he be here?

138
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,270
Aren't he and his mother staying here?

139
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,620
Isn't he living with his mother at his house?

140
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,730
Why would he be living here?

141
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,890
Cai Hong. You just came back. Why are you leaving so soon?

142
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,740
Brother Shao Tian.

143
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,840
Coming.

144
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,260
- Aunt. <br>- Miss Wu, what brings you here?

145
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,490
Is Brother Shao Tian in?

146
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,450
Miss Wu. Let's go in and talk.

147
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,640
Did Brother Shao Tian already leave?

148
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,510
He left about one and a half hour ago.

149
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,300
He said that he's going on a business trip and will be back in six months.

150
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,850
No need, Aunt.

151
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,920
Brother Shao Tian really left?

152
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,350
Why didn't he tell me?

153
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,010
He did so much for me and I didn't know anything about it.

154
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,190
Miss Wu. Please don't blame him.

155
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:30,160
He has been working night and day ever since he joined Rong Da just to give you a better life.

156
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,480
He didn't tell you about his business trip? It's probably that he's afraid you might worry.

157
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,940
I'm not blaming Brother Shao Tian.

158
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,290
I'm only blaming myself.

159
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,000
Brother Shao Tian is the General Manager of Rong Da

160
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,130
and you are still living here.

161
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,500
He helped me to buy back my home.

162
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,940
It's my fault.

163
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,830
I misjudged Brother Shao Tian.

164
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,950
Miss Wu, don't be sad over this.

165
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,080
Brother Shao Tian and I are used to living here.

166
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,060
He is very sincere about you and thinks on your behalf.

167
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,060
Frankly, I'm very happy.

168
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,380
I was afraid that he would still hold grudges in his heart.

169
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,200
Aunt, what do you mean?

170
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,020
I'm saying that I thought he was being good to you because you came from a rich family

171
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,090
but after having gone through this, I understand now.

172
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,910
Shao Tiao really likes you. I'm very happy.

173
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,890
Aunt, I will visit you another day. I'm going to find Brother Shao Tian.

174
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,590
Foolish child. Shao Tian already left one and a half hours ago.

175
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,960
He has already left the city gate. How are you going to find him?

176
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,040
Aunt, don't worry. Regardless of where he went, I will look for him.

177
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,430
<i>Brother Shao Tian,</i>

178
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,420
<i>sorry.</i>

179
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,510
<i>It's my fault.</i>

180
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:23,780
<i>You treated me so well and I still suspected you.</i>

181
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:51,900
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

182
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,170
Why are you standing alone here?

183
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,430
Are you trying to slack off from work?

184
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,350
I made a mistake about Brother Shao Tian.

185
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,780
What did he tell you?

186
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,310
Lu Man lent him money. Brother Shao Tian went to Shanghai to give the General clothes.

187
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,090
but

188
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:31,020
he needs to deliver it through the Jiangsu and Zhejiang blockage. <i>Battlefield</i>

189
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,900
It will be very dangerous.

190
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,190
If Brother Shao Tian

191
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,290
gets into trouble...

192
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,980
My... my life will be condemned.

193
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,930
It's my fault.

194
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,000
I blamed him by mistake.

195
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,940
He has been totally sincere about me.

196
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,060
I heard that you didn't eat anything for the entire night.

197
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,020
Here.

198
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,490
Eat something now.

199
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,960
Thank you. I don't have an appetite.

200
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:01,790
Do you know that your form of self-abuse will cause my family problems?

201
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,020
Is he that important to you?

202
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:38,270
Mr Zhou. We will be able to reach your home in two or three days.

203
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,310
Row faster. It should take us about two days.

204
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,440
Boatman, can you speed up?

205
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,700
This is already very fast, Second Master. I'm more anxious than you. This place is very chaotic.

206
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,630
Bullets could fly past. If I didn't need to support my family, who would want to come here to do this business?

207
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,550
Look. Do you see any other boats here?

208
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:02,300
This place is very dangerous. Others wouldn't want to come here but why you?

209
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,070
Mr Zhou. I won't hide from you. No one wants to take on such a dangerous task

210
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,670
but I'm not doing this because they paid me double.

211
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,420
My mom is sick and she is waiting for my money to see the doctor.

212
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,950
I wonder if my mom is feeling better.

213
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,130
Take this money. The money that you received in double is not that much.

214
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:32,410
Use this money to take your mom to the doctor. Don't take on such a dangerous task in the future. Stay home and look after your mom.

215
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,330
Mr Zhou. I can't take this money.

216
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,720
Life is hard for everyone.

217
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,660
If it wasn't, you wouldn't be undertaking in this dangerous task either.

218
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,310
Listen to me. Take the money.

219
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,250
I'm also here because of someone very important.

220
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,990
Your parents are still alive. Grasp the opportunity to show filial piety (to them).

221
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,760
Don't regret it when they're gone.

222
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,330
You will suffer and regret it.

223
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,620
Wu Cai Hong. What do you want to do?

224
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:31,730
Brother Shao Tian must be lacking in food by now.

225
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,810
He could also be injured.

226
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,860
Why do you always expect the worst?

227
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,070
The day Brother Shao Tian lit up paper latterns,

228
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,780
why didn't I give him a chance to explain?

229
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,070
He waited for me the entire night that day.

230
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:09,030
At that time, was he in the same mood as I am now?

231
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,930
Listen carefully to me.

232
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,830
You are the servant of the Jiang family. I'm ordering you to eat, drink and sleep

233
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,900
and do your work properly.

234
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,010
Boatman, row faster.

235
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,820
Okay.

236
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,500
Let me take a look. Mr Zhou, you hand is injured.

237
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,340
I'm fine. Boatman, row faster!

238
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,060
- Quick. <br>- Okay.

239
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,500
Miss. Zhou Shao Tian is back.

240
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,810
Did he complete his task?

241
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,280
Yes.

242
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,670
This Zhou Shao Tian didn't disappoint me.

243
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:21,030
Mr Wu is very satisfied, Miss. He said it went well during a critical time.

244
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,080
Where is Zhou Shao Tian? Why didn't he find me when he' returned?

245
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,320
He is injured.

246
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,450
Thus, I sent men to take him to the hospital.

247
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,700
Is his injury serious?

248
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,380
This won't do. Uncle Lai, get the rickshaw ready. I'm going to the hospital to see him.

249
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,000
Miss. Are you worried about Zhou Shao Tian?

250
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,140
I'm not worried about him.

251
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,980
If I retain this person, he will be able to do other tasks for me in the future.

252
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:57,930
Uncle Lai. Can you find someone to deliver a letter to Wu Cai Hong?

253
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,250
Since Zhou Shao Tian is in this condition,

254
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,340
I think he would want to see Wu Cai Hong very much.

255
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,340
He did such a big favour for me. I should be happy on his behalf.

256
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,990
Okay, I will do it immediately.

257
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,550
Shao Tian, how are you feeling?

258
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,770
I heard that you were injured and I rushed here.

259
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,780
Doctor, how is his injury?

260
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,280
Provide me with the best medicines. Don't cut any costs.

261
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,570
-Alright. <br>Mr. Zhou's injuries are all exterior but it's a bit deep.

262
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,570
Also, he came a bit late.

263
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,200
But Miss Lu, don't worry. I gave the best medicines to Mr Zhou.

264
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,340
Thank you, Doctor.

265
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,370
Shao Tian, how are you feeling now? Does it still hurt?

266
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,740
You really helped me with a big task. I didn't misjudge you.

267
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,250
Looks like I should thank you well.

268
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,050
I'm going out first. Call me if there is anything.

269
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,480
Have a good rest.

270
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,090
- Thank you. <br>- Thank you, Doctor.

271
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:23,050
Ms. Lu gave me such a big task. I practically lost my life.

272
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:30,090
I knew Manager Zhou is full of tricks so I knew you would make it.

273
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:35,130
Look, didn't you come back safe and sound?

274
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,640
I think you intentionally sent me to seek death.

275
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,100
If I died, you would have benefited the most. Rong Da would have belonged to you.

276
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,450
Who do you take me for?

277
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,890
I have no interest in your petty Rong Da.

278
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,080
What I want is Ling Long's secret formula.

279
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,980
Enough. Didn't you come back safely?

280
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,970
Moreover, your efforts were not wasted.

281
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,080
I already sent someone to ask Miss Wu to come here.

282
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,090
Your lover was crying as if the world had ended so of course, she will come.

283
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,520
Will Cai Hong really come?

284
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,690
She'll definitely come. You can count on it.

285
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:31,760
Not long after you left, she came to ask me if I really lent you the money.

286
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,720
What did you reply to her?

287
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,370
Of course, I said a lot of good things about you.

288
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,430
Talked about your love, even the gods would be shaking.

289
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,890
I have a good gut feeling about Cai Hong.

290
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,160
You don't need to tell me about your gut feelings.

291
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,730
Okay, I talked too much.

292
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,550
But this time,

293
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,650
you really escaped death.

294
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:56,130
One must not play with fate.

295
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,030
Was it worth it?

296
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,070
It's worth it as long as she's happy.

297
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,950
Brother Shao Tian.

298
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,580
Brother Shao Tian.

299
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,650
Miss Lu.

300
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,000
Okay. Seeing that you are alive, I don't have to worry anymore.

301
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,580
I'm leaving first,

302
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,870
so as to not disturb you two.

303
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,770
Brother Shao Tian.

304
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,010
What's wrong with your hand?

305
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,660
Is it serious? Why are you in this condition?

306
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,790
You went to the frontline without even telling me.

307
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,270
Did you know that I was worried about you every day?

308
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,080
I was afraid that you would be hurt and wouldn't be able to eat properly. You are still smiling?

309
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,370
Can't you see that I'm fine?

310
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,240
Cai Hong, it's no big deal. Seriously.

311
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,950
Aren't I back now?

312
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,650
Let me ask you.

313
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,960
Do you still blame me?

314
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,120
It's my fault.

315
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,270
I shouldn't have suspected you.

316
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,960
I would like to apologise to you. Will you forgive me?

317
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,440
I don't blame you at all.

318
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,940
Being able to come back safely and see you, I'm already very happy.

319
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,380
Promise me then.

320
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,060
Promise me that you won't do such foolish things again.

321
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:39,930
It's not important whether I get back my home or not. I only want you to be safe.

322
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,940
I already lost my father.

323
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,940
I don't want to lose you either.

324
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,490
I promise you that I will never ever leave you.

325
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,000
Promise me too, okay?

326
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,740
Trust me.

327
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,940
We will forever be together.

328
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,070
I promise you.

329
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,080
The doctor told me just now that

330
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,330
I can be discharged early.

331
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,370
I will take you home.

332
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,140
You can really be discharged?

333
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,570
Of course, I can.

334
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,340
Think about it. My mom hasn't seen me for a long time. She must have missed me like crazy.

335
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,900
Moreover, if she sees me taking you home, she will be extremely happy.

336
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,270
I'm back.

337
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,350
Shao Tian is back?

338
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,690
Miss Wu is also here?

339
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,230
Shao Tian, what's wrong with you?

340
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,340
- It's nothing major. <br>- Why are you injured?

341
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,400
Aren't I back safe and sound? Don't kick up a big fuss.

342
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,790
No. How could you be injured on a business trip?

343
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,790
Did you fight with someone?

344
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:06,790
I helped Rong Da send the General cloth. While traveling through the blockade, we were shot at.

345
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:11,450
Are you crazy? You want money instead of your life? It was such a dangerous task and you still dared to do it.

346
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,130
Aunt, please don't blame Brother Shao Tian.

347
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,310
He did this for me,

348
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,670
but he already promised me that he will never leave me again.

349
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,950
He also swore that he wouldn't do any more dangerous tasks in the future.

350
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,120
I already swore to Cai Hong that

351
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,760
I won't do any dangerous tasks again in the future.

352
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,180
But I did it for money this time.

353
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,970
It's so that you will have a daughter-in-law and grandchildren soon.

354
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,780
Really?

355
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,760
But my words don't count. Cai Hong still needs to nod her head.

356
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:54,470
Miss Wu. Will you nod your head or not?

357
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,330
Excellent.

358
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,720
I have been waiting for this day.

359
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,580
Stay here for a meal. I'm going to prepare it now.

360
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,940
Let's go in.

361
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,910
You don't need to see me off.

362
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,190
You are still injured. Stay home and have a good rest.

363
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:37,720
Look, my wrist's injury is not that bad. <br>Let me take you home.

364
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,940
Brother Shao, don't worry.

365
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,520
I will come again if I have the time.

366
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,860
Okay, be careful on the way home.

367
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,690
Shao Tian. I can tell that Miss Wu is a good girl.

368
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,520
There are certain things that can't be bought in the world.

369
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,990
You must treasure her.

370
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,340
Sorry for coming back late.

371
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,180
Is Zhou Shao Tian back?

372
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,860
He went to the frontline to deliver cloth?

373
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:24,700
He did this to buy back my home. He almost lost his life.

374
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,090
I made a mistake about him.

375
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,330
Looks like his plan really worked.

376
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,890
You are not allowed to say that about Brother Shao Tian.

377
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:39,240
Also, stay out of my business.

378
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,020
I don't want anyone to ruin our relationship.

379
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,320
I really want to find out the truth.

380
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,180
I swear that I will not suspect Brother Shao Tian again.

381
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,790
I will believe every single word that he says.

382
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,050
I already told you not to get involved.

383
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,740
So what? Nothing comes out of doing good deeds, right?

384
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:28,990
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

385
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,580
<i>You are allowed to say that about Brother Shao Tian. Stay out of my business too.</i>

386
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,080
<i>I don't want anyone to ruin our relationship.</i>

387
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,860
Brother.

388
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,710
What were you thinking about that caused you to look so captivated?

389
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,470
What's wrong?

390
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,740
This is for you.

391
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,070
It seems to be a telegram from overseas.

392
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:18,030
<i>Dear Mr Zhou Shao Tian, the Parker pen that you bought from us on April 1923</i>

393
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,310
<i>is a luxurious item so it's under a lifetime guarantee.</i>

394
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:27,040
<i>If there are any issues, you can send the item back.</i>

395
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,410
Brother. Isn't this telegram for Zhou Shao Tian?

396
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:36,970
Why is it addressed to you at this place?

397
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,260
Where are you going?

398
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,800
I'm going to find Brother Shao Tian. I already completed my tasks for today.

399
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,980
- Moreover, I already... <br>- Fine, I will go with you to see him.

400
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:04,930
Even though I'm your maid, regarding the matters between Brother Shao Tian and I, you can't get involved.

401
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,720
Wait until you read this

402
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,380
and see if you still believe Brother Shao Tian.

403
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,340
But I won't look at it.

404
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,350
No matter what you say, I will always trust Brother Shao Tian.

405
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,160
He has another Parker pen from America after your father passed away.

406
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,470
Read it.

407
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,330
<i>Leave this task to me.</i>

408
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:08,320
<i>I will order the same pen for your father's birthday.</i>

409
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,810
<i>It's a Parker pen.</i>

410
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,520
Impossible.

411
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,160
Brother Shao Tian would never do this.

412
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,420
I'm going to ask him.

413
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,070
Coming.

414
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,080
Miss Wu.

415
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,760
- Aunt. <br>- Young Master Shao?

416
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,040
- Aunt. <br>- Why are the both of you together?

417
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,280
Is Brother Shao Tian in?

418
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,720
Please come in and talk about this.

419
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,970
It's like this. I have something important to ask Brother Shao Tian.

420
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,610
Shao Tian went out.

421
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:55,380
He has been nursing his injuries for half a month. If you didn't visit him often, he would have gone back to work.

422
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,850
He came back to say that he's leaving on a business trip and won't be back today.

423
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,840
Aunt.

424
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,260
I would like to know if Brother Shao Tian owns a Parker Pen.

425
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,190
Parker pen?

426
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:12,380
Yes.

427
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,020
It's exactly the same as this.

428
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,840
It seems so. Yes, I saw him bringing out a fountain pen.

429
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,420
He was very careful about it.

430
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,720
He ordered it from overseas.

431
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,340
Do you know roughly when?

432
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,990
Yes.

433
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,420
It was on the day when the incident happened to Old Master Wu.

434
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,640
I'm old.

435
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,390
I can't remember things

436
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,380
but it just so happens that it was on the day of your father's incident.

437
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,820
Thus, I could still remember it.

438
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:57,350
How could that be? Why would Brother Shao Tian own the same pen?

439
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,710
I'm going to ask him.

440
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,330
Miss Wu.

441
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,540
Young Master Jiang, what's going on?

442
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,940
What's wrong with Shao Tian?

443
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,990
Aunt. Regarding this, it's better that you ask him yourself.

444
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,120
When I was fifteen years old,

445
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,370
when my mother had a stroke, I was reading a book.

446
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:14,880
Even when her temperament wasn't good,

447
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,830
I would take care of her diligently every day.

448
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,950
I was afraid that every single word and action would make her angry.

449
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,450
No matter what, I would tread carefully around her

450
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,550
but she was still afraid that she would exhaust me.

451
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,060
She left me.

452
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,960
It wasn't easy for me to accept my mom's death.

453
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:55,870
Now, I need to face my father's death.

454
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,100
I don't know who harmed my father.

455
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,420
During that short period of time,

456
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,590
Brother Shao Tian was with me.

457
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,150
He comforted me.

458
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:16,420
I thought that I would be able to rely on him forever

459
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,490
but now, I suspect that Brother Shao Tian

460
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:26,150
is my father's killer.

461
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,390
I don't know why he did that.

462
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,560
There are certain things that will sound cruel when I speak about it, but I still think

463
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,030
you need to know. In fact, you should think seriously about it.

464
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:53,640
Do you really think that Zhou Shao Tian's life is worth that much money?

465
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,540
Was it really worth Miss Lu paying such a high price just to tell him to complete a mission?

466
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,220
Don't you find it very strange?

467
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:07,650
But if his money is from Ling Long,

468
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,350
it becomes a different matter of course.

469
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,820
You are too cruel!

470
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,350
Why do you want me to believe that the only person who I trust is the killer of my father?

471
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,540
I don't believe it.

472
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,580
I don't believe it.

473
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,190
Come in.

474
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,110
Director Chen Suo.

475
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,810
This is the reply from the overseas office of the Parker pen.

476
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,780
It clearly proves that

477
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:56,690
prior to Wu Hong's death, Zhou Shao Tian purchased a Parker pen and it

478
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,710
is exactly the same as mine.

479
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:04,320
This telegram contains really important information and it's compelling evidence.

480
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:10,560
Shi Jie. Since there is new evidence, do your best to break this case.

481
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,320
Give Mr Jiang and Miss Wu an explanation as soon as possible.

482
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,720
Yes.

483
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:22,360
Mr Jiang, Miss Wu, Director Chen will take care of the matter.

484
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,290
Don't be too anxious,

485
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:29,540
but Wu Hong Da's case was a long time ago.

486
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:34,570
The longer the timeframe, the higher possibility that someone tampered with the evidence.

487
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,940
To add further, his injury wasn't from a fountain pen.

488
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,940
A fountain pen doesn't prove that he committed a crime.

489
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,480
Miss Wu, me saying this is not me pushing the blame

490
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,640
on the relationship between you and Zhou Shao Tian. I will not give you the reason of the law to fight.

491
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,330
But don't you worry, the police will not let go of anyone. If it's really Zhou Shao Tian's doing,

492
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,980
he will be dealt with accordingly.

493
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,060
Okay, we know.

494
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,330
<i>Shi Jie. <br>- Superintendent Ting.</i>

495
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,980
I will let you be responsible for this case.

496
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,460
If you face any difficulties, report to me and I will give you my utmost support.

497
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,900
I hope that you can break the case soon and give them an explanation.

498
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,270
Yes.

499
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,900
Cai Hong, don't worry.

500
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,020
I will definitely give your father in heaven an explanation.
