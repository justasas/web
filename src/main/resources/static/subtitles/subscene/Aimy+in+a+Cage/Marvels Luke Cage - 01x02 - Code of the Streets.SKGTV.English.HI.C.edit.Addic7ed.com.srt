1
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,902
- [breathes deeply]
- [man] What are you doing here, nigga?

2
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,078
I'm not gonna ask you again.

3
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,458
Young man...

4
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,128
I've had a long day.

5
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,339
I'm tired.

6
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:50,426
But I'm not tired enough...

7
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,845
to ever let nobody call me that word.

8
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,518
You see a nigga standin' in
front of you? [breathing heavily]

9
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,146
Across the street from a building named
after one of our greatest heroes?

10
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,150
- [gun cocks]
- Yeah, a dead one.

11
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,527
[Luke exhales]

12
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,280
[theme music playing]

14
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,896
[gunshots]

15
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,776
[gunshot]

16
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,095
[Scarfe] You're doing it
again. I hate it when you do that.

17
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,182
Hate it when I do what?

18
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,310
Stare at the photos like
they're about to start moving.

19
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,437
They are talkin' and movin'.

20
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,916
You just have to be still
enough to hear what they're sayin'.

21
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,524
Whatever, Horton.

22
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,321
A clue is a clue, no matter how small.

23
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,448
This was deeply personal.

24
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,492
Well, money invites the beast.

25
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,490
There's nothing in Chico's jacket

26
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,122
to suggest he was
capable of that type of violence.

27
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,249
I don't think he has the stomach for it.

28
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,920
Stomach? [sighs]

29
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,798
There was vomit found at the junkyard.

30
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,884
Inside it were fibers consistent
with that of a winter mask.

31
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,387
One of the robbers didn't have
the heart to go through with it.

32
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,265
My guess, it was babyface Chico.

33
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,729
Uh, he was the last man standing.

34
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,690
You mean to tell me Benjamin
Franklin was wrong?

35
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,902
Well, in this case, it was all
about the Benjamins either way.

36
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,696
[scoffs] Always is.

37
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,907
Somebody got jacked, and
somebody got pissed...

38
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,909
And somebody got dead.

39
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,203
This ain't over yet.

40
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,720
Eh, I just never got into Donald Goines.

41
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,096
[chuckling] Are you crazy?

42
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,892
Donald Goines was a street poet.

43
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,394
- [Pop chuckles]
- [Luke] I didn't say Goines isn't.

44
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,898
But Walter Mosley, George
Pelecanos? [clicks tongues] Boom.

45
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,066
I bet you're into Richard Price.

46
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,610
I dig Price.

47
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,194
Dennis Lehane, too.

48
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,447
What about Chester Himes?

49
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,158
Without question.

50
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,077
[clears throat] My biggest
beef with Donald Goines

51
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,955
is that he wrote about
criminals and he died like one.

52
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,918
[chuckles] You don't have
to get all Fox News about it.

53
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,294
[Pop chuckling]

54
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,587
Goines invented Kenyatta,

55
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,049
the best black hero this side of Shaft.

56
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,860
- [customer] Thank you, my brother.
- All right.

57
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,303
- Keep that magic touch.
- I'll keep working on it.

58
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,554
See you next week, Victor.

59
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,891
So you're saying Kenyatta
is better than Easy Rawlins?

60
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,392
I ain't saying all that.

61
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,437
I'm just saying Kenyatta's my favorite.

62
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,899
He took the fight to the man...

63
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,194
in the streets by his self.

64
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,447
Just like somebody else
could if he wasn't sweeping hair

65
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,490
and washing dishes.

66
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,534
[sighs] Don't start, Pop.

67
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,206
The whole neighborhood is yapping
about how Zip and two goons

68
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,459
got the beat down at
Genghis Connie's last night.

69
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,794
Hmm.

70
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,631
I heard it was four guys.

71
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,427
[chuckling]

72
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,388
I knew it had to be you.

73
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,352
[chuckles] No wonder you came
into the shop so light on your feet.

74
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,981
Either that or someone finally
gave you some trim.

75
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,315
Oh!

76
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,651
[both laugh]

77
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,489
[Pop] Mmm. Mmm.

78
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:12,247
So that's how it works? Those
thugs shake people down?

79
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,836
They work for Mariah or Cottonmouth?

80
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,422
[grunts]

81
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,929
A little bit of both.

82
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,348
They related?

83
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,976
- Aunt and nephew?
- Cousins.

84
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,728
Their grandma was Mama Mabel.

85
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,688
Who's Mama Mabel?

86
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,984
[sighs] The devil's ex-wife.

87
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,113
They ever come at you sideways?

88
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,823
No.

89
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,493
This place right here is
Switzerland. Everybody knows that.

90
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,747
Where you from, Luke?

91
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,167
Chicago.

92
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,377
You ain't from no Chicago.

93
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,006
Where are you from, really?

94
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,302
Savannah, Georgia.

95
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,845
All right.

96
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,597
Country boy.

97
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,977
You know how the wind feels fluffy, like
you could stuff it into a pillowcase

98
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,229
- right before a big thunderstorm?
- Mmm-hmm.

99
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,523
Harlem's the same.

100
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,400
Trouble smells a certain way.

101
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,153
You can... touch it.

102
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,572
Cottonmouth.

103
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,784
He's gonna fall behind
lookin' for Chico.

104
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,368
That's the way that works.

105
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,537
Ain't no secrets uptown.

106
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,500
I mean, you could set a watch by
the way that shit will play out.

107
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,711
[scoffs]

108
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,088
I'm fresh out of singles.

109
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,631
- I ain't gonna break no ten for that.
- [laughs]

110
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,550
[chuckles] Oh, no, no.

111
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,385
- [door opens]
- [bell chimes]

112
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,201
Something real about a razor.

113
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,164
You should let me use my
clippers. You gonna bump up.

114
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,166
Nah. [inhales deeply]

115
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,709
Doesn't have the same feel.

116
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,628
The clippers are idiot-proof.

117
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,423
That's what's missin' nowadays, Pop.

118
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,926
Attention to detail.

119
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,804
Everyone wants things fast, quick.

120
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:37,100
Me? I like to take my time.

121
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:42,355
[Pop] Time is a luxury most...
working class men cannot afford.

122
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,606
[Stokes] True.

123
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,944
Time is precious. Shouldn't be wasted.

124
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,739
Mmm...

125
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,284
A good razor shave is
like a vacation to me.

126
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,204
It's incredible how few
people take advantage.

127
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,916
- [Pop] It's a lost art.
- [Stokes] Exactly.

128
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,639
That's the problem
with these youngsters.

129
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,210
They want it all.

130
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,213
But they don't want to put in the work.

131
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,966
They'll rob...

132
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,428
lie, cheat, steal, just
to get what they want.

133
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,347
Damn shame if you ask me.

134
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,434
[softly] Yeah.

135
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,519
- Shame.
- Mmm-hmm.

136
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,899
How'd you... cut your hands?

137
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,526
Oh, uh, eh... shaving.

138
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:32,572
[chuckling] That's why I needed
a professional touch, you dig?

139
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,951
- [Pop] Sorry, brother.
- Twelve feet.

140
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,245
Two guns.

141
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,831
Four seconds.

142
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,959
You gonna move?

143
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,294
No, not yet.

144
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,881
Just 'cause they call you Bobby
Fish don't mean you're Bobby Fischer.

145
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,968
And you ain't Turkish neither, Turk.

146
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,510
Not last time I checked.

147
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,346
[Turk] That's not what
your daughter said.

148
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,472
[Bobby chuckling] Yeah,
but your mama confirmed it.

149
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,118
[Turk] Oh, you think you can throw
me off my game talking about my mama?

150
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,603
[Bobby] Oh, no, she
is a well-established ho.

151
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,981
That should not faze you one bit.

152
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,107
Check.

153
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,074
That's a cheap broom.

154
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,076
Old.

155
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,663
I just got home.

156
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,582
College?

157
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,127
Three years this time...

158
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,419
Seagate.

159
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,630
I'm from 'round the way.

160
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,966
Grew up right here.

161
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,885
Everyone knows Pop.

162
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,099
There was this little
Puerto Rican kid...

163
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,769
I can't remember his
name... It's like, um...

164
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,562
Rico or, uh...

165
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,648
Chico.

166
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,693
Yeah...

167
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,156
Chico.

168
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,785
He used to shape me up back in the day.

169
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,455
He was real good, too.

170
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,418
I was hoping he was still around.

171
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,673
People come and go.

172
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,007
You know how it is, right?

173
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,385
Yeah.

174
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,599
[Luke] Pop...

175
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,810
I've got some fresh towels right here.

176
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,646
You've got some dirty ones.

177
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,690
I could take 'em out if you want.

178
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,318
No sweat at all.

179
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,530
I'm good, Luke.

180
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,864
[Stokes] Big man...

181
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,659
you work here, too?

182
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,955
This brother got more
jobs than a Jamaican.

183
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,957
- [laughing]
- [chuckles]

184
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,294
[Stokes] What's your name again?

185
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,089
- Luke.
- Luke. [snaps fingers]

186
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,006
[inhales sharply] Mmm, old school.

187
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,176
Biblical. [chuckles]

188
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,010
I'm all about the old school.

189
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,805
You know that...

190
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,225
eye for an eye, tooth
for a tooth kind of thing.

191
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,477
Fire and brimstone.

192
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,605
[inhales sharply] See... back then...

193
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,276
do someone wrong, wasn't
no beggin' and pleadin'.

194
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,778
Just took care of it.

195
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,157
Handled your business.

196
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,162
What about turning the other cheek?

197
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,413
Mmm...

198
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,250
Jesus saves...

199
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,667
I don't.

200
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,838
You want a hot towel?

201
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,716
Not today. [exhales]

202
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,343
Gotta keep it movin'.

203
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,679
I'm a working man, too.

204
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,936
[Tone] Chico falls through...

205
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,480
we need to holler at him.

206
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,816
[Stokes] Thanks for the shave, Henry.

207
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,028
I'm loyal to my people.

208
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,448
[Luke] You're forgetting
something, Mr. Stokes.

209
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:12,333
Unless your last name is
Corleone, Shaft or Riley...

210
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,295
you owe my man $25.

211
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,130
Don't worry about it, Cornell.

212
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,177
Nah, it's all good.

213
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,470
[Stokes chuckles]

214
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,183
Tone, pay the man.

215
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,395
[bell chimes]

216
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,035
[door closes]

217
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,422
They got Shameek.

218
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,801
Cottonmouth did it personally.
Did you see his knuckles?

219
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,595
I'm sorry, Pop.

220
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,013
You never liked him anyway.

221
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,390
That's not entirely true.

222
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,768
Shameek is gone. I don't
condone what he did.

223
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,313
But it's not too late for Chico.

224
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,732
Pop, stay out of it.

225
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,484
Some people you just gotta let go.

226
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,611
I can't just turn my back on him.

227
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,072
You used to find people, right?

228
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,533
That was a long time ago.

229
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,203
It ain't exactly a skill you lose.

230
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,581
Look, this place is Switzerland.

231
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,625
If we can find him before they do,

232
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,212
maybe I can set up a
parley with Cottonmouth.

233
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,885
I don't think so, man.

234
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,054
I'm sorry, Pop. I can't do it.

235
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,641
Hey... yes.

236
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,518
You are sorry.

237
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,313
Now, I hadn't seen
Reva since she was five.

238
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,607
So when she comes
home with a convict husband

239
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,984
and a shaky-ass story...

240
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,819
I ain't ask her no questions.

241
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:09,033
And when that same well-read ex-con
comes back wanting to be paid in cash...

242
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,870
and lifting up refrigerators like
they're empty cardboard boxes,

243
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,790
I just nodded my head again.

244
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:21,462
What did you tell me about
keeping your secrets?

245
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,884
That I owed you one.

246
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,431
Well, time is due.

247
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,561
I'm collecting.

248
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,445
[indistinct chatter]

249
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,656
[boy 1] Whoo!

250
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,908
[boy 2] Hey!

251
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,207
- [boy 3] Five-O! Five-O!
- [boy 4] Let's go!

252
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,085
[Scarfe] Whoa! Hold
up... Hold up, hold up!

253
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,396
[chuckling] Where's everybody goin'?

254
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,505
Come on, Chauncey. You know the drill.

255
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,093
Have you seen this kid? Chico?

256
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,929
[Chauncey] No, I don't know that dude.

257
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,222
Stop it.

258
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,353
His initials are painted right here.

259
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,314
Just like all the other St.
Nick playground legends.

260
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,773
You seen him or not?

261
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,192
Nah.

262
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,196
Wastin' time, Misty.

263
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,031
Yo, pass me the rock.

264
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,658
[chuckling]

265
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,495
What, you fittin' to
play one-on-one with me?

266
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,374
No. That wouldn't be fair to you.

267
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,000
[all exclaim]

268
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,710
Come on, let's play H-O-R-S-E.

269
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,796
Shot for shot. And if I win...

270
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,092
you tell me everything I need to
know about Wilfredo Chico Diaz.

271
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,969
What's in it for me?

272
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,306
A get out of jail free
card for any non-violent felony.

273
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,684
[scoffs] Not doin' that shit. No way.

274
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,687
- [ball bounces]
- We good?

275
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,024
[boy 1] Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

276
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,567
Ladies first.

277
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,778
- [all exclaim]
- [boy 2] Come on, Chauncey.

278
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,112
[Chauncey chuckles]

279
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,370
[boy 2] Come on,
man. It's your thing, man!

280
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,540
[indistinct chatter]

281
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,671
Hey, you better shoot like
Cheryl Miller, not Barney Miller.

282
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,174
Sometimes I forget how old you are.

283
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:33,362
I mean, he gonna hold your purse, too?

284
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,970
[all chuckling]

285
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,266
Wow!

286
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,692
[all exclaim]

287
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,362
Come here.

288
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,365
You see that?

289
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,911
This is my court, too.

290
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,540
Let's play.

291
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,960
[all exclaim]

292
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,714
- [boy 1] Oh, come on, now!
- [all exclaim]

293
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,346
[inaudible]

294
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,303
[men speaking indistinctly]

295
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,439
- [knock on door]
- Yes.

296
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,277
Hey.

297
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,328
Mmm-mmm. That's not nearly enough.

298
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,498
[laughing] What?

299
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,166
It's not enough.

300
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,169
I need the rest so I
can make the deposit.

301
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,005
Well, I need to find the guy who has it.

302
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,176
Look... I borrowed from those donations,

303
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,179
at your request, so you
could refurbish your club.

304
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,307
You go and make a gun deal with Domingo.

305
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,560
Then you get jacked and
we're all exposed.

306
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,563
You promised this would be
taken care of, but it's not.

307
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,480
You don't give me orders.

308
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,107
We're partners. You're not my boss.

309
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,528
We're family,
Cornell. But think about it.

310
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,362
Do you really want to go to jail?

311
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,782
- Do you want to lose your club?
- Of course not.

312
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,535
Then you need to fix
this shit right now.

313
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,497
Does your guard dog want
a drink of water?

314
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,750
- [chuckles softly]
- Don't worry about him.

315
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,628
You worry about the
politics, I worry about my job.

316
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,548
Your job is to uncomplicate my life.

317
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,968
And your job is to
turn my water into wine.

318
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,974
Family first, right?

319
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,685
Always.

320
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,438
I'm coming by the club tonight.

321
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,940
[chuckles]

322
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,735
Why? I thought you said you
don't want to be seen there.

323
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:36,819
I don't.

324
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,196
But I like the music.

325
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,159
I'm going to be on you
until this is resolved.

326
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,663
It's getting resolved.

327
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,414
You best believe that.

328
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,630
[gun cocks]

329
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,508
- You ain't gonna fire that.
- I'll kill you.

330
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,468
Shameek is dead.

331
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,513
They have his half of the
money. Now they want yours.

332
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,518
- Shameek is dead?
- Yeah.

333
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,187
Well, good. [spits]

334
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,025
Then you just want my
money for yourself, don't you?

335
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,361
I couldn't care less.

336
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,822
I came here because Pop
asked me to come for you.

337
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,199
Pops?

338
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,535
For your dad.

339
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,037
[breath trembling]

340
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,206
Why does everybody bring him
up? He was never there for me.

341
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,958
I'm sick and tired of hearing about him.

342
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,045
Pop thinks he has a
way to clear this mess up.

343
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,338
I know you didn't kill Dante...

344
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,007
or Shameek.

345
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,051
All you guys wanted was the cash.

346
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,344
It was an inside job.

347
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,889
Dante's safe idea.

348
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,683
Look...

349
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,811
I found you in four hours for free.

350
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,899
Imagine how fast someone Cottonmouth
pays will find you.

351
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,358
[inhales sharply]

352
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:02,780
The only chance you have at survival
is if you come with me right now.

353
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,786
Well, I got a half a million
new chances is the way I see it.

354
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:23,217
Tell Pops... I'm sorry.

355
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,555
He was always good to me.

356
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,850
He deserves better.

357
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,534
Took your rook, rookie.

358
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,329
Hmm.

359
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,042
- It's your move, son.
- [chuckling] Mmm-hmm.

360
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,169
- Don't get scared now.
- Oh, no, no, no...

361
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,838
- [bell chimes]
- [indistinct chatter]

362
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,805
[gate creaking]

363
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,060
[Luke] Want some
catfish with that hot sauce?

364
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,395
[chuckling]

365
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,107
- You count calories, Power Man?
- [sighs]

366
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,442
Fork will kill you quicker
than any bullet.

367
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,155
[chuckling]

368
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,449
I found Chico.

369
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,328
He ain't coming.

370
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,498
You can't save everybody.

371
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,169
You're wrong about that.

372
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,756
What would have happened in my
life if people gave up on me?

373
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,885
I was no angel.

374
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,931
No, I was a beast.

375
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,059
<i>- [man grunting]</i>
- [Pop] <i>I was a beast.</i>

376
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,685
<i>No two ways about it.</i>

377
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,814
[Luke] <i>They call you Pop
because you were the OG?</i>

378
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:04,651
[Pop] <i>No, it was the sound my fist
made when I knocked a fool out.</i>

379
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,695
<i>Snap, crackle, pop!</i>

380
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,700
<i>Cottonmouth lost three teeth as a kid.</i>

381
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,370
<i>[chuckles] Wilfredo saw him
smile and the name just stuck.</i>

382
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,584
<i>And Fredo was the craziest little
Puerto Rican in black Harlem.</i>

383
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:24,171
<i>I used to call 'em Thing
One and Thing Two.</i>

384
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,731
Hey, yo, yo, yo. Can I take your photo?

385
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,175
- Yeah, yeah. Jamel, right?
- Right over here, man. Thanks.

386
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,384
Yeah, yeah. [mutters]

387
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,429
[Luke] <i>What'd that make
you? The Cat in the Hat?</i>

388
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,849
<i>- [shutter clicks]</i>
- [Pop] <i>Something like that.</i>

389
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,145
[Luke] So what happened?

390
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,605
[Pop] We got popped.

391
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:47,277
Wilfredo went from selling
crack to smoking crack.

392
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,698
I got caught with a
gun and a bag of money.

393
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,242
Kept my mouth shut.

394
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,745
Went on pause for ten years.

395
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,081
My woman was pregnant when I went in.

396
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,250
I haven't seen her or...

397
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,419
my son since he was 13.

398
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,047
I have this nightmare that...

399
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:10,384
one day, he's gonna come to the shop...

400
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,971
ask for a cut, sit in my chair...

401
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,931
and I'm not even gonna know him.

402
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,728
I didn't have one single
skill when I got out.

403
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,857
I could've gone back to the streets.

404
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,195
But you weren't that guy anymore.

405
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,115
I wasn't... and I'm not.

406
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,200
And that's what I go through every day.

407
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,119
Trying not to be that person.

408
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,205
I'm not that guy either.

409
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,417
I thought you was
innocent, Shawshank. Mmm.

410
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,670
I ain't guilty. [sighs]

411
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:50,007
But... I ain't innocent either.

412
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,803
I had to balance my
dirt... so I opened up this shop.

413
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,599
So those young
knuckleheads have a place to get away.

414
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,686
Like Fredo's son, Chico.

415
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:09,068
And certain... muscle-headed
fugitives lookin' for a change of pace.

416
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,988
[Pop chuckles]

417
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,115
After what I did at Genghis Connie's...

418
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,870
for the first time in a
long time... I felt at peace.

419
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,206
[Pop] Mmm-hmm.

420
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,749
I made a decision when
I got back to the crib.

421
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,254
I'm done running.

422
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,426
Boys run.

423
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,512
Men stand.

424
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,014
You're a man.

425
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,768
I am who I am.

426
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,688
Or...

427
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:51,693
maybe I have a chance to find
out who I could really be.

428
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,238
That's right.

429
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,948
- [Luke] Hmm?
- Yeah.

430
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,118
Come on. Let's get going.

431
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,664
Hey, Pop.

432
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,541
Damn. Y'all still at it, huh?

433
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,377
- He don't know when to quit.
- Oh, I know.

434
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,046
[Bobby] Until I win.

435
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,672
Gonna leave it open?

436
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,341
Yeah, till we shut the doors...

437
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,926
[chuckles] whether it's empty or not.

438
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:19,054
I'm gonna go get my smock.

439
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,615
[grunts]

440
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,867
What... were you thinking?

441
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,621
Sorry. I'm sorry! [sniffles]

442
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,666
[Pop exclaims] You dummy.

443
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,211
- You dummy.
- What's up?

444
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,337
Dummy.

445
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,298
[both sobbing]

446
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,723
You did good.

447
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,227
That's what.

448
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,315
My bad, Mr. Hunter.

449
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,027
Where's the restroom key? Just...

450
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,571
Get out of here.

451
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,239
Go.

452
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,075
You heard me.

453
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,418
You got to get him out of here.

454
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,423
And you know damn well, Chico
ain't gonna show up for work today.

455
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,759
Of course not, but... Pop
will tell us the truth

456
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,761
about who Chico really is.

457
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,472
He's just a barber, right?

458
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,432
Ah, he's a little bit of everything.

459
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,976
Not a very good judge of character.

460
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,604
He's got a big heart. We
should fault him for that?

461
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,980
[Scarfe] Nope.

462
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:56,151
Gimme a second. And
don't start without me.

463
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,027
Can't do the one-two punch without you.

464
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,281
Turk.

465
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,327
Misty.

466
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,705
I'm surprised to see
you this far uptown.

467
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm mostly Midtown nowadays, you know?

468
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,086
Puffy ain't got shit on me, baby.

469
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,755
I'm the real bad boy worldwide.

470
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,175
Yeah, your rap sheet got so many
hits, your record could put out a record.

471
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,928
Hey, I just fell through to see my man,
Bobby Fish, and to play some chess.

472
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,681
Well, you need to fall
your ass back downtown,

473
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,933
'cause if I catch you
around here again...

474
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,603
it's gonna be checkmate.

475
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,189
Understood? Mr. Barrett?

476
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,150
I hear you...

477
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,236
Detective.

478
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,321
Loud and clear.

479
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,370
Did anyone see you come here?

480
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,331
- Hmm?
- No... I don't think so.

481
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,375
- [door opens, bell chimes]
- Luke, check.

482
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,424
[whispers] Five-O!

483
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,010
You need to go in the
bathroom and hide. Go.

484
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,598
Go!

485
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,436
- Hey, Misty.
- Fish.

486
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,937
- How you doin'?
- Good to see you.

487
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,021
You, too.

488
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,791
- [Misty] Is Pop around?
- [Fish] He's in the back.

489
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,941
He'll be out in a minute.

490
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,529
- [pats Pop]
- Let me stall 'em. Sit tight.

491
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,950
[chuckles] Whoa.

492
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,245
Detective Mercedes Knight.

493
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,872
It's Misty now, Pop. You know that.

494
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,583
[Pop] All right, all right.

495
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,959
[chuckles]

496
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,920
Call yourself whatever
you want to, Detective.

497
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,339
- Hey!
- [chuckles] Ooh!

498
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,299
I respect authority.

499
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,301
[both chuckle]

500
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,595
I bet Kelly must be really
proud of you, hmm?

501
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,432
He's still mad I went to Temple instead
of playin' for St. John's.

502
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,601
- Bam!
- Swish!

503
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,102
[both laugh]

504
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,355
Is this your partner?

505
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,940
Detective Rafael Scarfe.

506
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,153
[softly] Okay.

507
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:06,198
How can I help you?

508
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,908
We're looking for
someone who works for you.

509
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,452
Wilfredo Chico Diaz?

510
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,162
You heard about that shooting...

511
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:14,831
at the junkyard?

512
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,666
Near the edge of the river?

513
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:18,877
No.

514
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,712
Really?

515
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,048
There was a shootout.

516
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,760
Looks like a gun deal that was robbed.

517
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,012
Turned into a bloodbath.

518
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,391
Dante Chapman was
found dead at the scene.

519
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:37,186
Shameek Smith was found about
18 hours later, beaten to death.

520
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:40,649
Last person to see Shameek Smith alive,

521
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,942
other than a strip club...

522
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,570
was right here at the
shop with his homeboy.

523
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,532
Uh, they were both here.

524
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,952
Chico gave Shameek a fade in that chair,

525
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,871
right next to where you're standing.

526
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:58,207
That's it though. That's the
last time I saw them both.

527
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,209
You really think Chico
killed his friend?

528
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,962
Over money?

529
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,965
You are?

530
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,556
Luke Cage.

531
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,726
Detective Misty Knight.

532
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,312
Detective.

533
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,940
Looks like you found some
better clothes to audit in.

534
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,280
[exhales]

535
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,159
Look... when my guys are here,

536
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,953
they know the rules.

537
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,664
Respect, no street talk.

538
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,500
But when they leave, I got no control.

539
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,795
Understood, but Chico
is a person of interest

540
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,089
who might have pertinent information.

541
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,591
Pertinent information?

542
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,344
Like, someone
saying who they really are?

543
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,138
Pertinent as in useful.

544
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,807
As in factual.

545
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,268
Like, uh... Chico's
number. You got that, right?

546
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,814
He missed work the last two days.

547
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,987
His booth rent is due, so
maybe he'll return my call.

548
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,781
If you see him, tell him to call me.

549
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,702
Call me anyway.

550
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,955
He may not be safe otherwise.

551
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,750
Will do.

552
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,920
- [chuckles]
- Nice meeting you, Luke.

553
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,341
You too... Detective.

554
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,061
- [door opens]
- [bell chimes]

555
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,277
Really? [scoffs]

556
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,779
We had coffee.

557
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,157
Mmm-hmm. [chuckles] Right.

558
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,663
You gonna call Cottonmouth?

559
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,540
No.

560
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,292
You need to see him.

561
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,085
What?

562
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,421
He's going to want to see you.

563
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:12,175
No. I'm afraid our... friends in
blue might have eyes on the shop.

564
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,095
You work at Harlem's Paradise.

565
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,139
You have a reason to go there.

566
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,936
You can't do this kind
of thing on the phone.

567
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,399
[sighs]

568
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,319
Look, man, Wilfredo...

569
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,198
he died... on these streets.

570
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,162
I don't wanna see
Chico go out the same way.

571
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,291
Can you do this for me?

572
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,216
I'm on it.

573
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,884
All right.

574
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,556
[softly] Thanks.

575
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,354
[dishes clattering]

576
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,901
[Nate] You're late. I have your money.

577
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,821
Cage.

578
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,865
Cage!

579
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,783
Do you hear me?

580
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,076
Cage!

581
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,661
[indistinct chatter]

582
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:33,256
Your brother down there told
Candace to send me up a Blue Hawaiian.

583
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,842
Like he gonna get up on
me with a Blue Hawaiian.

584
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,218
[both laugh]

585
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,764
Ah, he lucky I let his ass in here.

586
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,767
I need to speak to your man.

587
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,977
What? You didn't get
tipped at the barber shop?

588
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,311
Pat him down.

589
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,320
He's clean.

590
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,282
Thought you already had a job.

591
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,702
'Cause I could use some more ice.

592
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,288
I'm here for Pop.

593
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,208
Pop is a grown-ass
man. Why ain't he here?

594
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,296
He said you wouldn't wanna
hear this over the phone.

595
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,881
So he sent me.

596
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,466
Ha! The suspense is killing me.

597
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,219
Pop wants to set up a parley for Chico.

598
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,890
He doesn't want him to
end up like Shameek.

599
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,226
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

600
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,146
Those cuts on your hands say different.

601
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,065
[cell phone vibrates and chimes]

602
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:37,696
All I'm saying is that if you want
to talk to Pop about Chico,

603
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,238
that can be arranged.

604
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,365
All of your goods will be returned.

605
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,620
The only thing our mutual
friend wants is safe passage.

606
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,333
He'll never come back to New York, ever.

607
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,376
I don't speak Chinese.

608
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,922
[laughs] 'Cause that's
what this conversation is to me.

609
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:59,467
If I got somethin' to say to Pop, I
say it to him my damn self, you dig?

610
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,097
[sighs] There's history.

611
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,141
Pop understands your trouble.

612
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,021
He's just asking you to
remember your history.

613
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,447
[Stokes inhales deeply]

614
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,329
Tell Pop I'll come by the
barbershop for a haircut.

615
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,041
Same time as before.

616
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,501
You understand?

617
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,838
I'll tell him.

618
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,216
By the way...

619
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,052
you're fired.

620
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,847
No, I'm not.

621
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,850
I quit before I walked in.

622
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,354
[chuckles]

623
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,690
- [upbeat music playing]
- [crowd cheering]

624
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,787
We got eyes on the boy.

625
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,454
What do you want me to do?

626
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,541
- Your man say where he was?
- No.

627
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,836
[Stokes] Hmm.

628
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,465
Let it go.

629
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,260
Take care of it in the morning.

630
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,930
You sure?

631
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,307
If he's out on the streets
slippin', handle it.

632
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:33,352
But if he's not moving
around, I'll deal with it, all right?

633
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,274
[crowd cheering and whistling]

634
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:41,086
Now let me holler at y'all for a minute.

635
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,612
'Cause I got somethin'
that I need to say.

636
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,239
What y'all know about that thing?

637
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,134
[Mariah] You're wasting
your gifts, my brother.

638
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,494
This gangster life...

639
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,872
not what our ancestors fought for.

640
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,166
Not what our people died for.

641
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,126
This is exactly what they died for.

642
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:01,630
Self-determination, control, power.

643
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,329
That boy we was looking
for earlier today...

644
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,039
he's at Pop's Barber Shop.

645
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,710
- You seen him?
- With my own two eyes.

646
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,795
How long ago?

647
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,546
A little while back.

648
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,300
Hey!

649
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,385
Hey!

650
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,013
Yo, what's up with my money?

651
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,860
[clippers buzzing]

652
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,111
[Pop] You need to leave?

653
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,155
I'm just gonna pick up
dinner from Boulevard.

654
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,365
Where's Luke?

655
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,956
- Have you seen him?
- Girl, you just don't quit, do you?

656
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,126
- I just want to take him out for coffee.
- [scoffs]

657
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,180
You know what people
remember besides black martyrdom?

658
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,597
What?

659
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,349
Black money.

660
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,938
Don't you ever get sick of
people calling you a criminal?

661
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,065
[gun clicks]

662
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,401
You gonna at least wait for
Chico to come outside, right?

663
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,822
Right?

664
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,848
What he sayin'?

665
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:18,935
He'll only talk to
you. Right here at the shop.

666
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,859
I want something better.

667
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,527
- Like what?
- Respect.

668
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,614
It's all that ever really matters.

669
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,537
Money outlasts respect.

670
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,250
Respect will put your
name on the side of a building...

671
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,421
but the money that put your name
up there comes from someplace.

672
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,303
At what cost, Cornell?

673
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:58,224
When you find out... you'll tell me.

674
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,940
[all cheering]

675
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,616
What are you doing out
here with that bag, man?

676
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,785
- There's no TV back there.
- Are you serious?

677
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,333
Pop!

678
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,345
[bullet ricochets]

679
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,222
[screams]

680
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,276
[muffled screaming]

681
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,696
[whispering] Stay dead. Stay dead.

682
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,410
[gunfire stops]

683
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,255
[whimpering]

684
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,466
[gagging]

685
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,269
- You should've waited.
- Shut up, man.

686
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,077
You okay?

687
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:44,330
Pop! [softly] Pop.

688
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,540
Oh, Pop... [crying]

689
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,209
[gagging]

690
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,335
- Come on...
- [Pop grunts]

691
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,545
- [wheezing]
- You hear the sirens?

692
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,549
[panting] They're
almost here. They comin'.

693
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,927
Someone call the goddamn ambulance!

694
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,680
[Luke sobbing]

695
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,600
[Pop straining] Swear...

696
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,980
Swear jar...

697
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,233
[crying] I will. I will.

698
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:15,944
[gulps]

699
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:17,738
Luke...

700
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,703
[stuttering] Forward... always.

701
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,205
[gagging]

702
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,334
Always...

703
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:35,506
[stuttering] forward.

704
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,054
[whispers] Always forward.

705
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,264
[mumbling]

706
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,600
[crying] No.

707
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,146
[sniffling] No...

708
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,191
No! [sobbing]

709
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:56,277
No!

710
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,655
[screaming] No!

711
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,536
[breathing heavily]

712
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,122
[sniffles]

713
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,844
[indistinct radio chatter]

714
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,971
[Lonnie] Mommy, I'm okay.

715
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,974
I'm okay. Luke covered me.

716
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,893
He said he didn't move because he
didn't want them to shoot again.

717
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,980
- [Patty sighs] You see who did this?
- [Lonnie] No, Mama.

718
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,024
[officer] Excuse me, ma'am.
Will you come with me?

719
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,613
[Scarfe] You get a look at the shooter?

720
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,864
Nah.

721
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,991
It's a miracle I'm even alive, man.

722
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,214
Luke.

723
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,259
Luke?

724
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,594
Are you okay?

725
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,268
You didn't get hit?

726
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,354
I said I'm okay.

727
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,152
What happened?

728
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,695
They started firing.

729
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,823
The kid, Lonnie, was in
the middle of the room.

730
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,993
So, once I saw the flash...

731
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,704
instincts kicked in.

732
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,833
I grabbed him... and I shielded him.

733
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:39,672
You... shielded him? You
shielded him with what?

734
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,678
Have the paramedics seen you yet?

735
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,890
I said I'm good.

736
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,230
How long have you been working
here at the shop?

737
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,981
Five months.

738
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:05,364
Did Chico reach out to Pop since
we were in here earlier?

739
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,868
Was he hiding out here the whole time?

740
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:19,086
- What did they get from the canvass?
- [Scarfe] Uh, patrol got nothing.

741
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,047
Traffic cam picked up a black Escalade.

742
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,801
Tracked it to Hunts Point in the
Bronx, but it was torched. No prints.

743
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,095
[inhales sharply] They were after Chico?

744
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,514
- There's no doubt in my mind.
- Hmm.

745
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:33,767
I checked out Cottonmouth. He's
been at the club all night in VIP.

746
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,104
- So we don't have shit?
- No.

747
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,774
No decent witnesses except
for Chico, but then what else?

748
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,067
Nothin'?

749
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,045
[indistinct chatter]

750
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,134
[man] Yeah, baby. Uh-huh.

751
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,606
- [mouthing] Upstairs.
- I'm coming with you.

752
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,858
- Nah.
- No, I need to be there.

753
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,905
[Stokes] What's wrong, Shades?

754
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,034
- You should've waited.
- Waited? [scoffs]

755
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:35,371
Bump that noise. I got
the call. It was me.

756
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,914
What happened?

757
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,666
Look, Turk calls me.

758
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,960
Tells me he saw Chic
at the shop, slippin'.

759
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:45,631
I came and ask you if it was
important if the nigga was breathing.

760
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,090
You seem non-committal...

761
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:49,885
so I make an executive decision.

762
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,430
[both laughing]

763
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:55,015
That's what you call...
an executive decision?

764
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,434
[chuckles]

765
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:57,893
Yeah, okay.

766
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,063
Mmm, so you caught him slippin' outside?

767
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,941
No, bro, I lit that shit
up like the Fourth of July.

768
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:07,611
<i>[chuckling] It was all so Django
Candyland shit for real.</i>

769
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,738
Lights, camera, action,
baby! [clapping hands]

770
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,990
Somebody call Quentin! [laughing]

771
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,582
I suggested... we wait.

772
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,291
[Tone] Wait?

773
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,462
[stammers] Wait for what, Shades?

774
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,131
You ain't even down with the
clique. You can't give orders.

775
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,968
It was loud 'cause it's supposed to be.

776
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,262
Niggas need to know you
don't rob Cottonmouth!

777
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:36,557
[yelling] My name is not Cottonmouth!

778
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,187
[Tone] My bad.

779
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,814
My bad.

780
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,191
He's dead, right?

781
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:49,194
Chico's laid out... He's done.

782
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,489
It don't matter. We got the money!

783
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,660
[breathes deeply]

784
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,496
You had to do it, I guess.

785
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,712
Pops can rebuild. [inhales sharply]

786
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,508
He won't like it but
I'll donate some money...

787
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,176
anonymously.

788
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,356
It's all gonna be okay.
[chuckles softly]

789
00:50:15,381 --> 00:50:16,536
[pats arm]

790
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,228
What?

791
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:26,899
Pops is dead.

792
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,946
A casualty of war.

793
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,198
You know... [stammers] Shit happens.

794
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,659
[Turk] Yo...

795
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,411
Where's my money?

796
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,623
How the hell did you get up here?

797
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,792
I'm Turk Barrett, baby.

798
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,294
The door ain't been built
yet that can hold me back.

799
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,254
Now, where's my money?

800
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,090
Okay, Mr. Barrett.

801
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:55,135
Tone promised to pay you
for finding Chico, right?

802
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,304
- Yeah.
- That right?

803
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,100
Okay.

804
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,311
Hey, hey, hey!

805
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,146
[screaming]

806
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,819
[panting]

807
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:19,493
You can collect your money from
Tone downstairs, Mr. Barrett!

808
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,791
I assume that completes our business.

809
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,211
Y'all Harlem niggas are off the hook.

810
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,922
I'm going back to Hell's
Kitchen, where it's safe.

811
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,423
[scoffs]

812
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,016
Is that sufficient?

813
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,438
There's enough there.

814
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,903
You all right, cuz?

815
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:56,697
With what?

816
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,243
Extortion? Well...

817
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,454
Murder, no!

818
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,081
I'm not good.

819
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,502
Don't expect me to be.

820
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,587
The money's still green.

821
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,800
That it is.

822
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,803
You should get outta here.

823
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:24,016
You shouldn't be seen
associating with known criminals...

824
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,726
Councilwoman.

825
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,269
Take the side exit.

826
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,813
I got some garbage to
clean up downstairs.

827
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,324
Sorry about Pop.

828
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,663
Yeah, so am I.

829
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,205
I know what he meant to you.

830
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,374
[Stokes sighs deeply]

831
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:55,589
Believe it or not, there's
supposed to be rules to this shit.

832
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,112
He must have gotten hit.

833
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,617
What?

834
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,663
Luke...

835
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,081
Cage.

836
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,793
He shielded the kid.

837
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:37,756
He had bullet holes in his shirt.

838
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,300
Blood everywhere, none of it his?

839
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,304
How did he not get hit?

840
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,100
You're drunk.

841
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,980
Not yet.

842
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:55,083
- [breathing deeply]
- [man] What are you doing here, nigga?

843
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,135
I'm not gonna ask you again.

844
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,807
Young man...

845
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,185
I've had a long day.

846
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,521
I'm tired.

847
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,648
But I'm not tired enough...

848
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,735
to ever let nobody call me that word.

849
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,573
You see a nigga
standin' in front of you?

850
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:31,619
Across the street from a building named
after one of our greatest heroes?

851
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,457
- [gun cocks]
- Yeah, a dead one.

852
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,875
[Luke sighs]

853
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,337
You even know who Crispus Attucks was?

854
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,090
A free black man.

855
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,885
The first man to die for
what became America.

856
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:52,515
He could've acted scared when
those Brits raised their guns.

857
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,642
Blended in, in the crowd.

858
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,269
But he stepped up!

859
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,897
He paid with his life.

860
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,399
But he started something.

861
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,527
That's what Pop did...

862
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,695
Not me.

863
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,366
I laid in the cut until he stepped up!

864
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,035
And it cost him his life, too.

865
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,414
I ain't laying back no more!

866
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,375
You wanna shoot me?

867
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,128
Do it.

868
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,712
Pull the trigger, nigga!

869
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,507
I ain't got all night.
[breathing heavily]

870
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,009
Do it!

871
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:30,678
What, you scared?

872
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:32,973
[breathing heavily] Fine.

873
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,517
I'll do it for you.

874
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,930
Always forward, Pop.

875
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,183
Forward...

876
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,936
always.

877
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,399
[funk music playing]
