The Cage of Love

00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,770
<i>Episode 15</i>

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,550
Change into this and go out with me for a while.

4
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,910
I need to give Madam Jiang some porridge.

5
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,290
Just let your subordinate do it.

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,000
Aren't I one?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,990
Are you arguing with me?

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,080
Then are you looking at me as a privileged lady?

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,990
Do you want me to personally help you change your clothes?

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,860
Where are we going?

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,870
To a business opening ceremony.

12
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,950
- What if Madam Jiang looks for me?
- It will be very fast.

13
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,780
We will be back in the afternoon.

14
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,810
Miss. You look beautiful today.

15
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,000
When Young Master see's you, he will be very surprised.

16
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,290
Let's go.

17
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,750
What's wrong?

18
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,410
You look okay.

19
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,720
Let's go.

20
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,110
Miss. Don't be anxious. Young Master will definitely wait for you.

21
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,620
Get in the carriage.

22
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,780
Get in.

23
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,770
I will get in on my own.

24
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,110
Let's go.

25
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,190
Brother!

26
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,350
Brother!

27
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,360
Miss, your earrings.

28
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,250
Mind your own business.

29
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,790
Miss.

30
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,780


31
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,000
<i>Congratulations. This way, please.</i>

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,580
<i>This way.</i>

33
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,310
<i>Let's go.</i>

34
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,140
<i>- You are here too.
- Yes, let's go in together.</i>

35
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,120
Please go inside.

36
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,940
This way, please.

37
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,390
This way, please.

38
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,050
Miss. Please show your invitation.

39
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,210
-Invitation?
-Here.

40
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,790
She is with me.

41
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,730
Okay, please go in.

42
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,550
Thanks.

43
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,880
I don't understand the business here.

44
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,220
Why did you bring me here?

45
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,070
Didn't your father take you to such events?

46
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,930
He said that it was not suitable for women to attend this.

47
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,480
In the business field, everyone was two-faced to our family.

48
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,710
Brother Shao Tian was the one interested in these affairs.

49
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,630
My father hoped that he could hand over the business to Brother Shao Tian one day.

50
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,570
If your dad is watching over you, he would definitely be fuming with anger.

51
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,360
I don't like the way you talk about Brother Shao Tian.

52
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,720
Boss Jiang.

53
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,570
-You came.
-Li Ting Zhang, you also came.

54
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,280
Who is the host today that was

55
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,510
able to invite Li Ting Zhang to come is an amazing feat.

56
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,830
Thank you. Look over there. Welcome.

57
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,140
Lu Man.

58
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,840
He wants to establish a dye factory too?

59
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,190
Yes, with that woman by his side.

60
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,810
A woman boss?

61
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,600
Buddy Jiang. Don't under estimate that woman.

62
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,200
After I received the message, she conducted an investigation.

63
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,460
She wanted to find out the origin of things.

64
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,250
Thanks.

65
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,030
She is his lover.

66
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,970
He gets information straight out of doing business in the textile industry. Business is good.

67
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,850
Huzhou dominates.

68
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,810
Since she has brought her business to Huzhou,

69
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,310
it seems others have become victims of her business.

70
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,420
You have met your rival.

71
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,010
If she is here to do honourable business, I will welcome her any time

72
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,690
but even if it's not so, don't worry.

73
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,670
With you here, who would she dare to do anything illegal in Huzhou?

74
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,750
You do not need to flatter me.

75
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,260
We are now starting.

76
00:05:52,100 --> 00:06:02,000
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

77
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,660
Dear friends, people in the same industry and guests.

78
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,890
Today is the day that Rong Da starts operation.

79
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,690
I really appreciate everyone visiting today.

80
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,510
I am Lu Man who is just an ordinary girl.

81
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,500
For being able to open a dyeing factory in Huzhou,

82
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,570
I'm really grateful to a friend of mine.

83
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,350
After having this friend, I can lead a life of leisure.

84
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:34,270
I can now have tea at home, watch movies, go shopping and buy clothes.

85
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,030
Rong Da can earn me money while I am sitting at home.

86
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,880
The business dealings of Rong Da,

87
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,710
I let this friend of mine handle everything.

88
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,240
I would like to invite my secret friend up here now.

89
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,200
He is also our Manager at Rong Da. Please come up.

90
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,660
Welcome.

91
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,850
Today is the day Rong Da starts operating.

92
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,800
Rong Da is also now an important part of the Huzhou community.

93
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,180
We are glad you are gathered here for this ground breaking day.

94
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,310
It has special significance for you to be here.

95
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,540
I would like to share my happy event with everyone.

96
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,560
Thank you, everyone.

97
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,150
What's going on?

98
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:01,280
Looks like the missing money at Ling Long will show up soon.

99
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,310
I'm announcing the start of the ball now.

100
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,880
Excellent.

101
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,810
Let's dance.

102
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,430
Cai Hong. May I have this dance?

103
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,270
I think, at such an event today,

104
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,760
Mr Jiang won't be rude.

105
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,660
Don't be anxious.

106
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,390
How can she dance when she's holding a wine glass?

107
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,810
Go now.

108
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,650
Brother Shao Tian. What's going on?

109
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,080
Cai Hong. Don't be in disbelief.

110
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,060
What you are seeing is the truth.

111
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,570
Everything that I have done was to wait for such an opportunity

112
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,270
for the day when I can stand on equal terms with you

113
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,710
and dance with you.

114
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,160
Brother Shao Tian. What are you talking about?

115
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,320
We have always been on equal terms.

116
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,390
It's not the same. That was in the past and it's now.

117
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,860
It's who I am today that is worthy of you.

118
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,440
You have always been the same in my heart.

119
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,220
Thus,

120
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,470
I love you.

121
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,350
Cai Hong. Everything that I have done,

122
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,490
it's really all for you.

123
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,150
You want to dance, right? Let me dance with you.

124
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,620
Think I'm afraid of you?

125
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,230
You finally couldn't stop yourself. The money that you stole from Ling Long

126
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,830
you used it.

127
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,070
Didn't you hear that my boss is Miss Lu?

128
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,680
I'm the General Manager.

129
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,030
Even with this attitude, you say that you are not the boss.

130
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,190
Technically you are correct. Ms. Lu gifted me 3% percent of the shares.

131
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,760
Is there such a good thing on earth?

132
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,700
Who doesn't know that I helped Ling Long to make profits.

133
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,840
If not, Wu Hong Da wouldn't let me marry Cai Hong.

134
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,720
Do you think I'm her?

135
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,180
What's going on?

136
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,700
Wu Cai Hong. Let's go home.

137
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,660
When you were dancing with Brother Shao Tian, what were you both talking about?

138
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,760
What else could we be talking about? He has already switched sides.

139
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,550
Cai Hong.

140
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,000
Let me introduce you to the next ruling manager.

141
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,110
This is Miss Lu. She's also the boss of Rong Da.

142
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,310
This is my girlfriend, Wu Cai Hong.

143
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,770
Miss Wu. We have met in the past.

144
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,180
<i>Hello, Miss Wu. My name is Lu Man.</i>

145
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,340
<i>How did you know my family name?</i>

146
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,910
<i>You are now managing Ling Long, Miss Wu Cai Hong.</i>

147
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,950
<i>I'm your loyal client of Ling Long.</i>

148
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,980
Frankly. I have always wanted to establish a dye factory in Huzhou.

149
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,970
I just was never able to find a manager.

150
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,010
I heard that Mr. Zhou Shao Tian was your father's favorite.

151
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,770
It wasn't easy for me to get him to help me.

152
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,310
Thank you Ms. Lu for appreciating his talents.

153
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,760
Miss Wu. Don't say that. Without Mr Zhou

154
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,170
I wouldn't have been able to establish Rong Da.

155
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,080
Set your mind at ease. Because he shared his knowledge,

156
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,520
I'm giving him 3% of the shares.

157
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,230
Frankly, you don't need to tell me this. I don't really understand this business.

158
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,990
Miss Wu. You don't need to understand.

159
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,360
Rong Da has Miss Lu's capability and with my support,

160
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,780
it has Mr. Zhou's supervision

161
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,400
Let's work together to make it great.

162
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,430
Cai Hong.

163
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,950
Do you still have some other matters? I'm going to take your girlfriend

164
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,510
back to my home to look after my mother.

165
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,220
Cai Hong. I won't let you stay in the Jiang home for too long.

166
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,650
I will pick you up very soon.

167
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,550
The contract is signed for three years.

168
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,790
Do you understand what that means?

169
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,460
Close presence will have a real effect.

170
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,050
The contract that you signed with Miss Lu,

171
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,370
is bi-monthly. It is not the same type of contract.

172
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,500
Cai Hong.

173
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,960
You know that I am honest and open.

174
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,610
This is my contract with Miss Lu.

175
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,310
I will leave this with you.

176
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,090
I trust you. You don't need to do this.

177
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,170
Take this.

178
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,660
Trust me.

179
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,910
Do not listen to this villain's instigation.

180
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,800
Let's go.

181
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,620
Brother.

182
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,850
The opening ceremony...

183
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,350
why did you bring Wu Cai Hong there instead of me?

184
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,040
In the past, I blamed Wu Cai Hong wrongly.

185
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,190
I just wanted her to take a break from it.

186
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,970
It's not that simple as this, right?

187
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,160
I think you have been seduced by her.

188
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,750
Fei Fei. You are becoming more disrespectful.

189
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,960
It is not ladylike to say these things.

190
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,230
I originally was not a well-cultivated daughter of a rich family.

191
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,820
Now that a well-cultivated daughter of a rich family came

192
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,900
you are starting to complain about me, right?

193
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,340
But Brother, don't forget. It was her who caused the death of our father.

194
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,050
Even though you see her as delicate and ladylike.

195
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,160
Do you know the owner of Rong Da?

196
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,200
I'm not concerned about this.

197
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,270
Zhou Shao Tian is their General Manager.

198
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,730
There is definitely some problem with this. Investigate this for me.

199
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,400
Don't change the topic.

200
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,830
Today was the opening ceremony

201
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,050
and you brought Wu Cai Hong there.

202
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,370
You let her be by your side.

203
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,500
Do you know what this means? I think this is a major problem.

204
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,950
I have discussed this problem with you at length and I do not wish to speak about it anymore.

205
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,310
Brother. So that, you won't continue with this,

206
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,040
I will tell your mom about Wu Cai Hong's identity.

207
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,970
Stop there.

208
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,760
Mom's health just improved. You shouldn't provoke her.

209
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,460
Mom.

210
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,070
What's wrong?

211
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,670
Do you know who Wu Cai Hong is?

212
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:01,250
She is Cai Hong. Who else could she be?

213
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,900
I just fell and was unconscious for a few days.

214
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,610
Do you think I became foolish from sleeping too much?

215
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,980
- Mom. Frankly, Wu Cai Hong is...
- Fei Fei.

216
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,440
Mom.

217
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,940
What's wrong with the both of you?

218
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,490
Fei Fei. You talked about Cai Hong just now. What's wrong with her?

219
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,820
She wanted to ask you about your fall at the hospital.

220
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,930
I was afraid that you wouldn't be happy, thus, I stopped her from asking you.

221
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,810
Don't talk about this again.

222
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,570
You were at fault at the hospital that day too.

223
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,780
Even more so, Cai Hong took care of me for many days.

224
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,720
When I was conscious, she apologized on her sister's behalf.

225
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,730
Fei Fei. Let bygones be bygones.

226
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,630
I get it. I will listen to Brother.

227
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:14,020

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,060
What are you doing?

242
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,690
I prepared some fruits for Madam. She didn't have an appetite.

243
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,620
Have some.

244
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,800
Okay.

245
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,670
What are you still doing here? Go back to work.

246
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,840
You eat fast, you should slow down.

247
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,370
Young Master. Mr Shao Tian is outside asking to see you.

248
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,580
- I'm not seeing him.
- Mr Shao Tian is not here alone.

249
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,340
He brought a lot of people and two crates. It's like a parade.

250
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,640
Let him in.

251
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,100
Cai Hong. That man is here again.

252
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,930
But he looks different this time.

253
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,900
- Who are you referring to?
- It's that guy who was drunk that day and created a ruckus.

254
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,250
Subsequently, Miss got him beaten up.

255
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,500
Brother Shao Tian?

256
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,620
I really don't know what his name is

257
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,890
but this time, he's dressed a lot better.

258
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,030
They went into the yard looking important.

259
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,430
Miss.

260
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,120
What are you doing here?

261
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,870
I'm here to pay the debt.

262
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,890
A few days ago, my girlfriend ran into some difficulties.

263
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,800
You helped her to pay her debt.

264
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,390
I now can repay it even specifically two fold.

265
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,500
Hopefully Boss Jiang will have mercy

266
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,930
and let my girlfriend leave.

267
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,800
I'm not that great as you said.

268
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,630
Wu Cai Hong and I, one was the willing seller and the other was the willing buyer.

269
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,610
It was a mutual agreement.

270
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,590
Boss Jiang, let's not exchange words lightl

271
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,440
I'm here today to take Cai Hong away. Money is not the issue.

272
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,950
Name double, triple, or five times the price.

273
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,420
I'm not accepting the offer. We don't lack any money. Who cares how much money you have.

274
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,550
I have only two words. Not selling.

275
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,400
You have enough maids here.

276
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,880
Why are you insisting on not letting Wu Cai Hong go?

277
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,830
The debt is repayed.

278
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,000
It will be easier and more convenient for all of you.

279
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,660
Yes, you are right. Wu Cai Hong is my family's maid.

280
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,470
If I want her to stay, I will let her stay,

281
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,360
It's up to me when I will kick her out.

282
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,470
Can you control this?

283
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,900
You do not like drafts.

284
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,190
I did not know that real money was this important to Boss Jiang.

285
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,340
I brought this here with sincerity.

286
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,550
I hope that you will accept this.

287
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,820
Why didn't you bring me this money earlier?

288
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,340
You are here only just now?

289
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,030
You are too late. Let me repeat myself.

290
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,100
I'm not a good person except that I'm rich.

291
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,600
Take your valuables and

292
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,970
be good and get out of here now.

293
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,050
Don't let your mother worry about you. Be good.

294
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,320
This is not the first time I stepped through your main entrance.

295
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,040
I'm here today to take Wu Cai Hong with me.

296
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,110
I spoke nicely to you but you don't want to listen.

297
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,560
Do not eat anything and live as a monk.

298
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,010
Are you threatening me?

299
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,280
Did you think that by saying a few cruel words, I would be scared of you?

300
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,510
Aren't you going out now? Do you want to see the both of them

301
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,720
fight because of you?

302
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,270
Go and leave with your man to a far place and don't rely on this house for help.

303
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,370
Go now.

304
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,750
Cai Hong.

305
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,440
Are you okay?

306
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,250
Are you okay?

307
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,070
I'm fine.

308
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,030
Trying to snatch her away?

309
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,120
What right do you have?

310
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,550
Are you okay?

311
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,230
I'm fine, Brother Shao Tian.

312
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,520
They are only here to carry the chests.

313
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,130
If you want to fight, let's meet on the outside of Warlord Lu's garrison.

314
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,910
I can always invite them in.

315
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,550
Huzhou has many things to buy and sell,

316
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,960
we should leave it to the police to handle this.

317
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,540
I personally do not want to call Department Director Li Li.

318
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,730
Fine.

319
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,880
Brother Shao Tian, Frankly,

320
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,410
I'm doing well here. It's not what you think.

321
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,950
Cai Hong, don't be foolish. You are like a lamb entering the door of a tiger. Don't you know this?

322
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,710
Don't let this family fool you.

323
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,590
It doesn't matter. He and I signed an agreement.

324
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:00,130
I volunteered my fingerprints.
<i>signed with my own will. </i>

325
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,090
I really don't want to cause any trouble. Please help me this time.

326
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,260
Brother Shao Tian.

327
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,980
Can you guarantee that you will be safe here?

328
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,970
Okay, I will listen to you. I will go back first today

329
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,730
but I will definitely take you out from here.

330
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,010
Fei Fei, come out.

331
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,430
Send the guest off.

332
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,610
Mr Zhou, let's go.

333
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,150
Take care.

334
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,030
Mr Zhou, please take care.

335
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,130
Even though you have prospered

336
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,570
if you want to take away a member of the Jiang family,

337
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,530
it doesn't seem to be that easy.

338
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Miss Fang. Earlier you said you were a member of the Jiang family.

339
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,090
Earlier this may have been true. However,

340
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,470
unless you marry Jiang Yu and become his wife,

341
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:15,390
why don't you tell the members of the Jiang family that you will forever be an outsider?

342
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,430
You are someone who can't even take away his girlfriend.

343
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:24,240
What right do you have to say this about me?

344
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,570
Yes. It's because I couldn't do this

345
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,550
that I need your help.

346
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,080
Why should I help you?

347
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,980
Because you will be helping yourself by helping me. We will both get our benefits.

348
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,220
What a joke. You are my brother's enemy.

349
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,790
If I help you, I will be betraying my brother.

350
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,970
Frankly, you have already helped me many times.

351
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,620
Every time when I couldn't find Cai Hong, you were the one who told me her whereabouts.

352
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,480
I know that there is only one reason.

353
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,760
It's because you don't want Jiang Yu and Cai Hong to be alone together.

354
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,770
Now that Cai Hong is already staying at the Jiang's home,

355
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,200
if you don't want to have any regrets, you should help me.

356
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,940
Then, what can I help you with this time?

357
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:19,400
The contract to let Cai Hong go, get it for me.

358
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,590
Impossible. I can't help you with this.

359
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,790
You can do it

360
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:28,900
unless you want Cai Hong to be the lady of the house.

361
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,510
When that time comes, I'm afraid that you will regret it.

362
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,850
Think carefully over what I said.

363
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,920
I believe you will help me.

364
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,550
What makes you so sure?

365
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:47,090
Because what I want is Wu Cai Hong. As for you,

366
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,720
what you want is Jiang Yu.

367
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Are you angry that I didn't agree to Shao Tiao terms of exchange?

368
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,890
If not, you would have been free.

369
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,080
The contract I voluntarily signed.

370
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,870
I will take the consequences.

371
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,640
I won't be angry with you.

372
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,430
It's good that you think this way.

373
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,100
He suddenly brought so much money to buy you.

374
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,250
Don't you find it strange?

375
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:51,940
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

376
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,580
Brother.

377
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,290
Brother. Why didn't you allow Shao Tian

378
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,710
to take away Wu Cai Hong? His asking price was very high.

379
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,230
Do we lack money?

380
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,430
We do not lack money. You don't lack bristles. <i>supplies</i>

381
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:30,210
I just don't want him to take her away. Is there a problem?

382
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,190
Brother. Because of Wu Cai Hong,

383
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,560
are you not afraid of offending Warlord Lu?

384
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,680
I didn't do anything wrong. What should I be afraid of?

385
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,530
As you run this business, we want to run it harmoniously.

386
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:47,220
Even if you didn't do anything wrong, you can just randomly offend anyone.

387
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,810
Your play thing might offend Warlord Lu.

388
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,190
Is it worth it because of Wu Cai Hong?

389
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,270
Don't be afraid. I have my own methods.

390
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,660
I know that you have your own methods

391
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,470
but this is not your usual style of doing things.

392
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,810
In any case, you don't need to worry.

393
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,450
<i>Our family doesn't lack any money. Who cares how much money you have.</i>

394
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,570
<i>I only have two words. Not selling.</i>

395
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,070
<i>Yes, you are right. Wu Cai Hong is my family's maid.</i>

396
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,700
<i>It's up to me whether she stays or I kick her out.</i>

397
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,910
<i>Can you control when I will kick her out?</i>

398
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:42,260
<i>Brother Shao Tian.</i>

399
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,400
<i>I'm doing well at the Jiang's home. Don't worry about me.</i>

400
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,800
- Brother.
- Ah Li. You are here just in time.

401
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,670
About Jiang Yu's father, Jiang Wen Yuan's case,

402
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,600
I found some of their staff during that year and asked them about this.

403
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,740
Jiang Wen Yuan collaborated with foreigners privately selling them opium.

404
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,540
After the incident, Jiang Wen Yuan died in fear of punishment.

405
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,740
Some people said that Jiang Wen Yuan was a kind man. He could have been framed.

406
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,030
And that year, the person in charge of investigating Jiang Wen Yuan's case was Wu Hong Da.

407
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,950
When Jiang Wen Yuan died, Wu Hong Da took over Ling Long.

408
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,820
Was Jiang Wen Yuan framed then?

409
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,040
Also, he and Wu Hong Da,

410
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,230
what was their relationship?

411
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,740
About this, the old staff of Ling Long are not very clear about this.

412
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,150
But I have asked several people. They said that Jiang Wen Yuan was a good man.

413
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,240
The older employees were consulted.

414
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,390
What do they know?

415
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,190
What we need most now

416
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,700
is to confirm the evidence.

417
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,000
I will continue to investigate thoroughly.

418
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,690
Only it has been a long time.

419
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:58,200
You have a wide range of experience being in the middle.

420
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,970
After all the experience ranges from the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of the Regime.

421
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,260
Finding it will be very difficult. We need time.

422
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,460
Ah Li. Send more help

423
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,260
and investigate this as soon as possible. This is very important.

424
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,710
I know. I will do it fast.

425
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,540
I'm leaving first.

426
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,960
Uncle Lai.

427
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,410
That man just now is Zhou Shao Tian's confidant.

428
00:34:56,410 --> 00:35:00,150
Zhou Shao Tian seems to be investigating something.

429
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,250
Find someone to follow him and investigate this.

430
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,570
What is their close relationship?

431
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,520
By the way, keep a low profile.

432
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,310
Don't stir up anything.

433
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,990
Mr. Zhou. You have already looked at the house.

434
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,090
Other than the price being a bit expensive, there is nothing to be picky about.

435
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,300
But then again, the price is high.

436
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,000
There is a reason for it being expensive. Don't you think so?

437
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,040
You don't have to tell me about the benefits of this mansion.

438
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,920
I know this better than you.

439
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,920
You are right. I should never question the Master.

440
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,380
Of course, you are very familiar with this house but talking about this,

441
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,670
this Old Wu, not only does he look at the house and the person,

442
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,380
I heard he looks at the potential.

443
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,400
From the get-go Master Wu saw your potential.

444
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,500
Mr Zhou. You prospered on your own ability, right?

445
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,370
To add further, not everyone could afford to buy this mansion.

446
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,750
Since Mr. Zhou has money on his hands, you don't necessarily have to buy this house.

447
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,660
There are other mansions designed in Huzhou to do business.

448
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:24,140
If you are not happy, I will show you others. So how?

449
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,740
I want to reserve this.

450
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,580
Make an appointment with the owner now to discuss the price.

451
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,220
Mr. Zhou is a frank person. The price,

452
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,350
I already discussed with the existing owner of the house.

453
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,170
It's $1 million.

454
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,330
This price seems to be higher than the market rate.

455
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,130
But don't go to the trouble anymore.

456
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,890
Who told me to like this?

457
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,300
Mr Zhou. You are right. It's hard for this house to meet someone who likes it.

458
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,300
If you like it, then you should snatch it first. If not, someone else will take it.

459
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,470
To add further, everyone in Huzhou knows that

460
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,970
you have prospered. Don't even talk about this house.

461
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,700
You have the final say in the company, Rong Da.

462
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,540
Old Zhang. You don't need to flatter me. Let's do it fast.

463
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,940
Make an appointment with the owner of the house tomorrow.

464
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,140
Don't worry, I will do a good job.

465
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,230
Brother.

466
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,960
What's wrong? What's the matter?

467
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,930
Nothing. Can't I see you without any reason?

468
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,490
Okay, I have something to tell you.

469
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,110
Speak.

470
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,040
With Rong Da, you don't let me pay attention to Zhou Shao Tian anymore.

471
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,940
I didn't investigate the others yet but recently,

472
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,190
he planned to buy the Wu family's house. The deal is almost done.

473
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,390
Looks like this Zhou Shao Tian

474
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,780
really has deep feelings for Wu Cai Hong.

475
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,450
If not, he wouldn't use the money

476
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,450
to buy her previous house.

477
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,780
I think Wu Cai Hong also

478
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,890
has deep feelings for Shao Tian,

479
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,850
to become his wife.

480
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,900
This infatuation of love is in the wrong place when it comes to local business dealings.

481
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,390
Tell Wu Cai Hong to leave with me in an hour's time.

482
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,490
Where are you taking her? I want to go too.

483
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:30,150
Stay at home.

484
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,440
Where are you taking me again?

485
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,610
Don't ask anything. You will know later.

486
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:48,170
Come with me.

487
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:00,370
<i>Wu Cai Hong. What Shao Tian said is right.</i>

488
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,700
<i>I will kick you out from the Jiang home as soon as possible.</i>

489
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,700
Mr. Jiang.

490
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,960
Director Chen Suo.

491
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,800
Minister Lee explained everything to me.

492
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,620
It has been hard on you.

493
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,120
Where are we going?

494
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:25,040
I don't know what the schedule is for today either. I believe Mr Jiang has already made the arrangements.

495
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,580
Let's go.

496
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:36,820
- Mr Jiang, hello.
- Boss Qian, hello.

497
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,780
What brings you here today? Is there anything you need, your wish is my command.

498
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,770
Please don't ever say this.

499
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,340
Director Chen Suo, you came with Boss Jiang.

500
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,410
What's the matter?

501
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:52,000
Since you have such a good relationship with Mr Jiang, I won't say much.

502
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,310
Mr Jiang, please.

503
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,960
Boss Qian, I would like to ask you.

504
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:01,370
Did Zhou Shao Tian borrow any money from you lately?

505
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,960
In the past, he borrowed $200,000 from me.

506
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,280
He only returned the money after a long period of time.

507
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,380
I dare not lend him any money again.

508
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,140
Thus, he has already returned fully what he has borrowed in the past?

509
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,260
Yes. Zhou Shao Tian could have prospered lately

510
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,850
after he became the General Manager of Rong Da.
