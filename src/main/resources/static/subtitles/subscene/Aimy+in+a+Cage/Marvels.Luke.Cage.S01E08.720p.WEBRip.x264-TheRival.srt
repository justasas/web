00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:13,850
- [Claire] Luke, stay with me.
- [groaning]

3
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:16,937
Breathe. Breathe. Just breathe.

4
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:22,693
Don't move. Okay? I've got you.

5
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,197
[groaning loudly]

6
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:40,669
[engine starting]

7
00:00:50,178 --> 00:00:51,930
[breathing heavily]

8
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:09,239
Hey there, you.

9
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:14,160
- [straining]
- Okay.

10
00:01:14,244 --> 00:01:15,746
Come on.

11
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:17,497
Relax.

12
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:19,124
[breathing heavily]

13
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:20,291
Relax. You're okay.

14
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:23,920
- Where am I?
- Uh, you're in an ambulance.

15
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:25,922
You went into shock.

16
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:27,924
I called my friend Manny.

17
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:29,843
He used to run with my uncle
back in the day.

18
00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:31,261
He's driving. He's discreet.

19
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:33,138
[groans] What the hell
did you do that for?

20
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,598
- What do you mean?
- No hospitals.

21
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:38,644
- I can't be in the system.
- He borrowed it.

22
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:40,771
Like I said, he's discreet.

23
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:43,273
But you bleeding out
in the back of a gypsy cab?

24
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:45,233
That would get even more attention.

25
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:48,737
We need to keep you safe. Drink this.

26
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,989
You can't dehydrate.

27
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:58,079
I saw you looking for the shooter
before you passed out.

28
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:00,206
Did you see who it was?

29
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:01,917
No.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,584
- [groans]
- On a scale from one to ten,

31
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:05,086
how much pain are you in right now?

32
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:08,089
[breathing heavily] Three.

33
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:10,133
Liar.

34
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:11,927
I'm okay.

35
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:14,304
You're not okay.

36
00:02:15,388 --> 00:02:18,183
The bullet penetrated through your skin.
I didn't even think that could happen.

37
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:22,145
That makes two of us.

38
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:26,066
[breath trembling]

39
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:28,526
- I looked for an exit wound, but...
- I know.

40
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:30,821
It's still in there.

41
00:02:32,656 --> 00:02:36,159
The sound that it made,
like it was drilling into you...

42
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:39,120
I wanna get a closer look.

43
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:42,791
See what's going on inside of you.
I know a place.

44
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:47,796
[Luke] Whatever we gotta do.

45
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:51,925
[gunshot]

46
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:14,865
[theme music playing]

47
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,561
- [Luke] You okay?
- [Claire] Yeah.

48
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:29,564
- [both groan]
- Manny?

49
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:30,899
[Manny] Who was that son of a bitch?

50
00:04:30,982 --> 00:04:33,819
- [groans] Are you okay?
- I'll be fine.

51
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:35,445
But somebody took a shot at us.

52
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:38,031
You guys got to get out of here. Go!

53
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:40,700
[groans]

54
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:54,005
[Claire] Watch out.

55
00:04:54,714 --> 00:04:56,132
[both grunting]

56
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:04,349
Can you dig it?

57
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,602
[Claire] What the hell?

58
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,606
Every Friday night at the drive-in.

59
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:14,442
<i>The Warriors.</i>

60
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,156
[sing-song] Carl, come out and play.

61
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:24,995
- You know him, don't you?
- [sirens wailing in distance]

62
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:31,376
[man] I'm enjoying this shit, Carl.

63
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,003
Keep running.

64
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,257
[grunts]

65
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,717
[Claire whispering] Luke, hey.

66
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,594
You can't fight him yet, Luke.

67
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:43,554
[panting]

68
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:45,140
You're too weak right now.

69
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:47,100
Come on.

70
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:02,073
I didn't want it!

71
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:06,619
[yells and breathes heavily]

72
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:10,165
[Shades] You having second thoughts?

73
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:19,757
[Shades sighs]

74
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:23,303
What's on your mind?

75
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:27,682
I'm not having any thoughts.

76
00:06:28,683 --> 00:06:29,850
Is that normal?

77
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:33,021
As long as you stay on the clock,
it doesn't matter.

78
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:39,735
<i>The secret to every great lie</i>
<i>is it has to run parallel to the truth.</i>

79
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:43,698
Every moment wasted
brings you one step closer to jail.

80
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:45,908
So what do we do?

81
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:50,496
[Shades] <i>DNA is our friend...</i>
<i>and our enemy.</i>

82
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,290
<i>We must treat her carefully.</i>

83
00:06:52,373 --> 00:06:55,168
Head straight to the bathroom
and clean up.

84
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:57,170
I don't have any clothes.

85
00:06:57,253 --> 00:07:00,215
I had Alex take care of it.
They're in there.

86
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:04,635
<i>- To make this stick, we'll need a patsy.</i>
- [camera shutter clicking]

87
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:12,936
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

88
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,520
Karma is a cruel mistress.

89
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:18,108
She does not like being a side chick.
She eventually gets hers.

90
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:20,235
- Brace yourself.
- It's that bad?

91
00:07:20,318 --> 00:07:21,361
Yeah.

92
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,449
Did you forget anything?

93
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:28,284
The bottle.

94
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:29,660
[Mariah screams] No!

95
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:33,581
I hit him on the head with a bottle.

96
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,875
Did it break?

97
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:39,504
- No.
- That's good.

98
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,590
[Misty] Make sure we photograph the stage.

99
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:45,385
Compare the photos
with the last performance filmed here.

100
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:47,637
See if there's anything missing.

101
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,598
Microphone stand, a monitor, anything.

102
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:54,185
What do you think? You're the visualist.

103
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:02,152
[Misty] <i>You see all that trauma</i>
<i>to the head and the face?</i>

104
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:04,779
<i>The fall couldn't have done that.</i>
<i>It's not enough height.</i>

105
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:07,948
[groans]

106
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:12,953
[groaning]

107
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:16,791
[Stokes breathing heavily]

108
00:08:16,874 --> 00:08:18,959
[Misty] <i>But he's not dead yet.</i>

109
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,008
So let's say our perp did hit him
over and over again

110
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:27,468
with a blunt instrument until he's dead.

111
00:08:27,552 --> 00:08:30,263
The trash bag is for the clothes
you're wearing.

112
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:33,391
Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too.

113
00:08:33,474 --> 00:08:35,601
Spurlock will incinerate them.

114
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:40,440
The towels you use, the rugs...
They all go in that trash bag.

115
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:44,735
Get dressed from the clothes
in the garment bag.

116
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,197
I look like I'm in shock.

117
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:51,617
Is that why you're speaking to me
as if I'm a child?

118
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:54,912
I need you to hear me.

119
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:57,123
I want you to win.

120
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,917
Do what I say...

121
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:02,420
and when you get away with this...

122
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:06,382
you can go back to being the sexy...

123
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:10,803
domineering bitch...
that we all hate to love.

124
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:13,348
Now go.

125
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:18,228
[sighs and sniffles]

126
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:29,780
That's the last time
you will ever call me a bitch.

127
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:39,039
Look at what you did.

128
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,961
Destroying the face...

129
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:46,131
[grunting]

130
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:48,466
...that's rage.

131
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:52,095
But walking away
without leaving a trail of blood?

132
00:09:52,178 --> 00:09:53,554
Who's ever done that?

133
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:55,765
Temper, temper, Carl.

134
00:10:03,814 --> 00:10:06,192
[Misty] Councilwoman Dillard,
my condolences.

135
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:08,903
Oh, please.

136
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:12,907
My cousin's still laid out on the floor
and you're talking about condolences.

137
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,617
What's the condolence? The sheet?

138
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,912
I think you're taking this personally.

139
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:19,205
Why aren't you?

140
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:25,336
We are working as fast as we can.

141
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,297
They said you called this in.

142
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:34,720
Around noon, I called Cornell
and told him that we needed to talk.

143
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:38,266
He said he was busy
and that he would get back to me.

144
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:41,519
So I went in to work.
I mean, what could I do?

145
00:10:42,728 --> 00:10:45,856
Thanks to him,
I had a million fires to put out.

146
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:50,361
Around 10:00,
I realized that I hadn't heard back so...

147
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:52,155
[inhales]

148
00:10:52,238 --> 00:10:53,864
I decided to come here.

149
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:57,327
"Thanks to him." So you were mad.

150
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:02,373
Frustrated, yes. Mad? Never.

151
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:08,713
He was my first cousin,
but I practically raised that boy.

152
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:13,551
I loved him.

153
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:17,472
So when you got here
was the door locked?

154
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:24,144
There is a code on the VIP entrance.
It keeps the paparazzi away.

155
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:25,563
It changes every week.

156
00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:28,107
Yes, I had access.

157
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,568
So you let yourself in. Then what?

158
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:36,699
Then I found him,
sprawled out like a goddamn rag doll.

159
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:39,660
So he was already dead
when you got here.

160
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:43,373
Yeah.

161
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,043
But then I heard someone else crying.

162
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,004
Who?

163
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,091
Candace. [sobbing]

164
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:56,761
[sniffles] Candace Miller.

165
00:11:56,844 --> 00:11:59,472
Candace is Cornell's VIP hostess.

166
00:12:00,556 --> 00:12:04,226
Candy's worked here at Harlem's Paradise
since we re-opened.

167
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:14,904
Ms. Miller...
I'm Detective Misty Knight.

168
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:17,239
What did you see?

169
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:20,785
Take your time to collect your thoughts.

170
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:24,038
I don't need time. I saw who did it.

171
00:12:24,121 --> 00:12:25,706
It was Luke Cage.

172
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,177
[reporters clamoring]

173
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:43,140
[reporter 1] Councilwoman!
[reporter 2] Right here! Over here!

174
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:46,936
[reporter 3] Can you confirm that
it was Luke Cage who killed your cousin?

175
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:48,563
Is Harlem's hero a cold-blooded murderer?

176
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:49,939
Or did he just take out the trash?

177
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:51,607
- [Mariah] Who said that?
- I did. Frank...

178
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:56,153
My cousin Cornell Stokes
was a complex man.

179
00:12:56,236 --> 00:13:00,658
Conflicted, but underneath all the bluster
was the soul of a musician.

180
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:04,161
<i>He was a true Harlem original.</i>

181
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:07,206
[stammers] But what about this stranger?
That's the garbage.

182
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:10,793
But in your media rush
to anoint a savior after the explosion

183
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:15,214
at Genghis Connie's,
no one asked the crucial question.

184
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:18,258
Who the hell is Luke Cage?

185
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:21,721
You label Cornell Stokes
a gangster, a thug.

186
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:25,683
<i>But as many people</i>
<i>recently witnessed at Mount Olivet,</i>

187
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:29,520
<i>Cornell was a repentant man</i>
<i>dealing with his violent past.</i>

188
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:31,439
<i>Making amends for his wrongs.</i>

189
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:35,150
<i>He had every intention of...</i>
<i>of cooperating with the police.</i>

190
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:38,028
Goddamn vigilantes
who call themselves heroes,

191
00:13:38,112 --> 00:13:41,699
like Luke Cage, they are dangerous.

192
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:44,326
<i>They are a menace</i>
<i>to the safety, the security,</i>

193
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,997
<i>and the sanctity of our community.</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

194
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,207
People have used a lot of words
to describe my cousin,

195
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,168
but one word they have
never used is "coward."

196
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:55,630
<i>And only a coward</i>
<i>would hide in the shadows</i>

197
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:57,757
and kill an innocent man.
[stutters] That's it.

198
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,841
[reporters clamoring]

199
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:02,052
[reporter] One more question.
Councilwoman, was he innocent?

200
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,638
[clamoring continues]

201
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:06,807
[Luke breathing heavily]

202
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:10,102
[Claire] That guy's putting
innocent people in danger to get at you.

203
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:15,650
I'm gonna put a stop to it,
but I need your help.

204
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:20,696
[groaning]

205
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:23,533
[breathing heavily]

206
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:29,497
Hold on to this. I can't lose it.

207
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,831
[Claire] Okay.

208
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:35,711
[groans]

209
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:42,009
[Claire] I'm going to sterilize the area.

210
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,766
[wincing]

211
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:51,477
- You feel that?
- [groans] A bit.

212
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:54,188
Keep going.

213
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:56,524
No. I'm gonna see what kind
of anesthetic they have here first.

214
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:58,568
- No drugs.
- Luke...

215
00:14:58,651 --> 00:15:00,611
I can't be compromised.

216
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:03,573
Innocent people could die.
I can't risk it.

217
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:06,992
All right, macho man.

218
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:09,620
Actually, it's Power Man.

219
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:12,331
That's what Pop used to call me.
[chuckles]

220
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:15,125
- That's even cornier.
- [chuckling]

221
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:16,251
[groans]

222
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:18,546
Okay.

223
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:21,799
- I'm going in.
- [groaning]

224
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:27,888
All right,
I'm gonna press even harder, okay?

225
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:32,101
[Luke groaning]

226
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:35,438
[scalpel scraping]

227
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:37,397
[Luke groans]

228
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:40,776
Wild.

229
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:42,862
This is supposed to be soft tissue,

230
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:45,865
but it's almost
as impenetrable as your skin.

231
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:47,407
Give it to me.

232
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,455
[breathes deeply]

233
00:15:57,877 --> 00:15:59,169
[scraping]

234
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:00,379
[Luke groaning]

235
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:03,591
[exhales]

236
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:05,300
[scraping]

237
00:16:05,384 --> 00:16:06,969
- [breathing heavily]
- [scalpel clanging]

238
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,597
[grunts]

239
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,973
I gotta get it out.

240
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:13,726
It's getting hard to breathe.

241
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,937
Okay, let's look inside.

242
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:27,990
[door closes]

243
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:30,826
[Misty] Anybody waiting for you at home?

244
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,202
My parents.

245
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:34,747
I'm moving out
as soon as I finish night school.

246
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,831
Nice.

247
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:40,294
The quicker you answer my questions,
the quicker you can go. Okay?

248
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:41,504
Okay.

249
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:44,799
State your name and address
for the record.

250
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:47,342
Candace Miller. 555 Edgecombe Avenue.

251
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:49,720
- How do you know Mr. Stokes?
- He was my boss.

252
00:16:49,804 --> 00:16:52,932
- I noticed your hair was wet.
- I took a shower.

253
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:56,811
Crime scene officers combed
every inch of Harlem's Paradise.

254
00:16:56,894 --> 00:16:58,228
We also noticed that the shower

255
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:00,648
in Mr. Stokes' private bathroom
had been used.

256
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:02,608
- I used it.
- When?

257
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:05,277
After I was saw Mr. Stokes.

258
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:09,364
So, you're one of his... friends?

259
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:11,992
Yes.

260
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:14,620
He has several?

261
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:18,833
So I assume you have his code
for his private entrance.

262
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,043
What private entrance?

263
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:22,670
[door opens]

264
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:26,090
Don't say another word, Ms. Miller.
I'm representing you now.

265
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:27,925
Is this snake your lawyer?

266
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:32,512
Candace, if you're not guilty,
you'll answer my questions.

267
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:34,974
Nice try. My client isn't under arrest.

268
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:36,516
- Ms. Miller...
- I'm not guilty.

269
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:37,852
What else do you want to know?

270
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:39,436
Ms. Miller, don't say another word.

271
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,065
We used luminol and found traces of blood
in Mr. Stokes' shower,

272
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:45,610
even though it had been heavily bleached.

273
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:46,694
Stand up and walk out.

274
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:48,904
It's a good thing
you got this high-powered flunky.

275
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:51,281
I'm about to nail your ass to the wall.

276
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:52,950
It was Luke Cage!

277
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:56,453
[sighs]

278
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:03,377
After I showered,
I came out to see Cornell.

279
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,671
I still needed my paycheck.

280
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,592
I heard loud voices and a struggle.

281
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:11,135
That's when I walked out

282
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:14,013
and I saw Mr. Stokes
down below on the floor.

283
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:15,472
[sighs]

284
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:20,144
Luke Cage saw me and ran away.

285
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:23,689
He was wearing bright yellow gloves,

286
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:26,984
like the kind he used to use
when he washed dishes.

287
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:30,404
And you're positive it was Luke Cage?

288
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:32,406
You would know.

289
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:35,075
I saw you two at the bar together
the other night.

290
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,119
I saw you talking outside, too.

291
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:39,038
May I go now?

292
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:42,082
Candace, look me in the eye.

293
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:48,047
You were too scared to go upstairs
and serve Cottonmouth without Luke.

294
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,258
Table number seven, right?

295
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:53,552
And then you started sleeping with him?

296
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:56,806
But you still call him Mr. Stokes.

297
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:58,974
And you can't even tell me
about his private entrance.

298
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:03,395
What do they have on you, huh?
Is it money?

299
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:04,772
How much are they paying you?

300
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:07,441
This is over. We're done.

301
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:11,445
Your delivery arrived right on time.

302
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:14,156
Yes, thank you.

303
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,492
Okay, gotta go.

304
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:20,620
- [sighs]
- You killed it out there.

305
00:19:21,914 --> 00:19:23,958
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

306
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,877
Just get that clip up
on the website within the hour.

307
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:30,005
Send the link to all my supporters,
the donors.

308
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:33,383
- If we play this right...
- [slow clapping]

309
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:36,721
And the Oscar goes to...

310
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:39,014
Alex, would you wait in the car with Tony?

311
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:45,980
Detective, do you have a problem?

312
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:47,898
Just call 'em like I see 'em.

313
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:50,484
So you have your suspect, Luke Cage.

314
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:53,362
Who says I only have one suspect?

315
00:19:53,445 --> 00:19:56,031
You ready for our interview?

316
00:19:56,115 --> 00:19:59,659
Your cousin was attacked
by somebody he was close to.

317
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:01,829
That's what those wounds tell me.

318
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:04,707
It was passion. And hatred.

319
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:08,961
And Luke Cage didn't hate my cousin...
and me,

320
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:12,631
when he showed up at my brownstone
trying to intimidate me?

321
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:14,674
What do you have on Candace?

322
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:17,469
What do you have on me?

323
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:22,808
Other than the fact
that your edges are a little damp?

324
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:28,898
That's what I thought.
You ain't got shit.

325
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:30,733
You know what?

326
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:34,486
I'm not under arrest,
and I changed my mind.

327
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:37,364
You want to talk to me,
you call my lawyer.

328
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:39,950
[sighs]

329
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:43,162
Where's your partner?

330
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:44,955
Oh, I forgot.

331
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,623
- Sorry.
- Who the hell

332
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:48,918
- do you think you're talking to?
- [Ridley] Detective.

333
00:20:49,877 --> 00:20:52,922
Priscilla, you need to teach
your people some manners.

334
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:55,758
Mariah, I'm so sorry for your loss.

335
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,010
- Thank you for being there for me.
- Of course.

336
00:20:58,093 --> 00:21:00,888
Oh. It has been a very hard day.

337
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:03,432
- I'm sure.
- Hey.

338
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:05,642
Are you gonna make it
to the Founders' Day Lunch at Cecil's?

339
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:07,895
- You know I'll be there.
- Oh, great.

340
00:21:07,978 --> 00:21:09,729
[Mariah chuckles]

341
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:13,442
[whispers] Bye-bye.

342
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:18,823
You hugged her.

343
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:22,201
She's my soror. I had to.

344
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:23,953
You like Mariah for this?

345
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:26,705
- I do.
- You have an eyewitness, Detective.

346
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:30,209
- Who I can't trust.
- Who puts Luke Cage in the box.

347
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,002
The evidence points to two suspects.

348
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:34,254
One of them was someone
Cottonmouth was close to.

349
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:35,881
Because the door was locked?

350
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:38,508
Because they got to gangster number one
without catching a bullet.

351
00:21:38,592 --> 00:21:39,759
Come on!

352
00:21:40,677 --> 00:21:44,098
- Mariah called us.
- Then she called the press.

353
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:46,725
And she put Luke Cage on blast.

354
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:49,353
Look, I was just about to compel her
to make a statement

355
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:52,439
before you let your little soror
skee-wee on out of here.

356
00:21:52,522 --> 00:21:53,941
Where is Cage?

357
00:21:54,524 --> 00:21:57,444
Because Mariah's not going anywhere,
guilty or not.

358
00:21:57,527 --> 00:22:00,322
But your real number-one suspect is ghost.

359
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:03,450
What are you gonna do about it?

360
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:15,963
- [Luke gasping]
- [Claire] Okay.

361
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:19,799
[breathing heavily]

362
00:22:21,844 --> 00:22:24,054
[heart beating]

363
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,266
[Luke] Is it a boy or a girl?

364
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:28,767
[Claire chuckles]

365
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,978
It's either twins or you need
to start doing some sit-ups.

366
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:32,271
[chuckles]

367
00:22:32,354 --> 00:22:34,023
[groaning]

368
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:41,655
What is it?

369
00:22:41,738 --> 00:22:44,992
There's no bullet. It's just shrapnel.

370
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:47,119
Yeah, the bullet drilled into your skin
and exploded.

371
00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:49,829
All the pieces that are left
are just trapped.

372
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:52,166
How much?

373
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,002
A lot. And they're moving.

374
00:22:55,085 --> 00:22:56,878
We couldn't get the scalpel in.

375
00:22:56,962 --> 00:22:58,797
How you gonna take the bullet out?

376
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:01,758
Remember when Jessica shot you?

377
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:04,803
I've been trying to forget that. [sighs]

378
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:07,847
[sighs] Well, I drained the fluid
in your skull

379
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:09,516
by going behind your eye socket.

380
00:23:11,768 --> 00:23:13,187
I'll figure this out.

381
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,314
- [cell phone vibrating]
- [sighs]

382
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:18,525
Blocked ID.

383
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:21,946
Whoever it is has called three times.

384
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:23,405
- See who it is.
- [cell phone beeps]

385
00:23:23,488 --> 00:23:26,241
- Hello?
- Hello?

386
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:28,702
This is Detective Misty Knight.
Who is this?

387
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:32,497
Uh, Claire Temple. Um...

388
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:35,584
We met the other night.
I'm the nurse with the van...

389
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,962
and, uh... Scarfe.

390
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:40,380
[Luke] <i>Misty.</i>

391
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:41,840
I need you to come down to the station.

392
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:44,384
We've already been through this.

393
00:23:44,468 --> 00:23:45,469
No.

394
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:47,846
<i>Cottonmouth's dead.</i>

395
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:52,351
He was killed earlier tonight.

396
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:55,270
<i>I need you to come down</i>
<i>to answer some questions.</i>

397
00:23:55,354 --> 00:23:56,730
You think I did it?

398
00:23:56,813 --> 00:23:58,565
A witness puts you at the scene.

399
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:01,401
- Oh, this has got to be a joke.
<i>- Claire, stay out of this.</i>

400
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:03,445
He's been with me all night.

401
00:24:03,528 --> 00:24:04,821
<i>He hasn't killed anyone.</i>

402
00:24:04,904 --> 00:24:08,325
[Misty] Luke, listen,
I've got crime scene guys

403
00:24:08,408 --> 00:24:10,910
combing through the barber shop
and the apartment upstairs.

404
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:13,205
<i>Just make it easier on yourself, okay?</i>

405
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:16,375
Claire, hang up.
They're trying to trace the call.

406
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,751
[phone beeps]

407
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:20,212
Luke. Luke!

408
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:23,465
They're close. I've got a target area.

409
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:25,175
He's near the park.
Do you want to send a unit?

410
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:26,801
No. What's in the area?

411
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:29,054
Uh, a few shops, a women's clinic.

412
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:34,518
- I know that look. You're about to...
- I'm bringing him in myself.

413
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:36,853
I didn't finish my sentence, Misty.

414
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:39,273
You're about to do something stupid.
Don't.

415
00:24:39,356 --> 00:24:41,858
Listen, don't tell the inspector.

416
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:43,152
Don't tell anybody.

417
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:19,854
[Shades] I thought you went back
down south, Sugar.

418
00:25:19,938 --> 00:25:22,857
Ain't nothing down there for me.
I'm back.

419
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:24,901
What do you guys want?

420
00:25:24,984 --> 00:25:27,821
[Zip] Well, Cottonmouth's gone, so...

421
00:25:27,904 --> 00:25:29,364
Yeah.

422
00:25:29,448 --> 00:25:31,616
You guys did a real bang up job
protecting him.

423
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,453
What are you talking about?
He sent us away.

424
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:36,996
Anyhow, shit done changed.

425
00:25:37,081 --> 00:25:39,833
So we gonna need to
work out some type of...

426
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:40,917
What?

427
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:43,337
Severance?

428
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:51,303
Y'all work for me now.

429
00:25:51,386 --> 00:25:54,055
- [Amos] What about the club?
- It belongs to Mariah.

430
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:56,850
But I'm in charge.

431
00:25:57,892 --> 00:25:59,561
Do you understand?

432
00:26:03,482 --> 00:26:04,608
Good.

433
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:06,943
And do me a favor.

434
00:26:08,987 --> 00:26:10,572
Buy some new clothes.

435
00:26:11,615 --> 00:26:12,866
Please.

436
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:14,951
We're first class all the way.

437
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:20,124
You ain't worried about Luke Cage?

438
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:21,416
[sighs]

439
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:25,837
Leave.

440
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:37,349
[takes deep breath]

441
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:04,918
[camera shutter clicks]

442
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:08,213
[Luke breathing heavily]

443
00:27:15,554 --> 00:27:17,138
We gotta hurry.

444
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:19,349
I just want to examine
your soft tissue cells,

445
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:21,810
see if there's another way in
I haven't thought of yet.

446
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:23,102
[Luke] Just make it quick.

447
00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:25,647
Holy shit.

448
00:27:27,106 --> 00:27:30,985
Your epithelial cells are simultaneously
super elastic and energy absorbent.

449
00:27:33,863 --> 00:27:36,533
The cells that line your organs

450
00:27:36,616 --> 00:27:38,243
are stuck together like Legos,
which is normal.

451
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:41,580
But when I try to pull them apart,
they snap back together.

452
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:43,415
What does it mean, for real?

453
00:27:43,498 --> 00:27:47,001
[sighs] Don't quote me on this
because I'm not 100% sure,

454
00:27:47,085 --> 00:27:49,754
but it looks like the thing that makes
you super strong is the same thing

455
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:52,299
that's trapping the shrapnel
and forcing it in deeper.

456
00:27:52,382 --> 00:27:53,967
[Misty] Did I miss the party?

457
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,846
Is that a gunshot wound?

458
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:00,390
I thought bullets couldn't hurt you.

459
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:01,891
Join the club.

460
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:04,978
Luke, who shot you?

461
00:28:05,061 --> 00:28:07,063
I never saw him.

462
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:10,359
We were walking in Mount Morris Park.
The shot came out of nowhere.

463
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:13,528
Sniper. Medium range.

464
00:28:13,612 --> 00:28:15,780
I went with him in the ambulance,
but then the shooter attacked.

465
00:28:15,864 --> 00:28:18,950
- We barely got out.
- The ambulance that got flipped over?

466
00:28:20,285 --> 00:28:21,828
Well, then that's your alibi.

467
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:25,374
- Alibi?
- [cell phone vibrates]

468
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:27,208
Hello?

469
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:30,879
Yeah.

470
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:34,966
Okay.

471
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:38,136
Okay.

472
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:40,472
Thanks, Bailey.

473
00:28:45,352 --> 00:28:46,728
Luke Cage...

474
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:51,525
you're under arrest
for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

475
00:28:52,401 --> 00:28:53,943
You're kidding me.

476
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:01,200
Get down!

477
00:29:04,454 --> 00:29:06,122
[whirring]

478
00:29:07,457 --> 00:29:11,378
10-13. Harlem Women's Clinic.
10-13. Shots fired.

479
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:14,839
- [dispatcher] <i>10-13 Harlem Women's Clinic.</i>
- [whirring continues]

00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:16,090

00:29:17,676 --> 00:29:18,677
[breathing heavily]

482
00:29:22,013 --> 00:29:24,349
[Claire] What the hell kind of bullet
does that?

483
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:29,103
I got him!

484
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:40,156
I'm gonna go check it out.

485
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:41,616
Your backup isn't here yet.

486
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,203
When we get through this,
I'm still arresting your ass.

487
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,501
[groaning]

488
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:53,587
You okay?

489
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:56,756
Maybe she got him.

490
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,387
[screaming]

491
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:03,930
[man grunting]

- [Luke] Misty!

00:30:55,357 --> 00:30:57,859
- [gasps]
- Let's spend some time together.

503
00:30:59,235 --> 00:31:00,278
[groans]

504
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:04,240
I see Carl's taste in women
hasn't changed.

505
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:06,993
He likes frizzy hair and a tight frame.

506
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:10,246
Carl? Who's Carl? You mean Luke?

507
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:13,833
No, I mean Carl, Misty.

508
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:16,670
"Your adversary, the devil...

509
00:31:17,629 --> 00:31:20,590
walks around like a roaring lion...

510
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:24,302
seeking whom he may devour."

511
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:25,679
First Peter...

512
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:29,766
chapter five... verse eight.

513
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,438
See... my daddy was a preacher.

514
00:31:36,189 --> 00:31:38,066
Oh, come on. Aren't you gonna beg?

515
00:31:39,526 --> 00:31:41,570
Not even a little bit?

516
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:46,491
If you're going to shoot me, then do it.

517
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:49,202
Hmm.

518
00:31:49,285 --> 00:31:52,330
[groaning] I have to go after him.

519
00:31:52,414 --> 00:31:54,332
Help me up. [grunting]

520
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:01,172
This is my cross to bear.

521
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:03,425
[breathing heavily]
No one else can do this.

522
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:04,509

[Luke in distance] Misty!

[man] You're slowing me down, baby girl.

525
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:33,872
Besides, Luke likes you.

526
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:36,458
I'll hurt you later.

527
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:39,085
- He'll suffer more that way.

00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:46,092
[Luke] Stryker!

530
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:13,452
[Claire] Oh, my God.

531
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:19,709
Go.

532
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:21,044
End this.

533
00:34:18,643 --> 00:34:19,978
[Luke] Stryker?

534
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:25,274
Stryker!

535
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:32,741
[Stryker] You left me to rot, Carl.

536
00:34:37,328 --> 00:34:39,163
We can work this out.

537
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:42,041
[Stryker] Work what out? My life?

538
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:45,003
My mother destroying herself?

539
00:34:46,713 --> 00:34:48,632
Being away for so long?

540
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:51,092
Nah.

541
00:34:52,093 --> 00:34:54,888
There's nothing left to work out.

542
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:58,224
"I did not come to bring peace...

543
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:00,559
but a sword."

544
00:35:02,145 --> 00:35:06,858
Ain't that what the great
Reverend James Lucas used to scream at us?

545
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:10,153
Preached peace and prosperity...

546
00:35:10,236 --> 00:35:13,447
every Sunday on the pulpit,

547
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:16,367
but come Friday night on the sideline?

548
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,788
Nothing but fire and brimstone.

549
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:24,375
Guess he saved the sin
for Saturday night like everybody else.

550
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:27,837
And everybody else caught hell but you.

551
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:31,966
All the world's a stage
for the preacher's son...

552
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,093
and I was a quarterback.

553
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:37,764
And no matter how many passes I threw...

554
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,726
he was all about running the ball.

555
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:45,563
Because he wanted the game in your hands.

556
00:36:00,704 --> 00:36:02,246
Hello, Carl.

557
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:06,584
Willis.

558
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,795
I prefer Diamondback.

559
00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:10,296
Because you're a snake...

560
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:13,174
just like Cottonmouth.

561
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,428
I am a snake.

562
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:21,725
I've shed my skin for something better.
Stronger.

563
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:25,228
You left me to rot, Carl...

564
00:36:26,145 --> 00:36:27,772
in a gutter.

565
00:36:27,856 --> 00:36:32,193
But I changed that sewer into a garden.

566
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,862
I wasn't a good friend.

567
00:36:34,988 --> 00:36:36,823
I should've stood tall...

568
00:36:39,868 --> 00:36:41,327
but I didn't.

569
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:43,705
And you paid the price.

570
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:56,342
I've been watching you.

571
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,097
Harlem doesn't realize
they're worshiping a false idol.

572
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,266
- False idol?
- You, Carl. You.

573
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:05,268
You're the golden calf.

574
00:37:05,351 --> 00:37:07,979
But I got commandments for your ass.

575
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:10,356
I'm gonna bring the pain.

576
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,900
Reva's death?

577
00:37:11,983 --> 00:37:13,401
Keep her name out of your mouth!

578
00:37:13,484 --> 00:37:15,153
The crimes you went to jail for?

579
00:37:15,236 --> 00:37:17,613
The torture you endured
once you were inside?

580
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,824
All me, I'm afraid.

581
00:37:19,908 --> 00:37:21,743
Well, not Reva's death.

582
00:37:21,826 --> 00:37:24,954
I just like saying her name
just to watch you squirm.

583
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,000
- You ruined my life.
- I gave you wings.

584
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,294
[voice breaking] I sent you to hell...

585
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:35,089
and you come back with superpowers.

586
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:39,677
[inhales deeply] Ain't that a bitch?

587
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:41,470
- [yelling]
- [gunshots]

588
00:37:45,058 --> 00:37:47,143
[Stryker yelling]

589
00:38:01,282 --> 00:38:02,325
[groans]

590
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:03,868
[grunts]

591
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:13,544
[both grunting]

592
00:38:27,058 --> 00:38:28,184
[exhales]

593
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:31,520
[Stryker yelling]

594
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:40,363
[both panting]

595
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:49,288
[both grunting]

596
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:12,061
- [coughing]
- [straining]

597
00:39:14,397 --> 00:39:15,398
[spits]

598
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:17,441
You're bleeding, Carl.

599
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:20,236
[grunts]

600
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:26,034
[clattering]

601
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:31,372
[Stryker yelling]

602
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,293
[grunting]

603
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:38,171
[gags]

604
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:57,273
- Cooper went at her for about an hour.
- What did she say?

605
00:39:57,356 --> 00:39:59,317
[Ridley] Not much of anything.
Nothing we need

606
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,277
in terms of finding Cage
or your attacker.

607
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,736
I got it from here.

608
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,907
- You're in no shape to talk to her.
- I'm fine!

609
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,116
Are you?

610
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:10,828
She'll talk to me, I promise.

611
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:12,455
We have rapport.

612
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:23,007
[sighs]

613
00:40:25,343 --> 00:40:27,803
The attacker. Who was he?

614
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,306
[sighs] I already told the other guy
I don't know.

615
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:34,978
You know, I helped you.
I helped your partner. Luke helped you.

616
00:40:35,061 --> 00:40:37,563
- Why are you...
- Mmm-mmm. No, no, no.

617
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:40,399
The shooter, when he attacked,
what did he say?

618
00:40:40,483 --> 00:40:42,651
What's his connection to Luke?
Did Luke say?

619
00:40:42,735 --> 00:40:45,904
[sighs] You know, it's a blur.

620
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:47,573
Who's Carl?

621
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,369
Look, it is critical that I find Luke.

622
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:53,412
So why aren't you outside
looking for him?

623
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:55,206
Why won't you help me find him?

624
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:57,166
- I want a lawyer.
- Why?

625
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,876
You're not under arrest.

626
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,836
But I can do that. I can arrest you.

627
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,588
For what?

628
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,382
Cottonmouth's dead
and you gave Luke an alibi.

629
00:41:04,465 --> 00:41:06,592
That's accessory to murder.
That's hard time.

630
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:10,388
I'm not scared of you.
I did nothing wrong.

631
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:14,225
That son of a bitch
is out there hurting people.

632
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:18,479
But you won't do anything
to bring Luke Cage in and end this.

633
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:20,189
I'm out of here.

634
00:41:20,273 --> 00:41:21,815
Sit your ass down!

635
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:26,320
Now, people have been
walking out on me all day.

636
00:41:26,404 --> 00:41:29,532
No more lies and no more deception.

637
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:32,910
You are going to tell me what happened
and where I can find Luke.

638
00:41:33,494 --> 00:41:35,079
Back off.

639
00:41:35,163 --> 00:41:36,580
What, you think just because
you got jumped

640
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:37,915
by a psycho and lost your gun,

641
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:39,292
you get to talk to me like that?

642
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:41,544
- Do your job.
- What do you know about the job?

643
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:43,504
You're either too weak
to stand up to pressure,

644
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:45,464
or too stupid to see
that Luke is innocent.

645
00:41:45,548 --> 00:41:48,176
You probably couldn't find
your own ass with both hands.

646
00:41:51,429 --> 00:41:53,931
Who's weak now, huh? Huh?

647
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:55,474
[door opens]

648
00:41:55,558 --> 00:41:56,559
[Claire grunts]

649
00:41:58,269 --> 00:41:59,978
Detective Knight.

650
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,858
I apologize for how
you've been treated, Ms. Temple.

651
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:07,111
Would you like to press charges
against Detective Knight?

652
00:42:07,195 --> 00:42:09,863
[Claire scoffs] Please.

653
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:13,242
Luke Cage is innocent, Misty.

654
00:42:14,285 --> 00:42:16,120
You're after the wrong man.

655
00:42:16,204 --> 00:42:19,457
That's my statement. Write it down.

656
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:22,501
Look, Inspector, I, um...

657
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,177
[breathing heavily]

658
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,511
Willis!

659
00:42:58,454 --> 00:43:00,956
You done good, baby girl.

660
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,084
I know you were uncomfortable.

661
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:06,462
I didn't like your cousin,

662
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:08,256
and I would never sleep with him.

663
00:43:11,217 --> 00:43:13,344
But now I'm on record with that.

664
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:16,347
I'm not a whore.

665
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,848
No, you're not a whore.

666
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,934
You're a businesswoman.

667
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:26,023
And that, in your lap,
represents a chance to change your life...

668
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,111
and that of your whole family.

669
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:32,738
That's power.

670
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:39,162
Did Luke really do all of that?

671
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:45,000
You never really know
what anyone is capable of.

672
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,631
[sighs] Go on, get some rest.

673
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:54,135
You'll come back to the club
in a few days when it opens.

674
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:09,483
[Shades] You think it worked?

675
00:44:10,693 --> 00:44:13,821
She's a good girl. She won't fold.

676
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,282
What if she does?

677
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:19,910
We'll have to kill her.

678
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:23,121
And everybody else in that apartment.

679
00:44:23,206 --> 00:44:25,040
Make it look like a home invasion...

680
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,793
which would be a damn shame.

681
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:31,214
You know, Duke Ellington
used to live in that building.

682
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:33,090
And Count Basie, too.

683
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:37,261
I'd hate to bring down the market value.

684
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:40,764
[Shades] That's my girl.

685
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,777
[sighs]

686
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:04,705
I'm not like you.

687
00:45:21,472 --> 00:45:22,806
[Stryker] Carl!

688
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:37,571
They call this bullet the Judas.

689
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:42,410
You barely survived the first blast.

690
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:46,121
You won't survive the second.

691
00:45:50,293 --> 00:45:52,210
Any last words?

692
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:54,254
Willis...

693
00:45:55,423 --> 00:45:57,257
I'm sorry.

694
00:45:59,385 --> 00:46:01,219
You don't have to do this.

695
00:46:02,555 --> 00:46:04,307
I loved you like a brother.

696
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,225
Nigga...

697
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,020
I am your brother.
