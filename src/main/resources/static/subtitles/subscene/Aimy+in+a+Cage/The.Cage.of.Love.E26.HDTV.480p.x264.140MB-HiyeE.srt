<i>Episode 26</i>

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,700
Quick! Let's leave now.

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Catch them.

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,500
Quick!

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,700
Don't move!

7
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
- Mom.
- Don't move.

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,600
Don't move!

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,000
Go over there.

10
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Catch him.

11
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,600
Don't chase after him anymore. Let him go.

12
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,400
Everything's fine.

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Kid, are you okay?

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,600
Are you okay?

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Fall back.

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,000
Be good. Don't be afraid.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,400
Let's go.

18
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,200
Brother!

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,800
Something bad has happened. Old Cai's wife and son have been captured by the police.

20
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,200
We have been targeted. Brother, leave now.

21
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,400
Leave Huzhou and hide for a while.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Ah Li.

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,500
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,200
Nurse, did you see my brother?

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,800
Mr Jiang?

26
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,000
I just saw him leaving with two policemen.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,200
He was apprehended by the police?

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,600
It didn't seem so.

29
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,000
<i>Wu Mansion.</i>

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,600
Brother Shao Tian. Why didn't you go in since you are here?

31
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,400
Cai Hong.

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,900
I would like to take you to a place.

33
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,400
It's so late. Where are you taking me?

34
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,400
There is something I need to tell you.

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,900
I'm afraid that if I don't tell you now, I won't find the opportunity again.

36
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,400
Are you leaving? Will you be in danger?

37
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,600
Brother Shao Tian. It's already very late and you brought me here...

38
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Do you have something to tell me?

39
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,590
Didn't you say that

40
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,700
when you encountered an unhappy event, you would come here?

41
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,100
Cai Hong.

42
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,000
Do you remember what I told you?

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,900
This

44
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,400
has magical powers.

45
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
If anything bad happens,

46
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,200
as long as I walk around this,

47
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,400
everything will go back to the way it was.

48
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,000
I would like everything to go back to the way it was.

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This way, we can start anew.

50
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,900
But I don't understand, Brother Shao Tian.

51
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,200
If you want to go back to the way it was,

52
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,400
which part should we go back to?

53
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right. Where should we go back to?

54
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,200
For so many years, I have taken so many paths

55
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,400
and experienced so many matters.

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,000
If I hadn't missed that chance...

57
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,300
If everything could really restart,

58
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,800
I would go back to its original state.

59
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Or back to the time when my father passed away.

60
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,200
Or also back to the first time when I joined Ling Long.

61
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Or the first time my father took me to your home

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and the first time that I met you.

63
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,200
If my father didn't pass away that early,

64
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,100
I would never had gone to Ling Long. If I didn't go,

65
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,800
I would have never met you.

66
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,500
If I haven't met you...

67
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,200
Cai Hong,

68
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,400
Frankly, I know that

69
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,500
everything can't go back to the way it was.

70
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,400
But I don't have any regrets.

71
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
It's because I met you

72
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,200
when I took this path.

73
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,500
Knowing you was not a painful period for me.

74
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,400
It was a most beautiful thing.

75
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,000
Brother Shao Tian.

76
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,200
Can you tell me what has happened?

77
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,400
- I'm really worried about you.
- Cai Hong.

78
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,600
Remember what I said.

79
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Perhaps, I may not get the chance to say this to you again.

80
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,400
Do you know that being with you

81
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,200
was the most beautiful moments in my life.
I did not regret

Brother Shao Tian. You must be hiding something from me.

95
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,800
Don't tell me that compared to when you went to the battle ground,

96
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,400
it can't be worse than that, right?

97
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,800
I beg you,

98
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,430

109
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,000
How I wish we can be together forever...

110
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,000
to experience the world, for all seasons

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,200
and forever be together.

112
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,600
Even if I want to be with you forever,

113
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,780
it's time for me to take you home.

114
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,600
Cai Hong, I will take you home.

115
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,800
You haven't told me yet what happened.

116
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,600
Tomorrow.

117
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,600
I will tell you tomorrow.

118
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,400
Go back and have a good night's sleep now. When you get up tomorrow, you will know the answer.

119
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
Okay?

120
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,000
Tomorrow then?

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Tomorrow.

122
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,600
Brother Shao Tian, your hands are very cold.

123
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,200
I remember that your hands were very warm in the past.

124
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,500
You were always warming my hands.

125
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,100
I didn't think that today, it would be me doing this instead.

126
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,900
Cai Hong, thank you.

127
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:24,000
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

128
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,100
Don't move.

129
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,700
Zhou Shao Tian, come back with us to the police station.

130
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,600
Old Cai. You already admitted that you stole Ling Long's money.

131
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I'm giving you one last chance now.

132
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,000
Do you have an accomplice or not?

133
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,600
I already told you that I did it alone. I didn't have any accomplice.

134
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,400
Fine.

135
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,200
Bring them in.

136
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Why are you here?

137
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,400
- Dear.
- Dad.

138
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,000
Son. Director Chen.

139
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This doesn't concern my wife and son. Why did you bring them here?

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,800
Dear, we almost didn't see you again.

141
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,400
Do you know that a lot of scary events happened last night?

142
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Take them away first.

143
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,800
Dear! Son!

144
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,200
- I'm scared, Dad.
-Sit down.

145
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,600
Old Cai.

146
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,400
Your wife and son were in the hands of the bad guys.

147
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,000
We rescued them.

148
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,200
I can guarantee their safety now.

149
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,400
Old Cai.

150
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,800
You stole Ling Long's money. This is not a small crime.

151
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Do you want to spend your entire life in jail?

152
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,000
Why don't you think for yourself and your wife and son too?

153
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,400
I really want to help you.

154
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,200
If you are willing to cooperate, I will personally ask the court to help you.

155
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,300
But first,

156
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,000
you must tell the truth.

157
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,600
It was Zhou Shao Tian.

158
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,200
<i>Zhou Shao Tian forced me to do everything.</i>

159
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,000
<i>If you are sure, lay your bets now.</i>

160
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
<i>It was </i>

161
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,200
<i>Zhao Shao Tian that set the trap for me.</i>

162
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,600
<i>He lured me to gamble and I subsequently went into debts.</i>

163
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
<i>I couldn't pay my debts and he forced me to work with him</i>

164
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
<i>to establish a fake company.</i>

165
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,200
<i>We then used a fake document and forged Old Master Wu's signature.</i>

166
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,400
<i>All of Ling Long's money was transferred to the fake company.</i>

167
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,200
<i>Zhou Shao Tian forced me to do all this. </i>

168
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,000
<i>He slowly planned all this and forced me to take action.</i>

169
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,400
He later controlled my family

170
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,200
and pushed everything on me to take the fall alone.

171
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,000
Director Chen. You must believe me, please.

172
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,300
Let him sign the statement.

173
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,000
Mr Zhou.

174
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,800
Sit.

175
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,200
Mr Zhou.

176
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
I asked you here in the hopes that you will cooperate.

177
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,000
We would like to ask you some questions.

178
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,200
I hope you can reply truthfully.

179
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,700
Old Cai has been caught by us.

180
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,000
Furthermore, he has implicated you.

181
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,600
Do you have anything to say before we start?

182
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Jiang Yu. You are really a schemer.

183
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
You already can't wait to give me the final verdict.

184
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Zhou Shao Tian. I know that you took Ling Long's money.

185
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,600
Did you kill Wu Hong Da too?

186
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,000
Why did you give me the name of a murderer so quickly?

187
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,200
Whose idea is this?

188
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,400
You only need to answer me by saying yes or no.

189
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,000
It's not that simple as saying yes or no.

190
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yes or no.

191
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,800
In your eyes,

192
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,000
you already believed Jiang Yu and find me guilty.

193
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,100
Cai Hong, answer me.

194
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,200
Don't waste your time. Old Cai has already confessed.

195
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,000
Do you still have anything to defend yourself?

196
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,600
The police charged those who are guilty based on evidence.

197
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,500
Since you are sure that I killed him, show me your proof then.

198
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,600
Fine. Take him away.

199
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,800
Since he knows that we are here,

200
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,600
by answering him,

201
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,360
is that really that hard to do?

202
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,700
Get in the rickshaw. I will take you home.

203
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,600
No need. I would like to walk alone.

204
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,970
Go back first.

205
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,700
Miss. Old Cai has already confessed and implicated Zhou Shao Tian.

206
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,600
Zhou Shao Tian has now been taken away by the police for investigation.

207
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,200
Did Zhou Shao Tian confess?

208
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,800
No. I heard that he was overbearing, refusing to say anything.

209
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,600
Should we go and save Zhou Shao Tian?

210
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,800
Not yet. Go with me to the cell to see him first.

211
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,110
Miss. What you mean is that...

212
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,000
When Wu Hong Da died that day, he met with three people..

213
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,800
Zhou Shao Tian, Jiang Yu and Old Cai.

214
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,800
I forced Jiang Yu before. He definitely doesn't have the secret formula.

215
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,500
I want to use this opportunity to ask Zhou Shao Tian.

216
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,790
If he does not have the secret formula,

217
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,640
he is abandoned.

218
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,800
I will concentrate on going against him then.

219
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,100
You are really wise. I will go and make the preparations.

220
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,800
<i>Frankly, I know that everything can't go back to the way it was.</i>

221
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,400
<i>But I don't have any regrets.</i>

222
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,600
<i>It's because I met you when I took this path.</i>

223
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,200
<i>Knowing you was not a painful period for me.</i>

224
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,800
<i>It was a most beautiful thing.</i>

225
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,400
<i>Cai Hong, I love you.</i>

226
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,400
<i>I really love you very much. Don't be afraid.</i>

227
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,800
<i>Everything will be in the past.</i>

228
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,600
<i>Everything else will disappear.</i>

229
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,000
<i>Even though I want to be with your forever,</i>

230
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
<i>it's time for me to take you home.</i>

231
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,200
<i>What Brother Shao Tian told me is definitely not false.</i>

232
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,000
<i>I don't believe that he killed my father.</i>

233
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,700
<i>I'm going to ask him again.</i>

234
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,000
I really don't have anything to say to you.

235
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,600
Go home.

236
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,400
You are not telling me anything.

237
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,000
Is it because you have nothing to say

238
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,300
and no evidence?

239
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,900
Brother Shao Tian.

240
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,900
Are you really not going to explain

241
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,600
or apologise?

242
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,440
You don't even want to say this to me?

243
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,200
Last night,

244
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
I remember that you told me

245
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,700
that you love me.

246
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,600
You would protect me.

247
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,800
Why did you take Ling Long's money then?

248
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,200
Why did you harm my father?

249
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,300
My knowing you is just like a dream.

250
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,000
I have woken up from my dream.

251
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,100
It's time to face reality.

252
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,600
I won't believe it.

253
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,200
It wasn't a dream.

254
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,700
I want to hear you say it.

255
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Did you cause my father to die?

256
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,700
Is it that difficult to tell me the truth?

257
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,400
Please show Miss Wu out.

258
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,800
Miss Wu. Let's go.

259
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,000
Leave this to the police.

260
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,500
Shao Tian.

261
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,400
You did so much for Cai Hong

262
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,100
and what did you get?

263
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,200
You did so much for her and she doesn't even see you.

264
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,800
She only hates you

265
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
for stealing Ling Long's money and killing her father.

266
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,500
Miss Lu, in the end, I will find out what you are doing.

267
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,600
We are considered friends.

268
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,800
You are already in this state.

269
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,000
I wanted to come here and see if there is anything I could help you with.

270
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,600
I can also do my part as a friend.

271
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,700
When did you become someone that would miss a friend?

272
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,800
Even more so when we are not friends at all.

273
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,900
Just come and get what you want.

274
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,600
You have never trusted me.

275
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,100
You are really a direct person.

276
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,600
Fine, I like direct people too.

277
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,200
We won't waste any efforts this way.

278
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,600
I will get to the point.

279
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,200
- Do you have the secret formula or not?
- I already told you many times

280
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,800
that I don't have it.

281
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,400
It looks like you will never trust me.

282
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,800
Don't you get it?

283
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,800
The reason they forced you to confess is to make you die.

284
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,600
I'm asking you because I want to save you.

285
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,200
If you have the secret formula, you can tell me.

286
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
I can plead to the Military Governor

287
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,600
and tell him to put in a few good words for you and get you out of jail.

288
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,800
Wu Cai Hong will never believe you.

289
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,100
I'm the only one in this world who can help you.

290
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,800
If you give me the secret formula,

291
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
I can get you out.

292
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,800
I can let you get far away from here.

293
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,000
What I already told you,

294
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,640
I won't repeat it again.

295
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,000
Fine.

296
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,200
This is your last chance.

297
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,600
Since you have such an attitude, I can't help you then.

298
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,200
Have you really thought it through?

299
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,000
I never thought of

300
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,500
letting you help me.

301
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,300
Fine. Since you don't need my help,

302
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,500
don't blame me for not being righteous.

303
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,600
We already have a witness now.

304
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,200
Why doesn't he defend himself?

305
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Did he really take Ling Long's money?

306
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,900
Sister. I can understand how you feel.

307
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,800
Shao Tian is just like an older brother in our family.

308
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,100
Frankly speaking, I find it hard to accept it too.

309
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,200
Old Cai, Zhou Shao Tian.

310
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,600
The reason I asked both of you here is because this is our first confrontation.

311
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,400
I have already recorded what you said.

312
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,200
It will be used in the court in future.

313
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,800
Director Chen, I understand. I will answer all your questions truthfully.

314
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,200
Okay, Old Cai.

315
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,400
You said that you collaborated with Zhou Shao Tian to steal Ling Long's money.

316
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,600
It was RMB$1 million.

317
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,000
Zhou Shao Tian. Do you have anything to say?

318
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,000
Not answering, right?

319
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,400
I am telling you,

320
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,800
this sum of money is the same as what Ling Long's account showed.

321
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,300
Old Cai. How did you split the money?

322
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,800
Thirty and seventy percent.

323
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,200
I took thirty percent and Zhou Shao Tian took seventy.

324
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,000
Is Old Cai telling the truth?

325
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Both of you took such a big sum of money. What did you do with it?

326
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,400
I used it to settle my debts. I owed a lot of it.

327
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,500
I know that you are telling the truth.

328
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,900
We went to investigate your debtors. They admitted to it.

329
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,600
Zhou Shao Tian. What about you?

330
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,900
What did you do with such a big sum of money?

331
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
If you don't talk, we have no choice then.

332
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,100
Invite Miss Lu Man here. You must be polite.

333
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,700
Miss. These are Rong Da's new products.

334
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Compared to the textiles used with the Jiang family's secret formula,

335
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,800
these don't deserve to be looked at.

336
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Uncle Lai.

337
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,100
Looks like the secret formula is with Old Cai.

338
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,800
Regardless of which methods you use,

339
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,000
you must bring Old Cai here.

340
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,200
Miss. I have an informant in the police station.

341
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,570
This is not a difficult task.

342
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,400
It only depends on when there is a suitable time to do it.

343
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,400
Wait for Director Chen to get the evidence first

344
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,100
and find Zhou Shao Tian guilty,

345
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,600
we will do it then.

346
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,200
Miss Lu. There are two policemen outside.

347
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,600
They would like you to go to the police station for a while.

348
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,800
It seems to be connected to Zhou Shao Tian.

349
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,030
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

350
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,500
Director Chen. Shouldn't we do this in the interrogation room?

351
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,200
Miss Lu's identity is different. It's more comfortable to do it here in my office.

352
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,600
We would also like to thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to cooperate with us.

353
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,080
It's fine.

354
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Director Chen, didn't you say that Zhao Shao Tian could have to pay with his life?

355
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
I only just established a factory with him.

356
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,200
I won't be involved right?

357
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,800
Miss Lu, don't be afraid.

358
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,400
We, police won't accuse the good people.

359
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,400
We are only worried about whether he asked you to do things which you shouldn't have been doing.

360
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,200
How could this be possible? But talking about this,

361
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,400
I don't know what I should do or not do.

362
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,600
There wasn't anything suspicious?

363
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,700
Frankly, ever since Zhou Shao Tiao showed up,

364
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,000
I have been hesitating about something.

365
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I wonder whether I should tell the police.

366
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,100
Please speak.

367
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,000
Frankly, Zhou Shao Tian is the real owner of Rong Da.

368
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,400
He funded the company. He only used my name for the company.

369
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,800
I didn't imagine that Zhou Shao Tian was the real owner of Rong Da.

370
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,600
Yes. At that time, he told me that I didn't have to come up with any money or efforts.

371
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,800
He just borrowed my name to start the factory.

372
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,200
He also shared 40% of the profit with me.

373
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,100
I am thinking, it was such a good offer.
In a moment of foolishness, I did not think too much that

374
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,300
about something bad happening to him.

375
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,200
The more I thought about it, it didn't sound right. Could there be such a good thing on earth?

376
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,600
Did he tell you where he got the money from?

377
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,300
He really didn't tell me anything about this.

378
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,100
It's just that...

379
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,000
I did ask him.

380
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,200
I told him that since he has such a big sum of money, why didn't he take the post of the boss

381
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
instead of being the subordinate?

382
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,200
He told me that this money can't be made known.

383
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,900
He's was using me to launder it.

384
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,000
Miss Lu. Other than this, do you have anything else to tell me?

385
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,600
Let me think.

386
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,600
There is something else which seemed very strange.

387
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,900
Not long ago, he asked me for help.

388
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,800
He wanted me to help him order a Parker pen.

389
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,400
At that time, I didn't think it was a big deal and helped him with the favour.

390
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,800
I looked for General Lu's people and helped him make a pen.

391
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,800
<i>Cai Hong. In the past, you told me that</i>

392
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,000
<i>you wanted to buy this fountain pen as your father's birthday present.</i>

393
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,600
<i>But because you fought over this with someone, you didn't manage to buy it.</i>

394
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,700
<i>I wanted you to be happy. I ordered the exact same fountain pen for you.</i>

395
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,600
<i>If this fountain pen has harmed anyone,</i>

396
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,500
<i>its tip wouldn't be like this.</i>

397
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,000
You were to the one who got the fountain pen for Zhou Shao Tian?

398
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,100
Yes. This was not so long ago.

399
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,060
It was just a month ago.

400
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,200
At that time, he needed it very urgently.

401
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,000
Why do you find it strange then?

402
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,100
At that time, I didn't think much about it. Could something had happened to him then?

403
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,800
I later asked him why he needed that fountain pen.

404
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Furthermore, he wanted it that urgently. He said that he wanted to use it as gratitude.

405
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,200
As gratitude to help him avoid a murder case.

406
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,600
I thought he was joking with me then.

407
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,900
Who knew that he would be caught?

408
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,800
Record all this.

409
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,000
Miss Lu.

410
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
We are almost done with the questions.Thank you.

411
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,600
Don't mention it. I only just told you what I know

412
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,100
in order not to get involved.

413
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,000
Let me get someone to take you back.

414
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,600
No need. My subordinate is waiting for me outside

415
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Okay then.

416
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,400
- Please.
- Bye.

417
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,400
Miss. Did everything go smoothly?

418
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,400
Yes. It went too smoothly.

419
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,400
It actually made me feel nostalgic.

420
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,000
Zhou Shao Tian. What a pity.

421
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,800
Miss. What you meant is...

422
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,600
Uncle Lai.

423
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,000
Bring that contract for Rong Da that I signed with Zhou Shao Tian

424
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,600
and hand it to Director Chen.

425
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,400
Also, go visit General Huang and tell him about the fountain pen.

426
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,100
Let him use it as an evidence.

427
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,800
Yes. This way, not only will we close Wu Hong Da's case,

428
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,300
we will also push Zhou Shao Tian into a dead end.

429
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,400
Don't blame me for being cruel.

430
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,100
If he must blame anyone, he should blame himself for choosing the wrong woman.

431
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,200
He choose the wrong path.

432
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,800
Regarding Old Cai, make the arrangements quickly.

433
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,700
Okay.

434
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,000
This is Old Cai's statement.

435
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,600
This is Lu Man's statement.

436
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,000
Warlord Lu's counselor Huang's statement.

437
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,800
The telegram sent by the overseas manufacturer of the Parker fountain pen.

438
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,900
And also, the Rong Da's contract that you signed with Miss Lu Man.

439
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,400
We will follow the law and hand over this evidence to the court.

440
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,700
If there is anything else you want to say, you can do it now.

441
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,600
But you can choose not to talk and hire a lawyer.

442
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,100
- You can talk again in court.
- I will give up the rights to a lawyer.

443
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,700
Zhou Shao Tian. I have known you for a short while.

444
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,200
You are a smart person. All the evidence is here.

445
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,100
I think you should know what your end result is.

446
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
I know.

447
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,400
Headline! Headline!
Soon they will get to the bottom of Wu Hong Da's murder.

448
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,700
Tomorrow's the trial for the suspected murderer.

449
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,800
Since there was still a ledger that wasn't burnt,

450
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
before finishing with this exquisite book,

451
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,200
they were not able to drain the warehouse.

452
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,800
Thus, it was not burnt by Zhou Shao Tian.

453
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,600
It was only discovered yesterday.

454
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,220
There should be proof in here that showed Zhou Shao Tian made use of Ling Long's money.

455
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,000
See if it's of any help to you.

456
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,400
It will definitely be useful.

457
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Thanks.

458
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,400
It's getting late. I still need to prepare for court.

459
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,600
See you in court.

460
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,400
I won't be going today. If you have any other matters, you can look for me again.

461
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,800
You are not going? I thought you would definitely go.

462
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,600
That's regarding the Wu family. It doesn't concern us. Why would I go there?

463
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
But you have been very helpful.

464
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,800
That's because Zhou Shao Tian made everyone a suspect.

465
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,400
I was aggressive because I was only protecting myself.

466
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,800
Protecting yourself?

467
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Yes.

468
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,100
Okay, it's self protection then.

469
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,200
Wu Cai Hong needs someone by her side now.

470
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,850
I'm afraid that she won't be able to handle the end result.

471
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,400
It's okay. She has her family with her.

472
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,400
Furthermore, she needs to learn how to be independent.

473
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,790
Let her get used to it.

474
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,900
Mr Jiang. On your exterior, you seem very cold

475
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,900
but actually, you are a warm hearted person.

476
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,100
You could even see that I'm warm hearted?

477
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Perhaps so.

478
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,400
Okay, I will be here today.

479
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,200
If there is any other matters, you can always look for me.

480
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm leaving first then.

481
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,800
According to witness testimony provided by the police, today

482
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,000
is the court case of Zhao Shao Tian. The public trial.

483
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,100
It begins now.

484
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,800
According to the testimony of the former Finance Manager at Ling Long and Old Cai,

485
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,600
as Wu Hong Da's secretary, you schemed with Old Cai

486
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,200
to use his position to take illegal funds

487
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,800
and embezzle RMB$10 million.

488
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,300
About this allegation, do you have what it takes to refute it?

489
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,600
According to the testimony of Rong Da's Boss Lu Man,

490
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,800
you transferred the money from Ling Long to her to found Rong Da.

491
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,400
Actually, you are the real owner of Rong Da.

492
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,000
Do you have any objections to these allegations?

493
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,700
Zhou Shao Tian. Based on the overseas telegram from the manufacturer of the Parker pen,

494
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,400
you bought a fountain pen.

495
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,400
After the confirmed death of Wu Hong Da, his wound was examined.

496
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,080
According to Lu Man and Jiang Yu's testimony,

497
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,600
you got the very same pen handed over by Huang Junsheng.

498
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,200
Those two statements seal our presumptions.

499
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,600
You bought the fountain pen first to cause the death of Wu Hong Da.

500
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,000
Afterwards you were helped by Huang Junsheng.

501
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,800
The motive was to cover up the evidence of the Parker pen being used as an accessory for murder.

502
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,300
It was to cover up the truth for killing Wu Hong Da.

503
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,200
Do you need to defend your against this?

504
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,000
<i>Why isn't he saying anything?</i>

505
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,700
<i>He's been asked several times. Why doesn't he speak? </i>

506
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,240
Shao Tian. Say something, quick.

507
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,400
Based on the evidence, the court confirmed that

508
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,400
he joined forces with Zhou Shao, Lin Long's former chief financial officer,

509
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,600
and embezzled Ling Long of RMB$10 million.

510
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,800
After being unmasked, Zhou Shao Tian went to Wu Hong Da and had a bitter dispute.

511
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,000
During the dispute, Zhou Shao Tian stabbed Wu Hong Da with a pen.

512
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
He committed murder to silence him.

513
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
What do you say about this presumption,

514
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Zhou Shao Tian.

515
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,300
Do you have anything to say to defend yourself?

516
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:46,800
