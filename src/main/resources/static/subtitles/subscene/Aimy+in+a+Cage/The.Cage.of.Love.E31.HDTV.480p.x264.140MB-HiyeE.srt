The Cage of Love

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,310
<i>Episode 31</i>

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:09,000
On one hand, she cannot accept such brutal facts,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,270
on the other hand, she feels guilty about the victims.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,490
This was her father's fault. What has it to do with Cai Hong?

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,570
The Cai Hong that Cai Hong thinks,

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,950
it shows she is mature and considerate young lady.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,990
But this young lady cannot shoulder all this burden alone.

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,700
Yu Er. You must be good to her in the future.

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,960
I know.

11
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:31,360
I wanted to confess to Madam today

12
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,540
about your family grudge, but I couldn't.

13
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,910
You are already very brave.

14
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm really afraid that she won't forgive me.

15
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,880
Let it go.

16
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,460
<i>If you tell the truth, it will be chaos.</i>

17
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,120
<i>It is better not to reopen old wounds.</i>

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,060
<i>It is better to keep silent about the truth.</i>

19
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,120
Madam Jiang, let me serve you.

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,490
Cai Hong, just let the maids do this.

21
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,370
I already told Yu Er,

22
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,810
you went through so many hardships, you must be exhausted, mentally and physically .

23
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,030
Starting now, stay at our home and take a good break.

24
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,320
Madam, I have more things to do for you.

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,220
And maybe when I am occupied

26
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,030
I might think less about it.

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,780
Child. Don't keep the issues regarding your father in your heart.

28
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,020
You are still young. If you keep such things in your heart, you will grow even more depressed.

29
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:11,320
When my husband passed away, I kept thinking

30
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,810
until I was sick.

31
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,950
There were many times when I wanted to join him.

32
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,080
I hated all those ignorant people.

33
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,850
Hated them with all my might.

34
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,770
That hatred couldn't be forgotten.

35
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,100
That's the most stupid thing on earth one could do.

36
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,890
I know.

37
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,180
But some things one just cannot let go.

38
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,440
There is a no way to forget them.

39
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,640
Child. I have experienced how you feel.

40
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,490
That's why, I want to advise you.

41
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:59,090
Don't act like me. Such life will only trap you into the same tragedy.

42
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,160
- Madam.
- What are you doing?

43
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,270
I do not want my life to be trapped inside the same tragedy.

44
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,350
So I want to atone for my father's sins.

45
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,690
Please teach me what I should do.

46
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,840
Child, I can understand your need for atoning for your father's sins.

47
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,660
But wouldn't it be better if we devise a good plan on how to do it first?

48
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,310
Come, get up now.

49
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,990
No, Madam. I need to beg you for forgiveness, beg you for mercy.

50
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,570
I'm willing to do anything for the Jiang family

51
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,930
to wash away my father's crimes.

52
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,210
Cai Hong. What are you talking about?

53
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,430
Madam. I...

54
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,860
My father is Wu Hong Da.

55
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,030
It was my father who wronged the Jiang family, you and Jiang Yu.

56
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,900
I'm willing to be your slave

57
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,620
as long as you are willing to forgive me.

58
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,210
What did you say?

59
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,700
Who was your father?

60
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,930
Get lost now!

61
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,740
You are Wu Hong Da's daughter. Get out now!

62
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,490
Wu Hong Da's daughter is here to harm us.

63
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,960
- Get lost?
- I'm sorry. It's all our fault.

64
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,160
- She is Wu Hong Da's daughter.
- Mom. What's wrong?

65
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,190
- Madam, I'm very sorry.
- She is here to harm us.

66
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,770
Men! Take Madam to the hospital now!

67
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,390
I'm not going to the hospital. I want to stay here to protect Fei Fei and Yu Er.

68
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,760
- With me here...
- I'm not going to the hospital.

69
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,830
- Are you happy now?
- Don't be like this, Mom.

70
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,110
Tell her to get lost!

71
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,690
Men. Drag Wu Cai Hong out now!

72
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,600
- Madam.
- Mom.

73
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,210
Madam, I'm sorry.

74
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,470
- Let's go.
- Jiang Yu. Please tell Madam that I never wanted to harm her.

75
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,570
Leave now. Take her away!

76
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,070
Madam. I'm very sorry.

77
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,240
- Wu Hong Da's daughter.
- Everything's fine, Mom.

78
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,140
Leave!

79
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,880
Please let me see Madam. I still have many things to tell her.

80
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,560
Just give up. Our Madam will never forgive you.

81
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,140
Miss already told us to tell you to stay far away from us.

82
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,080
Don't let the Jiang family see you again.

83
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,330
Don't shut the door.

84
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,440
Don't shut the door. Let me go in to see Madam Jiang.

85
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,020
Let me see Madam Jiang.

86
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,370
<i>I don't believe it would just end like this.</i>

87
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,120
<i>In this world,</i>

88
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,590
<i>as long as there is a cause, there will be an effect.</i>

89
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,560
<i>As long as there is an effect, there must be a cause too.</i>

90
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,040
<i>If there is a sin, there must be a way to eliminate it.</i>

91
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,530
Young Master.

92
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,390
- What's wrong?
- Young Master.

93
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:27,950
Miss Cai Hong is crying and refuses to leave. She keep kneeling and bowing at the main door and seeks Madam's forgiveness..

94
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,630
Persuade her to leave.

95
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,950
Yes.

96
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,380
- Mom.
- Is she okay?

97
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,180
I told you many times that

98
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,610
Madam Jiang must not suffer any trauma.

99
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,690
I gave her some sedatives. Her condition is stable now.

100
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,890
Let her rest and don't give her any more shocks.

101
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,780
- I know.
- I'm leaving.

102
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,540
Thanks.

103
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:14,230
Yu Er. Is Wu Cai Hong really Wu Hong Da's daughter?

104
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,390
Who allowed her to enter the Jiang's home?

105
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,260
Mom. I remember you telling me that

106
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:31,690
the criminal was Wu Hong Da and not Wu Cai Hong. We must not pin her father's mistakes

107
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,080
on her head.

108
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,620
Mom.

109
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,260
You...

110
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,120
You already knew that she was Wu Hong Da's daughter.

111
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,020
Yu Er. Did you forget how your father died?

112
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,680
Did you forget the crimes that were committed towards the Jiang family?

113
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,120
How could you let a wolf into the house?

114
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,450
Wu Cai Hong is a good girl.

115
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,290
She didn't come here with an ulterior motive.

116
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,060
She only wanted to obtain your forgiveness.

117
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,440
I will never forgive her.

118
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,130
- Mom.
- Cai Hong is innocent.

119
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,880
We can't continue our grudges into the next generation.

120
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,360
Mom. You are such a kind person. Why can't you forgive Wu Cai Hong?

121
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,290
There is no forgiveness for evil deeds.

122
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,940
What evil deed did she do?

123
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,160
She lost her parents and her family went bankrupt.

124
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,690
A well brought up lady came to work as a servant in our family

125
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,000
and suffered so many hardships and punishment. What was all that for?

126
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,770
It was so

127
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,020
we could forgive her.

128
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,750
Mom, I remember that

129
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,210
since childhood you always advised us to improve ourselves.

130
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,500
Wu Cai Hong came to redeem for her father's mistakes.

131
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,480
Is this wrong?

132
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,000
Brother. You are saying this

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,020
because you fell in love with Wu Cai Hong, right?

134
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,690
You fell in love with Wu Cai Hong?

135
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,980
You fell in love with Wu Hong Da's daughter?

136
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:26,680
When I didn't know that she was Wu Hong Da's daughter, I already fell in love with her.

137
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,570
When I found out later that

138
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,740
Wu Hong Da was her father,

139
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,500
I wanted to let go of this feeling...

140
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,990
but I couldn't do it.

141
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:50,280
- Mom.
- Dear, I have wronged you.

142
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,020
How could we have such an unfilial son?

143
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,880
- What a misfortune.
- Mother.

144
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,130
Is Wu Hong Da taking revenge on us again?

145
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,040
- Mom.
- Don't call me Mom.

146
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,440
Go to your father's tablet now and reflect on yourself.

147
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,490
Starting from now, if you still dare to bring Wu Cai Hong here,

148
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,090
I will die in front of you.

149
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,570
Miss Cai Hong. Do you need to do this?

150
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,110
Young Master and Miss will never let you in.

151
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,360
Please let me in to see Madam Jiang. I really have a lot of things to tell her.

152
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,400
Please leave. Madam fell ill because of you.

153
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,870
Young Master is now kneeling down in front of his father's table to do self reflection. If you still don't leave,

154
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,310
you will really cause the entireJiang family to be in an uproar.

155
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:06,280
But this doesn't concern Jiang Yu. If Madam wants to punish anyone, she should punish me. Please help me

156
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,530
and let me seek forgiveness from Madam.

157
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,560
Leave now.

158
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,090
Leave.

159
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,110
Young Master, sorry. Madam has instructed this.

160
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,990
Dad, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have made Mom sick.

161
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,900
Please forgive me.

162
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,070
Dad, I'm sorry. I'm here today to tell you that

163
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,940
starting tomorrow, I have decided

164
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,060
to face my feelings.

165
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,980
I will not be a coward anymore.

166
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,620
Cai Hong knows very clearly the problems that we will be facing.

167
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,100
She is using her courage to redeem the grudges between the two families.

168
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,750
As for me,

169
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,090
I have always been running away from this.

170
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,260
I did it to deny my feelings

171
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,020
and intentionally hurt her.

172
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,860
I can't keep doing this.

173
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,900
I know very well that she is Wu Hong Da's daughter but she is a very good lady.

174
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,030
Your son likes Cai Hong very much.

175
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,720
I really want to be with her forever.

176
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,950
Dad. I promise you that

177
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,200
I will do my utmost best

178
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,060
and wait with Cai Hong for mother's blessing.

179
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,110
Dad, I hope that you will give me your support.

180
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,460
Mom, I know that your appetite is not good.

181
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,290
I instructed the kitchen to cook porridge for you. Have some.

182
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,230
When I think about my disobedient son, my appetite vanishes.

183
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,610
Mom. Everything is Wu Cai Hong's fault.

184
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,570
It has nothing to do with brother.

185
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,450
Please don't punish brother anymore.

186
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,980
Okay?

187
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,970
Fei Fei. You don't understand.

188
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,970
This love is just wishful thinking.

189
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,360
I won't let him rebel.

190
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,950
Anyway, I will definitely never forgive her.

191
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,480
<i>Mom. Who says I don't understand?</i>

192
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,980
<i>But in this world, is there really such a wishful love?</i>

193
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,280
- Miss.
- What is it?

194
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,070
Everything has been prepared. When should we take action?

195
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,080
The police have been keeping watch on me.

196
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,050
The Military Governor is very concerned about his image. He's protecting me for the time being.

197
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,840
But I know that

198
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,930
he is already beginning to suspect me.

199
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,330
So many eyes are watching me.

200
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,200
It won't be easy to do it.

201
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,130
What should we do now?

202
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:54,000
No matter how bright the moon is, it will be still covered by darkness.

203
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,680
Let's take action tonight.

204
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,880
As long as I get ahold of the secret formula, I will never let them find me.

205
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,670
Yes. I will make the arrangement now.

206
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,210
Tell our men to watch Jiang's house. When the secret formula shows up again,

207
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,920
we must be the first ones to get it. Make sure that our tracks are covered.

208
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,130
I understand.

209
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:28,640
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by
Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

210
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,440
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

211
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,010
<i>Are you doing well at the Jiang's home?</i>

212
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,970
<i>Did Fang Fei Fei and Madam Jiang give you a hard time?</i>

213
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:54,700
<i>Cai Hong, I can't be with you</i>

214
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,570
<i>but you must live well.</i>

215
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,700
<i>If you cry or are in pain</i>

216
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,030
<i>let my heart suffer first.</i>

217
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,630
Fire!

218
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,040
Fire!

219
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,330
Fire! Wake up!

220
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,710
Fire! Help us!

221
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,130
Fire! Take her out now!

222
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,490
Let's go.

223
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,120
- Come here, quick.

224
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,500
Mom.

225
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,470
Open the door.

226
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,610
Open the door.

227
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,010
Come out. Everyone in there, come out now.

228
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,970
- Where is Madam?
- I don't know.

229
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,600
- Where is Madam?
- She seems to be in there.

230
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,930
Over there.

231
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,960
Is anyone in there?

232
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,990
Men!

233
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,980
Is anyone here?

234
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,710
Madam, don't be afraid. Let's go.

235
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,960
Run now!

236
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,930
Let's go.

237
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,020
Madam. Don't be afraid.

238
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,920
Madam, quick.

239
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,310
- Quick!
- Mom.

240
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,550
Madam, quick.

241
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,380
Mom.

242
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,910
Take her out now. Let's go.

243
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,910
Who isn't out here yet?

244
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,740
Where is Madam?

245
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,550
Mom, are you okay?

246
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,200
Where is Yu Er?

247
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,040
- Yu Er!
- Mom.

248
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,420
Yu Er!

249
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,390
Jiang Yu!

250
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,300
Young Master is out!

251
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,370
- Brother.
- Mom.
- Is everyone okay?

252
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,870
Yu Er. Cai Hong went in to find you. Didn't you see her?

253
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,220
- Cai Hong.
- Yu Er, it's too dangerous.

254
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,710
Fei Fei, take care of Mom.

255
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,910
Brother, don't go. It's dangerous.

256
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,020
Jiang Yu.

257
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,940
Cai Hong!

258
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,070
Cai Hong.

259
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,960
Cai Hong!

260
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,300
- Why isn't Young Master out yet?
- Did something happen to him?

261
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,190
What should we do? The fire is so big.

262
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,110
Young Master.

263
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,440
Young Master is out.

264
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,990
- Young Master.
- That's great. Young Master is finally out.

265
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,870
Yu Er, are you okay?

266
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,250
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Take Cai Hong to the hospital now.

267
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,030
Quick.

268
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,070
Cai Hong.

269
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,070
Cai Hong, wake up.

270
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,010
There are still many things I haven't told you.

271
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,860
Hurry up.

272
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,520
Cai Hong.

273
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,980
Hurry up!

274
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:45,680
<i>God, I don't know what your plans are</i>

275
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,600
<i>but I'm willing to use my life to pray to you.</i>

276
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,570
<i>Let Cai Hong be safe.</i>

277
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,470
<i>Give half of my life to her.</i>

278
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,940
<i>I want to grow old and die together with her.</i>

279
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,570
Brother.

280
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,520
Brother, are you okay?

281
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,090
Yu Er. How is Cai Hong?

282
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,960
She is still in there.

283
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,450
Mom, are you okay?

284
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,800
Let the doctor run tests on you now.

285
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,930
- Go now.
- Young Master, you should go too.

286
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,990
Don't worry about me now.

287
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,800
Take my mom there first. Go now.

288
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,940
Yu Er. Cai Hong will be fine, right?

289
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,170
Brother, don't worry too much.

290
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,930
Heaven helps good people. She will be fine.

291
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,040
Yes, I know.

292
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,720
Enough, take mom there now.

293
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,980
Go now.

294
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,270
Doctor, what is the situation?

295
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:08,310
Miss Wu's injuries are not serious. We have already applied medicine to her wounds,

296
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,950
- but...
- But what?

297
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,630
She inhaled a lot of smoke during the fire which caused asphyxia. She has not awakened yet.

298
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:20,090
We can't confirm if there is any damage to her brain.

299
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,320
What do you mean?

300
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,530
If there is no brain damage due to the lack of oxygen, she could wake up at any time,

301
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,890
but if she has brain damage,

302
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,890
perhaps, she may never regain consciousness.

303
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,750
Mr Jiang. Currently, this is only what we can do.

304
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,700
That's to leave it to God. What we can only do is to wait.

305
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,030
Please keep calm.

306
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,290
Cai Hong.

307
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,590
How is she?

308
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,010
Doctor said she has asphyxia and that she cannot wake up.

309
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,950
Cai Hong.

310
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,800
Cai Hong.

311
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,730
Wasn't she at your home?

312
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,040
How did this happen?

313
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,370
Cai Hong.

314
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,360
Sister. Wake up.

315
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,880
Talk to me, sister.

316
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,480
Cai Hong. Nothing must happen to you.

317
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,570
If anything were to happen to you, how am I to explain to your father?

318
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,160
Sister.

319
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,440
Jiang Yu. What's going on?

320
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,900
Didn't you say that your home was safe?

321
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,530
- Didn't you say that you wouldn't hurt her?
- I'm sorry.

322
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:11,680
Why is your entire family fine except her?

323
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,450
You bastard!

324
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,660
Brother Shao Tian, don't do this.

325
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,370
Tell me!

326
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,990
Are you dumb!

327
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,640
I'm warning you. If anything serious happens to her,

328
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,900
I will never let you off!

329
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,520
Enough!

330
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,630
Stop fighting!

331
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,520
Jiang Yu. What are you still doing here?

332
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,100
Get lost!

333
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,350
I'm warning you. If anything happens to Cai Hong,

334
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,480
I will never let the Jiang family have any peace!

335
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,660
Get lost!

336
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,690
She is still not conscious?

337
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,310
How could this happen?

338
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:46,530
They said she inhaled a lot of smoke and that her brain might has suffered from lack of oxygen.

339
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,740
Oh my god.

340
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,330
How could this happen?

341
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,580
Dear.

342
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,350
I really can't forgive Wu Hong Da

343
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:06,060
but Cai Hong is a good girl.

344
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,670
I pray that she will wake up soon.

345
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:17,640
Dear, help her from heaven.

346
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,320
Mom.

347
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,520
How many such containers did you find?

348
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,050
We already found four filled up with petrol.

349
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,120
It's very obvious that someone started the fire.

350
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,640
Furthermore, it was an inside job.

351
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,070
Call all the staff of the Jiang family. Don't miss a single one.

352
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,900
Yes.

353
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,490
- Where is the secret formula?
- Jiang Yu didn't take the secret formula at all.

354
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,510
I really didn't get the secret formula. Uncle Lai, please believe me. I really didn't get it.

355
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,120
- You really didn't?
- I really didn't. Please believe me.

356
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,730
You can search me.

357
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,340
It has been hard on you then.

358
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,930
I really didn't get it.

359
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,270
<i>- Get up now.
- Mom.</i>

360
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,000
<i>Stop there!</i>

361
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,040
<i>Stop there!</i>

362
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,100
<i>Mom.</i>

363
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:48,020
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

364
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,170
<i>Mom.</i>

365
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,910
<i>Mom.</i>

366
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,810
<i>Mom.</i>

367
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,400
<i>Mom.</i>

368
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,060
<i>Fu Ching.</i>

369
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,590
<i>Mom.</i>

370
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,360
<i>Fu Ching.</i>

371
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,970
<i>Take Xiao Ge with you now.</i>

372
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,160
<i>Come.</i>

373
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:39,780
<i>Mom.</i>

374
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,810
<i>Let's leave now.</i>

375
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,910
<i>Let's leave now.</i>

376
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,790
<i>Mom.</i>

377
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,370
<i>Let's leave now, Ge Ge.</i>

378
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,060
Don't!

379
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,940
Miss! Miss!

380
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,460
Enter.

381
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:26,940
Miss. Did you dream of Fu Ching again?

382
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,520
How is the Jiang family?

383
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,040
Wu Cai Hong was badly injured and hovers between life and death.

384
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,930
As for the rest, they are okay.

385
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,920
Looks like this time,

386
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,070
we have to add another murder to our list to get the recipe.

387
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,950
Jiang Yu will not escape so easily again.

388
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,770
Miss. You must find the secret formula.

389
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,840
You must start anew

390
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,990
and create our flag dress.

391
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,550
Find a way to find someone

392
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,410
to kidnap Madam Jiang.

393
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:21,430
I want to use Madam Jiang to threaten Jiang Yu.

394
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,000
Yes.

395
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,990
I already know what you did.

396
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,030
Why are you so foolish?

397
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,020
Risking your own life for a dead man's tablet.

398
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:12,040
Look at the state you are in now.

399
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,170
Cai Hong. Do you know that

400
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,760
when you let go of my hand

401
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,020
and wanted to go to the Jiang family as a servant,

402
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:28,990
I knew that Jiang Yu had a place in your heart.

403
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,680
But do know that

404
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,170
in my heart,

405
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,070
your life is more important than mine?

406
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,500
You must wake up.

407
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,080
You must get well.

408
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,180
You haven't eaten anything today.

409
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,810
I brought your favourite food. Have more of these.

410
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,620
I'm not hungry.

411
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,300
Brother, don't be like this.

412
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,450
Looking at how you are,

413
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,070
I find it very hard to accept it.

414
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:48,040
Tell me why Cai Hong hasn't still regained her consciousness.

415
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:54,380
Brother, don't worry too much about it.

416
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,150
Cai Hong is a good girl.

417
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,550
God will definitely take care of her.

418
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:05,020
She may wake up tomorrow.

419
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,100
Yes.

420
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,710
She will definitely wake up.

421
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,030
She definitely will.
