<i>Episode 16</i>

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,040
Zhou Shao Tian could have prospered recently

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,840
after becoming the General Manager of Rong Da.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,860
He returned the money to me in less than two days.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,860
So, you are sure that Zhou Shao Tian lately

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,750
didn't come here to borrow any money from you?

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,700
Yes. I haven't make a mistake regarding this.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,720
In the past, he forced me to lend him money,

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,690
it was for desperate measures.

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,100
Didn't you suspect that Zhou Shao Tian stole your money?

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,730
Why are you checking on whether he has borrowed any money?

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,550
Don't be anxious first.

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,830
Record what Boss Qian just said

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,540
and let him sign the statement.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,060
- Why are you doing this?
- Just follow what I said.

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,800
Boss Qian, I will have to trouble you.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,770
If Zhou Shao Tian were to look for you to borrow money again,

19
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,280
please notify me and Miss Wu immediately.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,710
Okay, don't worry. I will.

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,300
-Boss Jiang, I bid you farewell.
-Alright

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,540
Thank you, Boss. Let's go.

23
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,630
I won't be seeing you off.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,770
Have a smooth journey.

25
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,720
We have traveled to all the banks in Huzhou.

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,690
Finally, we are at the last stop.

27
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,190
We are here.

28
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,440
Sir, please take care.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,900
Director Chen Suo, much welcome. You took a long drive to visit.

30
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,930
- Please come in.
- No need.

31
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,100
We are here today because Mr Jiang would like to ask you some questions. Just answer him.

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,230
Okay. Mr Jiang, please ask.

33
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,420
It's very simple. Please check for me if

34
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,610
Zhou Shao Tian came here to borrow money from you?

35
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,790
Zhou Shao Tian?

36
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,080
- Are you referring to Zhou Shao Tian from Rong Da?
- Yes.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,310
- He didn't come here.
- Are you sure?

38
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,650
Definitely.

39
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,990
Boss Meng.

40
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,890
Please sign the statement here.

41
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,500
And also, if he comes here to borrow money from you,

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,650
- please let us know.
-Okay, please wait.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,270
Jiang Yu, we were busy all day long with Director Chen Suo.

44
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,510
Can you tell me what you are doing?

45
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,290
You only need to record the results today that

46
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,490
none of the money lenders gave any loans to Zhou Shao Tian.

47
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,790
You still suspect that Brother Shao Tian stole the money, right?

48
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,420
We need to establish the facts.

49
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:11,970
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

50
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,490
Please.

51
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,660
Young Master. Mr Zhang is here.

52
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,580
Old Zhang. You are here.

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,030
I heard that you are the broker for the Wu house.

54
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,040
I'm interested in it.

55
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,780
Sell it to me.

56
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,590
The cash is here.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,620
This...

58
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,520
You didn't even look at it and you are giving me the money?

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,420
What is there to see? I don't need to see it.

60
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,070
Accept the money.

61
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,730
Mr Jiang. I can't accept this because before your offer,

62
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,540
I already promised this to a Mr Zhou.

63
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,340
He already saw the Wu house.

64
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,250
He's going to sign the contract tomorrow.

65
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,160
Rest assured, I have the names of other places.

66
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,610
I will take you to see them another day.

67
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,200
Didn't you just say that

68
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,450
you only made a verbal agreement with that Zhou guy?

69
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,760
I know the rules of selling a house too.

70
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,270
Whoever pays the cash first gets the house, right?

71
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,590
That's right.

72
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,500
The full cash is here.

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,420
I will be able to sign the contract with the owner tomorrow.

74
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,120
Cash in exchange for the contract.

75
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,730
What?

76
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,390
You don't trust my financial status?

77
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,770
I have complete confidence in your financial status.

78
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,340
It's just that regarding Mr Zhou,

79
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,360
I really don't know what to tell him.

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,860
Old Zhang. How could you be the broker?

81
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,580
You don't even know who you should sell the house to.

82
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,680
I already paid in cash. We can only blame that Zhou guy

83
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,470
for not having a destiny with that house.

84
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,290
To add further, regarding your verbal agreement,

85
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,730
who knows if there will be any changes tomorrow. Isn't that so?

86
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,410
Okay. You are both the buyers.

87
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,410
I can't afford to offend the both of you. Okay.

88
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,220
Since you have paid in cash first,

89
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,860
I can only say that you are destined to own that house.

90
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,030
This is the right way.

91
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,120
If that Zhou guy gives you a hard time tomorrow,

92
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,460
just tell him that I bought it.

93
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,850
Let's see if he dares to say anything.

94
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,260
Okay.

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,550
Keep the cash properly.

96
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,820
Thank you very much. Mr Jiang.

97
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,430
I will wait for you news tomorrow.

98
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,720
Hello.

99
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,330
Sorry, Mr Zhou. I'm late.

100
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,870
Where is the owner?

101
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,240
Mr Zhou.

102
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,940
I regret to inform you that the Wu house

103
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,320
has already been bought by Boss Jiang.

104
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,740
Boss Jiang? Which Boss Jiang?

105
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,370
Are you referring to Jiang Yu?

106
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,990
In the entire Huzhou, who can afford to buy the Wu house?

107
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,270
How many Jiangs would there be?

108
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,610
Old Zhang. We already agreed yesterday that

109
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,480
we would sign the contract today.

110
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,940
In a matter of a night,

111
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,510
you accepted someone else's cash

112
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,700
and sold the house.

113
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,900
I couldn't stop it.

114
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,180
You know the rich and powerful Boss Jiang.

115
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,190
He paid in cash yesterday.

116
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,810
According the the rules of the sales of houses,

117
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,030
whoever pays in cash first will get the house.

118
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,100
I can't do anything about this.

119
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,120
You couldn't do anything?

120
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,370
Jiang Yu's face has face.

121
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,880
Doesn't my face have any value either?

122
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,880
I didn't mean that. You are both rich.

123
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,420
I had a chance to do it. (sell)

124
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,320
To tell you the truth, Mr Jiang specifically asked me yesterday.

125
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,770
He wanted me to tell you that the house belongs to him.

126
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,600
Do you think he would give it up?

127
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,210
Return the money to him now.

128
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,300
Pay him back double.

129
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,300
Go and tell the owner of this house again that

130
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,150
I will give him another price.

131
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,270
This house...

132
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,280
I must have it.

133
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,610
Old Zhang.

134
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,300
Your way of doing business is not typical.

135
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,740
You clearly know that I like that house. So how?

136
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,430
- Are you trying to raise the price again?
- No.

137
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,780
Mr Jiang. I don't mean that.

138
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,720
I just meant that,

139
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,700
I only get a small commission.

140
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,150
To add further, anyone can buy the house.

141
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,360
The sooner it's done, my business will conclude earlier.

142
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,970
Right?

143
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,770
Tell me.

144
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,540
- What's going on?
- Don't you know that

145
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,610
this Mr Zhou is Zhou Shao Tian, the General Manager of Rong Da?

146
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,990
This week was the first time anyone was eyeing this place.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,430
He is willing to pay double the price and refund your money.

148
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,410
It is forcing a bid for the price to buy the house.

149
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,580
The owner of the house will accept the highest offer.

150
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,300
Hence, I'm here today to discuss this with you.

151
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,260
Could you let Mr Zhou have the house?

152
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,150
This is the only reason? You should have told me earlier.

153
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,290
If it's because of money, I have the money and can offer a higher price too.

154
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,320
I like this house.

155
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,400
Why don't we do this, Old Zhang?

156
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,400
I can offer a higher price.

157
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,370
I recommend we take this out on the balcony.

158
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,810
Since Mr Zhou wants to fight with me over the Wu's house,

159
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,910
I suggest an open auction.

160
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,270
The highest bidder gets the house.

161
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,130
You are telling me this for what reason?

162
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,420
This house has been on sale for a long time.

163
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,440
He didn't want to buy it earlier and insisted on waiting for me to buy it first.

164
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,200
He counted his money after I made my offer.

165
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,790
Mr Zhou. I'm only just the runner.

166
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,920
If Mr Jiang is not willing to withdraw his money,

167
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,150
there is nothing I can do.

168
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,270
Old Zhang. What did I tell you?

169
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,900
This house,

170
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,440
I must buy it.

171
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,300
I can offer any amount of money.

172
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,020
How to buy it,

173
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,370
I will leave it to you.

174
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,040
Since this is the case,

175
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,750
where both of you want to buy it,

176
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,800
as fair competition, I will talk to the owner of the house.

177
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,110
Since you will engage in bidding,

178
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,100
you and Mr Jiang can bid for it at the highest price.

179
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,970
What do you think?

180
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,040
Public auction?

181
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,220
Did Jiang Yu give you this idea?

182
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,750
Mr Zhou is wise.

183
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,400
Fine.

184
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,140
I will play this game with him

185
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,120
till the end.

186
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,510
<i>br</i>

187
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,190
Brother. Everyone in the streets of Huzhou are saying that

188
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,750
you are doing this from anger that steams with Zhou Shao Tian.

189
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,800
They are betting that when you buy the Wu mansion,

190
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,500
you are doing it for Wu Cai Hong.

191
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,710
It's quite interesting.

192
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,570
Brother. What's going on?

193
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,150
You are really going to buy the Wu's house?

194
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,940
It can't be because of Wu Cai Hong.

195
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,800
I don't lack a house to live in. Why should I buy a house?

196
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,950
Why are you doing this then?

197
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,310
You can't tolerate unscrupulous businessmen and you don't like publicity.

198
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,660
Yet you are going to do a public auction.

199
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,710
What do you have up your sleeve?

200
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,310
<i>Mom</i>

201
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,590
<i>It's here.</i>

202
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,320
<i>Come and take a look now.</i>

203
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,250
<i>It's here.</i>

204
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,070
<i>Come and take a look now.</i>

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,580
<i>Mom</i>

206
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,180
<i>Be careful.</i>

207
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,810
<i>Man Man. Why are you so careless? Are you okay?</i>

208
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,180
<i>I'm okay. As long as mom is here,</i>

209
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,200
<i>I'm not afraid of anything.</i>

210
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,730
<i>Xiao Man. You are such a good girl.</i>

211
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,720
<i>Mom, can you gift this to me?</i>

212
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,870
<i>Please, mom. Please, mom.</i>

213
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,500
<i>Fine. As long as you like it,</i>

214
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,530
<i>I will leave the best for you.</i>

215
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,600
<i>Thank you, mom. I love you so much, mom.</i>

216
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,820
Who is it?

217
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,290
Miss. It's me.

218
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,250
Come in.

219
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,630
Miss.

220
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,120
What is it?

221
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,620
We already checked into that Ma Li person.

222
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,690
Zhou Shao Tian helped check.

223
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,580
When Jiang Yu's father, Jiang Wen Yuan was convicted, he committed suicide.

224
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,400
Zhou Shao Tian is wondering if Jiang Wen Yuan was wronged.

225
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,150
This didn't concern Wu Hong Da at all.

226
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,190
I get it. Send a few men

227
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,030
and follow Zhou Shao Tian and his henchman.

228
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:37,000
Miss. Are you interested in the grudges

229
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,700
between the Jiang and Wu families too?

230
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,600
I'm not interested in their grudges at all.

231
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,400
What I'm interested in is whether the Jiang family has the secret recipe.

232
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,480
I want to know

233
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,840
after Wu Hong Da died,

234
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,460
who is holding the secret recipe.

235
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,340
I wonder between Jiang Yu and Zhou Shao Tian,

236
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,700
which is richer?

237
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,130
I think it's Jiang Yu.

238
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,030
Zhou Shao Tian is a rising star

239
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,630
with sudden riches. Then he has money.

240
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,640
I don't think Zhou Shao Tian will win in the auction.

241
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,830
I heard he and Old Wu had history.

242
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,470
I heard that Zhou Shao Tian is the boyfriend of the eldest daughter of the Wu family.

243
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,410
He wants to win her love.

244
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,380
That is how he thought of this idea to buy back the Wu's house.

245
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,640
You don't understand this. Jiang Yu and Zhou Shao Tian

246
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,330
are level headed people. Would they fight over a house?

247
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,310
They are in the same industry. They are not just fighting over this house.

248
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,810
It's for business and to vent.

249
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,250
Everyone, we are starting.

250
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,330
Those who are with Zhou Shao Tian, leave your money on my left.

251
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,240
Those who are with Jiang Yu, leave your money on my right.

252
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,800
Grab this chance now. It's a 50-50 chance.

253
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,640
<i>It's a rare opportunity in our village.</i>

254
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,210
<i>You have to spend money to make money.</i>

255
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,280
<i>Everyone. Let's ask Mr Jiang.</i>

256
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,190
<i>What amount are you willing to bid for the Wu mansion?</i>

257
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,270
<i>It's really just like what the rumours say. He's doing this to win Miss Wu's heart.</i>

258
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,880
<i>Mr Jiang. Do you need to win in this auction today?</i>

259
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,820
- Just wait and see.
- How long are you going to continue to compete with Mr Zhou?

260
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,200
Come. Please leave seats for them.

261
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,060
Old Zhang, it's not bad.

262
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,770
You got that many people within such a short period of time.

263
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,160
It's a small task.

264
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,380
Thank you Boss Jiang. In the future, if you need anything, let me know and your wish is my command.

265
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,250
Mr Jiang, Miss Wu. Please take a seat.

266
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,750
- Can we start now?
- Yes.

267
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,970
Mr Zhou, what about you?

268
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,770
Dear everyone. Today, I am

269
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,550
commissioned by the owner to head up the auction of this location,

270
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,180
the Wu mansion.

271
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,230
As promised, I will introduce two guests to the auction.

272
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,550
One is the boss of Ling Long, Mr Jiang Yu.

273
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,140
Great.

274
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,190
The other is the General Manager of Rong Da, Mr Zhou Shao Tian.

275
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,210
Great, Mr Zhou.

276
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,330
Mr Zhou.

277
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,510
Our rules are very simple.

278
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,550
The two sides will take turns bidding.

279
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,720
We will wait for the highest bid

280
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,130
and he will then become the new owner of the Wu's house.

281
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,810
This auction will be done in cash,

282
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,410
and the agreement will be signed in public in a fair manner.

283
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,780
I will announce the start of the auction now.

284
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,780
The Wu house is starting at

285
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,170
$200,000.

286
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,980
Mr Jiang offered this price.

287
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,910
<i>It was $100,000 two days ago.</i>

288
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,690
$200,000 going once.

289
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,870
<i>How much money is that?</i>

290
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,040
$200,00 going twice.

291
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,520
Mr Zhou bid for $220,000.

292
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,720
<i>$220,000?</i>

293
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,630
$220,000 going once.

294
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,040
$220,000 going twice.

295
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,900
Mr Jiang offered $200,000.

296
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,250
He is going to raise the offer now.

297
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,400
$250,000.

298
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,150
It's now $250,000.

299
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,050
$250,000 going once.

300
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,440
Guess how much your Brother Shao Tian will spend.

301
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,730
Mr Jiang offered a new price just now. It's $250,000.

302
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,600
Where did Brother Shao Tian get that much money?

303
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,460
You can ask him later.

304
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,510
$250,000 going twice.

305
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,260
Mr Jiang offered $250,000.

306
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,920
Let's see whether Mr Zhou will raise the bid.

307
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,850
Mr Zhou raised the price to $260,000.

308
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,410
$260,000.

309
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,620
$300,000.

310
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,450
$260,000 going once.

311
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,430
Mr Jiang raised his price again.

312
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,170
Mr Jiang bid for $300,000.

313
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,950
It's $300,000.

314
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,730
$300,000 going once.

315
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,260
$300,000 going twice.

316
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,140
Great. Mr Zhou has raised a new price.

317
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,600
$310,000.

318
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,360
$350,000.

319
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,880
$310,000 going once. $310,000 going twice.

320
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,830
$350,000.

321
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,480
Mr Jiang latest bid is $350,000.

322
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,390
$350,000 going once.

323
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,370
Why did you raise the bid that high?

324
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,700
Don't worry. The price I bid for

325
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,920
is higher than Zhou Shao Tian absolute price. Just watch.

326
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,200
Is this the last offer?

327
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,630
He won't dare to counter-offer.

328
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,080
$350,000 going once.

329
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,280
What if he doesn't bid for it?

330
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,580
You should be concerned

331
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,030
about where

332
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,340
he got such a big sum of money from.

333
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,810
$350,000 going twice.

334
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,840
I don't think anyone will counter offer the price.

335
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,560
<i>I think this will end soon.</i>

336
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,110
<i>How could they bid further?</i>

337
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,740
Does Mr Zhou wants to raise the bid?

338
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,330
$400,000.

339
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,930
$400,000! Mr Zhou raised the bid to $400,000.

340
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,690
It's already reached an astronomical price.

341
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,760
Let's see if the bid can go above $400,000.

342
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,050
$400,000 going once.

343
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,180
$400, 000 going twice.

344
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,380
$480,000.

345
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,190
$480,000.

346
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,110
Mr Jiang raised the bid to $480,000.

347
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,840
The Wu's family starting price was from $200,000 to $480,000.

348
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,640
That's an astronomical price!

349
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,400
I wonder if this bid will be a new record.

350
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,270
$500,000.

351
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,690
The Wu's house is now worth $500,000.

352
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,780
It seems like Mr. Zhou is determined to win the Wu house

353
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,840
We have the honor of being in his presence.

354
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,360
This is a legendary moment.

355
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,220
I would like to ask Mr Jiang if he would like to raise the bid.

356
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,390
Or are you going this to start a new rumour again?

357
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,620
- Will this be a new record?
- Raise the bid, Mr Jiang.

358
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,960
<i>My money is on you. I can't lose.</i>

359
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,340
<i>If not, we will lose.</i>

360
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,110
<i>We will need to pay.</i>

361
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,560
I'm announcing that Mr Jiang has given up on the bid.

362
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,260
He has given up.

363
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,740
Everyone. Please stay and witness the signing of the contract.

364
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,730
Let's congratulate Mr Zhou again.

365
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,900
<i>Congratulations.</i>

366
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,110
<i>Mr Zhou.</i>

367
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,900
<i>Congratulations, Mr Zhou.</i>

368
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,090
Mr Zhou, congratulations.

369
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,770
Let me make the introductions. This is the owner of the house.

370
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,920
Please hand in the money and sign the contract at the same time.

371
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,360
Once it's done, you are the owner of the Wu's house.

372
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,430
<i>I have never seen this before.</i>

373
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,660
Everyone, keep quiet for a moment.

374
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,860
I would like to take this opportunity to announce something.

375
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm going to give away the Wu's house to someone sitting here.

376
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,700
<i>Who is he giving it to?</i>

377
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,740
Miss Wu Cai Hong.

378
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,090
It's Miss Wu.

379
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,730
Everyone heard this.

380
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,890
This house belongs to the Wu family in the first place.

381
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,600
And today, it's returned to its rightful owner.

382
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,240
I'm using this opportunity

383
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,340
to also tell her that

384
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,350
I, Zhou Shao Tian,

385
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,760
starting from today, I will do my best to protect her.

386
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,250
Cai Hong.

387
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,600
I have gotten your family's mansion back.

388
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,780
Where did you get such a big sum of money from?

389
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,380
I'm the General Manager of Rong Da.

390
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,300
Does the General Manger of Rong Da command such a high salary?

391
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,380
Don't try to lie to us.

392
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,110
Your contract is still with her.

393
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,800
I hold 30 percent of the shares in Rong Da.

394
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,160
You just started operations and you are already successful?

395
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,870
I borrowed money from the moneylenders. I will return the loan when I'm successful.

396
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,650
- Not from a bank.
- Take a seat.

397
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,650
This

398
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,980
proves that you didn't take out any loans.

399
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,090
Why did you lie to me?

400
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,440
Did my father misjudge the wrong person? Did I too?

401
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,850
What's going on?

402
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:38,720
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

403
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,450
Mr Zhou.

404
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,250
Okay, you are still crying?

405
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,410
Isn't it good that you saw his true colours early

406
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,990
before things grew.

407
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,370
Perhaps, that money

408
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,620
was a loan taken out by Brother Zhou from the moneylenders.

409
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,540
Don't lie to yourself anymore.

410
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,860
If he managed to borrow that much money for the house,

411
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,790
would you need to leave Huzhou then?

412
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,350
Young Master. Zhou Shao Tian is here.

413
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,170
He said that it's urgent and he needs to see Miss Wu Cai Hong.

414
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,170
What's so good about seeing her except to listen to his conman stories?

415
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,820
Tell him to leave.

416
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,810
Perhaps, I should listen to his explanations.

417
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,990
Take everything into account

418
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,000
and think over it carefully.

419
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,570
In the past, when you went to check the accounts of Ling Long,

420
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,240
they were burnt. Other than yourself,

421
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,680
who else knew about this?

422
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,260
Fine. If you say that I burnt them. If I really wanted to burn them,

423
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,560
would I wait until that day?

424
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,160
Also, when you when to Old Cai's home,

425
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,920
in the end, you lost your way.

426
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,720
When you arrived, he and his wife already left.

427
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,510
Other than yourself, did you tell Zhou Shao Tian about it?

428
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:51,550
Brother Shao Tian and the carriage guy knew each other.

429
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,700
It was Zhou Shao Tian who intentionally let the carriage guy brought you there and lost the way.

430
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,790
This wasn't the case. When Fu Sheng started operations,

431
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,350
I met that carriage guy and found out

432
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,050
that he grew up with Brother Shao Tian.

433
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,890
When Brother Shao Tian started Fu Sheng, he asked him over to help him.

434
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,420
Regarding him taking me and losing the way,

435
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,980
Brother Shao Tian didn't know about it.

436
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,140
You believe such lies?

437
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,050
Think about it again. When I brought you to meet Old Cai's lover,

438
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,880
she also got killed in the end.

439
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,010
Other than you,

440
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,700
did Zhou Shao Tian know about this too?

441
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,950
- <i>Sir, I would like to ask you...
- You don't have the money, right? I'm not taking you.</i>

442
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,290
<i>Half of the fare? I will take you there.</i>

443
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,570
<i>I'm certain it is there.</i>

444
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,190
<i>The Cai family's home should be ahead.</i>

445
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,440
<i>Why do I feel that we are going the wrong way?</i>

446
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,140
<i>We have gone too far out of the way. </i>

447
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,950
<i>Cai Hong. Last night,</i>

448
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:56,110
<i>why were you with Jiang Yu?</i>

449
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,460
<i>Miss Wu.</i>

450
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,720
<i>Why is it you?</i>

451
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,420
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

452
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,220
<i>Brother Shao Tian. He...</i>

453
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,950
<i>Do you know each other?</i>

454
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,900
Mr Zhou. It's better that you leave. Miss Wu Cai Hong doesn't want to see you.

455
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,970
Tell me... is it that Cai Hong is not willing to see me

456
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,330
or Jiang Yu doesn't allow her to see me?

457
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,230
Mr Zhou. Please don't make it difficult for us.

458
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,500
I'm only relaying the message. Please go back.

459
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:44,510
♫<i> Once I thought to account for the end.</i>♫

460
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,060
♫<i> I now no longer retreat.</i>♫

461
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,370
♫<i> My heart is afraid to face it </i>♫

462
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,870
♫<i>Not willing to compromise.</i>♫

463
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:02,020
♫<i> After being hurt, if you cry </i>♫

464
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,720
♫<i>Love will not be afraid. </i>♫

465
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:13,500
♫<i>Suddenly, we all need to believe in fate. </i>♫

466
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,120
♫<i> Who are you to me? ♫</i>

467
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,620
♫<i>I am filled with sadness. </i>♫

468
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,020

00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,680

<i>Sweetness.</i>

475
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,370
<i>When your father passed away, the police took</i>

476
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,740
<i>all the ledgers that were sealed.</i>

477
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,980
<i>A few days ago, when the police delivered the ledgers</i>

478
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,890
<i>they were sealed in secret.</i>

479
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,390
<i>Do you know where he kept in the ledger?</i>

480
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,140
<i>No but I think that</i>

481
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,560
<i>since the police have concluded the investigation,</i>

482
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,870
<i>there shouldn't be any problems with the ledger.</i>

483
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,710
<i>Sure enough, this is not what I expected that</i>

484
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,190
<i>they went to Old Cai's hometown.</i>

485
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,120
<i>Brother Shao Tian, can you go with me when I leave today?</i>

486
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,200
<i>I'm afraid I can't today as I have made an appointment for my mother with the hospital.</i>

487
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,260
<i>She is sick. Why don't we go tomorrow?</i>

488
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,430
<i>It's only just a day's difference.</i>

489
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,790
<i>What Jiang Yu said is logical. Every time,</i>

490
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:51,760
<i>Brother Shao Tian always had an excuse to delay. Brother Shao Tian,</i>

491
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,590
<i>I don't know how to trust you.</i>

492
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,640
Madam. This is a small gesture.

493
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,840
It's not small at all.

494
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,930
You are rich now. How could your gift be small?

495
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,990
Cai Yun. Brew the best tea for Brother Shao Tian now.

496
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,270
Brother Shao Tian, take a seat first. I'm going to brew tea for you.

497
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,870
Come, Shao Tian. Sit.

498
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,660
Sit down now.

499
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,180
A few days ago, at the auction,

500
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,850
you bought our home. I read it in the newspapers.

501
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,630
You are young and promising! Our Cai Hong

502
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,860
has good tastes for choosing you as her husband.

503
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,510
Madam. Thank you for your compliment.

504
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,220
If you don't mind, I will send someone to take you and Cai Yun there

505
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,830
to let you live at the Wu mansion as soon as possible.

506
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,170
Look at you. Seriously.

507
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,470
Why are you still calling me Madam? Call me Mother.

508
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,920
How distant.
Quick, quick, quick.

509
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,900
Come, have your tea.

510
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,230
My husband really had good tastes.

511
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,490
He chose such a good son-in-law.

512
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,790
Cai Yun and I will benefit from your association.

513
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,080
Mom. I remember that in the past,

514
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,630
you didn't say this about Brother Shao Tian.

515
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,380
Child. Why are you butting in when adults are talking.

516
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,500
Go and play over there.

517
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,440
This child.

518
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,350
Madam, don't worry.

519
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,280
As long as I'm alive, I will let you and Cai Yun

520
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,630
live a good life like before.

521
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,800
As for Cai Hong and I, no one can come between us.

522
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,020
Who?

523
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,870
Who dares to stop you? Whoever dares to do that?

524
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,760
As her mother, I will be the first to dissent.

525
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,140
You and Cai Hong are the perfect couple!
<i>a talented scholar and a beautiful woman</i>

526
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,540
Your relationship is so good.

527
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,240
As her mother, of course, I will use my hands

528
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,880
and also my legs to approve.

529
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,560
Since this is the case,

530
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,220
there is a favour I would like to ask from you.

531
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,230
You are going to be family soon.

532
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,130
Why are you still asking for favours?

533
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,670
Even if you have a hundred requests, I will agree.

534
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,800
I will thank you first then, Mother.

535
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,080
Sorry to disturb you.

536
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,860
I would like to ask if you are a maid for the Jiang family.

537
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,930
Yes.

538
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,990
What is it?

539
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:00,380
Could you please pass this to Wu Cai Hong?

540
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,690
- This...
- Please.

541
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,740
This is from her sister.

542
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,720
Her mother is sick. She would like her to go home for a while.

543
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,160
Okay, I will help you with this.

544
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,040
Please accept this as a small gesture.

545
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,550
Tell her that her sister sent this.

546
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,370
Don't worry, I will remember this.

547
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:33,940
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

548
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,690
- This is from your sister.
- Thanks.

549
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,060
Please watch the fire for me. When the soup is ready, deliver this.

550
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,420
Where are you going?

551
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,250
I have some urgent matters. I'm going to ask Young Master for time off.

552
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,300
What's so urgent?

553
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,710
Someone delivered a note to say that my mother is sick.

554
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,770
I would like to take the day off to visit her.

555
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,030
Is it serious?

556
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,190
I'm not very clear about it either.

557
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,160
In any case, I don't have anything to do today. I will go back with you.

558
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,290
No need. I can go home alone.

559
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:32,770
What if you need to send her to the hospital or need medicine, do you have the money?

560
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,190
Cai Hong.

561
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,110
Why is it you? Where is my Mom and Cai Yun?

562
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,480
I sent men to take your mother and Cai Yun to the Wu's home.

563
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,420
But Cai Yun wrote to say that my mom is sick. What's wrong with her?

564
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,900
She is fine. I miss you. That's why I asked her for a favour.

565
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:09,010
You lied to me?

566
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:09,910
- I'm going to tell them.
- Cai Hong.

567
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,980
- I don't want this money from an unknown source.
- Don't leave. Listen to my explanation.

568
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,430
Let me go. I don't want to listen to your explanations.

569
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:17,360
I would like to listen to your explanations on where you got the money from.

570
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,710
Why are you everywhere?

571
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,960
Who are you to Wu Cai Hong?

572
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,130
Why should I explain it to you?

573
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:30,600
Brother Shao Tian, I'm asking you. The money you used to buy my family home,

574
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,170
did it belong to Ling Long?

575
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,840
Think carefully before you explain.

576
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,820
Once you start a lie, it will be the beginning of a thousand more lies.

577
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,950
I borrowed that money from Miss Lu Man.

578
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,000
Miss Lu Man lent you $500,000?

579
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,050
Why would she lend that to you?

580
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,350
The loan was part of my condition.

581
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,130
What condition?

582
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,040
Lu Man requested a very difficult thing.

583
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,440
It will be very risky to complete the task.

584
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,150
It may be at the expense of my life

585
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,800
but I already promised her.

586
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,310
What task is that which will require risking your life?

587
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:16,150
It's not very clear now. It seems to have something to do with General Lu Du.

588
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,530
It is a military secret.

589
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,980
Cai Hong.

590
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,590
Other than this life,

591
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,960
I don't have anything else.

592
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,840
If I lose you again,

593
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,500
will there be any more meaning in my life?

594
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,710
Being able to use my life to repay for the kindness of your family,

595
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,370
I think it's worth it.

596
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,690
Are you crazy?

597
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,970
What could be more important than life?

598
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,310
Wake up.

599
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,620
- You could even believe this?
- I already signed a life and death contract with Lu Man.

600
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,660
Is your life and death contract similar to your contract as the General Manager?

601
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,020
A shake of a hand and you could get $1 million.

602
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,520
I have only one life.

603
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,350
But for Cai Hong,

604
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,860
I can do anything.

605
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,710
I don't want the house.

606
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:16,110
I want you to sell it and return the money to Lu Man.

607
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,470
It's already too late.

608
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,720
Don't listen to his nonsense. Let's go.

609
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,350
Cai Hong.

610
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,690
Trust me.

611
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,390
Brother Shao Tian.

612
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:01,200
I hope that your family and mine will be safe and live in peace.

613
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,560
Also, don't lie to me again.

614
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,510
I'm not lying.

615
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,180
Whether you want to accept the house or not, it's not important.

616
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,410
It's from my sincere heart.

617
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:21,490
Moreover, the Wu's house belongs to you in the first place.

618
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,270
<i>Zhou Shao Tian.</i>

619
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,130
<i>Let's see how long you can last.</i>

620
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,910
Do you believe what he just said?

621
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:10,650
I don't know but I really didn't need him to spend so much money

622
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,090
to buy back my family home.

623
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:19,360
I only hope that he has been sincere towards me

624
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,620
with his sincere feelings.

625
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,460
What Zhou Shao Tian just said,

626
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,440
I don't believe a single word of it.

627
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,460
But the truth is not that far away. I really want to see

628
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,790
how long he can last.

629
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,600
Boss. Do you remember this fountain pen?

630
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,860
Mr Jiang. How could I not remember? This is from my shop.

631
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,630
What's wrong? Is there any problems?

632
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,750
No. I would like to ask you.

633
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,580
Other than me, did you sell this fountain pen to anyone else?

634
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,850
No because this fountain pen is rare.

635
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,250
Do you remember when you first bought this fountain pen,

636
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,680
there was an extremely beautiful woman who wanted to buy it too. She was wiling to pay a higher price.

637
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,450
If I had the product, I would have sold it to her earlier.

638
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,100
Okay, I know.

639
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,480
Sorry, Mr Jiang. We don't sell this fountain pen in my shop.

640
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,200
Only rich and people with status could buy such a fountain pen.

641
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,340
They would have to order this from overseas

642
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,070
and use the local agent to deliver it here.

643
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,770
I would like to trouble you to check

644
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,390
the overseas address of this fountain pen.
