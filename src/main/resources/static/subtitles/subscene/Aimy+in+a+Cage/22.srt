♫<i> So long, I have waited for so long... </i>♫

00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:16,400
♫<i> Waited for your love to bloom. </i>♫

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,840

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:29,190
♫<i> Yet couldn't find the way to your heart. </i>♫

5
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:35,660

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,900

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:48,340
♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

8
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:54,860
♫<i> In the end I did not get your heart. </i>♫

10

The Cage of Love

19
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,380
<i>Episode 22</i>

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,730
Why isn't Jiang Yu not making any moves?

21
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,820
Eh?

22
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,630
Why is he standing there and not making any moves?

23
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,940
Looks like he will be out soon.

24
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,840
<i>Why isn't he moving? There is not much time left.</i>

25
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,810
<i>That's right. The incense stick will burn out soon.</i>

26
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,760
<i>What's going on? What is he doing?</i>

27
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,730
<i>Why isn't he making any moves?</i>

28
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,630
<i>He's making us so anxious.</i>

29
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,100
<i>What is he trying to do?</i>

30
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,140
Boss Jiang. Is there a problem?

31
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,670
No.

32
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,670
<i>He seems to be moving. Why is he holding a brush?</i>

33
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,090
<i>I don't know. Just watch.</i>

34
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,440
Cai Hong. He is not dyeing the cloth. Why is he drawing?

35
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,300
Brother, what are you drawing?

36
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,850
Look, he's using the brush to dye the cloth.

37
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,720
If God wants to give me money, no one can stop him.

38
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,300
Mom. Why isn't he dyeing the cloth? It's not like he doesn't have the materials.

39
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,250
Let me tell you. It must be that he doesn't know how to dye.

40
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:17,080
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

41
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,650
The Jiang family has been in the dyeing and weaving business for many generations.

42
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,270
Does Jiang Yu know this technique or not?

43
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,780
If he doesn't,

44
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,960
he could have sent his master instead.

45
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,840
It's like a drawing.

46
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,310
Time's up.

47
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,100
Both, please show your skills.

48
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,230
<i>Great!</i>

49
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,390
<i>Rong Da, beautiful!</i>

50
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,370
<i>Great.</i>

51
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,550
<i>Rong Da!</i>

52
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,570
<i>Beautiful! Great!</i>

53
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,550
<i>Rong Da!</i>

54
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,960
<i>Great.</i>

55
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,790
<i>That's great.</i>

56
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,200
<i>Amazing.</i>

57
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,790
<i>Great.</i>

58
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,750
Jiang Yu is really something.

59
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,200
<i>Perhaps, grudges shouldn't end in revenge.</i>

60
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,630
<i>Just like in this dirty pond,</i>

61
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,420
<i>such a clean and pure flower could even grow in it.</i>

62
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,510
<i>Great.</i>

63
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,760
Fortunately, I didn't lose everything.

64
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,830
However, it was very exciting.

65
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,320
Yes.

66
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,790
Governor Liu.

67
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,490
Is this considered a dyed cloth?

68
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,450
In regards to the remark,

69
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,400
there are dyes on this cloth. Don't tell me this is not considered dyeing?

70
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,120
Whether it's accepted or not, let's let the audience decide.

71
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,770
Everyone, isn't this so?

72
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,320
Okay, let's start the vote now.

73
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,680
Give your lily to the one whom you like his work best.

74
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,190
Let's start with Warlord Lu and President Zhang.

75
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,560
<i>Great.</i>

76
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,730
<i>Come and vote.</i>

77
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,010
<i>Great.</i>

78
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,530
<i>Ling Long!</i>

79
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,500
Mr Zhang, please start first.

80
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,540
Okay.

81
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,570
I...

82
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,430
One stalk for Ling Long.

83
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,080
One stalk for Rong Da.

84
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,120
Miss Lu. Why aren't you voting?

85
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,800
For fairness, we can only vote once as contestants.

86
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,570
I will leave my vote to someone else.

87
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,290
<i>Why do you still need to consider? Of course, you should choose Rong Da.</i>

88
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,980
<i>Brother Shao Tian's cloth is indeed beautiful but it's not second to none.</i>

89
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,440
But Boss Jiang's cloth was personally drawn on.

90
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,260
It can be considered as second to none.

91
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,230
Who cares about that? I bet a lot of money on Shao Tian.

92
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,820
I will be stupid if I don't vote for Shao Tian.

93
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,370
Thirty four stalks for Ling Long.

94
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,540
Thirty five stalks for Ling Long.

95
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,380
Sixty one stalks for Ling Long.

96
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,810
I think we can't tell who the winner is for this first round.

97
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,500
This is how a contest should be.

98
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,230
This way, it's more interesting.

99
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,650
- Isn't that so? <br>- Rong Da has one hundred stalks.

100
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,490
No. There will be a clear victor soon.

101
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,050
One hundred and twenty stalks for Rong Da.

102
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,090
One hundred and twenty seven stalks for Rong Da.

103
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,170
Ling Long also has one hundred and twenty seven stalks.

104
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,740
I really didn't imagine the result would be like this.

105
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,590
Both their votes are equal.

106
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,390
Since this is the case, I will now announce that they...

107
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,600
Wait.

108
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,510
I haven't voted yet.

109
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:12,420
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

110
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,940
I remember you said that grudges

111
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,000
shouldn't end in revenge.

112
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,560
And that even in a dirty pond, a clean and pure flower could even grow.

113
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,900
At that time, I really couldn't forget my unhappiness.

114
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
But you also told me that

115
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,630
you couldn't forget the grudge about that person who killed your father.

116
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,890
I think

117
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,730
I can't forget it either.

118
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,810
Miss Wu Cai Hong gave the vote to Rong Da.

119
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,270
This is the first part of the contest.

120
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:27,760
No one could imagine that this would be the result.

121
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,660
Yet Zhou Shao Tian's cloth

122
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,600
is very deserving.

123
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,550
The winner is Zhou Shao Tian.

124
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,220
The second part of the contest will be the day after tomorrow.

125
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,380
Let our honourable guest announce the winner.

126
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,750
Xiao Man. Your silk contest is rather interesting.

127
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,150
Mr Zhang. After you first.

128
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,330
Warlord Lu, please.

129
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,050
Brother, I am not convinced about the dye.

130
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,370
What was so great about Zhou Shao Tian's cloth?

131
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,880
Leave first.

132
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,470
What's going on?

133
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,360
I couldn't dye it.

134
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,230
Why?

135
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,060
Someone tampered with my cloth. I couldn't dye it.

136
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,830
Why didn't you stop the contest then? Someone is playing around with it.

137
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:45,010
How am I to stop it? I was the one who personally brought the cloth.

138
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,530
Cai Hong. You did well in the voting.

139
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,340
It's right that you gave it to Shao Tian.

140
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,320
You should thank Cai Hong properly today.

141
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,210
Stop there.

142
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,260
What's wrong? Not happy with losing?

143
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,540
Competing in the silk contest with such despicable people like you

144
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,760
is only bringing us exquisite shame.

145
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,780
If you have the substance, you should compete fairly.

146
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,480
You sabotaged the cloth. Do you call yourself a righteous competitor?

147
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,930
- You... <br>- By the way,

148
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,290
you are not a righteous competitor at all. You are a bandit.

149
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,680
Who are you calling a bandit?

150
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,740
You should know clearly in your heart what you did.

151
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,060
Fei Fei, let's go.

152
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,930
What are you talking about?

153
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,710
Enough, stepmom. Cai Yun, go back with her. I still have matters to attend to here.

154
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,410
Okay, mom.

155
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,490
Be careful then.

156
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,620
- Mom. <br>- Let's keep the money.

157
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,500
I would like to check both the clothes.

158
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,050
How could this happen?

159
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,750
Did you sabotage this?

160
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,810
I don't know what's going on.

161
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:23,250
They were both here when we came in. I didn't do anything to this.

162
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,430
You have mistook me.

163
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,120
There are many things

164
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,940
which doesn't require sabotages.

165
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,460
The motive of this silk contest

166
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,330
is to let Jiang Yu take out his secret formula.

167
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,990
It's not important to sabotage anything.

168
00:15:51,990 --> 00:16:00,070
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

169
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,630
Congratulations.

170
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,970
Don't get involved between me and Jiang Yu. I can win fairly,

171
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,580
Isn't it good enough that you win? The method is not that important.

172
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,280
If not, how will we force Jiang Yu to resort to his method?

173
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,730
- I think the last battle... <br>- I already told you that

174
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,870
I wanted a fair contest with Jiang Yu.

175
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:42,740
If you hadn't gotten involved today, I wouldn't have won that fairly.

176
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,350
If you didn't sabotage it, I wouldn't have any misunderstandings with Cai Hong.

177
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,620
If you get involved again, don't blame me

178
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,410
for voiding our contract.

179
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,330
Okay then. I promise you that I won't get involved again.

180
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,190
I will wait for your good news tomorrow.

181
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,310
Wu Cai Hong will die in my hands one day.

182
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,930
Shao Tian, you are becoming more capable.

183
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,040
Winning the silk contest is such beautiful thing.

184
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,550
My deceased husband really didn't misjudge you.

185
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,740
Cai Hong is in there. I will call her for you.

186
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,030
Cai Hong.

187
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,180
Cai Hong.

188
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:01,290
What are you doing? He came here especially to see you and you are leaving? So rude.

189
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,110
Have a good chat between the both of you.

190
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,780
Stay here for dinner. I'm going to the kitchen.

191
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,510
I know that you are angry about the silk contest.

192
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:22,020
Please believe me. I didn't do that.

193
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,200
You didn't do it? It can't be Miss Lu...

194
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,340
It was Miss Lu. She was afraid I couldn't defeat Jiang Yu

195
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,420
and that Rong Da would have to withdraw from Huzhou.

196
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,710
It's because of me again.

197
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,020
I forced Miss Lu to take this step.

198
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,310
Who would be willing to withdraw from the dyeing industry from Huzhou?

199
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:57,030
She doesn't has anything to do with me but she helped me.

200
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,030
It's because of you.

201
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,420
Did I give you a lot of trouble?

202
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,450
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have to owe her such a big favour.

203
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,730
Don't say this. If it weren't for you,

204
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,090
I couldn't have beaten Jiang Yu. I already told Miss Lu

205
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,430
that I could win fairly against Jiang Yu.

206
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:25,440
Jiang Yu already lost the first part. If he loses the second part,

207
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,140
he will have to withdraw from the dyeing industry.

208
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,820
Thus, he may use the secret formula. As long as he uses it,

209
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,730
we will have the evidence.

210
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,140
I will tell Director Chen and he won't let him get away.

211
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,960
So, the motive of the silk contest is to make Jiang Yu

212
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,410
admit that he killed Old Master Wu to get ahold of the secret formula?

213
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,170
Sit.

214
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,640
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

215
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,340
I was afraid that he would catch wind of this. If Jiang Yu finds out,

216
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,100
he will never take part in the silk contest. Especially,

217
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,640
if he use the secret formula, he will then be admitting that he is the killer.

218
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,690
Brother Shao Tian is right. Director Chen, you must help me.

219
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,770
We have been investigating this case for a long time. I will like to find out the truth too. I will be there to observe on that day.

220
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,670
If Jiang Yu uses the secret formula, it will mean that he is the killer.

221
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,910
I will arrest him.

222
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,510
A few workers resigned this afternoon.

223
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,790
One of them was a skilled master.

224
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,070
They have all gone to Rong Da.

225
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,980
Brother, we only lost the first time. What should we do next?

226
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,400
It's my fault. I already said that

227
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,450
I didn't want you to get involved.

228
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,000
Yet until the end, I still need you to take the burden with me.

229
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,230
Brother, we are family. We should share the burdens together.

230
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,210
I have watched him working so hard

231
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,790
and suffering so much before you could come back to Huzhou to start anew.

232
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,930
I can't just watch and see you lose everything.

233
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,780
Fei Fei, don't worry. We will never lose.

234
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,510
As long as we use the Jiang's family's secret formula,

235
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,090
we will never lose.

236
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,100
Secret formula?

237
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:44,370
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

238
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,210
Father.

239
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,760
Please don't blame me.

240
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,900
<i>- Who are you betting on? <br>- I'm betting on Rong Da.</i>

241
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,070
<i>Are you sure Zhou Shao Tian will win?</i>

242
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,500
<i>If you want to bet, bet now.</i>

243
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,780
<i>How much do you want to bet?</i>

244
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,250
I bet too little yesterday. Today, I placed a big bet.

245
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,000
Do you think you will win?

246
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,400
Of course.

247
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,530
- How could that be such a good thing? <br>- That's right. Your winnings will be big.

248
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,070
<i>Bet on this and you will get rich.</i>

249
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,760
Yesterday's contest was really exciting.

250
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,250
I thought it would end in a draw.

251
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:04,440
I didn't think that ultimately, the winner would be Zhou Shao Tian.

252
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,500
Human affairs are hard to predict.

253
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,280
It's not confirmed yet who will be the final winner today.

254
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,580
Go now.

255
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,320
You too.

256
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,970
$50? $100?

257
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,220
Let's make it $100.

258
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,100
- Governor. <br>- Why are you only back now? Did you buy it?

259
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,430
- Yes. <br>- How big is the bet? <br>- $100.

260
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,680
Okay, leave.

261
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,000
$100.

262
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,400
I must win back everything what I lost yesterday.

263
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,540
Everyone, the second part of the contest

264
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,080
starts now. Let's invite our four judges.

265
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,930
Everyone, let's welcome them.

266
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,700
First is the Dean He of the Jiangnu School of Dyeing.

267
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,350
He has been in the dyeing industry for over thirty years.

268
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,180
Second is Miss Ma Da. She is from a famous dyeing factory in Jiangnan.

269
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,470
Third is the owner of the department store in our Huzhou, Mr Li.

270
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,960
He has been engaged in fabric sourcing for more than two decades.

271
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,410
The fourth is our city's most prestigious teacher in printing transfer.

272
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:28,040
Master Li, whose works are real masterpieces.

273
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,290
<i>Great.</i>

274
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,290
<i>Not bad.</i>

275
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,860
Judges, please take a seat. Next, I would like to introduce

276
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,110
the second theme for this part of the contest.

277
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,640
The second theme is reproductions.

278
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,370
<i>Reproductions?</i>

279
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,250
Before the incense stick burns out...

280
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,170
they must reproduce an exact replica of the original cloth.

281
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,900
They will be judged by our esteemed guests.

282
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,330
Similarly, the one with the most votes will be the winner.

283
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,070
<i>How did you know that it will be reproductions?</i>

284
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,270
<i>I have my own methods,</i>

285
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,590
<i>but I want you to lose to Jiang Yu this time.</i>

286
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:11,340
<i>Why are you using this opportunity to kick out Jiang Yu?</i>

287
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,040
<i>Don't forget what our initial motive is.</i>

288
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,860
<i>What we need is the secret formula. This is just a reproduction.</i>

289
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,160
<i>Jiang Yu will definitely not use the secret formula.</i>

290
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,930
<i>Even if you win, what about the secret formula?</i>

291
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,680
<i>The last two parts will be even tougher.</i>

292
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,050
<i>Even if you lose, you won't embarrass yourself. Think about this carefully.</i>

293
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,060
<i>The first part, you sabotaged Jiang Yu.</i>

294
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,420
<i>The second part, you want me to deliberately lose to Jiang Yu.</i>

295
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,940
<i>Why can't Jiang Yu and I have a fair and open competition?</i>

296
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,620
<i> Fairness? You should know better than me that,</i>

297
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,520
<i>In this world, there is no such thing as fairness.</i>

298
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,500
<i>Don't forget our first goal just because you want to prove yourself.</i>

299
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,410
<i>If you win this part, you won't be able to force Jiang Yu to use his secret formula.</i>

300
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:07,250
<i>When that time comes, so what if Jiang Yu leaves the dyeing industry?</i>

301
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,830
<i>Wu Cai Hong won't be able to get the proof that Jiang Yu is the killer.</i>

302
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:16,690
<i>She will probably not forget this for the rest of her life.</i>

303
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,800
Brother Shao Tian.

304
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,400
Brother Shao Tian.

305
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,940
Brother Shao Tian. What are you thinking of?

306
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,930
Nothing.

307
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,710
I don't want you to lose just because of me.

308
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,150
You started picking up the skills when you were very young.

309
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,230
You picked up very good skills during the past ten years.

310
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,830
In this silk contest,

311
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,340
all the seniors in the dyeing industry are watching you.

312
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,770
You have your pride.

313
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,370
If you don't do your best,

314
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:57,120
how would Jiang Yu know that we are his true rivals?

315
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,140
In any case,

316
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,510
I don't want you to lose the contest just because of me.

317
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,310
Thank you.

318
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,960
Let's invite the two contestants on stage now.

319
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,020
<i>Great. Victory to Ling Long!</i>

320
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:30,560
<i>Victory to Hong Da!</i>

321
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,090
This cloth is from the Tang Dynasty.

322
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,970
It requires the use of beeswax as an anti-agent.

323
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,830
Then heating the wax into the pattern on the back will be crucial

324
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,780
to continue printing

325
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,070
on this quality of silk.

326
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,660
As experts in dyeing we have high demands.

327
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,380
Moreover, this is the most famous creation in the Tang Dynasty.

328
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,230
This art was made with superb printing.

329
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,870
It will be difficult to reproduce its charm.

330
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,320
Next, I'm announcing that

331
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,400
the contest will begin.

332
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,590
<i>Victory to Hong Da!</i>

333
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:32,510
<i>Victory to Hong Da!</i>

334
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:53,340
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

335
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,820
For this part of the contest,

336
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,870
that rascal, Zhou Shao Tian is working very diligently.

337
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,460
Jiang Yu is not slacking either.

338
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,270
Jiang Yu doesn't depend on it.

339
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,990
Is Zhou Shao Tian your man?

340
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:37,350
Didn't we agree that we would have an open and fair contest?

341
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,510
Time's up. Please display your works.

342
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,100
<i>Excellent!</i>

343
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,710
<i>It's really beautiful. It looks exactly the same.</i>

344
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,070
Rong Da will definitely win this time.

345
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,710
Rong Da's performance is not bad.

346
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,070
Time's up. Why didn't you hang it up yet?

347
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,630
<i>Did you ruin the dye?</i>

348
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,910
<i>Hang it up.</i>

349
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,790
That's right. If you can't do it, just admit your defeat now.

350
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:03,590
- What's the hurry? <br>- Mom, don't say anything anymore. Sit down now.

351
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,060
<i>It's great!</i>

352
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,680
<i>Ling Long!</i>

353
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,100
<i>Look, it's not bad.</i>

354
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,540
I think Boss Jiang's cloth has surpassed that of the original.

355
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,840
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

356
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,940
Why can't I see it? So what about Jiang Yu?

357
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,860
The cloth may be dyed better but why is it superfluous?

358
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:48,670
So what if there are extras? Shao Tian is definitely the winner.

359
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,920
<i>- That's right. <br>- How could you say that?</i>

360
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,540
<i>It's definitely great.</i>

361
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:03,880
Everyone, please tell us your views about this contest.

362
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,650
Please come up with sound advise.

363
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,470
I will speak first then.

364
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:20,750
We all saw the rules with the standards.

365
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:26,700
Based on the rule of the contest, I feel that Mr Zhou's cloth is closest to the original.

366
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,540
I don't care about new trends. Rules are rules.

367
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,290
Based on the rule, Mr Zhou's cloth is closer to the original. He should be the winner.

368
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,920
Fine. Well said.

369
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,180
I think Boss Jiang's is more remarkable.

370
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,360
Even though the flower motifs on his cloth

371
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,280
is not close to the original, it's very innovative.

372
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,070
It is fit for our currently developing trends.

373
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:54,560
People like us in this industry should go for innovations.

374
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,950
Not only does it has a new approach, Boss Jiang's innovation

375
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,060
deserves compliments.

376
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,330
But the big national development should be vigorously promoted.

377
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,710
I support Boss Jiang.

378
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,680
Dean He has already said what's in my heart.

379
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,000
I support Boss Jiang too.

380
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,840
In this case, do we still abide by the rule?

381
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,340
The newly appointed President sent Mr Zhang to purchase the goods.

382
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,890
Looking at how young Mr Zhang is, he is definitely for the new style.

383
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,640
Huzhou needs to show this side.

384
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,090
That's right. Master Lin.

385
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,300
Do you think that Boss Jiang's skill is not up to scratch?

386
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,920
Of course not.

387
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,910
On the contrary, it's excellent.

388
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,270
Since this is the case, Master Lin,

389
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,730
let's be harmonious and have a mutual consent.

390
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,270
That's right. Let's be harmonious.

391
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,340
Fine.

392
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,640
Everyone, please continue.

393
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,740
Development and innovation must be awakened together.

394
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:08,240
Isn't that so?

395
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,210
Brother, why did you dye it differently? You clearly could do that.

396
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,790
Regardless of how I dyed it,

397
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,670
I will definitely win this part.

398
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,300
How could this be possible? Why are you so sure?

399
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:44,080
After the four judges have done their assessments, their verdict is...

400
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,470
Ling Long dye factory.

401
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:54,230
<i>- Great. <br>- How could I lose again?</i>

402
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,320
<i>How could you say that? What's going on?</i>

403
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,110
- How could it be this way? <br>- Mom. keep quiet.

404
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:09,380
Brother, we won. You are too amazing.

405
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,210
I already said, what benefits did Jiang Yu give you?

406
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,630
Don't leave.

407
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,600
How did this benefit you? I'm not done with you yet.

408
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,470
Explain this clearly to me. I'm so angry.

409
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,160
I lost everything.

410
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,510
Brother Shao Tian.

411
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,650
Brother Shao Tian.

412
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:44,600
In my heart, you won.

413
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,550
This is very subjective.

414
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,370
If everyone goes after the new trends,

415
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,180
who will satisfy our clients?

416
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,660
I only care how you feel.

417
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,130
Jiang Yu can see your ability now.

418
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,470
If he wants to beat you, he can only use his secret formula.

419
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,020
He won't be complacent for too long.

420
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:17,280
<i>Wu Mansion </i>

421
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:33,230
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

422
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,590
What's wrong? Are you still frustrated about losing to Jiang Yu?

423
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:52,440
I can tell that Jiang Yu is deliberating testing us today.

424
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,930
His last piece was superfluous. <i>overdone</i>

425
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,420
But it's good too.

426
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,340
Today, other than those older Masters,

427
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,320
I'm close with the rest of them.

428
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,310
Before the contest, I already talked to them.

429
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,360
I told them that this time, I must let Jiang Yu win.

430
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:17,040
But looks like your skills today is not as strong as Jiang Yu's.

431
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,660
Miss Lu.

432
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:24,060
I know very well what you are up to.

433
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:29,170
If you still want to achieve your goal, keep quiet now.

434
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,860
Okay, I talked too much.

435
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,790
All men need their face and pride.

436
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,770
But don't blame me for telling you this today.

437
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,750
What you lost today is just the contest.

438
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,030
You still have the chance to reverse it in three days.

439
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,130
But if you had lost a woman today,

440
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,210
the loser will be Rong Da.

441
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,430
I'm afraid it won't be that simple as losing face.

442
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,490
I won't lose face.

443
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,290
Don't worry. Because of Cai Hong,

444
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:08,410
I will definitely force Jiang Yu to use his secret formula at the final part of the contest.

445
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:12,280
Okay, don't forget what you promised me.

446
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,400
Please do your best in three days

447
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,390
to make Jiang Yu hand over the secret formula.

448
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,280
Can't you just do it for me?

449
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,170
I just overheard your conversation with Miss Lu.

450
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,630
Suspend the competition.

451
00:40:54,630 --> 00:41:00,450
If Jiang Yu really doesn't have the secret formula and Rong Da loses in the end,

452
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,130
I really don't know what I should do.

453
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,530
Cai Hong.

454
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:14,530
Don't you have any confidence in me?

455
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,310
Are you afraid that I will lose to Jiang Yu?

456
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,460
- No. <br>- Don't tell me to give up then.

457
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,850
I'm not only doing this for you.

458
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:26,700
I want to continue with this contest too.

459
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,980
Okay, go back and rest first.

460
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,540
I still need to prepare for the final part of the contest.

461

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

462
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:05,260
<i>Am I being too selfish and thinking only of myself?</i>

463
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,830
<i>I have never thought of Brother Shao Tian's difficulties.</i>

464
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:20,500
<i>Jiang Yu, are you affected by the impass as well?</i>

465

466
