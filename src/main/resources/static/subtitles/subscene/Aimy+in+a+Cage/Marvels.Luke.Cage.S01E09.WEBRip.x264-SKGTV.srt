00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:15,459
I should be out there doing my job.

3
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:19,838
[Krasner] Your job is out there
waiting for you, Detective.

4
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:22,173
The question is,
how badly do you want it?

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,679
You work for the department?
You a shrink?

6
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,764
[Krasner] I was on the job for 15 years.

7
00:00:29,848 --> 00:00:31,725
I left to become a psychologist.

8
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:33,101
[scoffs]

9
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:35,895
I'm with the peer assistance program.
I'm a volunteer.

10
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:38,565
Well, how about I volunteer
my way out of this chair,

11
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:42,318
tell you to kiss my ass,
and talk to my union rep?

12
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:44,988
Well, you could do that, sure.

13
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:49,909
But your inspector would guarantee
that you'll be at your desk,

14
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:53,121
and the only time you'll see the street
is in the parking lot,

15
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:56,583
or if you go to get coffee, or...
look out the window.

16
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:04,257
- This is voluntary, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,468
- And off the record?
- Absolutely.

18
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:10,263
So why are we doing this
in an interrogation room?

19
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:14,518
You'd be more candid at a Starbucks?
Really?

20
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:19,481
Mmm... Maybe at M&G's, after a shift.

21
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:22,567
Still can't believe
that place went out of business.

22
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:24,318
I miss Copeland's.

23
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:26,738
[chuckling] Who doesn't?

24
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:34,203
Whatever.
[inhales sharply] Let's do this.

25
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:41,377
Detective Mercedes Kelly Knight,
badge 3-0-9-3-5.

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,171
You know, you're not being recorded.

27
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:45,549
Of course I am.

28
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:50,720
You know this is bullshit, right?

29
00:01:50,804 --> 00:01:52,806
Things got rough with a hostile witness.

30
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:55,559
You think that's the first time
this has ever happened?

31
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,396
You lost control.

32
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,358
[inhales] And it's all about control
with you, isn't it?

33
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:06,945
I mean, that's why you were a point guard.

34
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:09,447
You wanted to be the one
to distribute the ball, right?

35
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:11,365
It's 'cause I was short,

36
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:14,160
and it was the only way
I could get on the court, so...

37
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:16,913
- 'Cause you had to play the game.
- It's not a game for me.

38
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:18,372
Then why get benched

39
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:21,710
for something as stupid
as getting physical with Claire Temple?

40
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,733
[Stryker echoing] Do you love?
Do you love?

41
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:46,067
Hmm?

42
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:48,903
[Stryker] Oh, come on.
You're not gonna beg?

43
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:51,239
Oh, come on. Not even a little bit?

44
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:52,490
[crying]

45
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:56,035
If you gonna kill me, then just do it.

46
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,888
What shook you?

47
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:17,807
Was it losing your gun to one suspect

48
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:20,518
while trying to arrest another
without backup?

49
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,436
Was it the extra eyes because of Scarfe?

50
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,563
Was it this Luke Cage guy?

51
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:27,901
What pushed you towards career suicide?

52
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:31,988
[chuckles]

53
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:36,159
You know how many times
I've been in this same goddamn box

54
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:37,994
on the other side of the table?

55
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:43,374
You think you are gonna break me?

56
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:46,585
Bring it.

57
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,715
Like I said,
this is not an interrogation.

58
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,301
I'm not here to break you.

59
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:57,013
You've already done that yourself.

60
00:03:57,096 --> 00:04:00,767
The question is, how broken are you?

61
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:03,227
And can you be fixed?

62
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:08,399

68
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:51,067
Sweet Christmas.

69

[drumming]

71
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:12,356
Hold up, hold up.
Somebody ain't playing that thing right.

72
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,318
Tighten up over here.
Tighten up over here, all right?

73
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:18,237
Let's do this, man. We rehearsed it.
Let's get this done.

76
00:06:56,817 --> 00:07:01,780
[Shades] So we've checked every truck,
every landfill in every borough.

77
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:04,700
And for all of that, we've got...

Nothing yet.

80
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:16,921
[Shades] Nothing yet. Nothing yet.

81
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:19,257
[Stryker] Y'all can't find Luke Cage?

82
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,844
What, he just dissipated?

83
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:26,305
Like smoke?

84
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,561
See, that's the thing.

85
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:38,692
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

86
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:40,862
- [gunshot]
- [gasps]

87
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:42,196

[Darnell gasping]

89
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:52,415
- There's nothing magical about it.
- [groaning]

90
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:54,333
Follow the smoke.

91
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,463
Or the damn garbage truck.

92
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:08,014
[chuckles] Well...

93
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:10,975
you ain't Houdini.

94
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,190
And you ain't Rick
from <i>Casablanca,</i> neither.

95
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,109
What?

96
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:24,447
You thought you could
whisper in Mariah's ear...

97
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:27,241
have her do your dirty work...

98
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:30,536
then you're the new king
with the big desk?

99
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,580
Hmm...

102
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:42,506
You killed my friend, Shades.

103
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:46,135
He was my number one seller.

104
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:49,430
Who do you think gave him
that Barron Claiborne there?

105
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,892
You don't have any friends.

106
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:57,480
"A man of too many friends
comes to ruin,

107
00:08:57,563 --> 00:09:02,986
but there is a friend
who comes closer than a brother."

108
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:07,991
Proverbs 18:24.

109
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:12,078
Cornell Stokes was that friend for me.

110
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:17,833
And I could trust him
like I could my own brother.

111
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:21,212
Cornell was losing it.

112
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,423
You trusted me to take care of him.

113
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:28,344
I trusted you to take care of it,
not him.

114
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,516
What? Did you think I was just gonna
give it all to you?

115
00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:37,979
[cocks gun]

116
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:42,984
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't splatter

117
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:45,653
this pristine desk
with your brain matter.

118
00:09:48,156 --> 00:09:50,866
[Zip] Because it won't help you find
Luke Cage any faster?

119
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:56,372
[laughing]

120
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:02,878
You're smarter
than your name implies, Zip.

121
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:07,258
Two rule books
got me through the darkness.

122
00:10:09,718 --> 00:10:11,137
The Bible...

123
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,684
and <i>The 48 Laws of Power.</i>

124
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:20,938
Do you want to know what the 49th is?

125
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:28,779
Luke Cage ain't dead
until you find his goddamn body.

- [Krasner] You had it rough recently.
- Where do you want to start?

142
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:54,823
Who do you talk to when things get bad?

143
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:56,909
I... [sighs]

144
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:00,496
I used to talk to Scarfe.

145
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,292
[stammers] No husband. A boyfriend?

146
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,174
The last time somebody set me up,
I ended up arresting the guy at the table.

147
00:12:11,257 --> 00:12:12,300
- No.
- Yeah.

148
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:13,676
I did a background check,

149
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,470
and he was wanted for robbery
in three different states.

150
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,432
They gave the dude a nickname
at my precinct.

151
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:21,975
- Yeah?
- Called him the Love Bandit.

152
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:24,395
I still get shit about it.

So who's the last person you dated?

- That's personal.
- That's why we're here.

158
00:12:53,216 --> 00:12:54,592
I met a guy at a bar.

159
00:12:55,343 --> 00:12:58,762
I wasn't nice to him, at all.

160
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:01,432
[scoffs] But he didn't care.

161
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,059
He was funny.

162
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:06,354
He wasn't wearing a ring.

163
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:12,610
And the first time he spoke to me,
even in a low cut dress,

164
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,152
he looked at my eyes...

165
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,280
not my breasts.

166
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:20,493
- So?
- So, we talked.

167
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:22,870
I could be myself.

168
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:25,623
He thought I was pretty
and he told me so.

169
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:28,041
We had coffee.

I feel a "but" coming on.

172
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:37,217
- But he wasn't who I thought he was.
- Just like Scarfe?

173
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:40,513
How does that make you feel?

174
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,600
How do you think it makes me feel?

00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:54,026
I didn't want it!

176
00:13:56,904 --> 00:14:00,866
[Mariah] You don't remember Jazmine.
How could you?

177
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:05,746
She was fly. So damn fast.

178
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,709
She used to drive Mama Mabel crazy
with all her boyfriends.

179
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:14,922
Malik was special, though.

180
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:17,675
He was talented.

181
00:14:19,302 --> 00:14:23,681
Played drums on a lot of those
Sugar Hill Records. The old ones.

182
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,520
I really liked him.

183
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:33,982
I thought they were good together.

184
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:38,612
Mama Mabel couldn't stand him.

185
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,866
She knew he was dabbling.

186
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,744
Coke, smack.

187
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:57,756
Malik wanted you, Cornell.
He did. But he OD'd.

188
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,385
And then Jazzy ran off.

189
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:05,348
She told me, "I'm not ready
to be nobody's mama."

190
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,016
And she just left.

191
00:15:10,102 --> 00:15:11,687
She left you, and there you were,

192
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,315
[stammering] wrapped in a blanket
in a basket.

193
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,278
Mama Mabel put you
in my hands that very day.

194
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:26,910
You always thought
I called you Mo for Cottonmouth.

195
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:29,747
Mo was for Moses.

196
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:41,717
I wasn't ready
to be nobody's mama, neither.

197
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:49,850
I did try to protect you from
[stutters] all the shit.

198
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:55,313
I tried... I tried to protect you
from yourself...

199
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,818
but I didn't.

200
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:03,656
[sniffles]

201
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:05,908
[stammering] I'm...

202
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:18,546
You did what you had to do.

203
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,174
I don't know how this happened.

204
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,554
You made a choice... [sighs]

205
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,057
and now we have to pay the price.

206
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:34,352
Diamondback is here to collect.

207
00:16:35,563 --> 00:16:37,355
Diamond-what?

208
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,526
He's not happy
that Cornell is dead, and...

209
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,487
Luke Cage is still alive.

210
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:49,577
Cage is in the wind right now,
and I need your help to find him.

211
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,161
Our frame doesn't work...

212
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:55,082
if he's not there to take the blame.

213
00:16:55,165 --> 00:16:57,793
[stammers] What, you want me
to call the police?

214
00:16:57,876 --> 00:16:59,920
If it comes to that, sure.

215
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:01,672
But right now...

216
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:05,050
we have more pressing concerns.

217
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,677
You keep saying "we."

218
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,099
[chuckling] Well, you.

219
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:16,228
Like it or not...

220
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,648
the business is yours now.

221
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:22,901
I have nothing to do with all of that.

222
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:25,278
You are the face now.

223
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:29,199
And nature abhors a vacuum.

224
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:35,998
You have to ensure a smooth transition
for all of Cornell's clients,

225
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:39,334
or it is going to be
straight up chaos for you.

226
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:45,007
- [radio static]
- [officer] Dispatch, car 77-0-5.

227
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,425
Sighting possible drunk.
Should we engage?

228
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,844
[dispatcher] <i>Is it our suspect?</i>

229
00:17:48,927 --> 00:17:51,096
[officer] We've a black male,
but need verification.

230
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,681
[siren wailing]

231
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:58,562
[breathing heavily]

232
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:07,905
Good morning. Is there a problem?

233
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,866
No. You tell me. What's your name, son?

234
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:15,954
[panting] I'm just taking a walk.
Minding my business.

235
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:18,290
I need to see some ID.

236
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:19,708
To walk?

237
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:22,503
Turn around, take down your hoodie.

238
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:26,840
- May I ask why?
- Because I said so.

239
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:36,224
[sighs]

240
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:41,605
[phone beeps]

241
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:47,235
- Oh, shit. It is him!
- On the ground, now!

242
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:51,031
Hands behind your back.
Get on the ground, now!

243
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,248
I'm really sorry, guys.

244
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:02,876
[officer] You're under arrest!

245
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:15,305
[groans]

246
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,600
[dispatcher] <i>Car 7-7-0-5, come in.</i>

247
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:27,109
<i>Car 7-7-0-5, come in.</i>

248
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,490
[screaming]

249
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:37,202
[panting]

250
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,014
Lemonade?

251
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:01,977
- Popular drink.
- And it still is.

252
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:05,939
That story in my file, too?

253
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:08,901
What story?

254
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:14,782
You know,
I don't believe everything I read?

255
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,704
I wanna hear you tell it.

256
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:32,382
[Misty] Summer of '95,

257
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:38,513
and every other car was playing either
"Shook Ones" or "Ice Cream."

258
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:42,893
I was hanging out
with my cousin, Cassandra.

259
00:20:45,437 --> 00:20:50,025
My mother told us never to walk around
the neighborhood by ourselves...

260
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:54,154
but it was hot, and I was thirsty.

261
00:20:55,906 --> 00:21:00,285
And she was taking way too long
talking to some cute boy.

262
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:02,329
So...

263
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:09,252
I went to Ruiz Bodega by myself
and got a lemonade.

264
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,297
When I got back, she was gone.

265
00:21:13,423 --> 00:21:17,678
It took the cops two weeks
to find her body.

266
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:21,514
Disfigured, beaten.

267
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:28,939
The boy, Mike Jones,
ran a train on her with his crew.

268
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:33,986
Nobody snitched.

269
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:37,364
Cops didn't push.
They didn't really give a shit.

270
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:44,830
She was just another poor, worthless bitch
from the Polo Grounds.

271
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:47,540
[breathing heavily]

272
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:50,668
So that's why you became a cop?

273
00:21:50,753 --> 00:21:52,796
I apply foot to ass,

274
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,049
and match lead for lead.

275
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:58,301
I put murderers in handcuffs.

276
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:03,098
I don't just seek justice, I stalk it.

277
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:06,351
And that much should go in my record.

278
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:12,024
With your resume,
you could've been downtown years ago.

279
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:16,069
Hell, you could've been a fed,
but you chose to stay in Harlem.

280
00:22:16,153 --> 00:22:19,740
I know this place, I know the players...

281
00:22:20,783 --> 00:22:22,743
and I can make a difference here.

282
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:25,245
Or use some
of those old school connections

283
00:22:25,328 --> 00:22:27,873
to make a little money on the side,
like your partner.

284
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:30,000
I didn't know anything about Scarfe.

285
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:32,836
Or anything he was doing.

286
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,963
He didn't buy new clothes,

287
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:39,717
no new watch, no new girlfriend,
no loose talk, nothing.

288
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:42,095
But he'd been working
for Cottonmouth for years.

289
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,306
And I trusted him...

290
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:46,934
so I didn't see it.

291
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:50,145
And neither did anybody else
in this damn department.

292
00:22:50,228 --> 00:22:52,439
So why do I get singled out for it?

293
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:53,941
Because you were the closest to him.

294
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:58,736
It's written all over your face.
Not seeing it bothered you, didn't it?

295
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:02,074
'Cause seeing is my thing, right?

296
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:05,410
That's what made me
such a good point guard.

297
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:08,080
'Cause I could see everything in my head.

298
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:11,708
I knew exactly where people were gonna be,

299
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,169
so I put the ball
right where it needed to go.

300
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:16,379
But you couldn't see Scarfe
for what he was.

301
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,924
Or were you blinded by your emotions?

302
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:21,301
[scoffs] You wouldn't say that
if I was a man.

303
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:23,553
- Oh, that is not true.
- Bullshit!

304
00:23:24,554 --> 00:23:27,099
Male cops can screw cop groupies

305
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:28,892
in the back of their unmarked
or their RMP,

306
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:31,269
and you guys cheer.

307
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,023
They get drunk
and fight each other in the parking lot,

308
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:37,234
and it's called blowing off steam.

309
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,278
There's always a double standard.

310
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:42,822
[inhales] And you never screwed anyone

311
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:45,783
that you shouldn't have
while you were on the job?

312
00:23:47,035 --> 00:23:48,078
No.

313
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:50,788
But you choked out a witness.

314
00:23:51,706 --> 00:23:53,000
Own your shit.

315
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:58,671
You went renegade
when you went after Luke Cage alone.

316
00:23:58,755 --> 00:24:00,715
And it got... [scoffs]

317
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:02,592
way deeper than it should have.

318
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:08,181
And this guy took the control
away from you when he took your gun.

319
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:10,725
[gasps]

320
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:12,519
Then you're in a room
alone with Miss Temple,

321
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:14,854
and she insults you,
and you lost control...

322
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:17,065
and you know it.

323
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:24,948
I need a break.

324
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,460
[exhales deeply]

325
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,307
[indistinct chatter]

326
00:24:55,312 --> 00:24:56,939
[saw whirring]

327
00:24:58,065 --> 00:24:59,274
[Mariah] What happened in here?

328
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:03,987
You know what happened here.
Same as you.

329
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,577
Sorry to hear about Cornell.

330
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,371
Hope they get that bastard.

331
00:25:13,455 --> 00:25:14,914
He's bad for business.

332
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:18,376
Well, yeah, I'm not here
to talk about Luke Cage.

333
00:25:19,836 --> 00:25:22,672
Well, it took a lot for you to walk
through those doors without your people.

334
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:25,842
<i>Chico,</i> please.

335
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:29,429
I was from around here
long before you even knew what that was.

336
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:36,853
Besides, we all contribute to this city,
one way or another.

337
00:25:37,562 --> 00:25:39,106
Contribute?

338
00:25:41,524 --> 00:25:45,820
I never trusted your cousin...
and I trust you even less.

339
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:49,282
Pretending to rise
to the right side of the law.

340
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:52,244
Girl, I know where you're from.

341
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:54,662
That stank don't come off too easy.

342
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:01,711
The thing my cousin built
needs to continue.

343
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,963
And you're gonna be the one to run it?

344
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:07,134
No. I need help.

345
00:26:09,344 --> 00:26:10,512
Me?

346
00:26:10,595 --> 00:26:12,264
Not just you.

347
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:16,351
Cornell had steady customers.

348
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:18,478
[Domingo chuckles]

349
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:20,855
Not everybody liked your cousin.

350
00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:22,357
I mean, God respect the dead.

351
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,153
Yeah, he got it done
without a lot of needless violence.

352
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,824
I want everybody to come to the table
so I can discuss a transition.

353
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:34,286
Maybe even a buyout.

354
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,750
There was something dangerous
behind your eyes...

355
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:44,587
and this is it, huh?

356
00:26:45,213 --> 00:26:47,715
Cornell was who he was.

357
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,342
I want something different.

358
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,681
I don't want to have
to look over my shoulder, Domingo.

359
00:26:54,764 --> 00:26:57,184
Gather all the bosses.

360
00:26:57,267 --> 00:27:00,312
I have a proposition
that will benefit us all.

361
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:05,067
[inhales sharply]
So who gets an invitation?

362
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:08,070
[breathing deeply]

363
00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:11,156
Jacques Alef with the Macoute...

364
00:27:12,657 --> 00:27:15,952
Neville Barnwell with the Yardies.

365
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,246
Juan Carlos Castro with the Cubanos...

366
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:22,959
And the Chinese, they got their own thing
going on downtown,

367
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:25,628
but Peter Hong with the Koreans...

368
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:28,631
he might wanna holla.

369
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:29,966
When?

370
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:32,760
Oh, that's gonna take me a few days.

371
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,762
Tonight.

372
00:28:00,372 --> 00:28:02,374
[softly] Abalone shells.

373
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:23,186
[sighs]

374
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,455
[Luke whispering] Claire. Claire.

375
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,874
[groaning]

376
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:48,545
[softly] Everybody's looking for you.
How did you not get caught?

377
00:28:48,628 --> 00:28:51,339
- He shot you again?
- [groans]

378
00:28:54,176 --> 00:28:55,343
Ugh!

379
00:28:56,178 --> 00:28:58,846
Why in the hell is this guy
trying to kill you so bad?

380
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:02,975
He's even going through the trouble of
using bullets that could actually do it.

381
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:06,229
Willis was my, uh...

382
00:29:06,313 --> 00:29:07,564
my best friend.

383
00:29:08,356 --> 00:29:11,151
He's, uh... He's delusional.

384
00:29:11,234 --> 00:29:14,111
Delusional and pissed. Let me see.

385
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:18,283
[groaning]

386
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:19,951
[police sirens wailing in distance]

387
00:29:22,454 --> 00:29:23,955
[Claire] Ugh, your wound
is getting infected.

388
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:25,373
- [grunts]
- This looks bad.

389
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:31,796
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?

390
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:34,299
[sighs] I should say, "What are you?"

391
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:40,222
I'm looking at your cells
and I've never seen anything like it.

392
00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:44,309
I've been looking up sea shells to better
understand the structure of your skin.

393
00:29:45,643 --> 00:29:46,894
Like I said...

394
00:29:47,812 --> 00:29:49,397
you're amazing.

395
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:51,774
Only one man knows the science.

396
00:29:53,818 --> 00:29:55,862
And I am not going back to prison.

397
00:29:57,154 --> 00:29:59,115
And is his name Dr. Noah Burstein?

398
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:04,454
[sighs] You gave me Reva's hard drive,
remember?

399
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:07,665
- Do you talk to him?
- No.

400
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:09,667
Reva kept tabs...

401
00:30:10,668 --> 00:30:12,712
just in case someone got cute.

402
00:30:15,632 --> 00:30:18,385
But I am not ready to reopen that door.

403
00:30:20,762 --> 00:30:23,223
I don't think that you have
very much choice.

404
00:30:23,306 --> 00:30:25,475
We need to get you out of here.

405
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,186
My mom has a car.

406
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:30,688
And we haven't totaled that one yet.

407
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:33,775
[chuckles and groans]

408
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:37,529
[Alex] Excuse me.

409
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,908
Excuse me? Madam Councilwoman?

410
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:43,826
Not anymore.

411
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,122
Have you seen the emails?
The interview requests?

412
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:49,999
Even Thembi Wallace
wants another sit-down.

413
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,126
Never.

414
00:30:53,378 --> 00:30:55,171
Can I show you something?

415
00:30:58,215 --> 00:31:00,760
Hit the news about 20 minutes ago.

416
00:31:00,843 --> 00:31:03,888
He attacked two cops and stole their cars.

417
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:06,641
- Cage?
- The cops are alive.

418
00:31:06,724 --> 00:31:10,853
They GPS'd the car,
but someone leaked the footage.

419
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,939
It was too hot to hold back.

420
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:15,650
- [man screaming]
- [thuds]

421
00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:19,279
Huh. [chuckles]

422
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:22,407
It's amazing.

423
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:26,077
I know it's tough seeing the man
that killed your cousin.

424
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:29,956
[Mariah sighs]

425
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:35,086
They'll get him, Alex.
Justice will prevail.

426
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:42,259
You know, Cornell taught me to be strong,
so I will be strong.

427
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:45,179
People understand the threat...

428
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,016
the kind of person you're up against.

429
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,395
They're not talking about the money,
or where it came from.

430
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:55,690
I think if you play this right,

431
00:31:55,773 --> 00:31:58,318
you could have supporters
with even deeper pockets behind you,

432
00:31:58,401 --> 00:32:00,612
who see this as a political issue,

433
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:04,741
and see your cousin as a brave man
who stood up to a freak.

434
00:32:05,783 --> 00:32:10,204
You would use my personal tragedy
for strategic political advantage?

435
00:32:12,624 --> 00:32:15,752
- Madam Councilwoman, I...
- I taught you well.

436
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:22,425
Go home, Alex.
I'm letting you off early.

437
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:26,554
[Alex] Thank you.

438
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:48,701
What happened out there...
that bothers you the most?

439
00:32:50,244 --> 00:32:51,371
I lost my gun.

440
00:32:51,454 --> 00:32:53,330
Other than that,
I wouldn't say it bothered me.

441
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,752
I saw your hand shake the first time
you looked at this photo. Why?

442
00:33:06,803 --> 00:33:12,892
Because I remembered
seeing myself see myself...

443
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:16,563
wondering what I would look like
in a casket.

444
00:33:19,982 --> 00:33:22,068
I mean, how the hell did I get there?

445
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:26,113
He got the drop on me.
How in the hell did he do that?

446
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:28,658
I could have disarmed him,
like, ten different ways.

447
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:31,786
Why didn't I do any of that?

448
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:35,081
I couldn't help anybody,
not even my damn self.

449
00:33:35,164 --> 00:33:40,294
He shoved my gun in my face...

450
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:41,879
and I froze.

451
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:45,675
And you know what I thought about?

452
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:50,597
I thought about Pop's funeral.
I thought about my own funeral.

453
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,099
I thought about my father,

454
00:33:53,182 --> 00:33:55,643
and what people would think about me.

455
00:33:56,894 --> 00:33:58,688
And this guy...

456
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:05,445
this guy was smiling...

457
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:10,407
[voice breaking]
while he was toying with my life.

458
00:34:10,492 --> 00:34:12,284
It was fun for him.

459
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:19,041
I didn't have control,

460
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:22,504
and maybe I never did.

461
00:34:22,587 --> 00:34:26,173
And when Claire
was talking sideways about me,

462
00:34:26,257 --> 00:34:29,594
all I wanted to do
was take my control back.

463
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,151
Oh, my God.

464
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:47,069
[exhales] What have I done?

465
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:48,362
[inhales sharply]

466
00:34:49,781 --> 00:34:50,782
[sniffles]

467
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,368
It's like anything else
you've learned on the job.

468
00:34:55,244 --> 00:34:56,704
It's ugly...

469
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,456
but you can't move your gaze.

470
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:03,127
You have to look... and learn.

471
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:06,548
That's how you get answers.

472
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,219
That's how you win.

473
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:20,227
[sighs heavily]

474
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,737
[groaning]

475
00:36:13,364 --> 00:36:15,532
[Luke breathing heavily]

476
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:19,746
- [Luke] It's getting harder to breathe.
- [exhales]

477
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:22,539
- [groans] These wounds are kicking my ass.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

478
00:36:22,624 --> 00:36:25,292
You know, it passed before,
it's gonna pass again, okay?

479
00:36:25,376 --> 00:36:26,753
I promise.

480
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:29,005
Can I get that
with the money-back guarantee?

481
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:31,173
- [both chuckle]
- [grunts]

482
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:32,592
Breathe.

483
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:34,343
[breathing deeply]

484
00:36:36,512 --> 00:36:38,014
See? You got this.

485
00:36:44,186 --> 00:36:45,605
What if this is a one-way trip?

486
00:36:45,688 --> 00:36:48,190
Hey, hey, you are gonna make it.

487
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:51,277
You hear me?
You're gonna make it just fine.

488
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,613
We're gonna fix this.

489
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:55,031
Don't even.

490
00:36:55,114 --> 00:36:57,574
- You're not dying in my mom's car.
- [chuckles]

491
00:36:57,659 --> 00:36:59,035
Okay?

492
00:37:00,536 --> 00:37:01,954
[sighs]

493
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:10,755
It's the part you can't fix
that's bothering me.

494
00:37:12,256 --> 00:37:13,507
What do you mean?

495
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:15,551
Willis.

496
00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:19,138
Willis Stryker.
He thinks he's my brother.

497
00:37:21,057 --> 00:37:22,516
Diamondback.

498
00:37:23,726 --> 00:37:28,981
He's... he's gotta be lying
about my father. He's...

499
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:32,777
He's... He can't be my brother.

500
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:04,100
[knocking on door]

501
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:15,319
[Claire] Hi. Sorry to ring so late.

502
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:17,739
My name is Sandra Lopez.

503
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:22,034
I'm currently majoring in prison studies
at Boston University, and, uh,

504
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:23,577
I was just wondering if I could ask you

505
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,913
a few questions
about your time at Seagate.

506
00:38:25,997 --> 00:38:27,999
My friend said that you worked there?

507
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:29,666
Your friend was mistaken.

508
00:38:30,584 --> 00:38:33,420
- What friend?
- Carl Lucas.

509
00:38:34,756 --> 00:38:36,298
I don't know anybody by that name.

510
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,344
He's alive, Doc.

511
00:38:40,427 --> 00:38:42,972
- That's impossible.
- Your experiment worked.

512
00:38:43,597 --> 00:38:45,057
It changed him.

513
00:38:46,475 --> 00:38:48,102
Changed how?

514
00:38:48,895 --> 00:38:51,022
You should see for yourself.

515
00:38:51,773 --> 00:38:53,816
- He's here?
- Yes.

516
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:57,779
Where is he?

517
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:15,087
What's up, Doc?

518
00:39:16,297 --> 00:39:18,007
I've always wanted to say that.

519
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,592
Let's get him out of here.

520
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,179
- [groaning]
- Put him on the couch.

521
00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:24,931
[Claire] Come on. Just a few more steps.

522
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:26,933
- [Luke groaning]
- [Claire] Easy, easy.

523
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:29,476
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

524
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:31,687
Breathe.

525
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:35,107
Breathe. Okay.

526
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:37,193
[Luke sighs]

527
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:41,613
You've got no scars. Nothing.

528
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:44,283
That lab was totally destroyed.

529
00:39:45,326 --> 00:39:46,743
You mean it worked?

530
00:39:47,703 --> 00:39:50,747
Yes... and no.

531
00:39:52,374 --> 00:39:54,877
Until last night... [breathing heavily]

532
00:39:56,378 --> 00:39:58,714
I was bulletproof.

533
00:39:58,798 --> 00:40:02,468
Jesus Christ, kid. What did this to you?

534
00:40:03,385 --> 00:40:06,638
They shot me with some crazy bullets.

535
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:08,640
They exploded inside of him.

536
00:40:08,724 --> 00:40:10,642
[Burstein] He should be dead.

537
00:40:10,726 --> 00:40:14,063
My skin is now tough... like armor.

538
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:16,023
I think maybe what makes him stronger

539
00:40:16,107 --> 00:40:18,734
is also pushing the shrapnel
deeper into his organs.

540
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:23,655
Trust me, it is impossible
to cut into his skin.

541
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:28,410
Look, I don't know what it is
that you think I can do for you.

542
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:31,788
My lab is not my lab anymore.
I wouldn't know where to begin.

543
00:40:31,873 --> 00:40:33,582
What if we can help you with that?

544
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:35,626
Reva took this.

545
00:40:36,627 --> 00:40:38,004
[Burstein gasps]

546
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:42,424
She shouldn't have done that. [sighs]

547
00:40:46,012 --> 00:40:47,596
Can you unlock it?

548
00:40:54,228 --> 00:40:55,646
[sighs]

549
00:41:01,152 --> 00:41:02,653
[Burstein] Oh, my God.

550
00:41:03,946 --> 00:41:06,073
It's all here. Everything.

551
00:41:06,157 --> 00:41:07,658
Everything you need?

552
00:41:08,575 --> 00:41:11,453
Everything I lost. So much more....

553
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:12,997
[Claire sighs]

554
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,958
Reva died for this, didn't she?

555
00:41:17,834 --> 00:41:19,836
Luke refuses to talk about it.

556
00:41:20,587 --> 00:41:22,298
[coughing]

557
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:25,968
[Claire] You okay?

558
00:41:30,264 --> 00:41:31,265
[gasps]

559
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:34,101
[Luke groans] They're killing me.

560
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:38,147
Doc, you figure this shit out.

561
00:41:55,664 --> 00:41:57,291
[Luke groaning]

562
00:41:57,374 --> 00:41:58,875
[Burstein] Watch your step.

563
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:04,673
- All right. Can you stand a second?
- [Claire] I got him.

564
00:42:08,427 --> 00:42:10,471
- [Claire] Okay.
- [Luke] All right.

565
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,559
[breathing heavily]
What is all this stuff?

566
00:42:16,518 --> 00:42:18,645
[Burstein] During the cover-up,
I stole whatever I could.

567
00:42:19,896 --> 00:42:20,982
[Luke] What cover-up?

568
00:42:21,065 --> 00:42:23,067
They couldn't advertise Rackham's death,

569
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,901
or the explosion
that supposedly killed you,

570
00:42:24,986 --> 00:42:27,529
or Reva's data dump,
so they... they killed the whole thing.

571
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:31,951
- Here, let's set him down.
- [breathing heavily]

572
00:42:32,034 --> 00:42:33,119
I was so close to a breakthrough.

573
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:35,121
That all ended when they thought
you were dead.

574
00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:38,540
- [all groaning]
- [Burstein] I started again from scratch,

575
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:42,003
but never came close
to replicating the Seagate incident.

576
00:42:42,086 --> 00:42:44,713
[stammers] I'm a nurse.
I know the drill. I can help.

577
00:42:46,132 --> 00:42:47,508
[Luke groans]

578
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:49,635
Why me?

579
00:42:50,552 --> 00:42:52,138
Why did you pick me?

580
00:42:53,097 --> 00:42:55,432
Because you were strong.
Stronger than most.

581
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,851
[Luke] That's not what Reva said.

582
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:00,937
She said she begged you to do it.

583
00:43:02,523 --> 00:43:05,067
There's more to it than that,
and you know it.

584
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:08,404
She begged me, but you were
already tabbed for the program.

585
00:43:10,572 --> 00:43:13,742
- Didn't Reva tell you about this?
- No.

586
00:43:14,951 --> 00:43:16,412
That's not gonna do anything.

587
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:20,457
- [Burstein grunts]
- [scalpel snaps]

588
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,169
Oh, my God.

589
00:43:24,211 --> 00:43:27,714
Look, I gotta get a blood sample
to cross check with Reva's data.

590
00:43:27,798 --> 00:43:30,926
Your DNA may be the X factor
that made this whole thing work.

591
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,263
- You mean, it could only work for Luke?
- [Burstein] Yeah, maybe.

592
00:43:35,556 --> 00:43:37,724
This wound is too septic
to get a decent sample.

593
00:43:37,808 --> 00:43:39,851
Are you saying
you can't recreate what you did?

594
00:43:39,935 --> 00:43:43,689
It's not as straightforward as that.
You know, penicillin, the X-ray machine...

595
00:43:43,772 --> 00:43:45,274
[groans]

596
00:43:45,357 --> 00:43:48,319
[Burstein] ...the smallpox vaccine,
pacemaker, even... even...

597
00:43:48,402 --> 00:43:49,445
even Viagra.

598
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:52,739
Those were accidents.
It's the same with Carl.

599
00:44:01,915 --> 00:44:03,209
This could work.

600
00:44:04,168 --> 00:44:06,170
If you go down his throat...

601
00:44:08,505 --> 00:44:10,507
We can puncture his mucus membrane.

602
00:44:10,591 --> 00:44:12,301
- Exactly.
- I like the way you think.

603
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:15,971
I don't.

604
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:18,474
Sorry.

605
00:44:19,808 --> 00:44:22,644
All right. Put your head back.
Just open your mouth.

606
00:44:24,146 --> 00:44:25,897
I'll try to make this quick.

607
00:44:28,484 --> 00:44:29,693
Breathe through your nose.

608
00:44:35,157 --> 00:44:36,492
[groaning]

609
00:44:36,575 --> 00:44:39,828
[Burstein] Easy, easy. Oh, here we go.

610
00:44:40,662 --> 00:44:42,289
[Burstein] It's working.

611
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:57,763
[Ridley] You see that?

612
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:03,519
- That's my shield.
- No, no, no.

613
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,480
That's not your shield.

614
00:45:06,563 --> 00:45:09,483
That shield belongs
to the city of New York and its people.

615
00:45:11,402 --> 00:45:12,736
And when you lose control,

616
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:15,656
go upside somebody's head
because you had a bad day...

617
00:45:16,657 --> 00:45:18,450
or you feel powerless...

618
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,788
- or you screw the wrong person...
- I didn't screw anybody.

619
00:45:22,871 --> 00:45:24,206
Come on, now.

620
00:45:31,297 --> 00:45:34,425
You don't deserve to represent
the people of New York,

621
00:45:34,508 --> 00:45:36,092
let alone protect them.

622
00:45:36,177 --> 00:45:38,637
That's not true and you know it.

623
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,763
I do.

624
00:45:41,473 --> 00:45:45,227
Look, we're wired differently.

625
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:48,272
We run towards gunfire.

626
00:45:48,355 --> 00:45:50,982
We drink when we're sad.
We screw when we're mad.

627
00:45:51,066 --> 00:45:55,654
And people hate us until they need us.

628
00:45:57,448 --> 00:45:59,157
And I hate that.

629
00:46:02,703 --> 00:46:04,746
But I love it, too.

630
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:12,629
[Ridley] We walk a higher path.

631
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:17,676
It's not simple. It's very hard.

632
00:46:17,759 --> 00:46:21,263
And that is why
people will always need us.

633
00:46:32,274 --> 00:46:34,818
Hero of Harlem, my ass.

634
00:46:37,571 --> 00:46:38,739
[sighs]

635
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,120
Look, if we're talking about a right path,
it's not just about Luke Cage.

636
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:51,042
You haven't even acknowledged the guy
that held a gun to my head last night.

637
00:46:51,126 --> 00:46:52,711
We will find out who that is.

638
00:46:52,794 --> 00:46:54,546
And we still need
to talk about Mariah Dillard.

639
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,632
She is not innocent in all this.

640
00:46:56,715 --> 00:46:59,468
Look, Mariah's not on the run for murder,
assaulting two police officers.

641
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:05,056
I need you to focus
on bringing in Luke Cage.

642
00:47:09,811 --> 00:47:11,938
Bullets bounce right off of him.

643
00:47:12,856 --> 00:47:15,609
Reason is the only thing
that's gonna work.

644
00:47:16,943 --> 00:47:19,988
And it has to come
from somebody he trusts.

645
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:21,740
[Ridley chuckles]

646
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:24,285
[laughs]

647
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:32,167
Go get him.

648
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,896
You ready for this?

649
00:47:52,979 --> 00:47:56,107
Like I said, ready as ever.

650
00:47:56,191 --> 00:47:58,193
You need to understand where you are here.

651
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,198
If they sense any weakness,
any hesitation...

652
00:48:03,281 --> 00:48:05,701
you're not just done politically...

653
00:48:05,784 --> 00:48:07,411
you're done permanently.

654
00:48:22,426 --> 00:48:23,427
You're late.

655
00:48:24,094 --> 00:48:27,639
I'm not. Looks like I'm right on time.

656
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:29,350
Wagwan?

657
00:48:32,268 --> 00:48:36,440
Now that my cousin is gone,
I'm making a few changes.

658
00:48:36,523 --> 00:48:40,318
I loved my cousin,
but I didn't like what he did.

659
00:48:40,402 --> 00:48:41,903
Until he stopped serving you.

660
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:45,949
Cut the crap, lady.
What do you want to tell us?

661
00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:49,285
I'm out.

662
00:48:51,913 --> 00:48:56,334
My family is no longer to be associated
with what you all do.

663
00:48:57,252 --> 00:48:59,755
I need to move
in a more legitimate direction.

664
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:00,839
[Jacques] Need?

665
00:49:00,922 --> 00:49:02,674
That's a weak hand you're playing.

666
00:49:02,758 --> 00:49:06,177
My cousin has valuable assets
and connections.

667
00:49:07,095 --> 00:49:10,306
I'll give them to you... for a price.

668
00:49:13,268 --> 00:49:16,187
- And you walk away?
- I walk away.

669
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:18,482
Why do I find that hard to believe?

670
00:49:18,565 --> 00:49:22,444
Because you're smart and stupid
at the same time.

671
00:49:23,111 --> 00:49:26,031
Diamondback, what are you doing here?

672
00:49:26,114 --> 00:49:27,616
You invited me...

673
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:29,535
by not inviting me.

674
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:37,793
- Excuse me?
- Now, Peter...

675
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,087
when you don't buy my wares,
or Jacques...

676
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,717
when you get them at a cheaper price
from my competitors,

677
00:49:45,801 --> 00:49:47,678
you're messing with my money.

678
00:49:47,761 --> 00:49:49,638
And that pisses me off.

679
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:51,723
- [gunshot]
- [Jacques] Hey, man!

680
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:54,560
[grunting]

681
00:49:59,189 --> 00:50:02,734
[Stryker] Anybody else not made it
to confessional this week?

682
00:50:02,818 --> 00:50:06,154
- [men breathing heavily]
- Your men outside are dead.

683
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:08,949
Your greed superseded your common sense.

684
00:50:09,032 --> 00:50:13,203
So now, I have the pulpit.

685
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:19,543
Rich men, camel and needles.

686
00:50:20,461 --> 00:50:21,795
What do you want?

687
00:50:22,754 --> 00:50:24,130
Hey, Neville...

688
00:50:25,215 --> 00:50:26,925
[in mock Jamaican accent]
if you wanna test me...

689
00:50:27,008 --> 00:50:30,136
[stammering] Ease up, man.
I got no hackle with you now.

690
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:33,515
- We'll listen what you have to say.
- Don't bother.

691
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,477
Just by being here, you're already dead.

692
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,729
- [gunshot]
- [groans]

693
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,314
Two for the price of one.

694
00:50:41,397 --> 00:50:43,191
[Domingo] What are you doing, man?

695
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:45,819
You're gonna start a war.

696
00:50:46,903 --> 00:50:49,197
"And then many will fall away,

697
00:50:50,866 --> 00:50:54,578
and they will betray each other
and hate one another.

698
00:50:54,661 --> 00:50:59,332
And many false prophets will arise
and lead many astray.

699
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,545
But the one who endures to the end...

700
00:51:04,963 --> 00:51:06,673
he will be saved."

701
00:51:07,674 --> 00:51:09,092
[Domingo] You're crazy.

702
00:51:14,681 --> 00:51:19,019
Crazy would be leaving you alive
to run a very profitable drug business.

703
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:24,024
But I got no beef with your cousins
down south of the border...

704
00:51:25,108 --> 00:51:27,068
so today is your lucky day.

705
00:51:29,362 --> 00:51:30,572
But you...

706
00:51:31,197 --> 00:51:32,824
You...

707
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,702
you're full of crazy.

708
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:39,915
I just killed four people, and...

709
00:51:41,124 --> 00:51:43,168
you didn't even flinch.

710
00:51:45,128 --> 00:51:46,755
You don't scare me.

711
00:51:48,298 --> 00:51:49,507
No...

712
00:51:50,425 --> 00:51:52,010
I don't think I do.

713
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,640
Tell me why we should be friends.

714
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:04,940
Luke Cage.

715
00:52:05,941 --> 00:52:08,276
Clearly, we both have issues with him.

716
00:52:08,902 --> 00:52:12,989
I heard he killed your cousin.
Allegedly.

717
00:52:13,073 --> 00:52:17,368
Rest assured, I will end him
when the time is right.

718
00:52:17,452 --> 00:52:19,580
But the time is not right.

719
00:52:20,622 --> 00:52:24,292
Have you even seen the dashboard footage
that's all over the news?

720
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:27,087
You don't you see the opportunity?

721
00:52:28,088 --> 00:52:31,675
You see a man you want dead who won't die.

722
00:52:32,759 --> 00:52:35,011
I see a marketer's dream.

723
00:52:36,054 --> 00:52:38,139
Why spend all your time

724
00:52:38,223 --> 00:52:41,852
killing and intimidating
your criminal customers in the dark

725
00:52:41,935 --> 00:52:46,356
when you should be selling guns
to police departments in the light?

726
00:52:46,439 --> 00:52:49,400
Guns that can handle these new threats.

727
00:52:55,031 --> 00:52:56,449
Go on.

728
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:04,165
Word is you have a weapon
that can take him down.

729
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:06,710
Kill Luke Cage.

730
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:11,632
But if you do, and you go big,

731
00:53:11,715 --> 00:53:14,926
everyone else will come to you

732
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:17,638
to help take down
the rest of these super-freaks

733
00:53:17,721 --> 00:53:21,016
that are upsetting
the natural order of things.

734
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:23,476
You gotta go big pharma on this shit.

735
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,815
You invent the disease,
then you sell the cure.

736
00:53:29,524 --> 00:53:30,901
[chuckles]

737
00:53:32,068 --> 00:53:35,822
Oh, Shades, now I see you were right.

738
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,663
I like how she thinks.

739
00:53:42,746 --> 00:53:45,331
And who better to broker the deals, hmm?

740
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,376
No. No, I'm out of this.

741
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:50,796
[Stryker] No... You're in...

742
00:53:52,005 --> 00:53:54,632
way into this...

743
00:53:54,716 --> 00:53:57,302
until I decide otherwise.

744
00:53:58,511 --> 00:53:59,595
Domingo.

745
00:54:01,765 --> 00:54:03,975
Sorry about the mess, <i>hermano.</i>

746
00:54:05,185 --> 00:54:08,063
But I have no doubt...

747
00:54:09,064 --> 00:54:10,857
you have people that can clean up.

748
00:54:10,941 --> 00:54:12,984
Why am I still alive, man?

749
00:54:14,695 --> 00:54:16,947
[Stryker] 'Cause no one's coming at me.

750
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:20,116
They'll ask around, so tell 'em...

751
00:54:21,242 --> 00:54:23,704
I'll murderize everything in sight.

752
00:54:24,955 --> 00:54:27,708
'Cause I don't care and I won't quit.

753
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:31,169
You can't bargain with me.

754
00:54:32,253 --> 00:54:34,923
You buy or you die.

755
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:38,969
[Stryker sighs]

756
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:42,180
You think Peter Luger's is still open?

757
00:55:00,656 --> 00:55:02,658
[R&B song playing]

758
00:55:09,582 --> 00:55:11,501
[singing]

759
00:55:48,704 --> 00:55:50,248
[inaudible]

760
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:05,013
That footage of Cage and the cops?
It went viral.

761
00:56:05,096 --> 00:56:06,431
What do you want to do about it?

762
00:56:06,514 --> 00:56:09,851
That's great... That's great.

763
00:56:09,935 --> 00:56:12,603
He's got nowhere to run now.
We'll find him.

764
00:56:13,814 --> 00:56:16,149
- It's all coming together.
- But there's gonna be a...

765
00:56:16,232 --> 00:56:17,483
Shh!

766
00:56:19,235 --> 00:56:20,778
I like this song.

767
00:56:20,862 --> 00:56:22,780
[R&B song continues]

768
00:56:40,173 --> 00:56:41,799
[song continues]

769
00:57:20,421 --> 00:57:24,634
[Burstein] We were working on creating
this artificial skin for burn victims.

770
00:57:25,635 --> 00:57:27,387
We used a process called CRISPR

771
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:30,765
to fuse the subject's DNA
with another DNA to gain its attributes.

772
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:33,184
The foreign DNA
was abalone shell, wasn't it?

773
00:57:33,268 --> 00:57:35,937
Uh, yeah.
Where did you do your residency?

774
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:42,318
145th Street. Um...
and my fellowship in Hell's Kitchen.

775
00:57:44,404 --> 00:57:46,031
Well, you're correct.

776
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:50,576
We already used abalone to build
better combat equipment for soldiers.

777
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:54,372
And to genetically enhance
the durability, pliability,

778
00:57:54,455 --> 00:57:56,666
and healing properties of human epidermis.

779
00:57:57,625 --> 00:58:00,711
Okay, so why are these bullets
penetrating his skin then?

780
00:58:00,795 --> 00:58:02,047
Are they dipped in something?

781
00:58:03,631 --> 00:58:05,466
Uh, well, perhaps.

782
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,177
But more likely
because of what they were made from.

783
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,804
You see, uh,
abalone is nearly impenetrable, but...

784
00:58:09,888 --> 00:58:10,889
[Claire] Right.

785
00:58:10,972 --> 00:58:13,433
...its stacked plates can be pushed apart
under the right circumstances.

786
00:58:13,516 --> 00:58:15,143
[Luke] Like what?

787
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:16,602
Hey.

788
00:58:16,686 --> 00:58:20,481
[stammers] During the experiment,
your skin cells were bonded

789
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:24,152
with hydrogen covalent bonds
at the exact point of acidity,

790
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:27,572
- temperature and saline concentration...
- English, please.

791
00:58:27,655 --> 00:58:30,951
Well, see, I can replicate
exactly the acidity

792
00:58:31,034 --> 00:58:33,328
and the saline portions of the experiment

793
00:58:33,411 --> 00:58:35,580
with the information
that's on the Reva drive that you brought.

794
00:58:35,663 --> 00:58:38,666
But the...
the wild card is the temperature.

795
00:58:39,709 --> 00:58:42,212
Because of what Albert Rackham did,
turning up the heat on the bath,

796
00:58:42,295 --> 00:58:46,882
I have no gauge as to the temperature
that catalyzed the experiment.

797
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:50,636
How are you going
to get this stuff out of me?

798
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,055
Right. Uh... [sighs]

799
00:58:53,056 --> 00:58:56,601
Imagine that your skin
works like a form of Velcro,

800
00:58:56,684 --> 00:58:59,270
uh, under a sort of lock and key.

801
00:58:59,354 --> 00:59:02,023
And in order to cut through it,
he's got to weaken the lock and key,

802
00:59:02,107 --> 00:59:04,400
so we can remove the shrapnel.

803
00:59:04,484 --> 00:59:06,444
- How do you plan to do that?
- [Claire sighs]

804
00:59:06,527 --> 00:59:09,739
Uh, I'm going to dip your skin
in boiling acid,

805
00:59:09,822 --> 00:59:11,950
and then, uh, remove the shrapnel.

806
00:59:19,457 --> 00:59:22,043
What? I've tried it with animals.

807
00:59:22,127 --> 00:59:23,962
He's putting me in a rotisserie spit?

808
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,631
Um...

809
00:59:26,714 --> 00:59:28,591
I think he wants to deep fry you...

810
00:59:30,426 --> 00:59:31,927
like a turkey.

811
00:59:32,012 --> 00:59:35,015
Now, look, we're only gonna have
a short window to do this, uh,

812
00:59:35,098 --> 00:59:37,100
before your skin closes up again.

813
00:59:39,227 --> 00:59:42,313
Just so we're clear,
what could go wrong?

814
00:59:43,481 --> 00:59:46,359
[Burstein] Well, your... your skin
could peel off like wax paper, and, uh,

815
00:59:46,442 --> 00:59:48,778
after about ten seconds,
you'd beg me to put a bullet in your head

816
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:50,238
because the pain would be so bad.
But your...

817
00:59:51,031 --> 00:59:54,450
your head looks fine, so I... I guess
the bullet would ricochet off your skull.

818
00:59:54,534 --> 00:59:55,910
[Claire sighs]

819
00:59:57,453 --> 00:59:59,372
Sweet Christmas.

820
01:00:12,468 --> 01:00:14,345
If the procedure gets too painful,

821
01:00:14,429 --> 01:00:17,348
just raise your hand in a fist
and I'll shut it down, okay?

822
01:00:17,432 --> 01:00:18,724
Like this?

823
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,644
- Right on.
- [Luke chuckles]

824
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,274
You trust this dude?

825
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,193
Hell no.

826
01:00:28,276 --> 01:00:29,610
[breathing heavily]

827
01:00:29,694 --> 01:00:33,989
If anything happens to me,
if anything goes wrong,

828
01:00:34,074 --> 01:00:36,659
make sure he doesn't keep Reva's data.

829
01:00:36,742 --> 01:00:39,245
It cannot fall into the wrong hands.

830
01:00:39,329 --> 01:00:41,497
I don't care if you have to kill him.

831
01:00:43,249 --> 01:00:45,960
I got you. But let's not go there, okay?

832
01:00:46,044 --> 01:00:47,753
I'm serious.

833
01:00:47,837 --> 01:00:50,173
- It's too dangerous.
- [sighs]

834
01:00:50,256 --> 01:00:53,468
We can't have guys like me
running around on every corner.

835
01:00:53,551 --> 01:00:55,886
What are you talking about?

836
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:58,473
There's nobody like you.

837
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:06,189
All right, let's go.

838
01:01:06,272 --> 01:01:07,815
[Claire] Okay, okay.

839
01:01:15,573 --> 01:01:17,408
[air hissing]

840
01:01:19,494 --> 01:01:21,996
Good? Okay.

841
01:01:31,046 --> 01:01:32,173
Good.

842
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,808
[Burstein] Keep your hands clear.
[Claire] Yeah.

843
01:01:42,892 --> 01:01:45,019
[Burstein] All right. Down.

844
01:01:51,151 --> 01:01:52,235
Hang in there.

845
01:01:53,653 --> 01:01:55,196
It's going to be okay.

846
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,282
[muffled screaming]

847
01:02:11,921 --> 01:02:13,964
How long do we keep him down?

848
01:02:14,715 --> 01:02:18,010
I don't know.
Just have to let the acid do its work.

849
01:02:21,597 --> 01:02:23,558
- Now?
- Not yet.

850
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:25,100
[muffled screaming continues]

851
01:02:25,185 --> 01:02:27,102
- [beeping rapidly]
- [alarm blaring]

852
01:02:28,854 --> 01:02:30,690
What are you doing?

853
01:02:34,527 --> 01:02:35,903
He's not ready yet.

854
01:02:38,739 --> 01:02:40,491
All right. Hold on.

855
01:02:52,044 --> 01:02:53,296
Damn it.

856
01:02:55,089 --> 01:02:56,841
- Dip him again.
- What?

857
01:02:56,924 --> 01:02:59,260
Again! Again!

858
01:03:04,557 --> 01:03:05,683
One more.

859
01:03:06,434 --> 01:03:08,728
[muffled screaming]

860
01:03:17,653 --> 01:03:19,405
- [rapid beeping]
- [alarm blaring]

861
01:03:19,489 --> 01:03:21,907
- [Claire] We're losing him.
- It's not working.

862
01:03:21,991 --> 01:03:23,243
[muffled screaming]

863
01:03:23,326 --> 01:03:24,410
Why isn't it working?

864
01:03:24,494 --> 01:03:27,288
[Claire] We're losing him!
[Burstein] It's not working!

865
01:03:27,372 --> 01:03:29,081
[beeping continues]

866
01:03:29,164 --> 01:03:31,959
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

867
01:03:37,172 --> 01:03:38,173
- [flatlining]
- Shit!
