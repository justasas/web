00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,890
<i>Episode 7</i>
 Did you see this? Just do  accordingly to the instructions.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,350
I get it.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,680
Boss. Take a look. This is our new product.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,970
It is easier to dye with color.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,810
It simplifies the dying process.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,330
Right. Take it to the workshop to test the dying process.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,740
Okay.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,870
Why do you keep staring at me?

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,980
Did you force Old Cai's family to move?

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,060
In your heart, you are already sure that

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,060
I was behind this.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,470
Furthermore, you are very clear that no matter how you ask,

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,900
I won't admit to it.

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,400
Don't tell me you don't want to explain this?

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,780
What is there to explain?

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,660
You will find out the truth sooner or later.

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,860
You don't need to accompany me today. Go to the rickshaw.

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,080
Take record of the newly dyed fabrics.

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,140
I'm returning these clothes to you. I have already washed them.

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,520
If you are going to complain, you can throw them away.

21
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,310
Fei Fei.

22
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,400
You are looking for me?

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,810
Brother. Ah Fa came just now.

24
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,790
She said the mistress of the house is looking for accommodations.

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,180
- Put these away for me.
- Where are you going?

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,600
To speak to Lao Cai's mistress.

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,380
I'm going with you.

28
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,730
Don't go. I'm not going there for fun.

29
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,590
Wait for my news.

30
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,110
Come, let's go.

31
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,290
Come with me to a place.

32
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,810
Jiang Yu. If you don't tell me anything, I'm not getting in the rickshaw with you.

33
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,160
There is no time. I will explain to you.

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,450
- Quick, get in the rickshaw now.
- I don't want to listen to your explanation.

35
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,240
If you want to find Old Cai, get in the now.

36
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,740
<i>He doesn't allow me to go but he pulled Wu Cai Hong along.</i>

37
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:29,330
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

38
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,640
- Hello, Mr Zhou.
- Did you see Cai Hong?

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,950
Cai Hong? Boss Jiang just took her away.

40
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,210
It seems to be something urgent.

41
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,840
You can leave.

42
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,120
Where did Cai Hong go?

43
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,060
It seems like she got into Boss Jiang's rickshaw.

44
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,280
Do you know where they went?

45
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,330
I don't know anything about this.

46
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,490
Do you know where Jiang Yu and Cai Hong went?

47
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,200
I know. But why should I tell you?

48
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,990
Because you are just like me.

49
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,200
You don't want to see them together, right?

50
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,160
Is anyone there?

51
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,930
- Be careful.
- Okay.

52
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,730
We are a step behind again.

53
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,140
You killed her just to prove your innocence.

54
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,160
What are you saying?

55
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,990
I was at Ling Long the whole day. Everyone, including you,

56
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,300
can be be my alibis. How could I have killed her?

57
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,010
If you wanted to kill anyone, you don't need to do this yourself.

58
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,570
- Wu Cai Hong!
- Let me go.

59
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,090
You need to tell the truth.

60
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,130
Look for yourself. These doors and windows are perfectly intact.

61
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,890
Nobody forced their way in. Also,

62
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,390
this room doesn't have the slightest sign of a fight.

63
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,990
The table also has two cups of tea, which shows that the aggressor

64
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,550
was very familiar with the victim. And I

65
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,270
don't even know this girl.

66
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,380
What you said, couldn't it have been done after the murder?

67
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,200
You schemed to harm my father and to take away Ling Long.

68
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,400
You say a weak woman was killed.

69
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,290
Why did you take me along with you?

70
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,470
You originally planned for me to be beside you.

71
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,180
You are simply awful!

72
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,010
You think that I'm the killer?

73
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,280
In order to clear my name I need to prove my innocence?

74
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,190
That's right. Not only are you a killer, your killer tactics are even scarier.

75
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,480
You are a monster.

76
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,550
Cai Hong.

77
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,720
Brother Shao Tian. Jiang Yu killed someone.

78
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,790
Let's report to the police now.

79
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,290
What's going on?

80
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,420
What brings you here?

81
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,750
What brings you here?

82
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,800
Cut the nonsense. Let's go back now.

83
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,190
Let's go now, Brother Shao Tian.

84
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,390
Cai Hong, is what I am hearing the truth?

85
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,540
It's just that I don't have any concrete evidence.

86
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,520
This is the latest results after the death.

87
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,620
You may leave.

88
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,050
Based on this new report, your father's injury

89
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,920
was caused by a small wound from a metal pen.

90
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,220
It left debris (evidence),

91
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,480
that is only found in a rare Parker pen tip.

92
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,670
Cai Hong. Does your father have such a pen?

93
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,360
Jiang Yu has this fountain pen too.

94
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,270
If we can test Jiang Yu's pen in a laboratory,

95
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,770
we may be able to explain it.

96
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,300
Can I tell Jiang Yu to come here

97
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,930
to examine his fountain pen?

98
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,210
Last time, we already confirmed his innocence.

99
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,590
Also, the witness was my superior, Chief Li Ting.

100
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,290
If you think that Jiang Yu used the fountain pen to kill someone,

101
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,300
let's test the pen thoroughly.

102
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,500
Brother Shao Tian. Did I make a mistake?

103
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,570
In case I hadn't insist on checking on her identity,

104
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,300
she wouldn't have died.

105
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,940
You are not at fault.

106
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,610
You are investigating your father's death to take revenge.

107
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,950
As it is something you swore to do.

108
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,260
Blame the cruelty of the murderer who

109
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,220
covered up the murder through silence.

110
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,540
If I hadn't forced the situation,

111
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,990
this matter wouldn't have come to this stage.

112
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,660
Cai Hong. Leave this matter to me now.

113
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,030
First Lao Cai and now his mistress...

114
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,610
I'm worried that if this continues, it won't bring you any benefits.

115
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,300
I am not going to be afraid. The more he threatens me,

116
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,850
the more I'm committed to removing his mask of hypocrisy,

117
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,390
and investigating the reason of my father's death.

118
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,470
Also,

119
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,390
I must get hold of Jiang Yu's fountain pen.

120
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,060
Brother.

121
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,810
So how? Did you meet Old Cai's mistress?

122
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,950
Yes,

123
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,870
- but she is already dead.
- Dead?

124
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,550
When I arrived there, she was already dead.

125
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,560
Who did it?

126
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,260
I don't know who did it.

127
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,720
How each time someone is always one step ahead of me..

128
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,700
it is like someone is being given clues (information) in advance.

129
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,670
Brother. What are you suspicious of?

130
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,890
I suspect this individual wants to stop people from being questioned
<i>(giving out information</i>

131
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,150
around us.

132
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,620
Brother.

133
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,130
Who do you suspect then?

134
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,520
Fei Fei. When I went to find Old Cai's mistress,

135
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,380
did you tell anyone about it?

136
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,680
I... didn't.

137
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,460
You really didn't?

138
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,840
It's that Brother Shao Tian.

139
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,870
When he couldn't find Wu Cai Hong, he was like a maniac.

140
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,140
He forced me to tell him.

141
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,940
I was thinking that place isn't safe.

142
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,740
He may be able to help when he is there.

143
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,930
Thus, I told him.

144
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,350
Could Shao Tian have done something?

145
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,600
Brother. Ever since Wu Cai Hong came to Ling Long,

146
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,920
she keeps bringing troubles.

147
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,420
When do you plan to let her go?

148
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,170
Wait till I have investigated fully

149
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,390
about who stole the money from Ling Long,

150
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,140
she can go whenever and wherever she wants.

151
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,760
Brother, don't overdue it.

152
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,410
Regardless of who stole the money from Ling Long,

153
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,070
I think we should thank him instead.

154
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,830
If it weren't for him, it won't have been that easy for us to acquire Ling Long.

155
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,780
Why are you always grabbing a hold of that man?
<i>(Why do you always suspect him?)</i>

156
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,630
The person who stole the money from Ling Long,

157
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,000
should also be the one who burnt the ledger.

158
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,640
He is also the same person who harmed Old Cai's mistress.

159
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,810
Furthermore, he should be near us.

160
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,980
If we don't get rid of him soon,

161
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,110
one of these days, he'll back us into a corner.

162
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,230
Shao Tian.

163
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,190
Shao Tian.

164
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,280
Shao Tian. You are here just in time. Think of a solution quickly

165
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,190
- to let my wife, children and I leave here.
- You are the killer.

166
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,950
I... I didn't have a choice.

167
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,950
What you did is suicidal.

168
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,840
Shao Tian. Listen to me.

169
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,130
I did according to your instructions.

170
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,850
I gave her money to leave

171
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,870
but I never would have thought that that person wanted more money,

172
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,460
she even used Ling Long to threaten me.

173
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,860
She said that she will report to the police.

174
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,030
I was in a panic. Thus...

175
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,620
I didn't kill her intentionally.

176
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,950
Shao Tian.

177
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,190
You are the only one who can help me to leave.

178
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,910
We're in the same boat.

179
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,980
Nothing must happen to me.

180
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,710
Are you threatening me?

181
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,350
I... wouldn't dare.

182
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,680
Master Shao.

183
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,540
Master Shao. I'm begging you.

184
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,430
Please save him. If you don't save him today,

185
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,630
he will be doomed.

186
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,150
Get up first.

187
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,570
Let's do this. I will think of a way

188
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,570
but you must listen to me next

189
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,880
time there is a plan.

190
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,140
Yes.

191
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,880
Okay, thanks.

192
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,500
Thanks.

193
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,660
Thank, Master Shao.

194
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,870
What are you doing?

195
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,020
Brother Shao Tian's mother is sick.

196
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,410
Thus, I'm cooking some porridge. He doesn't have time to take care of her.

197
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,120
I will take his mother to the hospital later.

198
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,240
Cai Hong. Have you thought it through

199
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,460
about being with Shao Tian?

200
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,010
Aunt.

201
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,200
Don't say that I talk too much.

202
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,210
When a girl marries someone,

203
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,950
they will be reborn for the second time.

204
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,400
This is an opportunity to turn your life around.

205
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,280
Of course, you must choose well.

206
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,900
Zhou Shao Tian isn't on your level.

207
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,870
A lowly husband and wife will live in misery.

208
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,630
This is not a game.

209
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,830
I think you have misunderstood.

210
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,310
I don't have the mood to be in love now.

211
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,160
Ever since my father passed away,

212
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,370
Brother Shao Tian has helped us a lot.

213
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,760
I'm just expressing my gratitude.

214
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,480
You should show your gratitude in a suitable fashion.

215
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,970
You are so close to him now.

216
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,160
It's inevitable that he'll misunderstand.

217
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,420
He still thinks he has a chance, no?

218
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,930
Come, Aunt.

219
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,010
Miss Wu, thank you.

220
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,810
It's okay, Aunt.

221
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,400
Brother Shao Tian is like a family member to me.

222
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,670
Thus, it's a given that I should take care of you.

223
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,640
Then, in the future,

224
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,930
could I treat you like my family member?

225
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:23,150
Of course. Just tell me if you want to eat anything.

226
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,010
When I have cooked it, I will have it delivered to you.

227
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,100
You are really a good girl.

228
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,810
Shao Tian, is really a blessing from the heavens.

229
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,530
Have some again.

230
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,040
Come.

231
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,200
Aunt?

232
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,300
It's really you.

233
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,470
Wench. So, it's you.

234
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,160
Why are you here again? Did you disobey the doctor's orders again?

235
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,950
No. My son is just anxious about me.

236
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,330
I'm getting older. I was feeling a bit dizzy and had a fever, but he was getting worried.

237
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:10,430
He brought me here for a medical check. Look at me.

238
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,300
Okay.

239
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,250
- I'm great.
- Don't overexert yourself.

240
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,890
I think you're still a little weak when walking.

241
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,490
When one is old, how could they not have any illnesses?

242
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,420
What are you doing at the hospital?

243
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,600
I came to visit someone who also didn't take good care of herself

244
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,890
but Aunt, why are you here alone?

245
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,700
No one is with you?

246
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,940
Yes, there is.

247
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,380
My daughter is here with me.

248
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,400
Just now, I had a craving.

249
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,330
I wanted to eat Rose Candy.

250
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,390
I sent him to go buy some for me.

251
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,180
You like to eat Rose Candy as well?

252
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,700
I have been eating this for several years.

253
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
I really like this too

254
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,930
but if we eat too many sweet things,

255
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,530
it won't be good for recovering from illnesses.

256
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,840
Consider that you are fated.

257
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,540
I will share it with you when she has bought it.

258
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,300
Are you bribing me?

259
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,220
That's good too.

260
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,240
Wench. I have met you many times.

261
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,780
I still don't know your name.

262
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,620
Aunt. You can call me Cai Hong.

263
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,700
Cai Hong?

264
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,790
This is a nice name.

265
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,460
Sorry to disturb you, Madam.

266
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,730
Could you please verify this hospital form?

267
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,620
I can't read clearly.

268
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,570
Cai Hong, read this to me.

269
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,730
To the patient, Wang Mei Feng.

270
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,970
The address is Xian Hu Street, number 25.

271
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,720
The hospital stay was three months and eight days.

272
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,370
Principal doctor was Zhao Hai Yang. I filled it in correctly, right?

273
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,960
Yes.

274
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,380
Thank you, Nurse.

275
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,990
Don't mention it.

276
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,930
Cai Hong, thank you.

277
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,150
It's okay, Aunt.

278
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,770
After one reaches a certain age,

279
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,280
coming to the hospital is a common occurence.

280
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,830
I can't even read the words clearly on the paper.

281
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,600
My daughter is very busy. I didn't want to impose on them

282
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,020
to tell them to keep me company.

283
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,890
I wanted to read the newspaper

284
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,340
but I realised that I forgot my reading glasses.

285
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,020
Cai Hong. If you could,

286
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,330
could you go to my house to get my reading glasses?

287
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,990
Go to your house?

288
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,360
Well...

289
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,310
Am I making it inconvenient for you?

290
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,870
Of course not.

291
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,240
I will come back here after I have gotten it.

292
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,130
No need. Let's do this.

293
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,500
Bring it for me tomorrow. This way,

294
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,360
you will have time to stay and talk to me.

295
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,490
When the time comes, you'll think I'm annoying.

296
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,060
How could I?

297
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,820
It's okay. I will bring it for you tomorrow.

298
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,360
Okay.

299
00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:04,380
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

300
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,130
Miss Wu. What's up?

301
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,770
I'm here to get Madam's reading glasses.

302
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,260
Okay, this way, please.

303
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,210
Come.

304
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,400
- Hello Housekeeper Qi.
- Where are you going?

305
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,170
The flowers in Young Master's room are wilting. I'm changing them.

306
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,940
Okay, go to the backyard and change them. Quickly now.

307
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,300
Your Young Master is staying there?

308
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,550
Yes. His room is over there.

309
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,050
It's pretty exquisite.

310
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,760
Housekeeper Ji! The accountant is over there looking for you.

311
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,080
He says there's an urgent matter.

312
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,720
Okay, I will go over now.

313
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,610
Miss, I have to go attend to some urgent matters.

314
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,240
I will bring the reading glasses to you later.

315
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,500
Thank you for the trouble.

316
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,120
Hello, Young Master.

317
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,980
What are you doing here?

318
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,540
I met Madam Jiang at the hospital.

319
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,720
She wanted me to come her to pick up something for her.

320
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,840
I was looking around your house.

321
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,860
What is there to look around?

322
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,660
You are not welcome here. Leave.

323
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,030
Miss Wu. Why are you here?

324
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,910
I brought Madam's reading glasses for you.

325
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,610
Okay, I know.

326
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,460
I'm leaving first.

327
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,640
Miss Wu. This is Madam's reading glasses.

328
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,800
Since Mr Jiang is back, he can deliver them to her.

329
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,360
Thank you.

330
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,930
Miss.

331
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,270
From the looks of it, the wound on his shoulder

332
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,100
was definitely caused by this fountain pen.

333
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,810
It's Jiang Yu.

334
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,400
Cai Hong, don't be rash first.

335
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,490
Even though, the wound was caused by a fountain pen,

336
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,170
we can't determine if it was this pen or not.

337
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,390
Superintendent Chen, you and my dad have been acquainted for more than ten years.

338
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,720
Based on your past friendship,

339
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,810
you must help me to find out the truth.

340
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,890
On the day the incident happened to Boss Wu, that day Jiang Yu came to find me.

341
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,850
Furthermore, Jiang Yu has always been planning to acquire Ling Long.

342
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,730
Thus, Cai Hong and I think that

343
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,820
he killed Boss Wu.

344
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,630
Even though this fountain pen is not strong evidence,

345
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,430
we could probably find more evidence with further investigation.

346
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,160
Don't talk about my friendship with your father first.
(It isn't just about our friendship.)

347
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,810
Even if we didn't have one <i>(relationship)</i>, I would still investigate this and find the killer.

348
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,110
I'm very thankful after hearing what you have said.

349
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,710
You don't need to thank me. I'm the police.

350
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,450
I'm only doing what I should do.

351
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,300
Hello. Go to Ling Long and tell Boss Jiang to come here.

352
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,840
Immediately.

353
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,070
Sorry. Who is Jiang Yu?

354
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,680
It's me.

355
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,590
Please come with us to the police bureau.

356
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,490
Wait.

357
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,630
What are you doing? Why are you taking my brother?

358
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,040
Sorry. We are only just following orders.

359
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,510
Let Mister Jiang assist in the investigation of Wu Hong Da's death.

360
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,900
Please understand.

361
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,510
What does Wu Hong Da's death have to do with my brother?

362
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,660
Do you have any evidence? Can the police just take him away like this?

363
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,000
We are only just following orders, Miss.

364
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,380
If you obstruct our duties,

365
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,500
I'm afraid you will have to go to jail with us too.

366
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,300
- You...
- Fei Fei.

367
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,440
No problem. I will go with you.

368
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,720
- Brother...
- Contact Lawyer Zhang and tell him to meet me there.

369
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,140
Mr Jiang. Do you recognise this fountain pen?

370
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,870
Of course, I know that this is a Parker pen

371
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,680
but how does this fountain pen concern me?

372
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,500
On Wu Hong Da's corpse,

373
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
we found a gold fragment

374
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,330
that was proven to belong to the Parker fountain pen.

375
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,740
So to say, the owner of this fountain pen,

376
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,420
could be the killer we are looking for.

377
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:13,590
This fountain pen is Jiang Yu's, you're smiting me!

378
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,520
You are trying to frame my brother.

379
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,900
Mr Jiang, sorry.

380
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,530
I'm just doing my work. I hope that you will cooperate with me.

381
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,770
Superintendent Chen,

382
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,830
let me ask you. Before you called me here,

383
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,420
did you thoroughly check this fountain pen?

384
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,250
You told me just now that you found a

385
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,190
golden piece of the Parker pen on the corpse.

386
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,370
But this fountain pen

387
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,780
doesn't seem to have any wears or tears.

388
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:46,630
Also, I know that this Parker pen is rare.

389
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,980
How long has it been since Wu Hong Da's case?

390
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,420
- More than a month.
- More than a month?

391
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,610
One month is enough for you,

392
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,170
you and especially you,

393
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,580
or perhaps someone else,

394
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,860
could have ordered the exact fountain pen from overseas.

395
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,750
Isn't this so?

396
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,750
Also,

397
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,710
how can you prove that this fountain pen

398
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,900
belongs to me?

399
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,960
Sorry. This fountain pen is really mine.

400
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,080
I would like to ask you. I just lost this fountain pen in my home.

401
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,680
Where did you pick it up from?

402
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,560
Can I formally file charges against

403
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,400
the person that stole the fountain pen from my home?

404
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,750
Don't make up stories! It's you who killed my dad!

405
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,950
Return my father to me!

406
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,790
- Cai Hong!
- What excuses are you making?!

407
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,170
Forget it. Don't be rash. Mr Jiang, sorry.

408
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,490
Forgive me for wasting your precious time.

409
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,690
Cai Hong is just a little girl, she doesn't know her manners.

410
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,520
Please forgive her.

411
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,910
Superintendent Chen, if you want to find me in the future,

412
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,700
don't waste your efforts.

413
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,610
Just call me and I will be here any time.

414
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,120
<i>Dad, don't worry.</i>

415
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,970
<i>I guarantee that</i>

416
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,270
<i>I will find the killer</i>

417
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,370
<i>and take revenge for you.</i>

418
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,700
<i>Stop making excuses, I know you killed my father!</i>

419
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,730
<i>Return my father to me.</i>

420
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,180
<i>It's you who killed my father.</i>

421
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,150
<i>It's her.</i>

422
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,510
<i>Why is she here? How dare she come here?</i>

423
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,410
<i>She's here again.</i>

424
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,700
<i>This...</i>

425
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,130
<i>Isn't this because of her?</i>

426
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,940
<i>She still dares to come here?</i>

427
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,390
Do you have documents for the boss?

428
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,740
Thank you.

429
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,900
<i>She is really brave.</i>

430
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,360
Wu Cai Hong.

431
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,040
You still dare to come back here?

432
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,680
<i>How could she come back here?</i>

433
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,880
Are you here to be scolded?

434
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,130
I came back just to work.

435
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,130
I think you are crazy.

436
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,280
Boss Jiang didn't sack me. I'm still an employee here.

437
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,710
Give me this.

438
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,710
Before I lose my temper,

439
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,530
get lost.

440
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,530
<i>That Wu Cai Hong is too stubborn.</i>

441
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,290
Hello, this is Ling Long.

442
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,410
Wu Cai Hong. Why are you still there?

443
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,880
<i>Is Miss Fang there? Hand over the phone to her.</i>

444
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,820
Boss Jiang.

445
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,490
If there is anything, just instruct me to do it.

446
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:34,430
Immediately go and send someone to retrieve the log from the meeting two days ago.

447
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,190
Where are you? I will deliver it to you.

448
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,660
You don't need to bother about this. After going through what happened yesterday,

449
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,230
you are no longer my secretary.

450
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,270
I admit that I was at fault.

451
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,120
If you want to punish me, I will accept it.

452
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,930
However, I didn't break the secretary code.

453
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,330
I would like to continue to be your secretary.

454
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,970
Fine.

455
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:00,090
If you can bring that meeting log to me,

456
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,910
I will reconsider it.

457
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,920
Where are you now?

458
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,490
I'm next to a tree where the flowers have bloomed.

459
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,260
What? I...

460
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,620
Boss Jiang wants me to deliver this document to him.

461
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,000
Please pick up the documents from the floor.

462
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,210
You!

463
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,390
I wish you good luck and hope that you can find him.

464
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:09,330
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

465
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,490
What did you do?

466
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,440
I already told you so many times and you still don't understand?

467
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,150
Revise this. If you don't get it done by today, don't report back for work.

468
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,150
Yes.

469
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,570
Miss Fang, it's a call for you.

470
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,620
Hello, brother.

471
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,640
Zhou Shao Tian?

472
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,620
Sorry.

473
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,620
I'm late.

474
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,880
If I really want to continue to work at Ling Long?

475
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,290
If you think that by staying,

476
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,970
you can depend on your endless thinking ability

477
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,720
to find

478
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,800
evidence of your father's death...

479
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,630
Then I will fight until the end.

480
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,180
I don't want to fight with you.

481
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,350
- I'm really very tired.
- I'm only stating the facts.

482
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,250
You wanted me to find a tree with flowers that had bloomed.

483
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,960
I can find any street, large or small,

484
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,100
any park, any tree,

485
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,160
as long as Boss Jiang gives the order, anything's fine.

486
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,630
In your eyes,

487
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,230
am I that hateful?

488
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,470
Think whatever you like.

489
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,410
Cai Hong.

490
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,700
Brother Shao Tian.

491
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,130
I heard you were trying to find an absurd place.

492
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,180
I was worried and came over.

493
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,640
It's getting late. I will take you home.

494
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,710
Can I continue to work at Ling Long?

495
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,270
Where are the documents?

496
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,820
It's the same old time at 8 am.

497
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,400
Why do you want to work at Ling Long?

498
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,340
Cai Hong. I know you want to find out the reason for your father's death

499
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,230
but have you thought about what kind of a man Jiang Yu is?

500
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,910
You came over here that late in the night. Do you know how worried I was about you?

501
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,980
I'm fine, Brother Shao Tian.

502
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:43,290
Go back then.

503
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,390
Wu Cai Hong. You still have the face to sit here?

504
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,470
If you are smart, you should leave Ling Long.

505
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,060
Leave my brother. Or else, I will not let you off.

506
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,020
Miss. I'm really rushing the documents now.

507
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,100
If there is nothing else, please go back.

508
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,880
Stop acting.

509
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,720
What are you trying to do? What are you scheming?!

510
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,130
Boss Jiang has already gave me the consent to come back here.

511
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,690
My brother has been deceived by you, but I haven't!

512
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,040
- Men!
- Miss.

513
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,400
Drag her out of Ling Long.

514
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,450
Miss. Would you like to check with Boss Jiang first?

515
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,890
Why should I ask him? My word counts.

516
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,410
Get lost now.

517
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,940
Fei Fei.

518
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,940
Brother.

519
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,610
Come out with me for a while.

520
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,900
Brother. She caused us harm

521
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,180
and also Ling Long. Why are you retaining her?

522
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,420
Come out.

523
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,170
Brother. What is on your mind?

524
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,860
What do you mean?

525
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,400
Why did you let Wu Cai Hong come back to work?

526
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,630
Aren't you afraid that she will harm you again when she's back?

527
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,820
You don't need to bother about this.

528
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,010
I have my own plans.

529
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,460
What are your plans?

530
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,630
I didn't see you make any plans.

531
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,340
Is she making your mind restless?

532
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,220
