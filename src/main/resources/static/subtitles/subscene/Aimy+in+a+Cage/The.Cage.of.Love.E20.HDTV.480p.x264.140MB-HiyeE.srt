<i>Episode 20</i>

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,410
Brother, you caught a cold last night.

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,130
I cooked some ginger soup to toxify your body.

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,970
Drink more of this.

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,180
I don't want to drink it.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,290
I already said that I don't want it.

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,710
I know that you find it hard to accept in your heart.

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,290
Letting go of your beloved one is very painful.

10
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:53,540
But if you fall in love with someone whom you shouldn't love, it will only bring more pain.

11
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,370
You need to balance things out.

12
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,130
As the head of the Jiang family, I would like to request that

13
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,800
for the sake of the Jiang family, for mother and my sake,

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,010
you must choose the right decision.

15

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,460
This is Wu Cai Hong's slave contract.

17
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,780
Brother. I am doing this for your own good.

18
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,680
<i>Jiang's Mansion</i>

19
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,490
Young Master.

20
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,190
Come in.

21
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,340
Young Master... Miss, Mr Zhou and Miss Wu are waiting for you.

22
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,680
I get it.

23
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,030
Brother.

24
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,010
I know what I should do.

25
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,550
What's wrong?

26
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,770
Did my father

27
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,900
really do something wrong to the Jiang family?

28
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:16,280
What your father did to the Jiang family, it's not something that could be forgiven with a mere apology.

29
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,730
Everything you encountered now, compared to during that time,

30
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,860
is considered as a minor crime.

31
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,450
Wu Cai Hong, listen carefully.

32
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:32,500
Your father caused all the past hardships to the Jiang family.

33
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,760
Every dress that you wore, every meal that you had,

34
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,160
- everything that you used are stained with the blood of the Jiang family.
- My father is not that kind of man.

35
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,710
Jiang Yu, tell me.

36
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,110
- Is what she said is true?
- Everything that I have said is true.

37
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,180
The grudge that we had for your father started twelve years ago,

38
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,060
the need to support widows and children of Jiang family and to live under Lu's only power.

39
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,670
For twelve years we have thought about only one thing in the time of hardships.

40
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,650
Revenge.

41
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,650
Do you still need me to explain this further?

42
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,560
Acquiring Ling Long. Torturing you...

43
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,070
this was part of my brother and my plan.

44
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,740
We planned this for twelve years.

45
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,570
Swallowing Linglong and always finding a way to torture me...

46
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,340
Was it all for revenge?

47
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,060
Why did you help me to find out who the killer of my father was?

48
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,570
When I was depressed,

49
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,070
why did you take me to the pond to appreciate the lotus flowers?

50
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:49,230
You even risked your life to save me from the pond.

51
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,900
Was all that done for revenge?

52
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,620
What's wrong? You are still not giving up?

53
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,960
Do you think that by my brother did all this because his heart was moved by you?

54
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,550
Stop dreaming.

55
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,630
How could my brother have feelings for someone whom he holds a grudge against?

56
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,550
Brother, she wants to listen from you personally.

57
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,090
Tell her and let her give up now.

58
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,160
Listen carefully.

59
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,970
Everything that I had done was for revenge.

60
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,940
I caused you to misunderstand and you thought too much about it. Sorry.

61
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,760
Cai Hong.

62
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,230
Did you listen well?

63
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,170
If you did, get lost. Don't let us see you again.

64
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,580
Don't go overboard when you speak.

65
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,980
Cai Hong didn't do anything to harm your family.

66
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,200
I'm here today to let Cai Hong know about the truth.

67
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,140
In the future, if you do anything to harm Cai Hong again, I will never let you off.

68
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,600
Are you done talking?

69
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,790
If you are done, get lost.

70
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,350
Jiang Yu.

71
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,590
If you were doing this for revenge,

72
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,890
your tactics

73
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,420
were really excellent.

74
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,900
Cai Hong.

75
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,710
Everything is clear now. Let's go.

76
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,710
Brother.

77
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,490
Our grudges between the Jiang and Wu families are now in the past.

78
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,080
So, my father

79
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,430
was really the killer of Jiang Yu's father.

80
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:41,620
Cai Hong. It was a grudge during that era. It has nothing to do with you.

81
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,560
I'm my father's daughter.

82
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,460
I should pay his debts.

83
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,540
Cai Hong.

84
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,140
I let you know this not to cause you pain.

85
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,010
I deserved everything that Jiang Yu did to me.

86
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,270
Cai Hong. Regardless of whether you are Wu Hong Da's daughter or not,

87
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,330
what I did was to protect you.

88
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,790
Starting from today,

89
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,960
I won't let the Jiang family harm you again.

90
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,910
Let's go back.

91
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,660
Jiang Yu is really despicable.

92
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,270
Even if he has complaints against our family and we did something wrong to him,

93
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,900
he should state it clearly. How could he bully such a young girl?

94
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,680
He is not a man at all.

95
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
Don't you think so?

96
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,330
What Brother Shao Tian said were lies. I don't believe that father was a bad man.

97
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,930
Sis. Brother Shao Tian is joking with us, right?

98
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,700
Mom. Tell Brother Shao Tian that father was not that kind of man.

99
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,060
Stepmom.

100
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,700
Did you know about the incident twelve years ago?

101
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,610
Child.

102
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,320
How could I know about his work?

103
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,740
Regarding the opium investigation, it was a widely known incident.

104
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,960
Furthermore, Father was the main person in charge. How could you not know?

105
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,450
By the way, that's right...

106
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,550
talking about this, at that time, it seems like...

107
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,740
there was really opium.

108
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,900
At that time,

109
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,290
it was a hot topic in the streets.

110
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,800
What happened to the suspect?

111
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,750
I heard that he committed suicide.

112
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,960
What was his name?

113
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,740
It has been so many years. How could I still remember?

114
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,760
How did my father become the boss of Ling Long?

115
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,240
From that time onwards,

116
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,600
his luck turned around and our family became better.

117
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,160
it did not turned around. He became a ruthless predator.

118
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,130
Sis. How could this be possible? Was father really such a bad person?

119
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,430
You already read it. Dad wronged the Jiang family.

120
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,670
I don't believe it. Father was not a bad person.

121
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,630
He helped some orphans with their education and hospitalisation.

122
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,680
Everyone respected him.

123
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,690
You can't accuse him falsely.

124
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,270
If not, he won't die peacefully in...

125
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,600
Sorry. Cai Yun. I didn't do this on purpose.

126
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,910
I only wanted you to see the truth.

127
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,050
This is not the truth. Father was a good man.

128
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,180
- Listen to my explanation.
- I don't want to. You are all talking nonsense.

129
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,190
Cai Yun!

130
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,630
I don't want to listen.

131
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,180
Cai Yun is still young.

132
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,410
She will be fine after a period of time.

133
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,050
<i>My father was a supporter of the foreign efforts movement. He was a rich businessman. </i>

134
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,350
<i>but he was sabotaged by someone later and framed for</i>

135
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,160
<i>for housing opiates. This resulted in my father's death.</i>

136
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,580
<i>The reason that the court officials gave us was that he committed suicide.</i>

137
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,950
<i>When my father passed away,</i>

138
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,370
<i>the factory was confiscated. My house was occupied.</i>

<i>You could say that we went bankrupt overnight.</i>

140
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,140
<i>I kept asking God why he did this to me?</i>

141
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,000
<i>My parents are the nicest people in the world.</i>

142
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,750
<i>Why did they have to suffer all that?</i>

143
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,670
<i>Furthermore, those bad people could escape the law.</i>

144
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,370
<i>It was really a difficult period at that time</i>

145
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,280
<i>but I continue to hang on</i>

146

<i>because of revenge.</i>

147
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,790
<i>Listen carefully. Everything that I have done was for revenge.</i>

148
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,970
<i>I caused you to misunderstand and imagine too much. Sorry.</i>

149
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,630
I finally understand

150
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,430
why Jiang Ju treated me that way.

151
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,510
Always a tyrant and so moody,

152
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,480
he even tormented me.

153
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,880
Taking into consideration the loss of Jiang family,

154
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,390
his torments to me are nothing.

155
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,990
Cai Hong.

156
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,840
You are too kind.

157
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,480
Moreover, the kindness of that generation had nothing to do with you.

158
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,450
How Jiang Yu treated you,

159
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,770
you can use revenge on him too.

160
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,800
With such a person like Jiang Yu,

161
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,260
you really should not be so kind- hearted.

162
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,390
What should I do then?

163
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,430
Don't tell me that I should be like Jiang Yu harbouring grudges

164
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:43,570
and let the next generation of the Jiang and Wu families forever harbour this grudge too?

165
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,240
I'm the daughter of a killer.

166
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,640
Even if he torments me,

167
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,070
I don't blame him.

168
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,140
You are really a foolish girl.

169
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,570
I am foolish.

170
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,150
That's why I was foolishly taken advantage by him.

171
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,540
I even harmed you.

172
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,110
Cai Hong.

173
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,850
Everything is already in the past.

174
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,920
Starting from today. I only want you.

175
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:41,980
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

176
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,600
Mr Zhou. You are looking good today.

177
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,770
One look and I can tell that you have defeated your rival in love and got the fair lady.

178
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,290
Miss Lu. You are joking. It was fortunate that you helped.

179
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:12,110
Don't worry. I have started to investigate about the secret formula.

180
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,390
Mr Zhou. You are a very smart man. You already know what I want when I didn't even say anything yet.

181
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,210
I wouldn't dare to forget about what you wanted.

182
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,590
Please make it quick then. I have been waiting for that secret formula for more than ten years.

183
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:30,230
I'm curious about what the secret formula is that it has been committed in your memory.

184
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,460
Once you see this secret formula, you will be like me.

185
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,350
When I was young, I was fortunate to see the textile that was dyed by this secret formula.

186
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,460
It was extremely beautiful. After such a long time,

187
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,110
I can still remember it clearly.

188
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,590
As long as we use this secret formula to dye the textiles and release them into the market,

189
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,720
the big factories in this industry will go bankrupt immediately.

190
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,770
To say it in an extreme manner, whoever gets a hold of this secret formula

191
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,850
will be able to control the dyeing business in the whole nation.

192
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:13,060
Hence, this secret formula to me, no, to Rong Da,

193
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,590
is of great importance.

194
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,920
But there is something I don't understand.

195
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,170
You have a huge network.

196
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,290
Is there anything else in Huzhou that you are not capable of doing?

197
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,480
Why do you, just because of a minor secret formula,

198
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,190
waste so much energy on it?

199
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,210
You even specially instructed me to do it.

200
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,780
I'm afraid that you are the only person who can get this secret formula.

201
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,620
Thus, please find out immediately.

202
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,410
As to why, you will find out soon.

203
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,370
- Brother.
- Enter.

204
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,110
Brother.

205
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,190
Brother.

206
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,900
Fei Fei, accompany me on a tour of the workshop.

207
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,710
Also, tell the staff that we will have a meeting in one hour.

208
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:17,270
♫<i> So long, I have waited for so long... </i>♫

209
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:23,510
♫<i> Waited for your love to bloom. </i>♫

210
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:29,970
♫<i> Desperately, I was desperately struggling to find... </i>♫

211
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:36,310
♫<i> Yet couldn't find the way to your heart. </i>♫

212
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:42,900
♫<i> Gently, I gently tried to inquire </i>♫

213
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:49,100
♫<i> but did not ask you whether I was your fated love. </i>♫

214
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:55,490
♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

215
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:02,120
♫<i> In the end I did not get your heart. </i>♫

216
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:10,710
♫<i> I'm not willing to give up (the love), but I can't have it either. </i>♫

217
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:17,210
♫<i> I fight a bitter battle between advancing and retreating. </i>♫

218
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:23,500
♫<i> I didn't see through to your eyes or heart </i>♫

219
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:29,380
♫<i> but I've already fallen in love with your tenderness. </i>♫

220
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,900
<i>Brother. If you can't forget her,</i>

221
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,690
<i>you will only hurt deeper. Please forget her.</i>

222
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,900
<i>Let time heal your wounds.</i>

223
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,960
Shao Tian, look at you.

224
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,550
You buy so much stuff every time you are here. Do you know how expensive these are?

225
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,810
Don't do this again. I won't be happy.

226
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,200
It's nothing much.

227
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,980
Madam Wu. Cai Yun is not in?

228
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,610
Of course, she's not at home. She has gone to school.

229
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,340
We are a republic country now. Girls should study more

230
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,290
so that they can marry into a good family.

231
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,390
I see.

232
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,260
Brother. Why don't I wait outside for you?

233
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,010
It's such a luxurious place here. I don't feel comfortable.

234
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,430
Cai Hong. Shao Tian is here. Come out now.

235
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,960
Cai Hong.

236
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,030
Come.

237
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,320
- Brother Shao Tian.
- Did you have a good sleep last night?

238
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,570
She didn't. In the middle of the night,

239
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,040
I could hear her sighing from my room.

240
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,480
The incident happened so many years ago.

241
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,700
Let it go as it's already in the past.

242
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,160
Even if your father really did that,

243
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,780
he was only doing business. It's a free market in Huzhou.

244
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,370
Why do you keep throwing dirty water at your father?

245
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,390
This child.

246
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:24,220
I heard that Boss Wu has Jiang Wen Yuan's secret formula.

247
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,450
What secret formula? I have never heard of this.

248
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,400
I seem to have some impression.

249
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,950
That year, he held a piece of paper

250
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,870
like it was something very precious. He wouldn't take it to the factory either.

251
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,600
He hid it at home and wouldn't let me ask him about it.

252
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,010
Was there a special place for this secret formula?

253
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,400
I'm a housewife. I don't know much about this.

254
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,720
Moreover, it has been so many years, I have forgotten about it.

255
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,070
That's right. It has been so many years.

256
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,210
We don't even know where the secret formula is.

257
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,150
It seems like he kept this formula

258
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,130
in his safe.

259
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:14,100
But after the Wu family's business was acquired, I don't know where it went.

260
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,990
Brother Shao Tian. Why are you suddenly asking about this?

261
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,860
Shao Tian. Is that secret formula worth a lot of money?

262
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,090
Frankly, it's not that simple as it being worth a lot of money.

263
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,230
That's right. On the morning of his incident,

264
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,990
I saw him taking out a piece of paper from his safe.

265
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,790
I think it must have been that secret formula.

266
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,930
Cai Hong. When you last cleaned the safe, did you see it?

267
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:51,970
No. There were only documents like the house deeds in the safe.

268
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:57,180
It must be the secret formula that he took that day.

269
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,140
If the secret formula was in Boss Wu's hands,

270
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,770
why didn't the police find it when they were searching the place?

271
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:11,420
So to say, that killer took the secret formula from my father?

272
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:16,210
You may be right. The murder's motivation of going there could have been this.

273
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,630
There is only one person who knows that the secret formula was with your father.

274
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,430
Jiang Yu.

275
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,330
Do you have any evidence?

276
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,870
Shao Tian is right. Jiang Yu is your fathers' killer.

277
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,700
He was also the one who took the secret formula.

278
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,400
Forget it. You are still not feeling well. Let's not talk about this.

279
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,000
Let's go out for a walk. It will be good for your health.

280
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,520
I would like to take a walk alone and see if I can find a suitable job at the same time.

281
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,710
Cai Hong.

282
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,370
You don't want to be a lady of leisure and insist on working outside.

283
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,480
Aren't you making it difficult for yourself?

284
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,750
Frankly, it's not a bad idea. We are republic country now.

285
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:09,140
It's also right that Cai Hong wants to be a new generation woman with a career.

286
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,790
- I will go with you.
- You really don't need to.

287
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,250
Come home early then.

288
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,230
I'm really worried about this child.

289
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm leaving, Boss.

290
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,510
Boss, sorry to disturb you. Do you need staff here?

291
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,750
We don't need any more staff. Go and look elsewhere.

292
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,740
Thank you.

293
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,840
Hello, Boss. Do you need any staff here?

294
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,700
No.

295
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,380
Sorry for your trouble then.

296
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,420
Boss. Do you need staff here?

297
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,890
You don't have to pay me first.

298
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,070
When you find that I'm suitable, you can pay me later.

299
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,820
This is not a problem of suitability.

300
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,340
Even if you are suitable, we can't afford to pay you.

301
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,410
Business is not doing well lately.

302
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,780
We are a small set up. We don't need many staff.

303
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,070
Why don't you try Ling Long or Rong Da?

304
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,260
I heard that these two big companies need staff.

305
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,130
I know. Thank you.

306
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:39,430
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

307
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,990
<i>Put me down.</i>

308
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,300
<i>Why are you shouting? So annoying.</i>

309
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,830
<i>Be careful.</i>

310
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,330
<i>The fourth clause in the Secretary's code is that regardless of whether the boss' order is right or not,</i>

311
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,540

312
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,450
<i>Eat this.</i>

313
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,830
<i>Are you okay? Let me take a look.</i>

314
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,800
<i>I'me fine. Let me do it alone.</i>

315
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,670
<i>Stop packing. Come.</i>

316
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,760
<i>Does it still hurt?</i>

317
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,410
<i>This Zhou Shao Tian really knows how to humour girls.</i>

318
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,780
<i>But it's a pity that</i>

319
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,700
<i>Unfortunately for him, rainbows only come after the rain.</i>

320
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,460
<i>Such a shady person like him, he will never be able to catch the rainbow.</i>

321
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,340
Let's go.

322
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,270
Wait.

323
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,610
Jiang Yu. Wait!

324
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,540
Wait for me.

325
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,380
Wait for me.

326
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,030
Stop the carriage.

327
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,350
Are you okay?

328
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,660
What are you doing here?

329
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,150
On behalf of my father,

330
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,730
I wanted to apologise to you.

331
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,370
You don't need to apologise.

332
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:13,040
The grudge between our families has already ended.

333
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,080
Take her home.

334
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,220
In the future, don't come and look for me again.

335
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,930
Thanks.

336
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,570
<i>If Jiang Yu really killed Hong Da,</i>

337
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,200
<i>he must have been discreetly at the scene</i>

338
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,470
<i>but he was not there.</i>

339
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,020
<i>The Police Chief Li Ting may be on good terms with Jiang Yu</i>

340
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,060
<i>but how such a man could go agains the palace order and</i>

341
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,500
<i>helped to be the witness for Jiang Yu.</i>

342
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,990
<i>Where is the loophole?</i>

343
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,010
Reporting, Sir. General Manager Zhou of Rong Da is here to see you.

344
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,530
Invite him in.

345
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:11,590
This way, please.

346
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,660
Sit.

347
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,290
I came without any notice as I would like to invite you for a meal.

348
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,220
Drunken Fairy Restaurant's Drunken Chicken.

349
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,540
General Manager. Why do you suddenly want to invite me out to a meal?

350
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,360
You even know that I love to eat drunken chicken.

351
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,530
I came here without notice to seek your advice on a matter.

352
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:35,030
Regarding Wu Hong Da's case, I know that on the day of the incident,

353
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,310
you and Jiang Yu were having a meal at Drunken Fairy restaurant.

354
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:40,740
You ordered that signature dish, the drunken chicken.

355
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:45,550
Mr Zhou. Why are you suddenly so interested in this?

356
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,630
I won't hide this from you. Wu Cai Hong is my girlfriend.

357
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,610
Wu Hong Da was my boss for many years.

358
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,710
Thus, the Wu family's business is my business too.

359
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,400
General Manager Zhou. You are a person with heart.

360
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:08,140
Miss. Brother Shao Tian wanted me to bring you here. There is something he would like you to know.

361
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,050
What is it?

362
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,660
- Look where you are going.
Look where you are going too.

363
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,270
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you too? You knocked into me.

364
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,520
If you knock into her, why are you going to pay for it?

365
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,380
Teacher Yao.

366
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,880
You are here. Many of the customers in there

367
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,130
are waiting to eat your signature dish, the drunken chicken.

368
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,510
Teacher Yao, go now.

369
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,690
Tell him to wait. The chickens are still being done.

370
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,390
If they want to eat it, they can cook them at their kitchens.

371
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,070
Who is this guy?

372
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,010
Dear customers, please come inside.

373
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,440
Your chef is really interesting. What time is it now and he just reported for work?

374
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,210
He is not afraid that the customers will bang the tables?

375
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,360
What can we do. That Teacher Yao

376
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,510
is a famous chef in Huzhou.

377
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,320
He just likes to drink.

378
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,690
He would drink till he is totally smashed every day after work.

379
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,800
He would only report for work at noon.

380
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,250
Many of our customers here

381
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,230
would wait till noon

382
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,710
but the drunken chicken that Teacher Yao cooks

383
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,580
is really good. Whoever wants to copy him, they just can't do it.

384
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,870
So, we let him get his way.

385
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,290
Some customers are willing to wait for him.

386
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,660
<i>Also, when I left that day, it just happened to be at noon.</i>

387
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,700
<i>I had an appointment for lunch later with Police Chief Li Ting.</i>

388
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,500
<i>Do you want to call him here for an investigation?</i>

389
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,250
By the way, I would like to ask you something.

390
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,790
Do youperhaps remember whether on the day of the Wu Hongda's accident

391
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,330
Chief Police Li Ting and the new boss of Ling Long, Jiang Yu,

392
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,970
did they dine here?

393
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,940
I don't remember about that day

394
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,130
but regarding Police Chief Li Ting and Boss Jiang,

395
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,630
I can recognise them.

396
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,610
They are famous people in Huzhou.

397
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,950
They are our regular customers.

398
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,350
Especially, Police Chief Li Ting. Every time when he's here,

399
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,980
he orders our signature dish, the drunken chicken.

400
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,780
Thank you.

401
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,710
It's like this. When Jiang Yu was being investigated by the police on that day,

402
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,140
he said that he wasn't at the scene and the witness was you.

403
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,110
Thus, the police called and didn't dare to ask too much about it.

404
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,650
Although, I think that was strange.

405
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,520
Thus, I came here specially to seek your advice.

406
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,120
Yes. Jiang Yu and I dined here that day.

407
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,040
Furthermore, we ordered the drunken chicken.

408
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,440
Do you remember what time Jiang Yu arrived at the restaurant?

409
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,080
I really don't remember. I only remember it was around lunch time.

410
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,270
Do you stil remember

411
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,200
when they served the food?

412
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,640
I remember this because a few of our friends were dining together.

413
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,630
Jiang Yu was a bit late. When he arrived, he was hungry.

414
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,580
We felt bad for him and ordered more food for him.

415
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,070
At that time, when they served the drunken chicken,

416
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:47,600
he said that he didn't had any appetite and didn't order anything else.

417
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,800
- Hello.
- Cai Hong.

418
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,400
- So how, Brother Shao Tian.
- I have already confirmed it with Police Chief Li Ting.

419
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,470
The day of your father's incident, when Jiang Yu reached Drunken Fairy restaurant,

420
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,440
the drunken chicken that Police Chief ordered just arrived.

421
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,700
That is to say, it couldn't be earlier than 12:20 pm.

422
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,040
I remember when the incident happened to my father,

423
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,040
it was at noon.

424
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,120
The Jiang family's secret formula was in your father's hands.

425
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,970
It went missing when he died. As long as we can prove that Jiang Yu took it,

426
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,000
he is the killer of your father then.

427
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:47,950
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

428
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,210
What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you

429
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,680
not to show up again?

430
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,560
Did you kill my father?

431
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,270
<i>I won't seek for your forgiveness.</i>

432
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,280
<i>I'm begging you</i>

433
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,930
<i>to let my family off.</i>

434
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,090
<i>Sorry.</i>

435
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,090
Shouldn't your father die?

436
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:47,100
He even did many unethical things.

437
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,340
Death's too good for people like him.

438
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,260
Jiang Yu. Why did you do that?

439
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,620
Why did you do that?

440
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,640
Why did you kill my father?

441
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,740
It's fine if you take revenge on me

442
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,610
but why did you do that?

443
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,910
I hate you. Return my father to me.

444
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,930
Return him to me. Jiang Yu, I hate you!

445
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,010
- Miss.
- Let me go.

446
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,580
- Miss.
- Jiang Yu.

447
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,460
Jiang Yu, come back.

448
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,710
- Jiang Yu.
- Miss, keep calm.

449
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,530
Jiang Yu, I hate you.

450
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,260
Miss.

451
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,840
Cai Hong.

452
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,160
What's wrong with you?

453
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,900
I'm fine.

454
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,990
Is it because of Jiang Yu?

455
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,610
Cai Hong. I would like to take you to a place

456
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:19,060
to see someone but you must promise me that

457
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,520
once you are there, you must listen to me and not say anything.

458
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,540
You will know once you have heard what's being said.

459
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,870
This way, please.

460
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,210
I came to disturb you without advance notice again.

461
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,790
I would like to ask you something.

462
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,540
Please ask.

463
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:58,260
I would like to know about the secret formula of the Jiang family.

464
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,520
This was my good friend who said nothing wrong.

465
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,110
- I got to know him a little.
- Excuse my interference.

466
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,760
That year, when Wu Hong Da wanted to get hold of the Jiang family's secret formula,

467
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,420
he harmed Jiang Wen Yuan.

468
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,430
That is most likely what happened

469
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,960
but when Old Master Jiang passed away,

470
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,480
they never saw the secret formula again.

471
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,920
After that mighty Jiang family declined.

472
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,270
Fortunately now the young Jiang master managed to buy back the house.

473
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,490
Didn't Jiang Yu learn the secret formula?

474
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,740
Young Master Jiang was still very young when his father passed away.

475
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:48,810
He wouldn't have passed on his secret formula to a kid.

476
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,920
To the Jiang tribe,

477
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,900
if he wanted to learn the secret formula, he would have to wait till he was an adult.

478
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,260
That was why the Jiang family could so casually

479
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,380
kick out Young Master Jiang from the family..

480
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,400
If they knew about the shrewd mind of Young Master Jiang then,

481
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,500
I believe they wouldn't have kicked him out that easily.

482
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,040
So to say, if Jiang Yu wants to get back the secret formula,

483
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,600
he could only find Wu Hong Da.

484
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:26,020
Yes. If I were Young Master Jiang,

485
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,130
I would ask Wu Hong Da to return the secret formula.

486
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:35,360
but I am afraid that Wu Hong Da wouldn't give it that easily to him.

487
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,990
Now that Wu Hong Da is dead,

488
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:42,660
I'm afraid that the secret formula has been lost.
