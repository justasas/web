3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,440
I know this. Let me do it.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,250
This is not the same fish you are used to.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,930
So, let me do it.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,550
Why do you know so much?

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,510
When my Mom was sick, I took care of her medications.

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,370
I didn't feel assured leaving this task to my servants. Thus, I gradually learned how to do it.

Wen Yuan.

32
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,200
Madam.

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,940
Madam.

34
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,860
Madam, what did you say? Please say it again.

35
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,720
Madam.

36
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,970
Madam.

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,070
You are awake, Madam.

38
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,560
Cai Hong.

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,750
Why is it you?

40
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,680
Madam, you are finally awake.

41
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,270
We missed you very much. I'm going to tell the rest.

42
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,810
Madam is conscious.

43
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,920
Madam is conscious.

44
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,410
Madam is conscious.

45
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,630
- Really?
- Madam is conscious.

46
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,840
Mom. You are awake. Can you recognise us?

47
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,980
Mom.

48
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,040
Yu Er.

49
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,690
Mom.

50
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,900
You are finally conscious.

51
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,820
Mom. You are finally conscious.

52
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,000
You scared us to death.

53
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,610
Cai Hong.

54
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,390
Thank you.

55
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,400
In my dream,

56
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,770
when I heard you singing,

57
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,700
my dream

58
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,960
became beautiful.

59
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,510
Madam. Thank you for waking up.

60
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,990
What are you doing?

61
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,300
I would like the rainbow bracelet back. It's very important to me. Could you return it to me?

62
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,770
No.

63
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,770
Also,

64
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,480
don't think that just because my Mom is conscious, I will forgive you.

65
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,770
Wu Long, you rascal.

66
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,450
Forget it if you don't want to help me. You scared me.

67
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,970
Come, sit here and be good.

68
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,880
Where does he keep the necklace?

69
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,790
What are you doing?

70
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,340
Wu Cai Hong, what are you doing?

71
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,990
I didn't do anything.

72
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,830
You still deny it? I saw you sneaking into my brother's room.

73
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,550
What are you looking for?

74
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,040
I... was looking for Wu Long.

75
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,450
I just saw Wu Long coming in here and I was afraid that he would mess up the room.

76
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,220
- I was just about to carry him out.
- Nonsense.

77
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,900
I saw you sneaking into my brother's room. You even searched his drawers.

78
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,590
Would Wu Long be in there?

79
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,700
I was really looking for Wu Long.

80
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,010
I'm going out first.

81
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,820
You are not going to tell the truth?

82
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,820
My brother is not here. I will teach you a lesson on his behalf.

83
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,080
My brother really hates his room being intruded into.

84
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,020
Even if I can't come in here, it's even more so for a servant like you.

85
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:40,510
Wu Cai Hong, I know there is a definite reason why you came to our house.

86
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,570
But in the end I was ignorant

87
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,970
and was just wishful thinking.

88
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,910
If I see you doing this again, it won't be that simple as getting a slap from me.

89
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,980
Get out.

90
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,080
You don't seem very happy.

91
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,000
Madam Jiang, I'm fine.

92
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,530
Your eyes are red and you still say that you are fine?

93
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,780
If you have any problems, I will decide for you.

94
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,030
It's just that I couldn't find a bracelet which is very important to me.

95
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,540
Don't be too anxious. I will tell the servants to look for it together with you.

96
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,730
No need, Madam. Thank you.

97
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,960
You are really too polite.

98
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,310
Brother.

99
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,250
I just saw Wu Cai Hong searching for stuff in your room.

100
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,610
I asked her what she was doing and she told me that she was looking for the cat.

101
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,940
How could the cat hide in the drawers?

102
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,350
I know what she is looking for.

103
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,520
Aren't you angry?

104
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,060
Don't you hate people intruding into your room?

105
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,680
She is looking for her bracelet.

106
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,880
Bracelet?

107
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,430
What bracelet? Brother, Wu Cai Hong is our enemy who killed father.

108
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,300
She certainly has tried her best to take revenge. You must always be cautious of her.

109
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,420
Enough, don't worry. Everything is fine.

110
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:50,240
Where did you keep that bracelet?

111
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,900
In the drawers.

112
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,590
What is its significance? Why aren't you returning it to her?

113
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,940
Enough, don't bother about it.

114
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:10,740
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

115
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,800
<i>Hateful. It's such a worthless thing.</i>

116
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,020
<i>I really don't understand why brother wants to keep this?</i>

117
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,910
Did you go to my brother's room because of this?

118
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,160
This is my bracelet. Return it to me.

119
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,330
It's such a worthless thing. Let's just throw it away.

120
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,890
No. Brother Shao Tian gave this to me.

121
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,760
So, this is the case.

122
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,020
Zhou Shao Tian gave this to you?

123
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,270
So to say, this is a lover's keepsake.

124
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,780
You want it, right?

125
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,490
Brother Shao Tian personally weaved this bracelet.

126
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,930
It represents his heart. Even though it doesn't cost much,

127
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,240
as long as your gift is sincere,

128
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,160
no one can say that it's worthless.

129
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,220
Because you don't know, doesn't mean you can trample on other people's stuff.

130
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:19,270
So what if I trampled on your bracelet? No matter the reason, it won't change anything,

131
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,080
I'm the mistress now and you are my servant.

132
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,260
I can check on you, your love and your worthless bracelet

133
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,290
and trample it with my feet. So what?

134
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,690
I know that I'm a servant of the Jiang family.

135
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,750
You are also the lady of the family.

136
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,770
In your eyes, my bracelet is nothing to you. Hence, could you please

137
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,950
return my bracelet to me?

138
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:50,050
It's good that you know your position but I still won't return it to you.

139
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,070
So what?

140
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,900
You are really unreasonable. Return the bracelet to me.

141
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,490
Wu Cai Hong. Your sister pushed my mom down the stairs. Are you going to push me now?

142
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,410
Why would I push you? I only want you to return my bracelet to me.

143
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:09,080
That day, why did my sister mistakenly pushed your mom down the stairs? Aren't you responsible too?

144
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,650
If your brother didn't instigated you to use the lipstick to frame Cai Yun,

145
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,490
would the both of you have exchanged words on that day?

146
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,860
If you both didn't exchange words that day and you didn't hit Cai Yun first, would Madam have involved herself in the tussle?

147
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,550
If you weren't so brutal,

148
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,600
-my sister would not have grabbed the wrong hands and pushed Madam down the stairs.
- and you took the rap for your sister.

149
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,910
If you feel bitter about this, go and tell my brother that it was your sister who pushed my mom and not you.

150
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,890
I will never talk about what happened regarding Cai Yun.

151
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,510
I only want my bracelet back. I'm reasoning with you.

152
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,950
That day Cai Yun's tussle caused such a great tragedy

153
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:52,240
It made the innocent Madam Jiang get hurt. I really hope that you can start anew.

154
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,600
Also, this bracelet is really very important to me.

155
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,920
Are you saying that I caused my mom to be injured?

156
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,260
Fine. Go and tell my brother then and see if he believes you.

157
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,650
I won't tell Jiang Yu.

158
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:12,100
I only hope that you can return my bracelet to me.

159
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:18,970
Also, I'm very sad too regarding Madam Jiang's injury.

160
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,570
I'm working very hard to redeem for it.

161
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,590
I hope that between us, we won't repeat the same mistakes.

162
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,940
Stop pretending to be a good person.

163
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,060
Redeem yourself?

164
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:37,330
Let me tell you. You will never be able to redeem yourself for what happened in the past.

165
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,710
Also,

166
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:46,940
let me remind you. Don't forget your status. You are only just a servant in the Jiang family.

167
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,130
You are being too extreme.

168
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,100
Return my bracelet to me.

169
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,010
What are you doing?

170
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:08,950
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

171
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,820
Is this that important to you?

172
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,670
Use the medicine. It will help in the healing,

173
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,700
otherwise you could get an infection.

174
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,340
- I'm leaving first.
- Thank you, Doctor.

175
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,730
Thank you, Doctor.

176
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,030
The bracelet representing Zhou Shao Tian's heart has not disappeared.

177
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:32,700
Did you overhear my conversation with Fei Fei?

178
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,990
How much did you hear?

179
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,060
Is that something you were afraid that I would overhear?

180
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,790
It's all because of this?

181
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,860
Was it worth it?

182
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,800
Come in.

183
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,750
Brother. You wanted to see me?

184
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,980
What you just said to Wu Cai Hong, was it all true?

185
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,540
Which part?

186
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,480
Everything.

187
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,120
I don't know what you mean.

188
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,400
Fei Fei.

189
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,110
In this house, living as two siblings...

190
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,460
I'm asking you.

191
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:15,390
It was clearly Wu Cai Yun who accidentally pushed Mom down the stairs.

192
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:21,140
Why did you say that Wu Cai Hong did it? Also, you were in the wrong first.

193
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,770
Why did you say that they intentionally pushed Mom down the stairs?

194
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,690
Is there any difference whether it was Wu Cai Hong or Wu Cai Yun who pushed Mom down the stairs?

195
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,490
They are both daughters of father's killer.

196
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,120
Of course, there is.

197
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,320
How could you frame her?

198
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,930
Because I hate Wu Cai Hong.

199
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,750
I hate how you protect her.

200
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,930
I hate how you are so careful about her.

201
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,940
Nonsense.

202
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:53,010
Fei Fei. When did you change?

203
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:58,200
Last time, you use a lipstick to frame Cai Yun, I already stated that I didn't like you acting like that.

204
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,530
I don't want my sister to do unethical things.

205
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,750
Where did that kind girl go to?

206
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,920
But brother, don't forget.

207
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,990
They are the daughters of the killer of our father.

208
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,670
So what?

209
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,250
We still need to be upright.

210
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:24,330
If we undertake unethical tactics for revenge, what's the difference between them and us?

211
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,760
<i>I'm afraid that Jiang Yu overheard my conversation with Fei Fei.</i>

212
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,850
<i>He surely knows now that it was Wu Cai Yun who pushed his mom down the stairs.</i>

213
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:40,440
<i>What if he finds Cai Yun and give her trouble?</i>

214
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:47,510
When I used the lipstick to frame Wu Cai Yun, why did you tell Wu Cai Hong that you instigated it?

215
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,390
Because you are my sister.

216
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:56,180
When you do something wrong, of course, I have to be responsible for you.

217
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,610
Fei Fei, tell me the truth. What exactly happened at the hospital the other day?

218
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,900
Let me tell you then.

219
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,000
You bumped into Wu Cai Yun at the hospital that day.

220
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,480
You both argued because of the lipstick. In the end, you took action.

221
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,530
Mom came forward to mediate and in the chaos,

222
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,500
Wu Cai Yun accidentally pushed Mom down the stairs. That's what happened.

223
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,550
Fei Fei.

224
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,550
Why didn't you tell me the truth earlier?

225
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,650
Because Mom was injured

226
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,910
and I couldn't accept it.

227
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,130
I feared you would blame me.

228
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,680
To add further,

229
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,120
Wu Cai Hong was the one who took the fall for her sister.

230
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,760
<i>So, I blamed him wrongly for the issue regarding the lipstick.</i>

231
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,010
I want to be alone.

232
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,430
<i>What should I do?</i>

233
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,010
<i>Should I tell him or not?</i>

234
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,750
Come in.

235
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,560
What is it?

236
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,840
You heard my conversation with Fei Fei just now?

237
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,340
So what if I heard it?

238
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,440
Cai Yun is still young. Thus, the mistake that she committed,

239
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,190
I hope that you will allow me to be responsible for her.

240
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,160
How are you going to do it?

241
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,140
We didn't intentionally push Madam Jiang down the stairs.

242
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,790
Thus, I'm willing to do anything for Madam Jiang.

243
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:07,860
I heard what you just said to Fei Fei.

244
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,270
I made a mistake about you regarding the incident about the lipstick.

245
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,330
It wasn't you who instigated Fei Fei to frame Cai Yun.

246
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:23,530
But even if I made a mistake about you, why did you protect your sister?

247
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,700
She is my sister. If she does something wrong, of course, I have to be responsible for her.

248
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,940
Since you can do this, why can't I?

249
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,530
In the past, Fei Fei wasn't like this.

250
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:48,620
In the past, she was very innocent and naive.

251
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:55,340
It's my fault. I didn't have the time to watch her grow up.

252
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:01,430
Ever since my father passed away, Fei Fei and my mom have been with me.

253
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,220
Thus, my mom and Fei Fei

254
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,980
need my protection for life.

255
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,350
I understand.

256
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,710
My stepmom and Cai Yun also need my protection.

257
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:31,090
♫<i> Gently, I gently tried to inquire </i>♫

258
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:37,320
♫<i> but did not ask you whether I was your fated love. </i>♫

259
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,720
♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

260
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:50,870
♫<i> In the end I did not get your heart. </i>♫

261
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,990
♫<i> I'm not willing to give up (the love), but I can't have it either. </i>♫

262
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:05,400
♫<i> I fight a bitter battle between advancing and retreating. </i>♫

263
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,710
♫<i> I didn't see through to your eyes or heart </i>♫

264
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:18,990
♫<i> but I've already fallen in love with your tenderness. </i>♫

265
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,170
<i>Let me go.</i>

266
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,100
<i>Don't!</i>

267
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,460
Miss.

268
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,330
Do you know me? Why do you keep following me?

269
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,470
Who are you? Why did you come here?

270
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,510
I was asked to go to the warehouse to bring this colored silk.

271
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:47,230
Miss. What gives you the right to question me?

272
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:52,030
I personally saw your hand

273
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,560
being cut off. You were also bleeding profusely.

274
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,720
It was this hand.

275
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,960
Miss. You are referring to this?

276
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,990
That was only just an act.

277
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,340
The hand was false and the blood was pig's blood.

278
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,820
You are fortunate that you are an employee of the Jiang family.

279
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,560
Why would Mr Jiang do something like this? Who do you take him for?

280
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,080
Looks like you know Mr Jiang very well.

281
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,030
Of course, I understand him. He is a good man. In the past, my name was Hua Zi.

282
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:26,040
I almost died in the streets. Mr Jiang saw me, fed me and even took me in.

283
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,260
He even gave me a job.

284
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,700
So that's to say, since he helped you, you helped him to do things that are against nature.

285
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,800
How could you say that about Mr Jiang? I have been with him for ten years.

286
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,820
I have never seen him do any harmful deeds.

287
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,320
- Really?
- Of course.

288
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,950
Miss. You are really strange.

289
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:53,010
<i>Could it be that Jiang Yu is not that bad as I think. Did I make a mistake about him?</i>

290
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:59,990
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

291
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,450
Wu Long. You are here?

292
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,120
Seriously.

293
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,570
When I saw you in Jiang Yu's room yesterday, I didn't have time to talk to you.

294
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,650
How did you become so heavy? Looks like Jiang Yu has been treating you well.

295
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,380
Wu Cai Hong.

296
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,050
Young Master Jiang wants to see you.

297
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,490
Why is he looking for me?

298
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,310
I don't know. Go there and you will find out.

299
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:35,120
Take a look. See which bracelet looks like yours.

300
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,720
Go ahead.

301
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,240
Take a look to see which threads you need for the bracelet.

302
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,100
Take a look.

303
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,450
Each colour is different.

304
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,640
Brother Shao Tian personally dyed the colours for this bracelet.

305
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,890
He also personally weaved it for me.

306
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,290
To me, it's second to none.

307
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:18,420
But thank you for taking trouble over this.

308
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,040
It was Fei Fei's fault. As her brother,

309
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,940
I should help her to redeem herself.

310
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,410
By the way, I just saw that person.

311
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,930
Who?

312
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,230
The man who had his hand cut off.

313
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,120
Why did you put on a show for Brother Shao Tian? Why did you do that?

314
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,670
I was forced to. <i>(had no choice.)</i>

315
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,620
I'm an innocent person who you accused of killing your father.

316
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,340
Of course, I want to find out the truth.

317
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,020
You are really not my father's killer?

318
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:02,850
If I'm really the killer, the fountain pen is such an important piece of evidence, would I leave it at home?

319
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,020
Furthermore, it was that easy for you to find it.

320
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:12,000
Why were you at the scene when something happened to my father then?

321
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,650
I definitely went to see your father that day. I went there to settle scores with him.

322
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:25,400
I told him that I started the process of acquiring Ling Long.

323
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,670
You have always wanted to defeat Ling Long.

324
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,090
Yes but

325
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,020
I used legal methods to fight. I have never used any underhanded tactics.

326
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:44,270
Tell me honestly then. The money that was stolen from Ling Long,

327
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,870
Old Cai and you really didn't do it?

328
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:55,880
I'm very sure that the money is in Zhou Shao Tian's hands. Why do you

329
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,720
think I pursued him?

330
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,410
I only wanted to force out the origin of the money and also to clear my name.

331
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,910
It will also show you clearly the person next to you

332
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,470
and the kind of person he is.

333
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,590
Jiang Yu. I can believe that

334
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,050
you didn't kill my father

335
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,440
but you can't suspect Shao Tian.

336
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,480
He wouldn't do that.

337
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,040
I know that you won't believe what I'm saying now

338
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,270
but I will show you the evidence in future.

339
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,120
Come with me to a place now.

340
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,320
- Where are we going?
- You will know once we are there.

341
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,010
I just don't believe that I will lose to Zhou Shao Tian.

342
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:06,020
See if there is anything you like. Just choose any one.

343
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,870
If you don't find anything to your liking here,

344
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,970
just tell me and I will personally dye it for you. There won't be a problem.

345
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,980
The colour is quite similar

346
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,000
but it's a bit off.

347
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:53,430
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

348
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,040
I finally found it.

349
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,050
You found it?

350
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,920
Over there.

351
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,440
I will do it myself.

352
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,200
Look at the condition of your hand. How are you going to do it?

353
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,950
I will help you to hold it then.

354
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,480
Pull this.

355
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,470
Show me your bracelet.

356
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,730
So, it's a seven coloured rainbow. <i>(Cai Hong is Mandarin for rainbow)</i>

357
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:23,980
When Brother Shao Tian gave me this bracelet, he said that it suited my name.

358
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,740
This Zhou Shao Tian really knows how to humour girls.

359
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:40,610
Unfortunately for him, rainbows only come after the rain.

360
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,980
He is so shady. He will never be able to catch a rainbow in his lifetime.

361
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:51,250
It doesn't seem to be nice for you to be talking about him this way.

362
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:56,920
You shouldn't speak ill of others. It is not what a gentleman would do.

363
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:10,220
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

364
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,870
Here.

365
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:12,950
Then, I'm going back to work.

366
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,250
What are you doing?

367
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,990
You indecisive little guy. Now you push me aside.

368
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:46,390
But animals can't lie. He will be good to whoever is close to him.

369
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:50,970
Looks like you are treating my Wu Long nicely.

370
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:57,040
At least, he is better than you and he can differentiate between good and bad people.

371
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:03,340
So to say, are you saying that you are a good person?

372
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,020
At least, I dare to say that I didn't do anything unethical.

373
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,700
You can tell the truth then.

374
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,030
Right , Wu Long?

375
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,950
I'm going back to work.

376
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,760
<i>It's exactly like the previous one</i>

377
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,960
<i>but it's still not the original bracelet.</i>

378
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,350
Brother.

379
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,540
Fei Fei.

380
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,080
Where did you go? Looks like you are in a good mood today.

381
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,400
Is that so?

382
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,020
You are my brother. Of course, I can see your moods.

383
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:01,180
But brother, does your good mood have anything to do with Wu Cai Hong?

384
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,100
No.

385
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:09,700
Where did you take her to last night? You came back very late.

386
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,400
Aren't you a busybody?

387
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,020
Can't I even ask?

388
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,650
There is a new dye factory called Rong Da. They sent you the invitation.

389
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,870
The invitation arrived last night. Do you want to go?

390
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,980
We are in the same industry. Of course, we should go.

391
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,330
Okay, I know.

392
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,480
So how? Does it look nice?

393
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,610
Of course, you look good in this.

394
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,630
I'm asking you if the dress is nice.

395
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,970
You are beautiful and look good in anything.

396
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,190
I just knew it was useless asking you.

397
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,030
Miss. Why are you so happy today?

398
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,880
Because my brother and I are attending a launch ceremony today.

399
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,060
I can't embarrass him.

400
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:12,300
That is right. Don't give cheek and embarrass him.

401
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,320
You know how to flatter.

402
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,560
But you used to attend such events with Young Master in the past.

403
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,030
Why are you so anxious today?

404
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:31,060
<i>That's right. I keep thinking that person standing next to my brother</i>

405
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,900
<i>is definitely going to be me.</i>

406
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,390
<i>When did I start to feel so anxious?</i>
