The Cage of Love

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,770
<i>Episode 15</i>

20
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,550
Change into this and go out with me for a while.

21
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,910
I need to give Madam Jiang some porridge.

22
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,290
Just let your subordinate do it.

23
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,000
Aren't I one?

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,990
Are you arguing with me?

25
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,080
Then are you looking at me as a privileged lady?

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,990
Do you want me to personally help you change your clothes?

27
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,860
Where are we going?

28
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,870
To a business opening ceremony.

29
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,950
- What if Madam Jiang looks for me? <br>- It will be very fast.

30
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,780
We will be back in the afternoon.

31
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,810
Miss. You look beautiful today.

32
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,000
When Young Master see's you, he will be very surprised.

33
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,290
Let's go.

34
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,750
What's wrong?

35
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,410
You look okay.

36
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,720
Let's go.

37
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,110
Miss. Don't be anxious. Young Master will definitely wait for you.

38
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,620
Get in the carriage.

39
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,780
Get in.

40
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,770
I will get in on my own.

41
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,110
Let's go.

42
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,190
Brother!

43
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,350
Brother!

44
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,360
Miss, your earrings.

45
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,250
Mind your own business.

46
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,790
Miss.

47
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,780
<br>

48
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,000
<i>Congratulations. This way, please.</i>

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,580
<i>This way.</i>

50
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,310
<i>Let's go.</i>

51
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,140
<i>- You are here too. <br>- Yes, let's go in together.</i>

52
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,120
Please go inside.

53
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,940
This way, please.

54
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,390
This way, please.

55
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,050
Miss. Please show your invitation.

56
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,210
-Invitation? <br> -Here.

57
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,790
She is with me.

58
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,730
Okay, please go in.

59
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,550
Thanks.

60
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,880
I don't understand the business here.

61
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,220
Why did you bring me here?

62
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,070
Didn't your father take you to such events?

63
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,930
He said that it was not suitable for women to attend this.

64
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,480
In the business field, everyone was two-faced to our family.

65
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,710
Brother Shao Tian was the one interested in these affairs.

66
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,630
My father hoped that he could hand over the business to Brother Shao Tian one day.

67
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,570
If your dad is watching over you, he would definitely be fuming with anger.

68
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,360
I don't like the way you talk about Brother Shao Tian.

69
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,720
Boss Jiang.

70
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,570
-You came. <br>-Li Ting Zhang, you also came.

71
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,280
Who is the host today that was

72
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,510
able to invite Li Ting Zhang to come is an amazing feat.

73
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,830
Thank you. Look over there. Welcome.

74
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,140
Lu Man.

75
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,840
He wants to establish a dye factory too?

76
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,190
Yes, with that woman by his side.

77
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,810
A woman boss?

78
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,600
Buddy Jiang. Don't under estimate that woman.

79
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,200
After I received the message, she conducted an investigation.

80
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,460
She wanted to find out the origin of things.

81
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,250
Thanks.

82
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,030
She is his lover.

83
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,970
He gets information straight out of doing business in the textile industry. Business is good.

84
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,850
Huzhou dominates.

85
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,810
Since she has brought her business to Huzhou,

86
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,310
it seems others have become victims of her business.

87
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,420
You have met your rival.

88
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,010
If she is here to do honourable business, I will welcome her any time

89
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,690
but even if it's not so, don't worry.

90
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,670
With you here, who would she dare to do anything illegal in Huzhou?

91
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,750
You do not need to flatter me.

92
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,260
We are now starting.

93
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:56,000
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

94
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,660
Dear friends, people in the same industry and guests.

95
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,890
Today is the day that Rong Da starts operation.

96
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,690
I really appreciate everyone visiting today.

97
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,510
I am Lu Man who is just an ordinary girl.

98
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,500
For being able to open a dyeing factory in Huzhou,

99
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,570
I'm really grateful to a friend of mine.

100
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,350
After having this friend, I can lead a life of leisure.

101
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,270
I can now have tea at home, watch movies, go shopping and buy clothes.

102
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,030
Rong Da can earn me money while I am sitting at home.

103
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,880
The business dealings of Rong Da,

104
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,710
I let this friend of mine handle everything.

105
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,240
I would like to invite my secret friend up here now.

106
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,200
He is also our Manager at Rong Da. Please come up.

107
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,660
Welcome.

108
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,850
Today is the day Rong Da starts operating.

109
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,800
Rong Da is also now an important part of the Huzhou community.

110
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,180
We are glad you are gathered here for this ground breaking day.

111
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,310
It has special significance for you to be here.

112
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,540
I would like to share my happy event with everyone.

113
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,560
Thank you, everyone.

114
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,150
What's going on?

115
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:55,280
Looks like the missing money at Ling Long will show up soon.

116
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,310
I'm announcing the start of the ball now.

117
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,880
Excellent.

118
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,810
Let's dance.

119
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,430
Cai Hong. May I have this dance?

120
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,270
I think, at such an event today,

121
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,760
Mr Jiang won't be rude.

122
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,660
Don't be anxious.

123
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,390
How can she dance when she's holding a wine glass?

124
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,810
Go now.

125
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,650
Brother Shao Tian. What's going on?

126
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,080
Cai Hong. Don't be in disbelief.

127
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,060
What you are seeing is the truth.

128
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,570
Everything that I have done was to wait for such an opportunity

129
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,270
for the day when I can stand on equal terms with you

130
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,710
and dance with you.

131
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,160
Brother Shao Tian. What are you talking about?

132
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,320
We have always been on equal terms.

133
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,390
It's not the same. That was in the past and it's now.

134
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,860
It's who I am today that is worthy of you.

135
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,440
You have always been the same in my heart.

136
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,220
Thus,

137
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,470
I love you.

138
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,350
Cai Hong. Everything that I have done,

139
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,490
it's really all for you.

140
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,150
You want to dance, right? Let me dance with you.

141
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,620
Think I'm afraid of you?

142
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,230
You finally couldn't stop yourself. The money that you stole from Ling Long

143
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,830
you used it.

144
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,070
Didn't you hear that my boss is Miss Lu?

145
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,680
I'm the General Manager.

146
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,030
Even with this attitude, you say that you are not the boss.

147
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,190
Technically you are correct. Ms. Lu gifted me 3% percent of the shares.

148
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,760
Is there such a good thing on earth?

149
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,700
Who doesn't know that I helped Ling Long to make profits.

150
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,840
If not, Wu Hong Da wouldn't let me marry Cai Hong.

151
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,720
Do you think I'm her?

152
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,180
What's going on?

153
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,700
Wu Cai Hong. Let's go home.

154
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,660
When you were dancing with Brother Shao Tian, what were you both talking about?

155
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,760
What else could we be talking about? He has already switched sides.

156
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,550
Cai Hong.

157
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,000
Let me introduce you to the next ruling manager.

158
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,110
This is Miss Lu. She's also the boss of Rong Da.

159
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,310
This is my girlfriend, Wu Cai Hong.

160
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,770
Miss Wu. We have met in the past.

161
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,180
<i>Hello, Miss Wu. My name is Lu Man.</i>

162
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,340
<i>How did you know my family name?</i>

163
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,910
<i>You are now managing Ling Long, Miss Wu Cai Hong.</i>

164
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,950
<i>I'm your loyal client of Ling Long.</i>

165
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,980
Frankly. I have always wanted to establish a dye factory in Huzhou.

166
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,970
I just was never able to find a manager.

167
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,010
I heard that Mr. Zhou Shao Tian was your father's favorite.

168
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,770
It wasn't easy for me to get him to help me.

169
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,310
Thank you Ms. Lu for appreciating his talents.

170
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,760
Miss Wu. Don't say that. Without Mr Zhou

171
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,170
I wouldn't have been able to establish Rong Da.

172
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,080
Set your mind at ease. Because he shared his knowledge,

173
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,520
I'm giving him 3% of the shares.

174
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,230
Frankly, you don't need to tell me this. I don't really understand this business.

175
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,990
Miss Wu. You don't need to understand.

176
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,360
Rong Da has Miss Lu's capability and with my support,

177
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,780
it has Mr. Zhou's supervision

178
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,400
Let's work together to make it great.

179
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,430
Cai Hong.

180
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,950
Do you still have some other matters? I'm going to take your girlfriend

181
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,510
back to my home to look after my mother.

182
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,220
Cai Hong. I won't let you stay in the Jiang home for too long.

183
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,650
I will pick you up very soon.

184
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,550
The contract is signed for three years.

185
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,790
Do you understand what that means?

186
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,460
Close presence will have a real effect.

187
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,050
The contract that you signed with Miss Lu,

188
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,370
is bi-monthly. It is not the same type of contract.

189
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,500
Cai Hong.

190
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,960
You know that I am honest and open.

191
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,610
This is my contract with Miss Lu.

192
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,310
I will leave this with you.

193
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,090
I trust you. You don't need to do this.

194
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,170
Take this.

195
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,660
Trust me.

196
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,910
Do not listen to this villain's instigation.

197
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,800
Let's go.

198
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,620
Brother.

199
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,850
The opening ceremony...

200
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,350
why did you bring Wu Cai Hong there instead of me?

201
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,040
In the past, I blamed Wu Cai Hong wrongly.

202
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,190
I just wanted her to take a break from it.

203
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,970
It's not that simple as this, right?

204
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,160
I think you have been seduced by her.

205
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,750
Fei Fei. You are becoming more disrespectful.

206
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,960
It is not ladylike to say these things.

207
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,230
I originally was not a well-cultivated daughter of a rich family.

208
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,820
Now that a well-cultivated daughter of a rich family came

209
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,900
you are starting to complain about me, right?

210
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,340
But Brother, don't forget. It was her who caused the death of our father.

211
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,050
Even though you see her as delicate and ladylike.

212
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,160
Do you know the owner of Rong Da?

213
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,200
I'm not concerned about this.

214
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,270
Zhou Shao Tian is their General Manager.

215
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,730
There is definitely some problem with this. Investigate this for me.

216
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,400
Don't change the topic.

217
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,830
Today was the opening ceremony

218
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,050
and you brought Wu Cai Hong there.

219
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,370
You let her be by your side.

220
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,500
Do you know what this means? I think this is a major problem.

221
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,950
I have discussed this problem with you at length and I do not wish to speak about it anymore.

222
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,310
Brother. So that, you won't continue with this,

223
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,040
I will tell your mom about Wu Cai Hong's identity.

224
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,970
Stop there.

225
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,760
Mom's health just improved. You shouldn't provoke her.

226
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,460
Mom.

227
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,070
What's wrong?

228
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:50,670
Do you know who Wu Cai Hong is?

229
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:55,250
She is Cai Hong. Who else could she be?

230
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,900
I just fell and was unconscious for a few days.

231
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,610
Do you think I became foolish from sleeping too much?

232
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,980
- Mom. Frankly, Wu Cai Hong is... <br>- Fei Fei.

233
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,440
Mom.

234
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,940
What's wrong with the both of you?

235
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,490
Fei Fei. You talked about Cai Hong just now. What's wrong with her?

236
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,820
She wanted to ask you about your fall at the hospital.

237
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,930
I was afraid that you wouldn't be happy, thus, I stopped her from asking you.

238
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,810
Don't talk about this again.

239
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,570
You were at fault at the hospital that day too.

240
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,780
Even more so, Cai Hong took care of me for many days.

241
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,720
When I was conscious, she apologized on her sister's behalf.

242
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,730
Fei Fei. Let bygones be bygones.

243
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,630
I get it. I will listen to Brother.

244
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:08,020

00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,060
What are you doing?

259
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,690
I prepared some fruits for Madam. She didn't have an appetite.

260
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,620
Have some.

261
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,800
Okay.

262
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,670
What are you still doing here? Go back to work.

263
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,840
You eat fast, you should slow down.

264
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,370
Young Master. Mr Shao Tian is outside asking to see you.

265
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,580
- I'm not seeing him. <br>- Mr Shao Tian is not here alone.

266
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,340
He brought a lot of people and two crates. It's like a parade.

267
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,640
Let him in.

268
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,100
Cai Hong. That man is here again.

269
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,930
But he looks different this time.

270
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,900
- Who are you referring to? <br>- It's that guy who was drunk that day and created a ruckus.

271
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,250
Subsequently, Miss got him beaten up.

272
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,500
Brother Shao Tian?

273
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,620
I really don't know what his name is

274
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,890
but this time, he's dressed a lot better.

275
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:37,030
They went into the yard looking important.

276
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,430
Miss.

277
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,120
What are you doing here?

278
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,870
I'm here to pay the debt.

279
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,890
A few days ago, my girlfriend ran into some difficulties.

280
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,800
You helped her to pay her debt.

281
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,390
I now can repay it even specifically two fold.

282
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,500
Hopefully Boss Jiang will have mercy

283
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,930
and let my girlfriend leave.

284
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,800
I'm not that great as you said.

285
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,630
Wu Cai Hong and I, one was the willing seller and the other was the willing buyer.

286
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,610
It was a mutual agreement.

287
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,590
Boss Jiang, let's not exchange words lightl

288
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:45,440
I'm here today to take Cai Hong away. Money is not the issue.

289
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,950
Name double, triple, or five times the price.

290
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,420
I'm not accepting the offer. We don't lack any money. Who cares how much money you have.

291
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,550
I have only two words. Not selling.

292
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,400
You have enough maids here.

293
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,880
Why are you insisting on not letting Wu Cai Hong go?

294
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,830
The debt is repayed.

295
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,000
It will be easier and more convenient for all of you.

296
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,660
Yes, you are right. Wu Cai Hong is my family's maid.

297
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,470
If I want her to stay, I will let her stay,

298
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,360
It's up to me when I will kick her out.

299
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,470
Can you control this?

300
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,900
You do not like drafts.

301
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,190
I did not know that real money was this important to Boss Jiang.

302
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,340
I brought this here with sincerity.

303
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,550
I hope that you will accept this.

304
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,820
Why didn't you bring me this money earlier?

305
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,340
You are here only just now?

306
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,030
You are too late. Let me repeat myself.

307
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,100
I'm not a good person except that I'm rich.

308
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,600
Take your valuables and

309
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,970
be good and get out of here now.

310
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,050
Don't let your mother worry about you. Be good.

311
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:16,320
This is not the first time I stepped through your main entrance.

312
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,040
I'm here today to take Wu Cai Hong with me.

313
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,110
I spoke nicely to you but you don't want to listen.

314
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,560
Do not eat anything and live as a monk.

315
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,010
Are you threatening me?

316
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,280
Did you think that by saying a few cruel words, I would be scared of you?

317
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,510
Aren't you going out now? Do you want to see the both of them

318
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,720
fight because of you?

319
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,270
Go and leave with your man to a far place and don't rely on this house for help.

320
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,370
Go now.

321
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,750
Cai Hong.

322
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,440
Are you okay?

323
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,250
Are you okay?

324
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,070
I'm fine.

325
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,030
Trying to snatch her away?

326
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,120
What right do you have?

327
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,550
Are you okay?

328
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,230
I'm fine, Brother Shao Tian.

329
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,520
They are only here to carry the chests.

330
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,130
If you want to fight, let's meet on the outside of Warlord Lu's garrison.

331
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,910
I can always invite them in.

332
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,550
Huzhou has many things to buy and sell,

333
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,960
we should leave it to the police to handle this.

334
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,540
I personally do not want to call Department Director Li Li.

335
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,730
Fine.

336
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,880
Brother Shao Tian, Frankly,

337
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,410
I'm doing well here. It's not what you think.

338
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,950
Cai Hong, don't be foolish. You are like a lamb entering the door of a tiger. Don't you know this?

339
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,710
Don't let this family fool you.

340
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:49,590
It doesn't matter. He and I signed an agreement.

341
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,130
I volunteered my fingerprints. <br><i>signed with my own will. </i>

342
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,090
I really don't want to cause any trouble. Please help me this time.

343
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,260
Brother Shao Tian.

344
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,980
Can you guarantee that you will be safe here?

345
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,970
Okay, I will listen to you. I will go back first today

346
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,730
but I will definitely take you out from here.

347
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,010
Fei Fei, come out.

348
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,430
Send the guest off.

349
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,610
Mr Zhou, let's go.

350
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,150
Take care.

351
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,030
Mr Zhou, please take care.

352
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,130
Even though you have prospered

353
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,570
if you want to take away a member of the Jiang family,

354
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,530
it doesn't seem to be that easy.

355
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Miss Fang. Earlier you said you were a member of the Jiang family.

356
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,090
Earlier this may have been true. However,

357
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,470
unless you marry Jiang Yu and become his wife,

358
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,390
why don't you tell the members of the Jiang family that you will forever be an outsider?

359
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,430
You are someone who can't even take away his girlfriend.

360
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:18,240
What right do you have to say this about me?

361
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,570
Yes. It's because I couldn't do this

362
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,550
that I need your help.

363
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,080
Why should I help you?

364
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,980
Because you will be helping yourself by helping me. We will both get our benefits.

365
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,220
What a joke. You are my brother's enemy.

366
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,790
If I help you, I will be betraying my brother.

367
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,970
Frankly, you have already helped me many times.

368
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,620
Every time when I couldn't find Cai Hong, you were the one who told me her whereabouts.

369
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,480
I know that there is only one reason.

370
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,760
It's because you don't want Jiang Yu and Cai Hong to be alone together.

371
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,770
Now that Cai Hong is already staying at the Jiang's home,

372
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:57,200
if you don't want to have any regrets, you should help me.

373
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:03,940
Then, what can I help you with this time?

374
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:13,400
The contract to let Cai Hong go, get it for me.

375
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,590
Impossible. I can't help you with this.

376
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,790
You can do it

377
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,900
unless you want Cai Hong to be the lady of the house.

378
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,510
When that time comes, I'm afraid that you will regret it.

379
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,850
Think carefully over what I said.

380
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,920
I believe you will help me.

381
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,550
What makes you so sure?

382
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:41,090
Because what I want is Wu Cai Hong. As for you,

383
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,720
what you want is Jiang Yu.

384
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Are you angry that I didn't agree to Shao Tiao terms of exchange?

385
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,890
If not, you would have been free.

386
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,080
The contract I voluntarily signed.

387
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,870
I will take the consequences.

388
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,640
I won't be angry with you.

389
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,430
It's good that you think this way.

390
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,100
He suddenly brought so much money to buy you.

391
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,250
Don't you find it strange?

392
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:45,940
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

393
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,580
Brother.

394
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,290
Brother. Why didn't you allow Shao Tian

395
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,710
to take away Wu Cai Hong? His asking price was very high.

396
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,230
Do we lack money?

397
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,430
We do not lack money. You don't lack bristles. <i>supplies</i>

398
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:24,210
I just don't want him to take her away. Is there a problem?

399
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,190
Brother. Because of Wu Cai Hong,

400
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,560
are you not afraid of offending Warlord Lu?

401
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,680
I didn't do anything wrong. What should I be afraid of?

402
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,530
As you run this business, we want to run it harmoniously.

403
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,220
Even if you didn't do anything wrong, you can just randomly offend anyone.

404
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,810
Your play thing might offend Warlord Lu.

405
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,190
Is it worth it because of Wu Cai Hong?

406
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,270
Don't be afraid. I have my own methods.

407
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,660
I know that you have your own methods

408
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,470
but this is not your usual style of doing things.

409
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,810
In any case, you don't need to worry.

410
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,450
<i>Our family doesn't lack any money. Who cares how much money you have.</i>

411
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,570
<i>I only have two words. Not selling.</i>

412
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,070
<i>Yes, you are right. Wu Cai Hong is my family's maid.</i>

413
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,700
<i>It's up to me whether she stays or I kick her out.</i>

414
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,910
<i>Can you control when I will kick her out?</i>

415
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,260
<i>Brother Shao Tian.</i>

416
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,400
<i>I'm doing well at the Jiang's home. Don't worry about me.</i>

417
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,800
- Brother. <br>- Ah Li. You are here just in time.

418
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,670
About Jiang Yu's father, Jiang Wen Yuan's case,

419
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:54,600
I found some of their staff during that year and asked them about this.

420
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,740
Jiang Wen Yuan collaborated with foreigners privately selling them opium.

421
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,540
After the incident, Jiang Wen Yuan died in fear of punishment.

422
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,740
Some people said that Jiang Wen Yuan was a kind man. He could have been framed.

423
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,030
And that year, the person in charge of investigating Jiang Wen Yuan's case was Wu Hong Da.

424
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,950
When Jiang Wen Yuan died, Wu Hong Da took over Ling Long.

425
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,820
Was Jiang Wen Yuan framed then?

426
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,040
Also, he and Wu Hong Da,

427
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,230
what was their relationship?

428
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:25,740
About this, the old staff of Ling Long are not very clear about this.

429
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,150
But I have asked several people. They said that Jiang Wen Yuan was a good man.

430
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,240
The older employees were consulted.

431
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,390
What do they know?

432
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,190
What we need most now

433
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,700
is to confirm the evidence.

434
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,000
I will continue to investigate thoroughly.

435
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,690
Only it has been a long time.

436
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,200
You have a wide range of experience being in the middle.

437
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,970
After all the experience ranges from the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of the Regime.

438
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,260
Finding it will be very difficult. We need time.

439
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,460
Ah Li. Send more help

440
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,260
and investigate this as soon as possible. This is very important.

441
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,710
I know. I will do it fast.

442
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,540
I'm leaving first.

443
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,960
Uncle Lai.

444
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,410
That man just now is Zhou Shao Tian's confidant.

445
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:54,150
Zhou Shao Tian seems to be investigating something.

446
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,250
Find someone to follow him and investigate this.

447
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,570
What is their close relationship?

448
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,520
By the way, keep a low profile.

449
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,310
Don't stir up anything.

450
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,990
Mr. Zhou. You have already looked at the house.

451
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,090
Other than the price being a bit expensive, there is nothing to be picky about.

452
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,300
But then again, the price is high.

453
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,000
There is a reason for it being expensive. Don't you think so?

454
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,040
You don't have to tell me about the benefits of this mansion.

455
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,920
I know this better than you.

456
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,920
You are right. I should never question the Master.

457
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,380
Of course, you are very familiar with this house but talking about this,

458
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,670
this Old Wu, not only does he look at the house and the person,

459
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,380
I heard he looks at the potential.

460
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,400
From the get-go Master Wu saw your potential.

461
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,500
Mr Zhou. You prospered on your own ability, right?

462
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,370
To add further, not everyone could afford to buy this mansion.

463
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,750
Since Mr. Zhou has money on his hands, you don't necessarily have to buy this house.

464
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,660
There are other mansions designed in Huzhou to do business.

465
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,140
If you are not happy, I will show you others. So how?

466
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:23,740
I want to reserve this.

467
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,580
Make an appointment with the owner now to discuss the price.

468
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,220
Mr. Zhou is a frank person. The price,

469
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,350
I already discussed with the existing owner of the house.

470
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,170
It's $1 million.

471
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:41,330
This price seems to be higher than the market rate.

472
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,130
But don't go to the trouble anymore.

473
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,890
Who told me to like this?

474
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,300
Mr Zhou. You are right. It's hard for this house to meet someone who likes it.

475
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,300
If you like it, then you should snatch it first. If not, someone else will take it.

476
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,470
To add further, everyone in Huzhou knows that

477
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,970
you have prospered. Don't even talk about this house.

478
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,700
You have the final say in the company, Rong Da.

479
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,540
Old Zhang. You don't need to flatter me. Let's do it fast.

480
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,940
Make an appointment with the owner of the house tomorrow.

481
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,140
Don't worry, I will do a good job.

482
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,230
Brother.

483
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,960
What's wrong? What's the matter?

484
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,930
Nothing. Can't I see you without any reason?

485
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,490
Okay, I have something to tell you.

486
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,110
Speak.

487
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,040
With Rong Da, you don't let me pay attention to Zhou Shao Tian anymore.

488
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,940
I didn't investigate the others yet but recently,

489
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,190
he planned to buy the Wu family's house. The deal is almost done.

490
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,390
Looks like this Zhou Shao Tian

491
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,780
really has deep feelings for Wu Cai Hong.

492
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,450
If not, he wouldn't use the money

493
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,450
to buy her previous house.

494
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,780
I think Wu Cai Hong also

495
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,890
has deep feelings for Shao Tian,

496
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,850
to become his wife.

497
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,900
This infatuation of love is in the wrong place when it comes to local business dealings.

498
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,390
Tell Wu Cai Hong to leave with me in an hour's time.

499
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,490
Where are you taking her? I want to go too.

500
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:24,150
Stay at home.

501
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,440
Where are you taking me again?

502
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,610
Don't ask anything. You will know later.

503
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:42,170
Come with me.

504
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:54,370
<i>Wu Cai Hong. What Shao Tian said is right.</i>

505
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,700
<i>I will kick you out from the Jiang home as soon as possible.</i>

506
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,700
Mr. Jiang.

507
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,960
Director Chen Suo.

508
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,800
Minister Lee explained everything to me.

509
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,620
It has been hard on you.

510
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,120
Where are we going?

511
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:19,040
I don't know what the schedule is for today either. I believe Mr Jiang has already made the arrangements.

512
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,580
Let's go.

513
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,820
- Mr Jiang, hello. <br>- Boss Qian, hello.

514
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,780
What brings you here today? Is there anything you need, your wish is my command.

515
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,770
Please don't ever say this.

516
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,340
Director Chen Suo, you came with Boss Jiang.

517
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,410
What's the matter?

518
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:46,000
Since you have such a good relationship with Mr Jiang, I won't say much.

519
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,310
Mr Jiang, please.

520
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,960
Boss Qian, I would like to ask you.

521
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,370
Did Zhou Shao Tian borrow any money from you lately?

522
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,960
In the past, he borrowed $200,000 from me.

523
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,280
He only returned the money after a long period of time.

524
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,380
I dare not lend him any money again.

525
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,140
Thus, he has already returned fully what he has borrowed in the past?

526
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,260
Yes. Zhou Shao Tian could have prospered lately

527
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,850
after he became the General Manager of Rong Da.
