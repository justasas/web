00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,440
The Cage of Love

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,620
<i>Episode 4 </i>

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,800
Today, the new boss is coming.

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,800
-Yes. I even heard that the new boss is handsome<br>-Really?

5
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>Come, help us to put them in.</i>

6
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,300
<i>Rinse them well, all right?</i>

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,700
Miss Wu.

8
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,500
Miss Wu.

9
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,500
Master.

10
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,000
Take care.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,400
Boss Jiang.

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,500
Boss is here.

13
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,600
- It's the new boss. <br>- Hello, Boss.

14
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
It has been hard on everyone. Go back to work.

15
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,400
Okay, let's go.

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,600
Quick.

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,100
Over here.

18
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,200
Over here.

19
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,200
Come in.

20
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,000
Boss Jiang.

21
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,200
This dress suits you very well.

22
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,500
As a worker, you should look like one.

23
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,100
I'm a secretary,

24
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,800
not a worker.

25
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,800
Aren't you?

26
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,100
Did you memorise the secretary's codes that I wanted you to do?

27
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,200
I have memorised them.

28
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,300
Recite them to me.

29
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,600
First.

30
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,100
The boss will only give the instructions once. His secretary needs to remember everything.

31
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,000
Second.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,800
During working hours the secretary is not allowed to slack off.

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,030
Third.

34
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,200
The secretary must be on twenty four hour call

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,400
and is not allowed any delays in the tasks given her.

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,200
Fourth

37
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,800
Boss orders are to be executed immediately, regardless whether they are right or wrong.

38
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,960
Fifth.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,800
Boss needs should be met with effort and fulfilled unconditionally.

40
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,790
They cannot be refused.

41
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Sixth.

42
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,500
If the secretary neglects any of the above rules, boss has the right to fire her.

43
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,400
Not bad. These rules,

44
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,900
not only must you remember them clearly,

45
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,400
even when you are asleep or dreaming, you must remember them.

46
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,500
If you don't follow them,

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,800
I will have you disappear from my sight immediately.

48
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,500
The second condition,

49
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,400
as a Secretary you have to stay close to me.

50
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,300
Never a step away.

51
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,800
Everyone should already know that

52
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Ling Long has gone through an exquisite merger.

53
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm your new boss.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,100
<i>New boss?</i>

55
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,600
Miss.

56
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,800
This...

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,900
Miss. This...

58
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,100
It's cold.

59
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Since everyone is already part of the staff,

60
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,000
I hope that everyone will be loyal to me.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
Staff is the most important.

62
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,400
Some people will have no doubts while others will doubt me.

63
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,830
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

64
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Are you trying to scald me to death?

65
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,400
<i>What is he doing?</i>

66
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,300
<i>He's being too extreme by doing this.</i>

67
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,100
<i>Miss. This...</i>

68
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,300
Does anyone have any objections?

69
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
If you do,

70
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,000
you can leave anytime. Don't force yourself.

71
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
I can give you two month's salary

72
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
as severance pay.

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,700
<i>This...</i>

74
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
It's still not hot enough.

75
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,200
Jiang Yu.

76
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,600
What are you trying to do?

77
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,400
It's either too hot or too cold? You have no intention of drinking it at all.

78
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
This...

79
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,830
I don't want to drink it. So what?

80
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,740
You are not happy?

81
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,000
If you are not happy, you can go home.

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Jiang Yu. You are being too extreme.

83
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,000
If you are not happy either, you also can scram and go home with her.

84
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,900
- Do you think I wouldn't dare to? <br>- Secretary Zhou, forget it.

85
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,500
Brother Shao Tian, don't be like this.

86
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,100
I hope we can cooperate in the future.

87
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,660
If the factory produces good results,

88
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,800
I will not treat you badly.

89
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,200
<i>Yes.</i>

90
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,300
Okay, go back to work. End of meeting.

91
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,800
<i>Go! Let's go!</i>

92
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Brother,

93
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,700
it looks like you won't have peace if Zhou Shao Tian is working in Ling Long.

94
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,890
Why don't you tell him to leave?

95
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,830
He is a long time staff.

96
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,500
I hope that with him around, he will stabilise the emotions of the rest of the staff.

97
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,400
But don't worry.

98
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,800
He will leave anyways.

99
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,100
Cai Hong.

100
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,700
Let's leave Ling Long together.

101
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,600
I know you would prefer to stay in your home.

102
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,200
No, I can't go.

103
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,100
If I leave now, it will affect my plan regarding Jiang Yu.

104
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,900
Maybe, the death of my father...

105
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,800
- I will never discuss the truth about my father's death. <br>- But if you continue to stay here,

106
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,700
you might not find evidence

107
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,000
and waste your time.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,400
I am fine with it.

109
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,000
Shao Tian, you don't need to worry about me.

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,900
As long as there is a glimmer of hope, I won't give up.

111
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,800
Cai Hong, I am sorry.

112
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,300
How can I blame you?

113
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,600
I chose it in this way.

114
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,800
Thus, no matter how Jiang Yu treats me,

115
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,000
I am fine with it.

116
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,800
Cai Hong.

117
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,600
As long as you stay in Ling Long,

118
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I will stay with you and protect you.

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,200
I think the secretary's post

120
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,800
is still not suitable for Miss Wu.

121
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,200
Why doesn't Miss Wu

122
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,500
decide herself to stay or leave.

123
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:50,940
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

124
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,400
I want to go to the bathroom.

125
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
I know.

126
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,600
The second condition of being your secretary

127
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,200
during working hours I must

128
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,300
never be a step away.

129
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,200
Take a look if you want to. Don't be shy.

130
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,200
Boss Wang from Suzhou is here.

131
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,800
For this afternoon, I reserved a private room, to give you privacy.

132
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Check the arrangements. I will go over in a while.

133
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,100
Alright.

134
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,100
Wu Cai Hong.

135
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,100
What are you doing here?

136
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,400
Who told you that you could enter <br> my brother's office without permission?

137
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,900
I am sorry, I will put the files in order as soon as possible.

138
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,800
There is no need to.

139
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,770
You are just a worker. I am the boss now.

140
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,190
Brother,

141
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,400
Cai Hong must have a problem adjusting.

142
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,200
Everything she had is gone.

143
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
Boss Jiang.

144
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
Wu Cai Hong.

145
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,600
My shoes are dirty. Clean them for me.

146
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,700
If you don't want to do it, you can leave.

147
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,200
<i>- Look. Isn't that Miss Wu? <br>- Yes, it's really her.</i>

148
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,400
<i>She was always so dignified. Now she is pitiful.</i>

149
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,700
<i>That's right. She's really pitiful.</i>

150
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,100
<i>Okay, don't say anymore.</i>

151
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,300
What are you doing? Boss Jiang.

152
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,880
If your shoes are dirty, I will clean them for you.

153
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,800
Between the both of you, who exactly is my secretary?

154
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,700
Look. She's really cleaning his shoes.

155
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,600
The cloth is already dirty. Shouldn't you change it?

156
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,200
Jiang Yu.

157
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Shao Tian.

158
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,900
I am fine.

159
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,400
I am okay.

160
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,900
There is no cloth?

161
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,300
You can use your own hand.

162
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,000
<i>She is using her hands?</i>

163
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,100
That's it.

164
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,700
What are you looking at? Go back to work.

165
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,300
<i>Go back to work.</i>

166
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,400
Come.

167
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,800
I am okay.

168
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,600
<i>Take care of this. Add the water.</i>

169
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,600
I never said your position was allowed <i>(to ride here.)</i>.

170
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
If in fifteen minutes

171
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,400
you are not in the Zuixian building,

172
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
you don't need to come to work tomorrow.

173
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,600
Let's go!

174
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Cai Hong,

175
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,600
Cai Hong. Cai Hong.

176
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,000
Shao Tian.

177
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,500
Let's go.

178
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,800
Sounds interesting.

179
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,100
Let's go!

180
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,900
<i>Watch out. Why are you riding a bicycle here?</i>

181
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,400
<i>Move aside.</i>

182
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,700
<i>Seriously. There are so many people here. Why is he riding his bicycle here?</i>

183
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,000
<i>Be careful.</i>

184
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,100
<i>Move aside.</i>

185
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Boss Wang.

186
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,400
Boss Wang, the price which we quoted you is already the lowest price Ling Long can offer.

187
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,200
What concerns do you have?

188
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,800
I chose Ling Long

189
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,400
because it lays in the old city of Huzhou

190
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,200
and because I could always rely on the quality.

191
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,200
I enjoyed collaborating with Ling Long in the past.

192
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,400
But, I heard that the boss of Ling Long has changed.

193
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,800
I do not know the new boss.

194
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,100
I wonder if the current Ling Long is still the same as in the past.

195
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,400
Boss Wang. I have acquired Ling Long.

196
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,200
It will be just as remarkable as in the past.

197
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,200
I'm sure that you

198
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,000
won't find a company better than ours.

199
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Even one with less cost.

200
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,500
If there are any problems,

201
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,950
I will give you the entire goods for free.

202
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,800
<i>What are you doing?</i>

203
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Be careful of the cage, Cai Wong.

204
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,700
Cai Hong, sit on tight.

205
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,500
Boss Jiang, you are really too young and too arrogant in your pressing.

206
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,800
It's just that the goods I wanted

207
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,000
were personally ordered by the northeast marshall, Zhang Lin Zhang.

208
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,200
If anything happens,

209
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,200
you will lose your head. <i>(be in trouble)</i>

210
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,700
Who told you to come in?

211
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Leave.

212
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,600
Cai Hong?

213
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,900
Uncle Wang.

214
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,200
I haven't seen you for a few years. We finally meet here.

215
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,900
Come, sit down and dine with us.

216
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,200
Sit.

217
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,200
You and Boss Jiang...

218
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,300
She is my secretary now.

219
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,800
I am just learning about everthing

220
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,000
and gaining some experience.

221
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,400
By the way, Uncle Wang,

222
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,800
are you here in Huzhou to order some goods from Ling Long?

223
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,400
We haven't finished the negotiation yet.

224
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,800
It was Marshall Lin Zhang who ordered the goods,

225
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,200
so I need to tread cautiously.

226
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
There is a variety of fabrics,

227
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,200
you should get it from Ling Long.

228
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,600
Why do you say this?

229
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,000
From what I know,

230
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
there are a number of fabrics, of good quality to choose from.

231
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But Ling Long has changed its owner now.

232
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,200
Even though Ling Long has changed its owner

233
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,800
the skills and workers are still the same.

234
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,800
We are just as good as in the past.

235
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,900
Furthermore, if Boss Jiang had no skills,

236
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,800
how could he sit in the most exquisite position in Ling Ling?

237
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,200
Based on what Cai Hong said,

238
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,800
I think that I don't have to worry anymore.

239
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:14,740
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

240
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,500
Boss Wang.

241
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,000
Let's have a good collaboration.

242
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,200
Okay, I will be a bit long winded. <i>(repetitive)</i>

243
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,800
As Master Wang,

244
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,000
we put importance on quality goods.

245
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,600
Between time and quality, there is no room for mistakes.

246
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,710
- Don't worry. <br>- Don't worry.

247
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,000
Boss Wang, don't worry.

248
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,400
I promise this afternoon, we will prepare the dye without delay.

249
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,700
Where is your rickshaw? I will escort you there.

250
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
It's over there.

251
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,300
Take care, Uncle Wang.

252
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,100
You can be considered as being a bit useful.

253
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,600
That is

254
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,800
because I'm Wu Hong Da's daughter.

255
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,500
No one should look down on me.

256
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,400
It's very easy for you to fall to your death,

257
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,200
Wu Hong Da's daughter.

258
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,000
Don't forget that you still need to work.

259
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,600
Brother. This woman, Wu Cai Hong, is not that simple as you think.

260
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,400
Think about it. She's Wu Hong Da's daughter.

261
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
She's scheming to get close to you.

262
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,000
When you were not in, she overturned your office.

263
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,120
She even had the capability to secure a big order.

264
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,150
If you keep her with you, it's like rearing a tigress.

265
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,600
I know.

266
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,400
You knew and you still...

267
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,600
Brother.

268
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Cai Hong. How were the negotiations today?

269
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,900
It was successful. You know Uncle Wang too.

270
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,000
He was my father's friend. It was fortunate that he put in a few good words about us.

271
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,400
The way he treated you, do you still need to help him make profits?

272
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,500
I'm not helping him.

273
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,800
I'm doing this to help Ling Long.

274
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,480
My father was a good man.

275
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,200
I don't want the business to be ruined.

276
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,000
I also don't want the workers to lose their jobs.

277
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,400
Furthermore, if I'm of use,

278
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,600
Jiang Yu won't be in such a hurry to kick me out.

279
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
If I'm with him, I will be able to find evidence.

280
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,400
How do you plan

281
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
to investigate Jiang Yu's crime?

282
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,800
I checked Ling Long's account records

283
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,270
and pieced together that large sums of money are missing.

284
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,400
In any case, Old Cai has already run away.

285
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,700
I think there is something odd about it.

286
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,200
But Old Cai's whereabouts are unknown.

287
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,000
It won't be that easy to find him.

288
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,800
Why don't we do this?

289
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,790
Let's find out why Jiang Yu wanted to kill your father.

290
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,600
Once we find out the reason, we will know where to get the evidence.

291
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,200
What do you think?

292
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,300
Perhaps, this is not a bad method.

293
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,830
Let's go.

294
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,070
Brother, something bad has happened.

295
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,380
The dye in the workshop is contaminated.

296
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,080
It's Marshall Zhang's batch order.

297
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,050
All dyes are scrapped.

298
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,050
<i>Look. How could this happen?</i>

299
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,120
<i>Why is it like this?</i>

300
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,620
<i>I don't know. Come and take a look.</i>

301
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,330
<i>What should we do?</i>

302
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,350
<i>Boss Jiang, look.</i>

303
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,900
How could this happen?

304
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,070
We don't know how to revert it back.

305
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,510
The dye was good before we went out to smoke.

306
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,510
When we came back, the dye...

307
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,530
became like this.

308
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,970
Is there any way to salvage this?

309
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,510
-We are missing key ingredients.<br>-It takes a lot of preparation.

310
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,880
These dyes need to be exquisite so the ingredients are very precious.

311
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,920
Madder, bluegrass and saffron are commonly used here.

312
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,820
We also need a lot of fresh roses.

313
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,720
Even if we order the raw materials right now

314
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,410
it will take at least ten days. I'm afraid it will affect the delivery of our goods.

315
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,580
<i>How could this happen?</i>

316
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,080
Check if there are any big rose gardens around here.

317
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,430
And also,

318
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:42,080
in the end, we will find who deliberately contaminated the dye.

319
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,590
<i>Yes, who could do such a thing.</i>

320
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,160
<i>We can't make anything from this.</i>

321
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,920
<i>How could this happen?</i>

322
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,770
Looks like you are bored.

323
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,430
You don't have anything to do but clean my office.

324
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,160
There is not a speck of dust around.

325
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,950
These days a lot of dust is collecting.

326
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,390
Dye material was intentionally contaminated.

327
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:39,130
There must be a staff member who intentionally sabotaged it.

328
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,580
What makes you so sure that it was done by a human?

329
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,690
Furthermore, it was done by a staff member at the factory?

330
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,710
It can't be because it has been very windy for the past two days that

331
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,940
dust contaminated the dye.

332
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,980
The Ling Long workshop...

333
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,680
only our workers can get in.

334
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,450
Thus, there is definitely something fishy about this.

335
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,090
But it's very strange.

336
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,820
It doesn't benefit them to do something like this.

337
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,160
What do they gain to accomplish?

338
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,640
By the way,

339
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:19,840
you know the staff better than me. <br>Investigate this for me before you report for work tomorrow morning.

340
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,000
If you can't find out anything, you can leave immediately tomorrow.

341
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,880
Brother, I already asked around.

342
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,490
Only along the river of Huzhou is where the roses grows,

343
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,530
but no matter what, this Old Madam refuses to sell them.

344
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,310
With good business, secrets are kept but

345
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:52,590
as long as the price is right, the negotiation can be done.

346
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,210
Leave now.

347
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,090
Aunt. We are tripling our price offer.

348
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,930
- Please reconsider. <br>- No, the price is non-negotiable.

349
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,720
Why aren't you listening to me? Leave now.

350
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,280
- Mrs Jiang. <br>- Aunt.

351
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,930
Sell the flowers to us. It will be of benefit for you.

352
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,390
This will not only be beneficial to us. Let's be honest.

353
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,800
Your flowers are growing in the wild. There is no one to appreciate them, right?

354
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,870
What? Are you saying that no one appreciates my flowers?

355
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,360
Let me tell you. Even if no one appreciates my flowers, I won't sell them to you.

356
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,550
Just because you have an urgent need, you don't need to rip the head off an old woman.

357
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,910
- What do you mean by that? Leave now. <br>- Sorry.

358
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,070
- It's only just the problem with the price. <br>- You!

359
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,480
I'm not going to sell to you. Get lost.

360
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,210
- Aunt... <br> - Get lost.

361
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,730
Okay, Madam. Don't be rash.

362
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,190
We will leave.

363
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,670
Seriously.

364
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,170
Fighting over flowers!

365
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,950
What are you thinking of?

366
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,080
I'm really furious.

367
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,630
Let's go back first.

368
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:07,890
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

369
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,070
Brother. What should we do now?

370
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,700
Looks like we really need to give up on this woman and find another solution.

371
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,020
Of course, we must not give up.

372
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,700
Fei Fei. Get someone to run checks on her.

373
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,380
Everyone has their weaknesses.

374
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,360
She is no exception.

375
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,190
I'm afraid that she really has no weaknesses.

376
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,440
I already asked her neighbours.

377
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,550
Her flowers are in memory of her deceased daughter.

378
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,920
All she has left of her daughter are these flowers.

379
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,130
Furthermore, she doesn't have any needs. If we want to talk terms with her,

380
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,230
I'm afraid it will be impossible.

381
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,120
Wu Cai Hong.

382
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,220
Did you find out who sabotaged the dye?

383
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,370
Who did it?

384
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,920
I don't know.

385
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,960
I couldn't find out anything.

386
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,930
You can get lost then.

387
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,870
I still have something to say.

388
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,030
Speak.

389
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,040
Everyone here are long time staff members of Ling Long.

390
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,170
Many people work hard.

391
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,750
They have been with Ling Long all this while

392
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,750
and have been with my father since it was established.

393
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,290
I'm really very grateful to everyone

394
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:12,870
for your love for my father and Ling Long.

395
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:18,430
I am also grateful to everyone for your years of loyalty.

396
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,100
Today, Ling Long,

397
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,420
even though it's now under Jiang,

398
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,380
but no matter how they changed the name,

399
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,860
it's still Ling Long.

400
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,530
It belongs to everyone of you.

401
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,860
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

402
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,480
We are all really close.

403
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,610
We received an order from Mister Chang,

404
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,390
because of our high quality.

405
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:51,800
Without a doubt, because of our years of expertise.

406
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,630
But with some careless words

407
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,810
this all can be destroyed.

408
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,710
In order for it not to be ready on time,

409
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,080
someone deliberately contaminated the dye in the workshop.

410
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,450
<i>Who would do such a thing?</i>

411
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,890
Perhaps, this person wants to take revenge for my father.

412
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:12,120
In doing so, they didn't think things through.

413
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,130
By this all workers will be affected.

414
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,500
Ling Long may go bankrupt.

415
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,940
You will be unemployed.

416
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,130
How many families will lack food and clothing then?

417
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:32,010
<i>Miss is right. It always has been. </i>

418
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,170
<i>They have wives and children too.</i>

419
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:39,290
<i>What should we do?</i>

420
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,170
Frankly,

421
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,950
it doesn't matter if I leave Ling Long.

422
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,840
It's just that I want to tell everyone that

423
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,990
Ling Long belongs to each and every one of you.

424
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,680
You must do a good job.

425
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,420
Don't do any foolish things again.

426
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,540
<i>That's right.</i>

427
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,420
<i>Who did this? Why doesn't he stand up for this?</i>

428
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,080
<i>- He's dragging us down. <br>- He's harming all of us.</i>

429
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,470
<i>Who did it?</i>

430
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,960
Miss, don't leave.

431
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,150
I did it. Don't kick Miss Wu out.

432
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,460
<i>He did it.</i>

433
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,020
Miss, I'm sorry.

434
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,880
The hostile takeover

435
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,470
and boss's death

436
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,210
must have something to do with him.

437
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,070
I wanted to take revenge for Old Master.

438
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,560
Hence, that's why...

439
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,450
Okay.

440
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,540
Wu Cai Hong can stay but Zhang Fu needs to leave.

441
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,640
Furthermore, he must compensate for the loss of the dyes.

442
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,720
How could you do that? You clearly know that

443
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,330
Uncle Fu will never be able to get hold of such a large sum of money.

444
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:55,150
Cut the crap. End of meeting. Go back to work.

445
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,930
Let's go.

446
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:01,280
Uncle Fu.

447
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,410
Jiang Yu.

448
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:06,100
Do you know that his family depends on him?

449
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,230
His child has a disability.

450
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,300
In that case he should have not been so impulsive and reckless.

451
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,820
Jiang Yu.

452
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,700
I'm begging you.

453
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,150
Spare him.

454
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,060
Let him off.

455
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,560
You can't even protect your own position.

456
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,840
What right do you have to beg on his behalf?

457
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,680
Yes.

458
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,650
I don't have the right.

459
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,060
I can only beg you.

460
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,890
If you don't agree to let Uncle Fu off,

461
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,120
I will kneel down here.

462
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,440
Do whatever you want.

463
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,580
Get up, Cai Hong.

464
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,770
- Get up. <br>- Don't persuade me, Shao Tian.

465
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,180
If Jiang Yu doesn't accept this,

466
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,390
I will keep kneeling here.

467
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,800
Boss Jiang. I hope that you will accede to her request,

468
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,750
or I will leave Ling Long

469
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,020
and take all the workers along with me.

470
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,110
Are you threatening me?

471
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,880
No matter what you think,

472
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,180
I hope that you will agree to our term.

473
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,250
Do you think that the workers are loyal and will leave with you?

474
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:27,220
They are staying because of Ling Ling's reputation and their salaries.

475
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,470
If you want to leave, it's up to you

476
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,130
but I want to see

477
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,540
how many workers at Ling Long will leave with you.

478
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,950
Jiang Yu.

479
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,020
You will regret this.

480
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,970
Miss has been kneeling for a long time.

481
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,860
Yes. How could she endure this?

482
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,750
- It has been too long. <br>- That's right.

483
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,350
The colour of her face has changed.

484
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,350
Cai Hong, get up.

485
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,040
Get up.

486
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,540
That rascal, Jiang Yu, will never agree to your term.

487
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,570
Can't you tell that his heart is made of steel and stone?

488
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,260
Don't be naive anymore. Get up now.

489
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,680
Cai Hong.

490
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,860
Take her away.

491
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,980
Do not go against what I say again.

492
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,780
Cai Hong. You are awake.

493
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,640
Brother Shao Tian.

494
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,230
You fainted from heat stroke. Your body is still weak.

495
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,140
You must rest today.

496
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,070
Sorry, I gave you troubles again.

497
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,400
Don't say that.

498
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,800
Cai Hong, leave Ling Long.

499
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,990
I will help you to find the evidence of your father's killer.

500
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:04,260
I promised my father that I will find his killer.

501
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,730
Jiang You wanted to get rid of me due to the recent problems.

502
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,580
I definitely won't back down.

503
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,700
But, Brother Shao Tian,

504
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,700
you shouldn't remain at Ling Long.

505
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,900
Jiang Yu doesn't trust you anymore.

506
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,780
It is impossible for you to do this task.

507
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,170
Take your talents to another place.

508
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,940
You can do well.

509
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,080
Cai Hong. You are right

510
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,250
But I want to tell you this.

511
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:42,870
Regardless if whether you are a heiress or a poor man's daughter,

512
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,220
I will always be with you.

513
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,100
My heart will always be with you.

514
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,780
Thus, I will only leave if you leave.

515
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,990
If you stay, I will stay too.
