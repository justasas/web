[EKG machine flatlining]

4
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:26,155
[Claire breathes deeply]

5
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:27,907
- Do you have defib paddles?
- No.

6
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,575
Shit!

7
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,036
- What are you looking for?
- [panting]

8
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:34,705
Claire, what the hell are you doing?

9
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:36,957
Stand back!

10
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:42,713
[Luke groaning]

11
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:46,300
[machine powering up]

12
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,889
- [panting]
- [EKG machine beeping]

13
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:55,475
[bubbling]

14
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:58,103
- That was reckless.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:58,187 --> 00:01:59,313
Sometimes you gotta
throw the science out

16
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:00,523
and go with what you know.

17
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:04,985
Okay, let's take this step by step
and think this through.

18
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:06,571
Once we get the shrapnel removed,

19
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:09,406
his healing factor and cell regeneration
should take care of everything else.

20
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:11,992
But what's next? Temperature is right.

21
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:14,579
Uh, we have to raise the pH levels
so his skin reacts.

22
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:17,414
So what else will break down
abalone shell?

23
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:18,498
Salt water!

24
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,500
- Yeah. Yeah. Saline!
- Salt water.

25
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:22,962
Where do you have it? Is that it?

26
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:26,423
[bubbling]

27
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:39,103
[grunts]

28
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:42,189
Let's get him out.
He has chills. That won't help him.

29
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:43,733
[Burstein] His temperature's
dropping quickly.

30
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:46,276
That's it.

31
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,738
It's not the pH mixture
that's the problem.

32
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:50,364
It's the temperature.

33
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:52,491
We need to turn it up. All the way up!

34
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,284
[Burstein] No, no!
You don't know what you're doing.

35
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:56,370
Did you bring him all this way
just to kill him?

36
00:02:56,453 --> 00:02:57,997
Think about what happened last time.

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,957
The temperature was the only thing
that you couldn't control.

38
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,041
- That's what you said.
- Yes.

39
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,502
But Albert Rackham was a racist asshole.
He was trying to kill Carl.

40
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:05,254
Okay. Well, maybe that redneck
was onto something.

41
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:07,339
Maybe the explosion is what did it.

42
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:09,675
We don't just need to heat up that soup.
We need to boil it!

43
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,302
You are about to do something
completely stupid.

44
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:13,888
[breathes deeply]

45
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:16,390
I wouldn't be a good scientist
if I let you do it alone.

46
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:18,308
- [valve opening]
- [air hissing]

47
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,356
All right.

48
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:26,525
More.

49
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:29,111
All the way up.

50
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:32,990
- [steam hissing]
- It's really heating up.

51
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:37,577
It's climbing.

52
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:42,541
[loud thud]

53
00:03:47,212 --> 00:03:49,006
This is good. This is very good.

54
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:56,346
- [Burstein] You see?
- [Claire] Yeah.

55
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,431
[steam hissing]

56
00:03:58,557 --> 00:03:59,850
I need a scalpel.

57
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:02,019
- Scalpel.
- Okay.

58
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:06,523
I'm seeing something.
This is really deep.

59
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:11,486
[alarm blaring]

60
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:14,489
Forceps.

61
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:15,991
Forceps.

62
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,168
Okay.

63
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,630
- How many more left?
- Two more pieces.

64
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:41,225
[beeping]

65
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:44,519
- [Claire] I'm losing him.
- [Luke groaning]

66
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:47,439
- I'm not going fast enough.
- You're doing great.

67
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:52,236
- Got it.
- [shrapnel clinks]

68
00:04:57,825 --> 00:04:59,159
Claire.

69
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:02,079
- [muffled screaming]
- You're okay.

70
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:05,750
- [Luke breathing heavily]
- [Claire] Hey, got you.

71
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,377
- We got it all.
- [breathing heavily]

72
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,171
We got it all. You're gonna be okay.

73
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:12,715
[breathing heavily] We did it.

74
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:15,384
We did it. You're gonna be fine.

75
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:27,021
[sighs]

76
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,982
Who the hell are you?

77
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:43,287
You took your sweet time,
Madam Councilwoman.

78
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,539
Why didn't you just come to me?

79
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:47,707
Power doesn't travel.

80
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,209
First rule of business...

81
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:50,836
and war.

82
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:54,339
You have no real power without me.

83
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,092
You could at least let Tony bring me.

84
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:59,719
I got lost three times
trying to find this damn place.

85
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:03,390
Sure, but then I would've had
to put a bullet in the back of his head.

86
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:06,977
No one comes here. Period.

87
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,450
[Mariah] So this is the cure?

88
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:25,329
[Stryker] That's medicinal-grade,
heavy-duty RX stacked up right there.

89
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:26,872
Most definitely.

90
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:30,167
You wouldn't believe
how expensive these things are.

91
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,796
Untraceable, alien metal... explosive.

92
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:37,883
You hit Luke Cage with one of these.

93
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:39,844
He's still alive.

94
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:42,637
If it didn't work, what's the big deal?

95
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:46,976
Well, you don't need to kill God
with one shot to sell a weapon.

96
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:48,936
You just need to make him bleed.

97
00:06:50,062 --> 00:06:52,731
That's all well and good,
but who's gonna be able to afford it?

98
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:55,817
What price can you put on peace of mind?

99
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:57,236
Don't sweat it.

100
00:06:58,237 --> 00:07:02,366
The same Judas metal
can be broken down for mass production.

101
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,327
Each single bullet is less powerful,

102
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,207
but now you can put 'em in a machine gun
and let off a hundred of those bitches.

103
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,710
Mass production is where it's at.

104
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:16,964
I'm a politician. I'm not a gun dealer.

105
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:19,383
Well...

106
00:07:20,342 --> 00:07:22,011
what's the difference?

107
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:25,055
[blows]

108
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,975
Sell the fear.

109
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:30,602
Those people need to look
at that dashcam footage

110
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:33,563
and ask themselves if the world is ready

111
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:36,691
for bulletproof niggas
that eat cops for breakfast.

112
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:39,361
Black fear.

113
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:44,033
After abolition, it's how gun laws
got enacted in the first place.

114
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:48,578
[Mariah] You talk of laws.
Laws are bureaucracy.

115
00:07:48,662 --> 00:07:52,041
The mayor can't even wipe his ass
without three different committees

116
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:55,377
to argue about the texture of the paper
and to pick the brand.

117
00:07:56,753 --> 00:07:59,339
I'm gonna need time
to sell the cops on this,

118
00:07:59,423 --> 00:08:00,757
even with the fear.

119
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,718
[chuckles] Ooh.
Well, you're out of time.

120
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:05,429
This shit starts right now.

121
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:07,890
What?

122
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:16,856
I hate to interrupt
your Isotoner moment, but...

123
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:18,442
this is serious.

124
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:21,987
I'm out of time and then?

125
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:24,489
A few illmatic deaths.

126
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:26,283
Word of mouth spreads like wildfire.

127
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,826
No!

128
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,370
Luke Cage must be the focus.

129
00:08:30,454 --> 00:08:33,040
Oh, he is my focus.

130
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,167
Always.

131
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:43,800
I've never seen anything like it.

132
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:46,011
- [Burstein] No one has.
- [sighs]

133
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,889
A man whose cells can regenerate
is a man who doesn't age.

134
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:52,809
Do you know how valuable that is?

135
00:08:54,186 --> 00:08:55,854
Luke's the only one?

136
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:57,897
Yes.

137
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:00,943
All the other subjects failed.

138
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:04,863
[sighs] There's a lot of work to be done.

139
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:07,532
A lot of good work.

140
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,618
How many more people will have to die?

141
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:13,538
They volunteered in exchange
for time off their sentences.

142
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:16,166
They knew the risks.

143
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:18,961
[sighs] I... I'm not a monster.

144
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:20,462
I never said you were.

145
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:23,340
[Luke sighs]

146
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,593
Hey.

147
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:28,928
Who are you?

148
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,809
Just kidding, Claire.

149
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,062
[Luke chuckling]

150
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:41,483
[child] I've got you!

151
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,068
[children playing]

152
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:48,448
- Hi, Ann. How are you?
- Morning, Officer.

153
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:56,790
[vendor] Hey, Officer Albini.
Got those socks your wife wanted.

154
00:09:56,873 --> 00:09:57,874
Pink or red?

155
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,419
One set or more?

156
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:02,671
Yeah.

157
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,132
All right. Okay.

158
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:09,178
[glove powering up]

159
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:10,470
I'll be right back.

160
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:16,810
Can I help you?

161
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:19,396
My name is Luke Cage.

162
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:21,023
[grunts]

163
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:31,158
I'm Luke Cage!

164
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:32,451
<i>Luke Cage!</i>

165
00:10:32,534 --> 00:10:34,703
[Chang] So that's what you saw?
[vendor] Yeah, that's what I saw.

166
00:10:34,786 --> 00:10:36,413
Exactly like that.

167
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:39,124
That cat with the hoodie
punched that cop

168
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,875
and he flew back, like, 20 feet,

169
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,628
like he was shot from a cannon
or some shit.

170
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:46,631
So, uh, this was the guy you saw?

171
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:49,551
I didn't see his face.
But he laid him out.

172
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:51,928
- Then he said, "Luke."
- [Chang] Cage?

173
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:54,181
[vendor] Oh, I just heard "Luke."
Or maybe "Duke" or...

174
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:56,266
- Hey.
- [Misty] Hey, Bailey.

175
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,351
What do you think?

176
00:10:58,227 --> 00:11:01,396
[sighs] Well, let's eliminate
the other possibilities.

177
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,399
We know Jackie wasn't hit by a car
or anything like that,

178
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:05,859
and this guy over here talking to Chang

179
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:07,026
isn't just making stuff up,

180
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:09,863
'cause that Luke Cage
dashcam video went viral.

181
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:13,283
Well, there are no impact wounds.

182
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:14,993
No glass, metal flakes or nothing.

183
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:17,329
The impact is localized and focused.

184
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:19,456
- I mean, he was hit...
- Punched.

185
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:20,665
He was punched...

186
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,418
and he flew back over 20 feet.

187
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:26,838
And the size of the hole
and the punch is consistent

188
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:28,465
with that of a human fist.

189
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:30,842
And the punch was so hard,
it bent back the shock plate

190
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:32,177
of his Kevlar vest.

191
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:36,765
Nanny said Cage?

192
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:40,101
The nanny is saying
she heard the suspect say "Cage."

193
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:41,978
But let's think about this.

194
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:46,691
A guy in a hoodie, punching a cop
and then saying his name?

195
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:49,611
If it was one of the goons
connected to Cottonmouth,

196
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:52,781
I could halfway see it, but... a cop?

197
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:54,699
Don't forget, you know, he's on the run.

198
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,994
You saw him fighting with us
on that dashcam vid.

199
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:01,873
Albini, he must've just spotted him
and he tried to take him down himself.

200
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:05,669
Jackie was never a hard charger.
I don't see it.

201
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,338
Who else has that kind of strength?

202
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:12,634
Look, in Harlem, black,
wearing a hoodie...

203
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:13,718
It's not rocket science.

204
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:16,471
What about the backpack
they said he was wearing, huh?

205
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:18,097
What about it? Luke doesn't wear one?

206
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:19,933
Not usually, no.

207
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:22,811
So he switched it up that day.
And what's the big deal?

208
00:12:22,894 --> 00:12:24,188
How does that eliminate him?

209
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:26,815
- The whole thing just doesn't smell right.
- I don't smell anything.

210
00:12:26,898 --> 00:12:29,067
[indistinct arguing]

211
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,736
Right now, I smell rage.

212
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,656
Wait. Smith, Smith, Smith.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Smith.

213
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:37,826
This is Harlem.

214
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:41,288
And when a cop gets killed, heads roll.
That's just how we do.

215
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:43,164
You killed a cop!

216
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:45,459
I know you did it.

217
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:48,044
Now kids are getting jacked up
by the police.

218
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:49,921
What are you doing to my city?

219
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:52,632
It's not yours. Never was.

220
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:56,345
Harlem is my birthright. It's mine!

221
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:57,929
City council or not.

222
00:12:58,638 --> 00:13:01,225
"When justice is done...

223
00:13:01,308 --> 00:13:03,393
it is a joy to the righteous...

224
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:06,521
but terror to evildoers."

225
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:10,484
You quote the Bible
like you actually believe in God.

226
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:11,860
And you speak to me

227
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:14,738
as if you're not actually
in the presence of death.

228
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:18,032
Your way was taking too long.

229
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:23,247
I killed two birds with one stone
by sticking a body on Luke Cage.

230
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:27,626
He's hiding somewhere
in the blessed aquarium,

231
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:29,586
so I turned the heat up.

232
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:32,714
Old Carl...

233
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:37,093
he's either gonna stand up
and defend his name...

234
00:13:38,094 --> 00:13:40,972
or he's gonna run and hide,
like a bitch.

235
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:44,434
Either way, it doesn't matter.

236
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:47,312
I've got the gun to take him out.

237
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:50,148
You're completely out of control.

238
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:55,529
And you're not a real politician,
because if you were,

239
00:13:55,612 --> 00:13:57,489
you'd flip this.

240
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:01,075
Get your Sharpton on.

241
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:05,372
Make this moment all about you.

242
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:10,001
- [Smith] I know the job, Inspector.
- Watch your tone, Jake.

243
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:11,586
That's not what I'm saying.

244
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,087
People are pissed. I'm pissed.

245
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:15,590
- But we can't let this get out of hand.
- Goddamn right.

246
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:16,841
One of our own is dead.

247
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:20,262
<i>Cage is gonna pay for what he did.</i>
<i>We're gonna hit the streets hard.</i>

248
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:22,055
<i>We're gonna shake the ground.</i>
<i>Smoke him out.</i>

249
00:14:22,138 --> 00:14:23,765
<i>That's how you find a roach.</i>
<i>You fumigate.</i>

250
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:25,850
[officer 1] Hold up!
[officer 2] Get him down.

251
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:29,145
[Ridley] <i>You're talking about</i>
<i>a community of people, not pests.</i>

252
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:32,023
Oh, come on, Inspector.
I'm from the South Bronx.

253
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:33,608
<i>I'm 28 years on the job.</i>

254
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:36,653
<i>I'm not some idiot who's afraid</i>
<i>of blacks and Hispanics.</i>

255
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:40,073
I said "police." Where's Luke Cage?

256
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:41,658
Who? Wisdom is locked up.

257
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:43,827
He in C-74.
This is not his corner no more!

258
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,914
Not Wiz, fool! Cage, Luke Cage.
Where is Luke Cage?

259
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:50,667
- This is all about Luke Cage.
- Look, I want Cage as badly as you do.

260
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,669
He's at the center
of three active investigations.

261
00:14:52,752 --> 00:14:54,504
But we need to be careful
about how we pursue this.

262
00:14:54,588 --> 00:14:56,881
[Smith] <i>Caution is in the wind,</i>
<i>just like he is.</i>

263
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:59,384
<i>- Our guys need results.</i>
- [Ridley] <i>Remember who you serve.</i>

264
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:01,135
All right, all right.

265
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:03,763
- I know one kid who knows Luke Cage.
- Who?

266
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:05,139
What's his name?

267
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:06,600
Do not light up Harlem behind this.

268
00:15:06,683 --> 00:15:09,268
The good people in Harlem
have no problem with me.

269
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:10,520
Just the assholes.

270
00:15:10,604 --> 00:15:12,188
[Ridley] You need to be responsible.

271
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:14,065
- Methodical.
- [Smith] That, we are.

272
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,485
[Ridley] Okay. Do it right.
No bullshit, no headlines.

273
00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:18,152
You find him, you take him down.

274
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:21,239
Anything on your boy?

275
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:23,325
Chang's taking the lead on that one.

276
00:15:24,743 --> 00:15:27,662
I don't care. Luke is your guy.

277
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:30,624
Look, I'm trying to figure out
who attacked me.

278
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:32,709
[Lonnie] I know where I'm goin'.
Why you gotta be so tight...

279
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,754
Why is you holding onto me like that?
Get up off me, man.

280
00:15:35,837 --> 00:15:39,508
Until Luke Cage is in cuffs,
he's your priority, not your attacker.

281
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:40,717
Thanks.

282
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:50,435
Do you have a lotto winner yet?

283
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:54,689
We have the majority of the face.

284
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:58,192
Lot of angles, but not a full composite.

285
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:02,155
[Bailey] I have a friend down in intel
on the task force.

286
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:05,324
- Maybe she could help.
- Ooh! "She"?

287
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:08,828
- I wanna talk to my mother.
- Your mother? [chuckles]

288
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:11,289
You definitely ain't no hard rock.

289
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:14,125
She's a lawyer. Or she about to be.

290
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:19,839
Well, if you haven't done anything wrong,
you don't have any problem.

291
00:16:19,923 --> 00:16:21,466
I don't.

292
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,386
But you've got about five problems,
far as I can tell.

293
00:16:24,469 --> 00:16:26,555
- Like what?
- [scoffs]

294
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:28,515
I was on my way home from school.

295
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:30,684
Y'all picked me up with no PC.

296
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:33,061
I just got back from school. Chess club.

297
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:35,063
Fifteen people can place me there.

298
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:37,649
And all I have in my bag
is a half-eaten Snickers bar.

299
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:41,152
- I want my phone call.
- Sure. After you answer some questions.

300
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:43,780
[scoffs] About what?
I don't bang and I don't hang.

301
00:16:43,863 --> 00:16:46,157
I'm looking for Luke Cage.

302
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,742
- What about Luke?
- You seen him?

303
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:49,453
That's my man.

304
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:51,370
- He's a good dude.
- That "good dude" killed a cop.

305
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,747
There's no way he killed a cop.

306
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:54,624
- You're lying.
- You calling me a liar?

307
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,543
Luke Cage ain't kill no cop. No way.

308
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:58,753
Look, unless you charging me
with something...

309
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:01,840
I ain't gotta say squat. I'm leaving.

310
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:04,217
You better sit your ass down!

311
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,345
Luke Cage killed my training officer.

312
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:10,557
He had a wife, twins your age.

313
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,309
- Luke Cage ain't kill no cop.
- Look...

314
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:15,520
you better start talking.

315
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:22,276
Your hands are cold.

316
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:29,325
All you had to do
was take the shrapnel out?

317
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,411
It's like replacing
a burnt-out Christmas bulb.

318
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:36,833
You repair the circuit,
the whole thing lights up again.

319
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,167
It's miraculous.

320
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:40,378
[sighs] It's no miracle.

321
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:42,631
Wouldn't you say so?

322
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:45,258
Miracles are good things.

323
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,761
What's good about me being here, huh?

324
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:50,805
All those prisoners who died.

325
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:52,474
Reva's murder. For what?

326
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:54,350
Immortality.

327
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:00,565
What about those people you work for?

328
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:02,692
Do they know I'm here?

329
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:05,695
No. They barely keep tabs on me anymore.

330
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:07,656
I don't believe that.

331
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,700
You're too valuable not to keep tabs on.

332
00:18:10,784 --> 00:18:12,035
And you're not?

333
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:17,666
Wounds healed instantaneously
on the battlefield.

334
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:22,086
Concussions, major head trauma,
healed within hours.

335
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:24,756
You're at the center of that.

336
00:18:29,135 --> 00:18:31,220
Cancer and HIV are next.

337
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,267
[sighs] That's a lot
for me to think about.

338
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,230
Right now, I just want my life back.

339
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:44,108
Well, take your time.

340
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:46,986
I'll be back.

341
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,155
Help yourselves
to anything you like in the fridge.

342
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:52,617
I don't trust him.

343
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,703
Me neither.

344
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:56,871
Reva's files.

345
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:01,167
It's unlocked and unencrypted.

346
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,627
What do you wanna know?

347
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:05,296
[sighs] Reva.

348
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,340
What she wouldn't tell me.

349
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:12,971
Maybe we should just take the zip drive
and be on our way before he gets back.

350
00:19:14,013 --> 00:19:15,682
It might never be unlocked again.

351
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:18,142
I gotta know.

352
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:21,520
Which one?

353
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:23,815
[Luke] That one.

354
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:26,234
Tiara? That's a weird name.

355
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:29,362
It's that thing I took off my head
after I escaped from the tank.

356
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:33,199
That's my prison number.

357
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:37,579
<i>Regarding subject Lucas, Carl...</i>

358
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:40,373
<i>He's interesting.</i>

359
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:44,210
<i>He's intelligent.</i>
<i>There's a fire that burns within.</i>

360
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:47,421
<i>Even when he's not engaged,</i>
<i>you can always tell he's thinking.</i>

361
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:48,882
<i>He's educated.</i>

362
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:52,719
<i>He's not used to being incarcerated,</i>
<i>but he always carries himself with pride.</i>

363
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:53,887
<i>I think he's one to watch.</i>

364
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:55,972
Click seven.

365
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,269
<i>Lucas' increasing loyalty</i>
<i>to Squabbles is an asset.</i>

366
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:05,690
<i>I think Rackham's assertion</i>
<i>that Carl wanting to protect his friend</i>

367
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:10,111
<i>will make him more willing to take part</i>
<i>in the fight trials is accurate.</i>

368
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:11,696
[Luke breathes heavily]

369
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,573
- Click 40.
- You sure, Luke?

370
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:19,788
<i>Subject Lucas is beginning to unravel.</i>

371
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:24,167
<i>He doesn't shave, he doesn't groom</i>
<i>and he lives to fight.</i>

372
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,795
<i>He's actually beginning to hurt people.</i>

373
00:20:26,878 --> 00:20:29,297
<i>Physically, by far,</i>
<i>he's the best subject we've had.</i>

374
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,634
<i>But it remains to be seen</i>
<i>if he'll be cleared for stage three.</i>

375
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:36,805
<i>Every single subject</i>
<i>has died approaching that stage.</i>

376
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:39,057
<i>If anyone can do it, he can.</i>

377
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,266
[Luke sighs]

378
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:42,435
[Burstein] You weren't supposed
to see that.

379
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,564
- So what you got?
- They all said the same thing.

380
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:48,817
Hoodie, Cage,
and they saw Jackie go flying.

381
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,402
No other leads? We need something.

382
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:55,489
Chief is up my ass.
Social media is blowin' up.

383
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:56,950
This whole job has gone tactical.

384
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:59,452
I don't want anyone from the Two-Nine
getting caught up in any bullshit.

385
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:01,329
Everyone in Harlem has a camera.

386
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:03,581
- Guess what? I got something.
- What?

387
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:06,292
Willis Stryker.
Facial recognition just made a match.

388
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,044
There's also a sealed juvenile record.

389
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:11,005
That's it? Why is it sealed?

390
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:12,799
[Bailey] It's past
the statute of limitations.

391
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:14,801
Okay. So how can I get into it?

392
00:21:14,884 --> 00:21:17,095
Well, if you find a date
and a courthouse,

393
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:19,222
and there was some press,
you might get lucky.

394
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:21,307
[Lonnie] Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop, stop!

395
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,475
- [man grunting]
- What in the hell is that?

396
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:24,686
[officer 1] Hands off! Get him off!
[officer 2] Dorsey! Dorsey!

397
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:26,645
[Dorsey] Where is he, huh?
[officer 2] Get off him, Dorsey!

398
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,147
Where is he, punk? Huh?

399
00:21:28,231 --> 00:21:30,399
Why are you protecting him, huh?
Just tell me where he is.

400
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:32,318
[Ridley shouting]
What the hell is going on?

401
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,950
What the hell did you just do?

402
00:21:39,951 --> 00:21:41,703
[Luke breathing heavily]

403
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:45,331
We were trash.

404
00:21:45,414 --> 00:21:47,416
You knew no one would care
if we were gone.

405
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,086
That was the whole point
of Reva's therapy sessions.

406
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:53,131
To separate the trash from the triumphant.

407
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,635
[stutters] To pick out those subjects
that were most psychologically ready

408
00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:00,471
- to survive the process, Carl.
- Stop calling me that!

409
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:02,181
I'm Luke.

410
00:22:02,265 --> 00:22:03,850
Carl died at Seagate.

411
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:06,102
[Burstein scoffs]

412
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:10,356
What, you're still pining
like a lovesick puppy for Reva?

413
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:11,440
Please.

414
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:13,442
She lied to everybody.

415
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,029
That was her job.

416
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:18,072
She lied to you about her involvement.

417
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:20,033
I promise I'll explain it all.

418
00:22:20,116 --> 00:22:23,744
She lied again when she erased
both of you from existence.

419
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:25,955
Thank you for saving my life.

420
00:22:26,497 --> 00:22:28,332
Thank you for changing mine.

421
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,543
She knew the stakes.

422
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,838
[sighs]

423
00:22:33,922 --> 00:22:34,923
You're...

424
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,426
You're the future, Carl.

425
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:41,345
You're a walking fountain of youth.

426
00:22:50,897 --> 00:22:53,107
My name is not Carl.

427
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:55,693
I'm Luke Cage!

428
00:22:55,776 --> 00:22:56,986
[grunting]

429
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,450
[yelling]

430
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,518
You're never gonna do this
to anyone else ever again.

431
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,146
How's that for stakes?

432
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:37,068
- [sighs]
- Claire.

433
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:39,112
Claire, you're brilliant.

434
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:42,866
You're not even trained.
Imagine the things I could teach you.

435
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:47,120
Talk to Luke.
Tell him what he's throwing away.

436
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:48,872
He's my friend.

437
00:23:50,623 --> 00:23:52,458
And that's why you'll never see him again.

438
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:54,710
Or this.

439
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,298
You didn't say
I would never see you again.

440
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:03,761
Be thankful I'm not the one
with the powers...

441
00:24:04,803 --> 00:24:08,807
because I'd kill you if you did
half the shit that you did to him to me.

442
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:11,394
Not just ruin your barn.

443
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,855
[breathing heavily]

444
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:51,100
Carl Lucas is Luke Cage.

445
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,479
- Hey. I found out that Willis...
- It's gonna have to wait.

446
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:56,940
Officers.

447
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:59,817
I am releasing these to the media

448
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,696
in the next 15 minutes
so they can see the contrast.

449
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:06,365
Don't make a bad situation even worse,
Councilwoman.

450
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:08,201
You'd think a sister in charge
would change things.

451
00:25:08,284 --> 00:25:09,327
But you're blue,

452
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,579
which makes you just as white
as anybody else!

453
00:25:11,662 --> 00:25:13,539
Luke Cage is a suspect
at large for murder,

454
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:14,790
a number of other crimes.

455
00:25:14,873 --> 00:25:17,543
Luke Cage may be bulletproof,
but my boy isn't.

456
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:19,170
Can't y'all understand that?

457
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:21,214
Patty, Patty, save your words.

458
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:23,924
- The only thing they understand is action.
- [Ridley] Mariah.

459
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:26,719
Detective Dorsey has been arrested,
suspended without pay.

460
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:28,012
We are taking formal steps to charge...

461
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:30,889
No! Not enough, Priscilla. Not today.

462
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:35,436
The death of that officer at the hand
of that super-freak was bad enough.

463
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,521
But to beat down a child?

464
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:40,899
Means you're not doing your job.
Come on.

465
00:25:41,484 --> 00:25:42,568
Patricia.

466
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:47,490
- How's Lonnie?
- Keep my son's name out of your mouth.

467
00:25:52,828 --> 00:25:57,500
He's at Frederick Douglass Hospital
right now, getting checked out.

468
00:25:58,667 --> 00:25:59,918
Y'all gonna pay for this shit.

469
00:26:00,003 --> 00:26:02,255
Until you capture Luke Cage,

470
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:05,383
and apologize to the people of Harlem,
we will...

471
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:08,761
- bring this city to its knees.
- [crowd agreeing]

472
00:26:08,844 --> 00:26:14,975
All over Harlem, young black and brown men
are being slapped around by an NYPD

473
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,062
too scared to do something
about Luke Cage.

474
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:20,231
- [crowd agreeing]
- And because young Lonnie Wilson,

475
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:21,774
our brother...

476
00:26:21,857 --> 00:26:24,402
just had the misfortune of knowing this...

477
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:27,280
supposed superhero turned super-menace...

478
00:26:27,363 --> 00:26:31,534
[on TV] <i>he was beaten in custody</i>
<i>like it's 1956.</i>

479
00:26:31,617 --> 00:26:36,455
<i>Any time one of Harlem's finest is killed,</i>
<i>we all suffer.</i>

480
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:40,543
But let's make sure that that outrage
is pointed in the right direction.

481
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:45,589
I encourage the NYPD
to effectively arm themselves

482
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:48,509
to protect the public, not to harass

483
00:26:48,592 --> 00:26:51,720
young brothers and sisters,
<i>hermanas y hermanos,</i>

484
00:26:51,804 --> 00:26:54,807
who are the lifeblood and the future
of our community.

485
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:59,228
And I encourage that community
to rally with me at Harlem's Paradise.

486
00:26:59,312 --> 00:27:02,981
We will discuss our next plan
of non-violent action.

487
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:04,733
Luke Cage must be found.

488
00:27:04,817 --> 00:27:06,319
- He must be stopped.
- [crowd agreeing]

489
00:27:06,402 --> 00:27:10,614
- This must never happen again.
- [crowd agreeing]

490
00:27:12,658 --> 00:27:14,077
[Ridley] Yes, Chief.

491
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:20,708
Yes, sir.

492
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:25,629
- [Ridley sighs]
- Do you have time to talk now?

493
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:28,299
About what? About Mariah's little
"I Have a Dream" moment outside?

494
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:31,385
About all the kids getting beaten up
by cops and the videos going viral?

495
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:33,804
Something's off about this
and you know it.

496
00:27:34,763 --> 00:27:37,850
Why the hell would she hold that rally
at Harlem's Paradise?

497
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:41,145
Shouldn't she be too spooked to even go
inside after what happened to her cousin?

498
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:45,899
Cage did not kill Officer Albini.

499
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:48,694
Nothing settles down until Cage
is in the box. We need to talk to him.

500
00:27:48,777 --> 00:27:51,572
- And I need to talk to Willis Stryker.
- Who is Stryker?

501
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:55,326
I get the feeling that he is connected
to everything that's been going on.

502
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:58,579
Cage, Cottonmouth, all of it.

503
00:27:59,163 --> 00:28:00,623
You'll need proof.

504
00:28:01,665 --> 00:28:02,833
I'm on it.

505
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:13,219
[exhales] You swam that whole way?

506
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:15,638
Doesn't seem as far away now.

507
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,182
Hmm.

508
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:21,810
[Luke] You ever hold
someone in your arms,

509
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:24,147
hear them breathing against your chest,

510
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,106
and you're in one emotional place...

511
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:28,984
and they're in another?

512
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,407
And you have absolutely no idea
what they're thinking.

513
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,825
It's called having a boyfriend.

514
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:38,202
[Luke chuckles softly]

515
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:47,002
Reva lied to me.

516
00:28:47,878 --> 00:28:49,713
She helped you to disappear...

517
00:28:50,714 --> 00:28:52,425
because she was protecting you.

518
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:56,512
- It couldn't have all been a lie.
- You don't understand.

519
00:28:56,595 --> 00:28:58,306
That woman?

520
00:28:58,389 --> 00:28:59,640
The idea of her...

521
00:29:00,683 --> 00:29:01,767
her smell...

522
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,395
That was the only thing
that kept me sane at Seagate.

523
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:06,689
That's what's eating me up inside.

524
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:09,942
I don't think I really knew her at all.

525
00:29:11,735 --> 00:29:13,321
You still love her.

526
00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:15,239
I love...

527
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:18,617
the idea of Reva.

528
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:22,830
But not her, specifically.

529
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,666
Not anymore.

530
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:30,296
[sighs] I should just go, you know?

531
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:33,966
I should just turn around
and walk away from all this shit.

532
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:35,551
[scoffs]

533
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:39,388
I wish you would've told me that,
what, 800 miles and 28 hours ago?

534
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:42,933
I could have got some sleep.

535
00:29:45,811 --> 00:29:47,396
We've come too far.

536
00:29:48,772 --> 00:29:50,524
We're both in this now.

537
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:52,568
Together.

538
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:56,154
Look, it's...
It's a lot for me to take in all at once.

539
00:29:57,072 --> 00:29:58,574
[Claire sighs]

540
00:29:58,657 --> 00:30:00,826
I just need a plan, that's all.

541
00:30:02,995 --> 00:30:06,290
Willis hates me,
and I just need to figure out why.

542
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,460
This was all so long ago.

543
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,006
Savannah's the place
where all those answers are.

544
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:16,425
The past is present for him.

545
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:21,514
Whatever wounded him
has not cooled off at all.

546
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:24,225
I trusted Reva...

547
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:27,144
and I was wrong.

548
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:30,689
How can I trust you?

549
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,901
I never back down from a fight.

550
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,112
Even if you don't trust me...

551
00:30:38,697 --> 00:30:40,324
trust the fighter in me.

552
00:30:43,536 --> 00:30:44,995
Fair enough.

553
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,055
I'm driving.

554
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,979
About time.

555
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,834
- [switch clicks]
- Ah.

556
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:33,126
[whirring]

557
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:59,362
- [boxers grunting]
- Domingo.

558
00:32:01,071 --> 00:32:05,409
- Do I know you?
- No... but I know you.

559
00:32:06,118 --> 00:32:08,078
I've seen your rap sheet.

560
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:10,914
How do you have time to commit crimes
and train boxers?

561
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:14,377
I guess you must have to be
good at multitasking.

562
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,086
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

563
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:21,299
I like boxing.

564
00:32:21,384 --> 00:32:22,968
You know what Mike Tyson once said?

565
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:26,430
Uh, Mike Tyson mumbles too much
to say much of anything.

566
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:28,098
No, Mike is great.

567
00:32:29,683 --> 00:32:33,354
He said, "Everyone has a plan...

568
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:34,772
until they get hit."

569
00:32:34,855 --> 00:32:37,400
Well, sometimes you have to take a hit...

570
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:40,110
before you can punch back.

571
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:44,197
- And I know how to counterpunch.
- Mmm.

572
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,037
Who's this?

573
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:52,748
You tell me.

574
00:32:52,831 --> 00:32:55,543
Look, I saw you with Cottonmouth.

575
00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:57,169
I heard about your little beef.

576
00:32:57,252 --> 00:32:59,755
Beef? No beef.

577
00:32:59,838 --> 00:33:02,800
All I know is, Cottonmouth dies,
this guy shows up,

578
00:33:02,883 --> 00:33:05,343
and suddenly everything changes
all over again.

579
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:07,555
Who is he?

580
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:11,475
You come alone?

581
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:13,477
Why are you asking me all this?

582
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:17,272
Because everybody
is so focused on Luke Cage,

583
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:21,569
nobody's talking about the fact
that the heads of the Jamaican, Haitian,

584
00:33:21,652 --> 00:33:24,362
and Cuban crime families
have all gone missing.

585
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:27,282
I'd go to Harlem's Paradise.

586
00:33:28,617 --> 00:33:30,243
It's under new management.

587
00:33:34,915 --> 00:33:37,375
[speaking Spanish]

588
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:41,129
[boxer grunts]

589
00:33:48,178 --> 00:33:49,597
[Claire] So this is it?

590
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,014
It used to be.

591
00:33:52,307 --> 00:33:54,017
My grandfather built that sign.

592
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:57,104
He founded this church
after he came home from World War II.

593
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,773
He was a Red Tail.

594
00:34:00,691 --> 00:34:03,569
- Tuskegee Airman.
- Nice.

595
00:34:03,652 --> 00:34:07,781
He wanted a sign that was bold...
just like the tail of his plane.

596
00:34:10,576 --> 00:34:11,952
So what happened here?

597
00:34:12,911 --> 00:34:14,287
Why is everyone gone?

598
00:34:15,288 --> 00:34:16,540
I don't know.

599
00:34:34,892 --> 00:34:36,226
[Etta] James...

600
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:39,104
Carl needs you now more than ever.

601
00:34:39,187 --> 00:34:40,898
How can you be here for your community

602
00:34:40,981 --> 00:34:43,734
and every other family
in the congregation,

603
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:45,443
but you're never here for us?

604
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:49,072
Stay out of grown folks' business.

605
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,491
[young Luke] Yes, ma'am.

606
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,827
Mama?

607
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:56,329
Carl, come on.
I'm taking you to practice.

608
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:58,582
[young Luke] All right.
Let me say goodbye to Daddy.

609
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,083
I'll be waiting in the car.

610
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:03,587
- Mrs. Lucas.
- Ms. Stryker.

611
00:35:36,954 --> 00:35:38,205
[man laughing in distance]

612
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:41,917
[people conversing in distance]

613
00:35:48,131 --> 00:35:49,633
[books clatter]

614
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,015
Carl.

615
00:35:58,058 --> 00:36:00,853
[Etta] Look, heffa.
You're not fooling nobody.

616
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:03,021
You're little more than his hoe,
and we both know it.

617
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:05,566
He lied to me too, Etta.
You think we're the only ones?

618
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:07,109
You're through. And you're done.

619
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:10,403
Are you kidding me?
Come at me again, bitch,

620
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:12,197
and I won't hold my tongue
about Willie anymore.

621
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,992
You say a word,
and the checks stop coming.

622
00:36:15,075 --> 00:36:17,535
He'll get pulled from Lieber Academy
so quick, your head...

623
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,704
[Claire] Luke?

624
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:27,295
Luke, are you all right?

625
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:29,506
[breathing heavily]

626
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:35,137
Willis Stryker...

627
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,429
is my brother.

628
00:36:43,979 --> 00:36:46,148
I never wanted to accept it, but...

629
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,441
it's real.

630
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,569
- They never told you?
- No, no.

631
00:36:51,654 --> 00:36:53,030
No, no one dared.

632
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:55,365
[breathing heavily]
It was all the little things.

633
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:57,826
All the sideways glances during service.

634
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,163
My mother hating on Willis,
even after he won the city championship.

635
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:03,874
All my dad's convention trips with Dana.

636
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:06,168
He was always so protective of her.

637
00:37:07,169 --> 00:37:08,295
Who's Dana?

638
00:37:09,337 --> 00:37:12,049
His secretary. Willis's mother.

639
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:15,218
He was two years older than me.

640
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:18,847
For years, my mother couldn't conceive,
and then one day, I...

641
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:20,390
I came along.

642
00:37:21,474 --> 00:37:24,019
That's why everybody called me
the miracle baby.

643
00:37:25,145 --> 00:37:26,980
I hated that spotlight.

644
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:29,316
They should have told you.

645
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:32,485
Had Willis not framed me,
I wouldn't have gone to Seagate.

646
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:34,487
No Seagate, no powers.

647
00:37:35,447 --> 00:37:36,865
Reva would still be alive.

648
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:39,617
How is that your fault?

649
00:37:39,702 --> 00:37:43,330
It's not my fault.
My father started this whole thing.

650
00:37:44,206 --> 00:37:48,711
Willis hates me because
my father hates the idea of him.

651
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:51,338
[chuckles]

652
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:54,424
What he doesn't realize is that my father
never really liked me very much either.

653
00:37:54,507 --> 00:37:58,178
So where is this grand Reverend Lucas?
Why does he get a pass?

654
00:37:58,261 --> 00:37:59,596
Doesn't matter.

655
00:38:00,638 --> 00:38:03,851
Diamondback is after everything
and everyone that I've ever cared about.

656
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:06,103
So it stops with me.

657
00:38:08,146 --> 00:38:09,982
I am my brother's keeper...

658
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:13,235
whether I like it or not.

659
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,947
It's on me.

660
00:38:23,661 --> 00:38:25,413
[indistinct chatter]

661
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:31,754
[crowd chanting] This stops now!
This stops now!

662
00:38:31,837 --> 00:38:35,257
This stops now! This stops now!

663
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,800
This stops now!

664
00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:39,928
Yes, it does. Yes, it does.

665
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:42,973
Oh, it warms my heart
to see you here this evening.

666
00:38:43,056 --> 00:38:44,474
[man] Good to see you, too.

667
00:38:45,683 --> 00:38:48,478
My cousin, Cornell Stokes...

668
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:52,107
was murdered right where you're standing,

669
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,777
and it pains me to even be here.

670
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:57,445
- But it's necessary.
- [crowd agreeing]

671
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:01,909
Luke Cage murdered my cousin,

672
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:04,787
and I am not afraid to speak out about it.

673
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,831
The man is a liar, he is a menace,

674
00:39:07,915 --> 00:39:13,170
and as long as he is running around loose,
hiding amongst us, no one is safe.

675
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:14,296
- [crowd murmurs]
- [man] Ain't none of us safe!

676
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:17,800
Now, I know what brought us
here tonight.

677
00:39:17,883 --> 00:39:22,805
The police putting their hands
on yet another young black man.

678
00:39:22,888 --> 00:39:23,972
It's wrong.

679
00:39:24,056 --> 00:39:26,183
- It is wrong.
- [crowd agreeing]

680
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:28,936
No doubt about that. But...

681
00:39:30,062 --> 00:39:32,522
we cannot lose focus here.

682
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:37,820
A cop was killed
by this super-powered menace.

683
00:39:37,903 --> 00:39:42,324
And our young brother was hurt
during their witch-hunt.

684
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:44,617
Brothers and sisters...

685
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:47,579
our world has changed.

686
00:39:47,662 --> 00:39:52,835
- We have new threats, new terrorists.
- [man] Yeah.

687
00:39:52,918 --> 00:39:56,046
That woman over in Hell's Kitchen
snapped a man's neck

688
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:58,673
because he was mind-controlling her.

689
00:39:58,756 --> 00:39:59,757
[crowd murmuring]

690
00:39:59,842 --> 00:40:03,887
We got a bulletproof murderer
on the loose in Harlem

691
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:08,809
with his own twisted sense of justice,
putting us all in harm's way.

692
00:40:08,892 --> 00:40:10,060
[crowd murmuring]

693
00:40:10,143 --> 00:40:11,478
Do I trust the cops?

694
00:40:12,562 --> 00:40:15,065
- [man] No. Hell no.
- Not blindly.

695
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:19,820
- [crowd agreeing]
- We need protection from Luke Cage.

696
00:40:19,903 --> 00:40:24,616
We need protection from
the other powered people like Luke Cage.

697
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:26,784
He is the real threat!

698
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:28,453
[crowd agreeing]

699
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,710
We need to arm our men and women in blue

700
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:38,255
so that they can protect us.

701
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:39,756
Truly protect us

702
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:44,469
and never confuse us
with those who are the real threat.

703
00:40:44,552 --> 00:40:46,263
- [crowd cheering]
- You stay strong!

704
00:40:52,602 --> 00:40:54,646
I know you will stay strong

705
00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:57,357
and I know you will welcome
to this mike right now,

706
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,860
- Reverend John Pope!
- [crowd cheering]

707
00:41:05,615 --> 00:41:07,784
Emails. Make sure you get emails
and a head count.

708
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:11,038
- [man] Consider it done, ma'am.
- Oh! I didn't know you got off work.

709
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:13,331
- Hey. How you doing?
- [laughs]

710
00:41:13,415 --> 00:41:15,292
- [John] Because you are here.
- Excuse me.

711
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:16,877
[John] That means that you care.

712
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,420
Are you that desperate?

713
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:20,130
What do you mean?

714
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:22,590
You're just using that kid
to stay politically viable

715
00:41:22,674 --> 00:41:26,219
even though Brenda's still gonna force
your crooked ass off the city council.

716
00:41:26,303 --> 00:41:28,346
I don't know what you're talking about.

717
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:31,724
You know damn well Luke Cage
didn't kill that poor cop.

718
00:41:31,808 --> 00:41:34,602
Everyone knows he's the one
who busted up Cottonmouth's...

719
00:41:34,686 --> 00:41:36,813
- Cornell.
- Cottonmouth's operation

720
00:41:36,897 --> 00:41:38,273
at Crispus Attucks

721
00:41:38,356 --> 00:41:42,610
and that $7 million in blood money
that came out of your office.

722
00:41:44,112 --> 00:41:48,158
Cornell dies,
Brenda and the rest of the party back off

723
00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:50,202
and your popularity surges.

724
00:41:51,286 --> 00:41:53,788
But I see right through you, Mariah.

725
00:41:55,165 --> 00:41:56,458
How dare you.

726
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:58,751
You can't be trusted.

727
00:41:58,835 --> 00:42:02,923
Who needs trust when you have power?

728
00:42:03,006 --> 00:42:04,674
[crowd cheering and applauding]

729
00:42:19,064 --> 00:42:20,190
Yo, Luke.

730
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,696
I won't say nothing.

731
00:42:31,868 --> 00:42:33,578
You're not going, are you?

732
00:42:36,414 --> 00:42:38,041
Why not?

733
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:41,003
Nothing like a warm welcome
from Mariah Dillard.

734
00:42:45,882 --> 00:42:47,800
[crowd cheering and applauding]

735
00:42:47,884 --> 00:42:51,096
Now, he calls himself a friend.

736
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:54,141
- [woman] He ain't my friend!
- But by his actions...

737
00:42:54,224 --> 00:42:56,934
we know that this is false.

738
00:42:57,019 --> 00:42:58,895
- [crowd agreeing]
- Now, can you say "false"?

739
00:42:58,979 --> 00:43:00,355
- [crowd] False!
- [John] Say it again.

740
00:43:00,438 --> 00:43:01,939
- [crowd] False!
- [John] Mean it this time!

741
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:03,316
- [crowd] False!
- [John] Yes!

742
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,652
- False! Yeah.
- [crowd applauding]

743
00:43:05,735 --> 00:43:07,195
Now...

744
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:11,241
Luke Cage has a lot to prove to us.

745
00:43:11,866 --> 00:43:15,620
What is he? Where does he come from?

746
00:43:15,703 --> 00:43:17,872
And will more come like him?

747
00:43:18,956 --> 00:43:24,171
And does his presence here mean
that we will be endangered? Endangered...

748
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:25,838
by superhuman threats?

749
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:28,425
Now, I want you...

750
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:30,427
to follow me this evenin'.

751
00:43:31,344 --> 00:43:32,679
From the bottom of your heart.

752
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:34,764
No, no, no, not from the top,
or the middle.

753
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:36,183
From the bottom of your heart.

754
00:43:36,266 --> 00:43:38,185
- This...
- [crowd] This...

755
00:43:38,268 --> 00:43:39,311
- I'm gonna go upstairs.
- [John] Stops!

756
00:43:39,394 --> 00:43:40,978
- [crowd] Stops!
- [John] Now!

757
00:43:41,063 --> 00:43:43,148
- You sure that's a good idea?
- [John] This stops now!

758
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,774
Misty's gonna need backup.

759
00:43:45,317 --> 00:43:46,818
[crowd chanting] This stops now!

760
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:48,820
This stops now!

761
00:43:48,903 --> 00:43:50,322
Be careful.

762
00:43:50,405 --> 00:43:52,449
[crowd continues chanting]

763
00:43:52,532 --> 00:43:54,159
Always.

764
00:43:54,242 --> 00:43:55,452
You're so corny.

765
00:43:55,535 --> 00:43:58,621
[crowd chanting] This stops now!
This stops now!

766
00:43:58,705 --> 00:44:01,833
This stops now! This stops now!

767
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:03,501
[chanting continues]

768
00:44:18,516 --> 00:44:21,519
[chanting continues]

769
00:44:46,419 --> 00:44:47,754
[Stryker] Hey, baby.

770
00:44:47,837 --> 00:44:50,047
- You miss me?
- Put your hands where I can see 'em!

771
00:44:50,132 --> 00:44:51,174
You're under arrest.

772
00:44:51,258 --> 00:44:53,635
Nah. Not today.

773
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:56,179
- [grunts]
- [crowd screaming]

774
00:45:00,016 --> 00:45:01,309
[grunting]

775
00:45:03,395 --> 00:45:05,147
That's Luke Cage! He's here!

776
00:45:13,196 --> 00:45:14,614
[man] There he is. Get him!

777
00:45:27,419 --> 00:45:30,087
- [grunts]
- [Misty breathing heavily]

778
00:45:30,172 --> 00:45:32,131
[crowd screaming]

779
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,802
[rapid gunfire]

780
00:46:00,076 --> 00:46:01,286
[softly] I got you.

781
00:46:02,204 --> 00:46:03,205
You hear me?

782
00:46:04,121 --> 00:46:05,207
I got you.
