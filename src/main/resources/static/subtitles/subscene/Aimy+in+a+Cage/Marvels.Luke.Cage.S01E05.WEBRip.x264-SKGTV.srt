[theme music playing]

00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:24,569
[music playing]

4
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:26,905
[Jidenna rapping]

5
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:15,829
[grunts]

6
00:02:57,746 --> 00:02:58,830
[man grunts]

7
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:07,922
[groans]

8
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:10,675
[man groaning] Bitch!

9
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:08,942
This ain't no social.

10
00:04:12,654 --> 00:04:15,031
This is what we call
a State of the Union.

11
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:20,244
Darrell, how we doing after Fort Knox?

12
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:25,208
Break it down and let it be broke.

13
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,836
[Darrell] Ain't nothing to let be.

14
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,379
You are broke.

15
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:34,968
Let me rephrase.

16
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:37,011
You got your real estate.

17
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:39,097
Mama Mabel left you the club.

18
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,433
You and Mariah share the deed
on her old brownstone.

19
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,769
I know you got some cash, right?

20
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,192
I got at least... 250 laying around.

21
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,403
[Darrell] Well, Fort Knox
is what hurts, baby.

22
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:58,324
You lost seven figures,
seven times over.

23
00:04:58,407 --> 00:05:01,494
All of your cash profits from the corners,
stash houses, drops.

24
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:03,621
You still got stocks,
the club profits, but...

25
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:06,540
But what?

26
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:08,960
The streets is talkin'.

27
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:12,171
And that dude with the hoodie,
if he's still out there...

28
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:14,465
This nigga too scared to say his name.

29
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:18,970
Koko, this ain't PS 154.
You ain't gotta raise your hand, man.

30
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,388
[Koko] I been reading this book.

31
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:23,182
[chuckles] Huh. You readin' now?

32
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:25,518
- [laughing]
- Yeah. It's a... it's a book on politics

33
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,938
and the social conditions
that created hip-hop.

34
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:31,440
The Dodgers left Brooklyn,

35
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:33,692
Robert Moses created
the Cross Bronx Expressway,

36
00:05:33,777 --> 00:05:36,863
and white folks went
running for the suburbs.

37
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:41,075
This cat named Moynihan went and hollered
at Nixon, and told the prez

38
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:45,789
that maybe the inner city
could benefit from the benign neglect.

39
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:47,081
Benign what?

40
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:50,501
It's... it's the benign neglect.

41
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,253
What it means is this:

42
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:56,590
Maybe if we just leave
that Luke Cage cat alone,

43
00:05:56,674 --> 00:06:00,303
give him his side of the street,
we take ours.

44
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:04,849
[shouting]

45
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:24,035
Benign neglect.

46
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,786
[laughing]

47
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,040
Yeah, okay. [chuckling]

48
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:34,670
The police sitting on my money.

49
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,841
So I'm gonna have to turn up my game.

50
00:06:37,924 --> 00:06:41,469
Zip... I want you
and the fellas to hit the streets.

51
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:45,932
Hit every business from 110 to 155th.

52
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,351
If they got a dime,
I want at least a nickel.

53
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:51,104
Bring everything back
by the end of the day.

54
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:55,108
You think you're gonna recoup $7 million,
just like that?

55
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:59,445
I don't even know why you back here.

56
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,491
Look around.

57
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:07,954
You know damn well
why Diamondback sent me.

58
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,999
Fort Knox?

59
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,504
This makes the junkyard rip...

60
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:20,299
look like Amateur Night at the Apollo.

61
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,389
This dishwasher...
thinks he can prove Harlem don't need me.

62
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:31,727
Let's see how bad
he really wants to wear the crown.

63
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:39,193
You hit the boulevard
and squeeze 'em hard.

64
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:44,782
And when they start crying,
talking about, "Why? Why?"

65
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:50,329
You tell them to go talk
to Luke Cage down at the barber shop.

66
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:53,124
They're paying
a Luke Cage stupidity tax.

67
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,376
[breathing heavily]

68
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,295
[shouting] What are you doing?

69
00:07:58,421 --> 00:07:59,881
Time is precious!

70
00:07:59,964 --> 00:08:01,299
Move!

71
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:03,842
Zip!

72
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,181
Call Mr. Spurlock.

73
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,272
Tell him we gonna need his services.

74
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:32,956
- [both grunting]
- Get off!

75
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,916
[grunting]

76
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:47,720
- You got problems with the tax?
- Holler at your man Luke Cage...

77
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:49,722
- Holler at Luke Cage...
- [all] At the barber shop.

78
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:58,397
[Zip] Payday, Aisha.

79
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:00,191
We ain't got it this month, Zip.

80
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:01,275
[Zip chuckles]

81
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:03,569
Back off.

82
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:05,989
- [scoffs] Give me that.
- [both straining]

83
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,532
- [Aisha screams]
- [laughing]

84
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,159
What the hell are you doing, Zip?

85
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:11,535
[Aisha yelling]

86
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,042
Ooh.

87
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:21,462
Didn't your old man come up on the Mets?

88
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:22,671
He got cut.

89
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:24,673
He played for the championship
New York Nines team.

90
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:27,468
That's a Nine's ring?

91
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,886
Zip, please.

92
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,555
That's my father's!

93
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,018
[Zip chuckling]

94
00:09:35,684 --> 00:09:37,853
[Zip] Aw! Don't cry.

95
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:39,688
[chuckling] You mad?

96
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:42,150
Holler at Luke Cage.

97
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,360
He'll tell you why we doin' this.

98
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:55,163
- A tailor?
- That ain't no tailor.

99
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:57,706
That's Dapper Dan himself.

100
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,625
Dapper Dan?

101
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,044
[chuckles]

102
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:03,837
Said you needed a suit,
that's why I had you come here.

103
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:06,840
And I figure...

104
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:09,135
Pop would want you to come
to his memorial correct,

105
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:12,388
so I used a little bit of money
to have my man Dap do you right.

106
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:14,765
[chuckling]

107
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,837
[Dapper Dan] Saw you on TV
the other night. Buried alive.

108
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,506
Now that's what I call style.

109
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,052
- [Luke] Lucky.
- You ain't lucky. You blessed.

110
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:58,726
Hey. What was Mike Tyson like?

111
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:01,354
[Fish chuckling] Oh, I know
you're sick of telling that story.

112
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:03,231
He whooped Mitch Green's behind,
didn't he?

113
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:06,359
[scoffs] Mike Tyson
is a real nice guy, man.

114
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:07,985
But he hit like a beast.

115
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:10,613
Yeah, well there was beauty in that beast.

116
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:15,159
You can't control what people say.
Just be the best man that you can be.

117
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:18,537
And always make sure
they spell your name right.

118
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:22,666
[Luke] Now, that's a dapper approach, man.

119
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,294
- Thanks, man.
- Appreciate it.

120
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:30,633
Let's see here.

121
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:33,344
[both chuckling]

122
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,179
That ain't no smock.

123
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,392
- You ready for later?
- All good.

124
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:41,894
Messages stacked up at the door.

125
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:45,356
Like everybody in Harlem
looking for you after that building thing.

126
00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:48,359
I'm strictly about Pop's memorial today.

127
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,903
[sighing] Seating everyone at this thing

128
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:53,071
is gonna be the toughest move
I've mastered

129
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:55,366
since the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit.

130
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,075
[sighing] I mean...

131
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:00,996
I gotta put Estelle up front,
'cause she's been with him the longest,

132
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,416
at least as far as the neighborhood knows.

133
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,045
Keep her far away as hell from Charlene.

134
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:13,342
She's real sly. Moves like a bishop
on the diagonal at all times.

135
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:16,053
Now, they both
have to steer clear of Candy,

136
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,722
who they both think is his cousin.
[chuckles]

137
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,474
Candy?

138
00:12:20,558 --> 00:12:23,436
She rubs everyone the wrong way but Pop.

139
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,356
Who she rubs the right way,
every Tuesday and Thursday at 9:45.

140
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,899
[chuckling]

141
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:32,570
Looks like Shaft ain't had nothing
on Henry Hunter.

142
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:34,488
- Pop was a mack.
- [scoffing]

143
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:36,699
If that's what you wanna call it.

144
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:41,912
He would want you to have
his apartment upstairs.

145
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:45,208
Uh, especially since your crib blew up.

146
00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:56,219
I'll earn my keep somehow.

147
00:12:56,302 --> 00:12:58,178
Goddamn right you will.

148
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:02,015
We fix this place up,
the doors gotta reopen.

149
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:06,103
- Talk for another day.
- Cool.

150
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:10,691
- Luke Cage here yet?
- Whoa, slow down, Aisha.

151
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:12,235
- What's wrong?
- [Luke] I'm Luke.

152
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:15,529
What you got to do with all this shit
happening up and down Lenox Avenue?

153
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:16,905
What are you talking about?

154
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:18,741
Zip snatched my daddy's championship ring

155
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:21,452
and hit about 20 other spots
all over uptown.

156
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,371
- Why?
- I don't care why.

157
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:25,080
You need to get my daddy's ring back.

158
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:27,666
You remember what he was like
before he got strung out?

159
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,502
Eddie's a good dude deep down.

160
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:32,880
To me, what's left of him is that ring.

161
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:36,467
The only reason why he didn't pawn it is
because I took it away from him.

162
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,052
Somebody's gotta protect his legacy.

163
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:41,555
- Even if he won't.
- [sighing]

164
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,182
Let me get into this.
See what the hell's going on.

165
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,894
Get into it?
You need to check these dudes!

166
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:48,854
Everybody heard about
what you did in the projects.

167
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:51,899
Don't be a punk and just stand by.

168
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:03,286
Different kind of chess gambit.

169
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:08,165
Cottonmouth figures if he can't drop you,
he'll get Harlem to push you out.

170
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,750
Where you going?

171
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,420
To make sure Cottonmouth
spells my name right.

172
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,591
They smashed all my displays!

173
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:19,593
Yo, they took my Les Paul.
That's my life.

174
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:20,761
Jacked me for my tips!

175
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:23,138
- I'm on it!
- [woman] I work hard for that money.

176
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:24,473
I'm on it!

177
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:34,567
[Soledad] Hey, you're late.

178
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,860
What? I got robbed.

179
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,280
Some guy stole my bag.
I had to whoop his ass.

180
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:42,408
What were you thinking?

181
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:44,702
I was thinking that I wanted my bag back.

182
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:46,495
- He could have killed you.
- [tsks]

183
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:48,581
<i>Mami,</i> please. I grew up here.

184
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:51,792
If you don't fight back,
they make you into a doormat.

185
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:55,296
You know who taught me that? You.

186
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:58,048
Things have changed up here, <i>mija.</i>

187
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,842
Things have changed everywhere.

188
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,303
Is...

189
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:04,555
Is why you came back home?

190
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:08,266
I wanted to come back
where things made sense, yeah.

191
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:13,814
What the... [groans]

192
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:15,316
[grunts]

193
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,443
- Where is he?
- Who?

194
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:18,902
Les Paul.

195
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:33,334
- Those two?
- Yeah.

196
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:36,128
- Let's go talk to them.
- Don't you need a gun?

197
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:37,463
I am the gun.

198
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:40,674
Yo, Plug One, Plug Two.

199
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:42,468
What is this? Your boyfriend?

200
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:43,802
You want some of this? [grunting]

201
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,806
[woman scoffs]

202
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:50,851
You know my name?

203
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:52,478
That's Luke Cage, asshole.

204
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:55,981
The next time you say my name...
I'm coming for you.

205
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,275
Now, when you wake up,

206
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:00,819
I want you to tell everybody
that you've been screwing with

207
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:04,365
that they got nothing to fear
from Cottonmouth, you understand?

208
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:05,866
Wake up? [grunts]

209
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,092
[man groaning]

210
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:28,639
I can't believe that bitch shot me.

211
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:31,058
Got a name on that "bitch" who shot you?

212
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:34,437
I ain't say I got shot.

213
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,188
No snitching, huh?

214
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:41,610
You remember me from Genghis Connie's?

215
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:44,112
Oh, shit.

216
00:16:45,113 --> 00:16:46,990
What happened? Who shot you?

217
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:49,410
I'm going back to Raleigh.

218
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:51,078
I've had enough of this shit.

219
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:52,455
[groans]

220
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:56,750
You ain't moving fast enough.

221
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:58,794
Aisha ain't like the others.

222
00:16:58,877 --> 00:17:01,213
She wants that ring back.

223
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:02,756
You gotta understand.

224
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,260
When her father was sick,
she came up in the streets all by herself.

225
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:09,597
She's tougher than she looks.

226
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,973
Aisha shot that dude?

227
00:17:11,974 --> 00:17:15,519
He was with Zip. He laughed at her,
and talked trash about the ring.

228
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:17,312
Where'd she get the gun?

229
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:20,608
Yo, I plead the eighth.

230
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,610
You mean the fifth.

231
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:25,237
Yeah, that shit. I plead the fifth.

232
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:29,116
Where is she?

233
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:31,744
Check the shop on St. Nick.

234
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:34,497
If she ain't there,
your guess is as good as mine.

235
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,836
Don't you get tired of hanging out
near crime scenes?

236
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:43,839
Who's this?

237
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:49,094
Is this is what you were
looking for this morning?

238
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:52,681
Uh-uh. It's evidence.
Part of my investigation.

239
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:54,517
- That's my property.
- Too bad.

240
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,644
Is she the reason rockets
keep getting dropped on your head?

241
00:17:57,478 --> 00:18:00,230
A good cop would ask the person
doing the shooting that question.

242
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,315
Oh, yeah, wise guy?
Well, how about this?

243
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:04,276
What's going on
between you and Cottonmouth?

244
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:08,697
He didn't like the way
I was washing dishes and he fired me.

245
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:11,366
Chaos rolls off you like water off a duck.

246
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:13,285
But it's gotta stop.

247
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:14,787
Innocent people are getting hurt.

248
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,831
Either be a part of the solution
or leave.

249
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:20,333
I will. I'll leave.

250
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:22,335
But first, I gotta do right by Pop.

251
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:27,550
[Misty] Hey!

252
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:31,136
- You going to Pop's memorial?
- Yeah.

253
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,513
Don't.

254
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:43,231
[Shades] You need to let this go.

255
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:45,526
No.

256
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:48,195
It makes you look weak.

257
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:51,532
I can't ignore him.

258
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,952
You can't let this dude drive you stupid.

259
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:59,122
It only helps his name ring out...
like yours used to.

260
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,918
[sighing] All right...

261
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:07,214
Mr. Gangster Consultant.

262
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:08,799
Take your shot.

263
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,301
- What would you do?
- Sell this club.

264
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,429
You can net three mil, easy,
on the real estate alone.

265
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:16,014
Not happening.

266
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:20,143
No one black has ever
done anything like this.

267
00:19:21,144 --> 00:19:23,981
Percy Sutton came close,
but that was years ago.

268
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:29,319
Harlem's Paradise is special.

269
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:33,531
And it's not going nowhere.

270
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:38,161
If you don't make the right moves now...

271
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,913
you are done.

272
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,087
This place is my reputation.

273
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:52,009
My blood.

274
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:55,721
My legacy.

275
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,773
[scoffs]

276
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:09,567
He's here.

277
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,588
You guys? Again?

278
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:37,220
[Stokes] There he is.

279
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,266
Dishwasher Lazarus.

280
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:43,936
You want your old job back?

281
00:20:46,604 --> 00:20:49,858
Costs to be a savior. Ask Jesus.

282
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:53,445
You started all this.
This is me finishing it.

283
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:56,281
You want Harlem? It's expensive.

284
00:20:56,364 --> 00:21:00,661
I don't want Harlem.
I just want you to stop messing with it.

285
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:03,496
This is my home.

286
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:06,750
You don't know a damn thing about it.

287
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:12,881
- [grunting]
- [bone breaking]

288
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:15,342
- [yells]
- [bone cracks]

289
00:21:15,425 --> 00:21:16,802
[groaning]

290
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:21,598
[bullet ricocheting]

291
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:26,687
[grunting]

292
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:31,233
Carl Lucas?

293
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,277
[Stokes] Whoa! Whoa!

294
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:41,243
It's called deductive reasoning.

295
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:46,498
If a rocket launcher couldn't stop me...
what's that little peashooter gonna do?

296
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,417
You wanna go to war?

297
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:51,962
Hmm?

298
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:56,174
I'll take you to war.

299
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:58,301
You don't have enough people.

300
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:00,470
This mob's not deep enough.

301
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:03,140
Ask your man, Shades.

302
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:04,933
You're supposed to be dead.

303
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,644
You can't kill me.

304
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:11,398
Keep my name out your mouth.

305
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:16,236
Or what?

306
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,239
[inhales deeply]

307
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:33,128
You know this son of a bitch?

308
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:35,713
It's a long story.

309
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:37,966
I'll make time.

310
00:22:49,186 --> 00:22:50,520
- Don't do that.
- What?

311
00:22:51,313 --> 00:22:52,772
Worried I'm gonna spill it?

312
00:22:53,731 --> 00:22:55,775
<i>Mami,</i> you're so superstitious.

313
00:22:56,693 --> 00:22:58,153
And you're not?

314
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:04,659
There's more to this than superstition.

315
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:11,624
That's a kind of yes/no thing.

316
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:17,005
There's a middle ground.

317
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,300
Unexplainable.

318
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,182
The hospital was attacked by men in masks.

319
00:23:27,265 --> 00:23:32,604
And the one I took down had a scar...
like from an autopsy.

320
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:37,067
Like he had died
and come back to life once before.

321
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,112
And his friends
broke in and killed Louisa.

322
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:42,739
The hospital wants to cover it up.

323
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:46,869
They're saying that
a junkie stabbed Louisa.

324
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,914
I was gonna go to the cops,
so they gave me a choice.

325
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,584
Actually, it wasn't a choice at all.

326
00:23:56,586 --> 00:23:58,255
I'm glad you came home.

327
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,716
I kinda had to.

328
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,095
Metro-General pretty much made sure
I can't work anywhere else in New York.

329
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,890
What would make you happy?

330
00:24:10,142 --> 00:24:12,185
I've seen a man...

331
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:14,812
a blind man who can see,

332
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:17,857
because his other senses
are so amplified.

333
00:24:19,651 --> 00:24:23,863
And this other man who survived
a shotgun blast to his head

334
00:24:23,947 --> 00:24:26,950
and recovered from a brain hemorrhage
in a few hours.

335
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:29,244
And they both needed my help.

336
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:32,205
I think that's what I want to do.

337
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:35,875
Is help people...

338
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,711
with abilities.

339
00:24:41,381 --> 00:24:47,012
You know what
your <i>abuela</i> said about these things?

340
00:24:49,181 --> 00:24:52,976
Well, you know I don't believe
in that Santeria mumbo jumbo.

341
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:58,315
She was a <i>curandera,</i> not a priestess.

342
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:03,528
The world isn't the world anymore, <i>mija.</i>

343
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:08,033
Aliens coming out of the sky.

344
00:25:08,116 --> 00:25:10,994
- People with silver hammers.
- [Claire sighs]

345
00:25:11,703 --> 00:25:13,288
Green monsters.

346
00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:19,586
All I know is...
everything happens for a reason.

347
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:25,258
And now, somehow... you're a part of it.

348
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:29,679
What do you call that?

349
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:32,307
[sighing] The worst luck in the world.

350
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:36,436
It's called fate.

351
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:44,236
[men grunting and gun firing
on television]

352
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:46,821
That's Carl Lucas.

353
00:25:48,406 --> 00:25:51,326
I did time with him at Seagate Prison
when I first got there.

354
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:55,830
Rackham, captain of the guards,
he had us work him over real good.

355
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:58,416
There's no way
he could've survived in one piece.

356
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:04,006
This nigga's half Houdini, half Ali.

357
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,591
There's a bullet for everyone.

358
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,344
Diamondback taught me that.

359
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:11,888
Say what?

360
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,890
I got something to show you.

361
00:26:17,102 --> 00:26:19,021
[man speaking Polish]

362
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:22,482
Russian?

363
00:26:22,565 --> 00:26:24,234
Ukrainian, I think.

364
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:25,902
Eastern European connection.

365
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:31,324
[Stokes] Kevlar?

366
00:26:31,408 --> 00:26:33,493
[Shades]
Must have a South American hookup.

367
00:26:33,576 --> 00:26:35,912
It's heavy duty. Military grade.

368
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,082
[speaking Polish]

369
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,923
[gunshot]

370
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,633
[man groaning]

371
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:51,511
This ain't shit.

372
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:52,762
- Wait for it.
- [whirring]

373
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,764
- Wait for it.
- [muffled explosion]

374
00:26:58,101 --> 00:26:59,977
[exclaiming]

375
00:27:00,062 --> 00:27:02,439
That is the illest shit
I've ever seen in my life!

376
00:27:02,522 --> 00:27:04,649
Are you serious?

377
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:06,818
Based on a prototype by Hammer.

378
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:10,238
The rounds are a composite,
invisible to metal detectors.

379
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:13,825
And they incinerate forensic evidence,
so they are untraceable.

380
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,787
What kind of metal does that?

381
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:20,707
Nothing from this Earth.

382
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,836
- The incident?
- That's what I hear.

383
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:27,046
Yo...

384
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,756
if you wanted to kill Jesus...

385
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:31,759
that's the bullet you'd use.

386
00:27:31,843 --> 00:27:34,053
That's why they call it the Judas.

387
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:38,975
Hmm... I can think of a few fools
I'd love to baptize with that joint.

388
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,727
[laughing]

389
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:44,147
How do I get 'em?

390
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,524
One of two ways.

391
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:49,068
You pay for it.

392
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:53,823
Or you ask Diamondback
to handle Carl Lucas for you.

393
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,120
I don't need Diamondback
to handle my problems.

394
00:27:58,203 --> 00:27:59,829
[inhaling sharply]

395
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,581
How much for the damn thing?

396
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:14,886
- Per bullet?
- Mmm-hmm.

397
00:28:14,969 --> 00:28:16,429
For real?

398
00:28:19,056 --> 00:28:20,225
God damn it.

399
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:23,770
Diamondback can front me.
I'm good for it.

400
00:28:23,853 --> 00:28:26,189
He ain't gonna front you a dime.

401
00:28:26,273 --> 00:28:28,275
You made too many mistakes.

402
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:30,860
He told you that?

403
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,488
Does he have to?

404
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:36,866
[chuckling]

405
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,743
I'll call him my damn self.

406
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:44,207
He ain't the same Diamondback.

407
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:50,004
If he does you this favor...
he's taking Harlem from you.

408
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,467
I'm just letting you know.

409
00:29:09,691 --> 00:29:14,028
I'll get Domingo his guns,
square everything away...

410
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:17,324
so Diamondback can front me the loan.

411
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:21,369
Then I'll kill Cage
so shit can get back to normal.

412
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:25,081
Let me make a few phone calls.

413
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,251
- My man.
- Hmm.

414
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:39,929
Hey, Captain.

415
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:43,433
We need to talk, seriously.

416
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:46,769
What's the problem?

417
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,145
Scarfe.

418
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,981
IAB hasn't officially said anything,

419
00:29:50,064 --> 00:29:53,360
but someone I trust is telling me
he's under investigation.

420
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:54,569
What?

421
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:58,990
[scoffs] Look, I've been riding
with Scarfe for years.

422
00:29:59,073 --> 00:30:00,908
Is he salty? Yeah.

423
00:30:00,992 --> 00:30:02,744
But dirty? Never.

424
00:30:02,827 --> 00:30:06,623
We have a lot of eyes on us, Misty.
Can't take any chances.

425
00:30:06,706 --> 00:30:08,291
What's this based on?

426
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:11,878
The night of the restaurant explosion
and Crispus Attucks raid,

427
00:30:11,961 --> 00:30:14,839
you and your partner logged into
the crime scene 40 minutes apart.

428
00:30:14,922 --> 00:30:16,216
So?

429
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:18,175
In the time that was unaccounted for,

430
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,553
your only source of information
for the barber shop shooting,

431
00:30:20,637 --> 00:30:22,138
Chico Diaz, went missing.

432
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:23,931
He was last seen with Scarfe.

433
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:26,768
That's not true.

434
00:30:26,851 --> 00:30:30,187
Scarfe left the precinct to pick up Chico,
but Chico was gone.

435
00:30:31,188 --> 00:30:34,984
So, he picks up a witness unsupervised,
which is against protocol,

436
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,569
doesn't even log it in,

437
00:30:36,653 --> 00:30:39,822
and he still has time to get
to Genghis Connie's before anyone else.

438
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:41,198
What, is he clairvoyant?

439
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:42,867
He's not telling you everything.

440
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:45,828
Look, they are wasting their time on this.

441
00:30:46,746 --> 00:30:48,080
[Scarfe] Good news.

442
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:50,917
Gyro guy's back.

443
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,170
Got your nasty, mystery meat for you.

444
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:55,755
Veggie for me.

445
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,718
Captain, LT.
Y'all hitting on my partner again?

446
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:03,137
[Perez scoffs] She's fair game
when you ain't around.

447
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,431
[Scarfe chuckles]

448
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:08,560
Let me know when you have something that,
uh, we might be able to use, Detective.

449
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:14,482
What was that about?

450
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:17,610
Luke Cage.

451
00:31:17,694 --> 00:31:21,197
They think we're losing sight
of Cottonmouth by focusing on him.

452
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:25,952
That's what happens when you start hawking
raffle tickets in your own precinct.

453
00:31:26,035 --> 00:31:27,662
You forget how to do police work.

454
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,666
Hey. When I get back from the memorial,

455
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:34,961
you good with going over all the shit
that's gone down since Crispus Attucks?

456
00:31:35,044 --> 00:31:37,672
Sure.
I'll get started while you're gone.

457
00:31:37,755 --> 00:31:39,549
Go say goodbye to your friend.

458
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:48,350
[phone ringing]

459
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,772
Scarfe.

460
00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:59,444
Yeah, got it. [exhaling sharply]

461
00:31:59,527 --> 00:32:01,654
Y'all ready, baby? [chuckles]

462
00:32:01,738 --> 00:32:03,740
Let's do it.

463
00:32:03,823 --> 00:32:06,368
Whoo! Give it to me, baby. [chuckles]

464
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:08,745
Oh! Thank you.

465
00:32:08,828 --> 00:32:10,955
[laughing] Whoo!

466
00:32:12,123 --> 00:32:13,290
Whoo!

467
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:14,792
[Zip] That's it, that's it.
[man] Man, take my money.

468
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:17,337
[Zip] The banker, baby,
that's what they call me.

469
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,171
[man 1] Double or nothing.
[man 2] Bettin' six, bettin' six.

470
00:32:19,255 --> 00:32:22,174
[conversation continues indistinctly]

471
00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:23,385
Damn.

472
00:32:23,468 --> 00:32:26,763
You guys actually take lunch breaks
like real employees, huh?

473
00:32:29,432 --> 00:32:31,559
Any of you guys at Crispus Attucks
the other night?

474
00:32:31,643 --> 00:32:33,603
- Uh... uh-uh.
- Nah, man.

475
00:32:39,108 --> 00:32:41,235
[scoffs] Like I need these bitches.

476
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:42,945
[gun cocking]

477
00:32:46,991 --> 00:32:48,451
[bullet ricocheting]

478
00:33:00,963 --> 00:33:02,882
[choking]

479
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:05,552
Aisha's ring. You got it?

480
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:08,262
[groaning]

481
00:33:08,345 --> 00:33:10,515
Think about where you are.

482
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:14,644
It's hallowed ground... this park.

483
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:17,229
Named for Jackie Robinson.

484
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,607
[grunting]

485
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:24,195
It's here. It's all around you...

486
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:26,531
if you respect yourself enough
to take a look.

487
00:33:26,614 --> 00:33:28,199
At what?

488
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:30,410
Our legacy.

489
00:33:30,493 --> 00:33:31,828
[choking]

490
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,125
[Zip grunting]

491
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:53,808
[Perez sighs] I don't know
what the hell you've been doing,

492
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:55,226
but IA's onto you,

493
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:57,520
and they've given the captain a heads-up.

494
00:33:57,604 --> 00:33:59,355
You're being investigated, Scarfe.

495
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:02,108
Captain was poking around Misty,
seeing what she knows.

496
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:06,112
But... we've got bigger problems than IA.

497
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:11,451
Cottonmouth needs Domingo's guns
from evidence. Now.

498
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:13,828
Goddamn Cottonmouth.

499
00:34:15,872 --> 00:34:17,081
What do you suggest?

500
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:21,461
It'd be easier just to kill him.

501
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:24,631
Not really.

502
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:26,799
We don't know if he's got a backup plan.

503
00:34:26,883 --> 00:34:29,176
You better have a backup plan
for getting them guns.

504
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:32,805
[Perez] <i>I got Sergeant MacClean</i>
<i>from property on it.</i>

505
00:34:33,765 --> 00:34:35,767
[Scarfe] <i>MacClean?</i>

506
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,770
<i>That fat donut-eating bastard</i>
<i>is gonna get us burnt.</i>

507
00:34:38,853 --> 00:34:41,147
[Perez] <i>We'll be fine. He's on payroll.</i>

508
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,815
<i>If we go down, he goes down.</i>

509
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:50,364
[exhales]

510
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:08,090
[Luke] Aisha, I got something for you.

511
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:21,604
You with them stickup boys?

512
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:25,149
- No.
- Good.

513
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:28,110
'Cause we ain't got shit left.

514
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:33,407
[Luke] I'm sorry about
what happened to your shop.

515
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:36,368
Back in the days, people had respect.

516
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:39,496
I seen 'em all come and go.

517
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:43,125
Nicky. Fritz. Azie.

518
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,002
It's always been wild.

519
00:35:46,087 --> 00:35:49,256
But people
carried groceries for old ladies.

520
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,217
Your name meant something.

521
00:35:52,844 --> 00:35:55,471
Maybe that's why they call it
"back in the day."

522
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,183
You're Eddie?

523
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:03,104
The one and only.

524
00:36:03,187 --> 00:36:04,731
I need to find your daughter.

525
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:09,569
She still carrying on about that ring?
It ain't worth shit.

526
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:14,031
Maybe it reminds her of better times...

527
00:36:15,783 --> 00:36:17,493
back in the day.

528
00:36:26,335 --> 00:36:27,920
What about your father?

529
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:30,798
Did he play the game?

530
00:36:30,882 --> 00:36:32,341
Of course.

531
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,802
Baseball is a game
passed from father to son.

532
00:36:35,803 --> 00:36:38,389
That's why you don't see no niggas
playing the game no more.

533
00:36:38,472 --> 00:36:40,099
'Cause all the fathers is gone.

534
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:42,685
[scoffs]

535
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,148
Aisha's the one
had the idea for this damn shop.

536
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:50,777
Said I could sign some autographs...

537
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:53,905
and keep my hands on something positive.

538
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:58,575
I said,
"Baby, everything I touch turns to shit."

539
00:36:59,744 --> 00:37:01,578
She never did listen.

540
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:09,253
Quit letting her down.

541
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:13,758
If she comes back...
tell her Luke Cage came by.

542
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:16,761
I need to see her.

543
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:20,932
You him, huh?

544
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:24,060
Your name is all over Harlem today.

545
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:26,688
Not in a good way.

546
00:37:28,064 --> 00:37:29,857
I'm about to change that.

547
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:32,735
You should do the same.

548
00:37:35,863 --> 00:37:37,073
[door closes]

549
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:47,583
That's him.

550
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,170
- [Soledad] Who?
- [Claire] Luke.

551
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:54,548
Oh, he's trouble.
He reminds me of your father.

552
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:58,635
Yo, that's Luke Cage.

553
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,305
- You know him?
- Yeah. From the barber shop.

554
00:38:01,388 --> 00:38:03,140
He's for real.

555
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:36,924
Shit.

556
00:38:40,636 --> 00:38:43,347
Sorry, Pop. You got me.

557
00:39:12,043 --> 00:39:13,044
Hi.

558
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:16,547
You know the man?

559
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:57,338
[cell phone chiming]

560
00:40:29,245 --> 00:40:31,247
I never really knew my father.

561
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,708
I always said that...

562
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:36,585
outside of my conception...

563
00:40:38,129 --> 00:40:39,713
he was never there for me.

564
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:44,969
It got easier and easier

565
00:40:45,887 --> 00:40:47,304
to think of him as dead.

566
00:40:48,222 --> 00:40:49,806
And now that he is...

567
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,643
I need him.

568
00:40:52,726 --> 00:40:54,645
More than ever.

569
00:40:54,728 --> 00:40:56,272
[shakily] I was gonna tell him...

570
00:40:57,273 --> 00:40:59,150
I've got one on the way.

571
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:01,318
He's a grandfather.

572
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:06,365
I just hope that
by being in my son's life...

573
00:41:07,616 --> 00:41:09,326
I'm able to do the things that...

574
00:41:10,995 --> 00:41:13,664
seems like Pop did for everybody else.

575
00:41:24,383 --> 00:41:26,052
Aisha.

576
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:27,929
I took care of it.

577
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:30,973
You don't have to do anything else.

578
00:41:31,765 --> 00:41:34,601
And take your hand... out of your purse.

579
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:46,572
Would anyone else like to say anything?

580
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,701
[Stokes] I have a few words.

581
00:42:01,045 --> 00:42:02,379
[clearing throat]

582
00:42:07,718 --> 00:42:09,971
Henry Hunter was my mentor...

583
00:42:10,054 --> 00:42:12,223
[inhales deeply]

584
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:13,933
and oldest friend.

585
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:16,936
Taught me streets the hard way.

586
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:19,396
Y'all don't remember
the sound of his fist,

587
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,190
but that's how he got his name.

588
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:22,608
[chuckling] Pop.

589
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:26,653
But he changed.

590
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:29,156
He evolved.

591
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,117
[all agreeing]

592
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,784
You see, Harlem would do that to you.

593
00:42:33,535 --> 00:42:37,581
Where some people saw a war zone,
Pop always saw a pasture.

594
00:42:37,664 --> 00:42:43,545
A breeding ground for artistry...
greatness.

595
00:42:43,629 --> 00:42:45,797
[all agreeing]

596
00:42:45,881 --> 00:42:47,508
From Billy Strayhorn...

597
00:42:48,717 --> 00:42:51,678
Teddy Riley, Big L, A$AP Rocky.

598
00:42:51,762 --> 00:42:53,305
All those brothers...

599
00:42:54,223 --> 00:42:57,101
came from right here.

600
00:42:57,184 --> 00:42:58,727
[all agreeing]

601
00:43:00,271 --> 00:43:04,733
Roses from the concrete,
all 'cause of people like Pop.

602
00:43:06,735 --> 00:43:10,447
Now, I believe that whatever
doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

603
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:12,241
And that's how
we got to look at Pop's death.

604
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:14,118
[all agreeing]

605
00:43:16,412 --> 00:43:18,455
Now, they never caught the shooter.

606
00:43:20,582 --> 00:43:24,295
But I have faith that he is rotting
in the depths of hell.

607
00:43:25,296 --> 00:43:26,797
I miss Pop.

608
00:43:28,174 --> 00:43:31,385
I promise you with all my might...

609
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:36,348
that even though
we are being attacked from all sides

610
00:43:36,432 --> 00:43:38,642
by foreign interlopers...

611
00:43:39,768 --> 00:43:41,020
strangers...

612
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:43,397
with arcane abilities...

613
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,981
[all agreeing]

614
00:43:49,778 --> 00:43:51,197
...I promise you...

615
00:43:52,114 --> 00:43:54,450
I stay true to what we have right here.

616
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:58,537
'Cause that's what Pop woulda wanted.

617
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,164
[all agreeing]

618
00:44:00,247 --> 00:44:02,374
[man] Yes, yes, yes. Yes!

619
00:44:21,602 --> 00:44:22,936
[screams]

620
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:26,690
[yelling]

621
00:44:53,049 --> 00:44:54,801
I asked Pop once...

622
00:44:56,512 --> 00:45:00,182
why he didn't want people
to curse in his shop.

623
00:45:01,183 --> 00:45:04,478
And why we had
to wear these ugly smocks.

624
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:06,647
- [people chuckling]
- He said...

625
00:45:08,064 --> 00:45:12,569
"These kids
need to see a man go to work...

626
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:18,742
every day...
and to be in the presence of men...

627
00:45:19,826 --> 00:45:23,038
in uniform putting in work."

628
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:24,540
[all agreeing]

629
00:45:27,251 --> 00:45:28,877
I didn't want to walk in late,

630
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,088
but... I was trying to do
what Pop always did.

631
00:45:34,383 --> 00:45:35,634
Help those in need.

632
00:45:36,677 --> 00:45:41,139
And protect them from the forces
that would do them harm.

633
00:45:44,017 --> 00:45:47,062
[inhaling deeply]
At first, it was selfish...

634
00:45:48,397 --> 00:45:50,399
because my name was attached to it.

635
00:45:51,024 --> 00:45:52,693
But then it got bigger.

636
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:58,949
If we try to protect only ourselves...

637
00:45:59,032 --> 00:46:01,827
without looking out
for those people closest to us...

638
00:46:04,037 --> 00:46:05,331
then we lose.

639
00:46:08,584 --> 00:46:10,711
Pop never forgot his people.

640
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,506
Where some people saw hard rock kids...

641
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:17,968
he saw precious jewels.

642
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:23,265
He reminded me that
diamonds are formed by pressure...

643
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:26,227
covered in dirt.

644
00:46:27,311 --> 00:46:29,020
But then you polish them...

645
00:46:29,938 --> 00:46:31,106
and they shine.

646
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:32,983
[all agreeing]

647
00:46:37,613 --> 00:46:39,323
[all exclaiming]

648
00:46:39,906 --> 00:46:44,328
Pop saw the shine in everyone
that walked in his barber shop.

649
00:46:44,411 --> 00:46:47,873
He cut their hair.
He listened to their problems.

650
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,043
And he made them feel better
about the world and themselves.

651
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:57,466
We have to strive on a daily basis...

652
00:46:57,549 --> 00:47:00,010
to do the same for each other.

653
00:47:01,553 --> 00:47:04,556
And sometimes, that's gonna mean
standing up to a bully.

654
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,141
[all agreeing]

655
00:47:06,224 --> 00:47:10,145
Especially...
if he calls himself a friend.

656
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:13,357
- [all exclaiming]
- [man] Talk about it.

657
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:17,986
I don't believe in Harlem.

658
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:24,075
I believe in the people
who make Harlem what it is.

659
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,744
[cheering and applauding]

660
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:49,017
I believe this... belongs to you.

661
00:47:52,228 --> 00:47:54,147
So, you're one of them, huh?

662
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:57,150
You mean someone who gives a damn?

663
00:47:57,233 --> 00:47:58,485
Yeah.

664
00:47:59,486 --> 00:48:00,821
[chuckling]

665
00:48:03,198 --> 00:48:05,241
[indistinct chatter]

666
00:48:18,046 --> 00:48:19,297
I was wrong.

667
00:48:20,341 --> 00:48:21,592
I'm glad you came.

668
00:48:21,675 --> 00:48:24,094
Embarrassing you in public
was much better than doing it

669
00:48:24,177 --> 00:48:26,805
behind closed doors
in your cheap-ass club.

670
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,101
Never confuse the battle with the war.

671
00:48:34,688 --> 00:48:36,690
Next suit that gets damaged...

672
00:48:37,816 --> 00:48:39,401
I'm taxing you.

673
00:48:41,403 --> 00:48:43,154
[laughing]

674
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:47,075
Yes.

675
00:48:51,372 --> 00:48:54,332
Hell of an impression you made in there.

676
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:55,584
I'm sorry, did you just
pay me a compliment?

677
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:57,043
No, I didn't.

678
00:48:57,127 --> 00:49:01,339
You need to stop with this pissing contest
before more people get killed.

679
00:49:01,423 --> 00:49:03,133
Maybe if y'all stopped him
in the first place,

680
00:49:03,216 --> 00:49:04,718
no one would've had to die.

681
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:07,888
I will get him the right way.

682
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:10,849
- The system will win.
- Forget the system.

683
00:49:10,932 --> 00:49:13,560
Arrests lead to indictments.
And indictments lead to pleas.

684
00:49:13,644 --> 00:49:15,937
There's always a bigger fish,
a bigger angle.

685
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:17,355
A slap on the wrist.

686
00:49:17,439 --> 00:49:20,901
Boom. Right back in business.
I ain't going for that.

687
00:49:20,984 --> 00:49:22,944
You just started World War III in there.

688
00:49:23,028 --> 00:49:27,198
And your ass might be bulletproof,
but Harlem ain't.

689
00:49:27,282 --> 00:49:29,618
Harlem is gonna suffer.

690
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:31,578
So if you aren't gonna help us
take him down,

691
00:49:31,662 --> 00:49:33,789
then you need to leave right now, Luke,

692
00:49:33,872 --> 00:49:36,082
before you make things worse.

693
00:49:41,129 --> 00:49:43,674
I'm sorry things couldn't be
different between us.

694
00:49:46,051 --> 00:49:48,011
But I ain't going nowhere.

695
00:49:57,896 --> 00:49:58,980
