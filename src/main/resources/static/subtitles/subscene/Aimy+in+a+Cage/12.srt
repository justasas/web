00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,900
<i>Episode 12</i>

20
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,830
- Does it still hurt? <br>- Don't come over.

21
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,620
What did you do to Brother Shao Tian?

22
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,100
What did you do to him?

23
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,110
Don't worry. He's not dead yet.

24
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,490
You are a killer and a monster.

25
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,260
I don't believe what you said. I'm going to find Brother Shao Tian.

26
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,120
Without my consent, you are not going anywhere.

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,890
Why should I listen to you?

28
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,910
Why must I get your consent?

29
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,130
If you don't want your Brother Shao Tian to die a quick death,

30
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,870
you better keep quiet.

31
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,870
Let me go in.

32
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,000
Let me go. Let me go in.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,140
Jiang Yu!

34
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,170
Why are you not letting me in?

35
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,730
Jiang Yu.

36
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,800
I want to see Cai Hong. Let me go.

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,020
- Stop. <br>- Why are you not letting me in?

38
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,290
Stop. What are you doing?

39
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,850
What right do you have to imprison Cai Hong. You are breaking the law.

40
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,180
You dare to talk to me about laws?

41
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,750
You keep up with them through your own methods.

42
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,890
What do you mean?

43
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,960
Still pretending?

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,000
Money, to you, is more important than life.

45
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,250
You are personally saying that I stole Ling Ling's money.

46
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,690
Where is the evidence?

47
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,260
I hold to it <i>follow the law</i> but

48
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,550
you just want to hide

49
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,390
Isn't that so?

50
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,260
Cut the crap.

51
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,870
Let's see how far he can get away.

52
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,670
Let's go.

53
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,560
Cai Hong. Have a good recovery. I will think of a way to visit you.

54
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,460
<i>Jiang Yu, will never let this go. </i>

55
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,830
<i>Brother Shao Tian.</i>

56
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,100
<i>I will wait for you.</i>

57
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,020
Da Chuen.

58
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,850
Mr Jiang. Why did you come?

59
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,030
I came to take a look.

60
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,600
Da Chuen.

61
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,470
Did Shao Tian notice any loopholes yesterday?

62
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,990
He definitely didn't.

63
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,140
Is there really anyone in this world who values money more than life?

64
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,830
This is impossible.

65
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,400
If one has no money but is still alive, he can still work. But if one is not alive...

66
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,950
what's the use of having money?

67
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,560
Sorry, Mr Jiang. I'm an unrefined person. I talk without thinking.

68
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,830
Please forgive me.

69
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,380
You are right. Zhou Shao Tian was definitely acting that day. Where did we go wrong?

70
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,210
Mr Jiang. What are you looking for? Let me help you to find it.

71
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,630
No need. I will do it on my own.

72
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,560
Okay.

73
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,050
<i>Put it on for me.</i>

74
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,660
<i>You agreed?</i>

75
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,390
Miss Wu. Does your wound still hurt?

76
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,870
No, thank you.

77
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,510
It's time for your medicines. This is for the fever and pain.

78
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,830
I have almost recovered. Can I be discharged?

79
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,020
You can't. Mr Jiang has instructed that you should stay here until you are fully recovered.

80
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:06,310
Nurse. I took a loan with high interest. They won't let me off.

81
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:12,210
I'm afraid that they will find my home. They will use cruel tactics. They will definitely not let my family off.

82
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,970
Please help me to check if I can go home.

83
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:20,450
Miss Wu. It's not that I don't want to help you. It's that you can't leave the hospital in your condition.

84
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,010
Our hospital is responsible for our patients.

85
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,980
Here, take your medicine first.

86
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,490
Miss Wu. This is the way. As long as you take your medicine regularly, you will recover faster from your wound.

87
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,390
Thank you, Nurse. I'm tired and would like to sleep.

88
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,310
Come. Let me help you.

89
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,430
Slowly.

90
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,990
Thanks.

91
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:29,930
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

92
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,850
What are you doing here again? Looking for a beating?

93
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,190
Does this hospital belong to you?

94
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,040
Does this bench belong to you?

95
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,230
Can't I even take a seat?

96
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,680
What's wrong?

97
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,940
Young Master.

98
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,430
What are you up to?

99
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,030
I'm taking a seat. So what?

100
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,960
If Wu Cai Hong were to find out your true colour, what do you think she will do?

101
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,740
I was even almost tricked by you.

102
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,020
You are being too serious over a small bracelet.

103
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:33,530
Jiang Yu, with your crafty ways and the backing of the banks, try to catch me.

104
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,330
You captured Cai Hong.

105
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,900
If you dare harm Cai Hong,

106
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,010
I won't let you off.

107
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,470
Why won't you let me off?

108
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,110
You did a lot of unethical things. Who should be the one who shouldn't be left off?

109
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,820
Take your time sitting here.

110
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,020
I'm going to visit your girlfriend.

111
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,410
Wu Cai Hong.

112
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,350
Wu Cai Hong.

113
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,340
What's wrong?

114
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,530
- Where is Cai Hong? <br>- Are you blind? Why are you still asking?

115
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,880
Let me tell you, Jiang Yu. You are the cause of this. If anything were to happen to Cai Hong, I won't let you off.

116
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,030
Why don't you find her and you will know? Move aside.

117
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,440
You need to give me an explanation for this.

118
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,460
Stay far away from me. Let's go.

119
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,580
The one who should stay far away from me is you. Find her now.

120
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,830
Go. What are you still doing here? Look for her now.

121
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,940
Wu Cai Hong, come out!

122
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,300
Who are you? What are you doing?

123
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,550
We are looking for Wu Cai Hong.

124
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,080
- She is not in. <br>- Not in?

125
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,990
She owes us money. Do you know that today is the deadline?

126
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,190
Who owes you money? Nonsense. Leave now.

127
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,650
Keep quiet.

128
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,380
Buddies.

129
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,070
Capture this young girl.

130
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,200
Sell her to the brothel.

131
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,210
Let me go. What are you doing?

132
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,060
- Let me go! <br>- What are you doing?

133
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,720
I'm begging you to let me go.

134
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,220
- Mom! <br>- Stop that.

135
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,880
- Cai Hong. <br>- Sis.

136
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,010
- What are you doing? <br>- Wu Cai Hong, you are back just in time.

137
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,140
I'm here to get back the money from you today.

138
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,310
Cai Hong, leave now. These people won't go easy on you. Leave now.

139
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,930
Leave? It's not that easy.

140
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,300
I was the one who borrowed the money.

141
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,970
If you want to kill or cut, do it to me. I would bear it all. Let go of my stepmom and my sister.

142
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,170
Fine. Buddies, let her go.

143
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,950
Sirs, let's do this.

144
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,740
Don't take away my daughter.

145
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,210
You can sell me. I'm not that bad.

146
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,850
I have been to the north and south and am a star. <i>she is worldly and a good luck charm.</i>

147
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,450
I'm not too bad.

148
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,410
Stepmom.

149
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,820
Kiddo, keep quiet when adults are talking.

150
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,290
Let me tell you. I'm not operating an old folk's home. I don't need an old hag like you.

151
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,800
Sir. You are wrong in saying this.

152
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,100
Move aside. Let's go.

153
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,040
Let me go. Let's talk.

154
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,680
Let's go.

155
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,270
Let go of my daughter.

156
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,270
Stop there. Let her go.

157
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,170
Let her go.

158
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,710
- Let her go. <br>- Brother Shao Tian.

159
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,910
Let her go.

160
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,220
What are you bragging about? You want to return the loan on her behalf, right?

161
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,260
Do you have the ability to repay her loan?

162
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:11,290
Brother Zhou. Cai Hong took out a loan with high interest for you. If you are a man,

163
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,940
you would face these people without me having to tell you.

164
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,100
Zhou Shao Tian. Do you think I don't know who you are? Don't waste my time.

165
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,110
You still owe me the loan with interest. Pay back the loan immediately.

166
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,690
She is such a beautiful girl. If you want to see her again, I'm afraid you will have to go to the brothel.

167
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,310
You!

168
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,410
Brother Shao Tian, stop fighting.

169
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,620
I'm begging you. Let him go.

170
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,090
Scram!

171
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,060
Cai Hong.

172
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,610
Beat him.

173
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,670
- Brother Shao Tian. <br>- Stop. The money that she owes...

174
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,030
Who do you think you are?

175
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,900
Stop.

176
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,790
What did you want to say just now? Speak.

177
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:34,070
I said that even if you beat me to death,

178
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,940
I can't pay back this loan.

179
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,410
Is that so?

180
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,810
Still pretending? You don't have the money and you are still pretending to be a Young Master?

181
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,530
Enough.

182
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,500
Stop beating him.

183
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,220
Jiang Yu, please help.

184
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,750
I'm begging you.

185
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:03,140
Still pretending? Are you going to pay back your loan?

186
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,480
I can save him but you must agree to my terms.

187
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,930
What terms?

188
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,950
Speak now.

189
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:15,300
I haven't thought of them yet. Agree first before I tell you.

190
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,090
Okay, I agree.

191
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,390
Who cares? What is the big deal.

192
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,470
Stop the beating.

193
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:28,280
How much does she owe you? What's the total?

194
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:39,520
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

195
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,350
Brother Shao Tian, are you okay?

196
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,630
I'm fine.

197
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,830
What did you want me to promise you?

198
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,580
Come back with me.

199
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,430
Why should I go back with you?

200
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,460
You just promised me that.

201
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,680
No.

202
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,080
Jiang Yu. I won't let Cai Hong leave with you.

203
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,550
That day, you clearly had the chance to help her

204
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,010
but you didn't. You already made your decision.

205
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,790
Cai Hong is a splendor woman, for that

206
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,480
you will only hinder her. <i>( hold her back) </i>

207
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,900
Mom. How could you say this to Brother Shao Tian?

208
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,790
Brother Shao Tian. Don't worry about me.

209
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,620
I know what I should do. I will be fine.

210
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:03,620
No. You can't leave with him. He will harm you.

211
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,120
He won't harm me.

212
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,950
Let's leave.

213
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:27,470
Cai Hong! <br>♫<i> So long, I have waited for so long... </i>♫

214
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:34,290
♫<i> Waited for your love to bloom. </i>♫

215
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:40,750
♫<i> Desperately, I was desperately struggling to find... </i>♫

216
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:47,150
♫<i> Yet couldn't find the way to your heart. </i>♫

217
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:56,410
♫<i> I'm not willing to give up (the love), but I can't have it either. </i>♫

218
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:02,920
♫<i> I fight a bitter battle between advancing and retreating. </i>♫

219
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:09,170
♫<i> I didn't see through to your eyes or heart </i>♫

220
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:14,990
♫<i> but I've already fallen in love with your tenderness. </i>♫

221
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:24,950
<i>Zhou Shao Tian. Let's see how long you can hang on before you come and beg me.</i>

222
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,150
You paid back my loan and even wanted me to accept your terms.

223
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,920
Speak. What are the terms?

224
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,950
Now you are so anxious to talk to me.

225
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,320
Even if you are evil and have harsh conditions, I will not be afraid of you.

226
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,900
Speak.

227
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,070
Sign the slave contract

228
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,050
and be a servant in our family.

229
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,330
I don't agree.

230
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,900
Do you have any other choice?

231
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,820
I just don't understand.

232
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,290
You paid off such a big loan, this could have bought you many servants.

233
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,110
Why me?

234
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,810
Because torturing you has become my greatest pleasure in life.

235
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,910
You are a pervert.

236
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:39,840
Check this over. If there are no problems, use your finger print to seal it.

237
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,840
It's three years. You will be free after three years.

238
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,900
It's only just three years.

239
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,060
As for the day you were hurt, the day Zhou Shao Tian would have confessed...

240
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,130
Who would have wanted the money instead of life?

241
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,530
Brother Shao Tian didn't do it. Why should he admit to it?

242
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,270
You're not the devil,

243
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,480
however, with a cut hand comes labor.

244
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,960
Even if you were a monster, I would not believe you.

245
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,190
If I'm a monster, you are a fool.

246
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,980
Think whatever you want. Return the bracelet to me.

247
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,720
Starting from now, you are Jiang family's servant.

248
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,050
Where are you going? Return the bracelet to me.

249
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,330
Brother, where did you go?

250
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,470
I have been waiting for you the whole afternoon.

251
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,630
Fei Fei. Send someone to pay back Wu Cai Hong's loan with interest.

252
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,060
Brother. Why are we helping her to pay off her debt?

253
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,700
Because she signed a three year contract with me as our servant.

254
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,730
Brother, we are not lacking in any servants.

255
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,090
Even more so, what can Wu Cai Hong do?

256
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,360
Enough. Go when I tell you to. I still have work to do.

257
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,890
Finishing cleaning, I'm exhausted.

258
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:15,100
Mom. I did the cleaning and not you. Why are you tired?

259
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,460
I'm tired just by seeing you hard at work.

260
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,690
Come on. Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

261
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,340
Mom. I was scared to death today.

262
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,840
Your sister is really soft-hearted. We were unable to help ourselves,

263
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,560
but in order to help Zhou Shao Tian, she went to ask for help from the loan sharks.

264
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,470
Those robbers didn't touch her.

265
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,290
Sister is still in the hospital. I'm going to deliver some food to her.

266
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,430
You don't need to worry about this. Jiang Yu is there. She won't starve.

267
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:50,680
Don't think that he is a cold and emotionless person on the exterior. I can tell that he's interested in your sister.

268
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:57,950
If not, why would he spend so much money on your sister? What's the problem with going through hardship with him?

269
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,240
Mom. I don't like you behaving this way. Brother Shao Tian and his family treat sister very well too.

270
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,080
I support Brother Shao Tian.

271
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,670
What do you know? He is different from the past now.

272
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,080
If your sister stays with that poor guy, she won't have any future.

273
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,000
Okay, I'm not going to argue with you anymore.

274
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,270
Even if I don't need to deliver any food to sister, I'm going to deliver a change of clothes to her.

275
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:23,920
By the way, when you go there, help to bathe your sister. It's not convenient for her as she is injured.

276
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,510
Remember to tell her that I miss her.

277
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,090
When she has a good life with Jiang Yu, don't let her forget me. Understand?

278
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,740
Mom. How could you be like this?

279
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:39,010
What's wrong with being a rich man who will let you eat, dress and live well?

280
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,740
So vulgar.

281
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,170
You!

282
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,980
You remember that.

283
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,490
The doctor says that your body is in good health. What is the problem?

284
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,540
Thus, he prescribed some sedatives.

285
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,960
-Let's take a break now. <br>-Ok

286
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,920
They are now prescribing it.

287
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,060
I am a bit tired.

288
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,320
Also, I should take a break since I am tired.

289
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:13,580
The last time, you placed the lipstick in my bag and framed me for being a thief. Right?

290
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,540
Why are you saying that I framed you. If you stole,

291
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,670
why did the police catch you?

292
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,260
It was you who framed me. I have never seen anyone as bad as you.

293
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,470
You are the bad one instead. Your sister is a bad person too. Your entire family is bad.

294
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,730
You dare to scold my sister and my family? You are the bad person instead.

295
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,650
So what if I insult you. It's all because of your family's wrongdoing that karma got to you.

296
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,990
Who gives you the right to scold my family?

297
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,760
What's wrong with me scolding you?

298
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,680
- Fei Fei, keep calm. <br>- What are you doing?

299
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,980
- Why are you pushing me? <br>- So what if I pushed you?

300
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,310
- I will beat you. <br>- You dare lay a hand on me?

301
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,870
<i>Why does that sound like Cai Yun's voice?</i>

302
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,300
<i>It's Cai Yun's voice. Am I dreaming?</i>

303
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,060
Let's talk in a civilised manner.

304
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,890
Why are you grasping my clothes?

305
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,130
Stop fighting.

306
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,550
- Who says you can hit me? <br>- Stop fighting.

307
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,210
Let go now.

308
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,180
Mother.

309
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,240
Mother.

310
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,260
Quick.

311
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,430
-Mother

312
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,780
Mother. Mother.

313
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,730
Fei Fei.

314
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,080
Mother.

315
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,450
Mother, wake up.

316
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,800
Mother.

317
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,430
-Stop scaring me. <br>-Why you?

318
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,290
Mom, wake up now.

319
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:50,160
Sister, she won't die, right? I didn't do this on purpose.

320
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,460
Cai Yun. Remember this. Don't say anything at all.

321
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,680
Doctor. Doctor! Doctor!

322
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,920
Doctor! Doc...

323
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,250
Doctor. Doctor!

324
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,340
<i>Emergency Room </i>

325
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,740
Fei Fei. How did this happen?

326
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,880
How could this happen?

327
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,830
I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm sorry.

328
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,660
It was...

329
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,470
It was me. I pushed Madam Jiang down the stairs.

330
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,800
It was her.

331
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,900
She pushed Mom down the stairs.

332
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,100
Is this true?

333
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,950
Yes.

334
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,430
I fought with Fei Fei just now.

335
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,680
I lost my grip and pushed Madam Jiang down the stairs.

336
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,530
I didn't do this on purpose.

337
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm really sorry.

338
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,680
Brother. Just now, Mom and I were walking to the porch to take a rest.

339
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,780
They both came over to cause trouble. They started the fight first

340
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,880
and pushed Mom down the stairs.

341
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,590
Blame me for not protecting Mom. If anything were to happen to her,

342
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,950
what would I do?

343
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,890
Let me ask you again.

344
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,990
What Fei Fei said,

345
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,890
is it the truth?

346
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,020
Yes.

347
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,440
I was the one who pushed Madam Jiang down the stairs but I didn't do it on purpose.

348
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,870
I...

349
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,980
I don't want to listen to your excuses. If anything were to happen to my Mom,

350
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,110
I won't let you off.

351
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,430
Doctor. How is my mother?

352
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,650
Mr Jiang, I'm sorry.

353
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,920
I prescribed whatever treatments I could for Madam Jiang

354
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,320
but she is still unconscious.

355
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,880
Madam Jiang could have a concussion and there are blood clots in her brain.

356
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,860
If the blood clots go down, she may regain her consciousness.

357
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,720
Maybe? What do you mean by that? When will my mother be conscious?

358
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,490
This will depend on God's will.

359
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:48,070
It may be a few days, months or forever.

360
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,210
I'm sorry.

361
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,430
I'm really sorry.

362
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,560
- Why? What did we do wrong?! <br>- Let my sister go!

363
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,780
- Why did you harm my family?! <br>- I'm sorry.

364
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,120
Your father already harmed my father. Why did you harm my mom?!

365
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,580
Why?! Why?!

366
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:29,060
Why? Why?!

367
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,020
- Keep calm. <br>- Let me go.

368
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,390
You better pray to God that my mother will be fine.

369
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,030
If not...

370
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,290
Madam Jiang, I'm sorry that

371
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,040
this has happened.

372
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,070
I'm really very sad. We really didn't do it on purpose.

373
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,020
But I believe that good people will be rewarded.

374
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,870
God will favor you.

375
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,400
You will definitely wake up.

376
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,170
What are you doing?

377
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,140
Get out.

378
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,040
Wu Cai Hong, I don't want to see you again. Get lost now and stay far away from me.

379
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:45,340
Doctor, it has been a few days. Why is my mother not a little better?

380
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:51,100
In fact, Madan Jiang's condition has been improving.

381
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,760
Really?

382
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,880
A few days ago, Madam Jiang could not swallow,

383
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,700
take medication or eat.

384
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,070
This morning,

385
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,510
Madam Jiang already swallowed on her own eating liquid food.

386
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,970
These are signs of improvement.

387
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,280
When do you think my mother will be conscious?

388
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:20,700
Don't be anxious about this. I can't confirm when Madam Jiang will be conscious.

389
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:26,190
Half of this will depend on her self will, the other will be Heaven's will.

390
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,210
Mr Jiang. I invited you here to have a talk with you.

391
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:36,570
Based on Madam Jiang's current condition, I feel that she can be discharged from the hospital and seek treatment at home.

392
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:42,120
If she goes back to an environment where she is familiar with, this may help her in regaining her consciousness.

393
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,590
So, I can take my mother home?

394
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:46,990
Based on her current condition, she can seek treatments at home.

395
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,230
Of course, we will still conduct regular tests on her.

396
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,770
Thank you, Doctor.

397
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,490
What are you doing here?

398
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,510
I came here to see if Madam Jiang is conscious. Has she woke up?

399
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:28,080
My mom will be discharged from the hospital tomorrow. Pack your stuff and get ready to go to my home.

400
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,940
What?

401
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,400
Don't forget that you signed the slave contract.

402
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,750
If my mother remains unconscious, I will settle the score with your entire family.

403
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,870
- Sis. <br>- Cai Yun, don't talk about this matter.

404
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,080
Cai Hong.

405
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,330
- Mom.<br>- Mom.

406
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,040
You drag it to no end.

407
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:28,160
Cai Hong. You are going to the Jiang mansion, right?

408
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,470
I'm going there to be a maid.

409
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,460
Don't lie to me.

410
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,590
I can tell that Jiang Yu is interested in you.

411
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,960
This is a rare opportunity.

412
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,490
You must hold on tight to this opportunity. Understand?

413
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:45,970
I'm going to the Jiang mansion to be a maid because I signed a slave contract.

414
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:50,130
Do you think he will waste his money in repaying my debts?

415
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,470
You are really foolish. What do you mean by a slave contract?

416
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,740
This is only just an excuse.

417
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,850
Is the Jiang family lacking in staff?

418
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:04,990
Jiang Yu is using this excuse to keep you by his side so that he can see you every day.

419
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,120
What are you talking about?

420
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,740
Wu Cai Hong. You are really stupid.

421
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,490
You have a big fish like Jiang Yu

422
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,080
but you look for a small fry like Shao Tian instead.

423
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,880
People should have ambitions. <br><i>Idiom: Man should seek his way up.</i>

424
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,320
This is a good opportunity. Don't let it go.

425
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,280
Marry Jiang Yu, have a child and enjoy life.

426
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,010
Listen to your stepmother and don't be complacent.

427
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,740
I'm afraid that I will disappoint you.

428
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,720
This child is so disobedient.

429
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,830
This is the new servant. Her name is Wu Cai Hong.

430
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:05,490
I want to teach her the rules of the Jiang family first.

431
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,610
I called everyone here to give you a wake up call.

432
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,330
With the dedicated staff here, they can tell you that

433
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,280
you must listen and understand things.

434
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,070
Yes.

435
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,600
Mrs Zhang.

436
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,870
Use discipline.

437
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,860
Teach this wench a lesson. Give her twenty beatings first.

438
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,090
Yes.

439
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,830
It's not that easy to be a servant in the Jiang family.

440
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,130
You must remember what I say.

441
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,920
First, you must obey orders.

442
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,790
Second, you must be loyal. <br>Third, you must abide by the law and behave yourself.

443
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:56,390
Fourth, our family is fair in measuring out rewards and punishments.

444
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:01,680
If you commit a mistake, you must willingly accept the punishment and not be angry.

445
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,460
Miss is letting out her temper on her.

446
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,670
What's wrong today?

447
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,130
Did she do something wrong?

448
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,160
Miss is even teaching her the rules herself.

449
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,300
I heard that she pushed Madam Jiang down the stairs at the hospital.

450
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,990
She caused Madam to be in a coma now.

451
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,440
No wonder, Miss is punishing her like this.

452
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,060
It seems to me that she wants her to pay with her life.

453
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,780
Did you remember what I said?

454
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,310
I'm asking you a question. Answer me.

455
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,710
Yes, I do.

456
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:48,340
Mrs Zhang. In the future, you must monitor Wu Cai Hong and teach her well.

457
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,700
Yes.

458
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,770
Young Master.

459
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,810
Everyone can leave now.

460
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,900
Yes.

461
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,240
Young Master Jiang.

462
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:13,540
I'm begging you. Let me take care of Madam.

463
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,850
Did I hear correctly?

464
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,540
Do you know who caused my mother to be in this state?

465
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,720
If you dare to go clear to my mother, I will never let you off.

466
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,970
You can give me a chance to redeem myself.

467
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,480
My mom, because of blood clots in her brain also,

468
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,330
was confined to a bed.

469
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,600
This type of condition, if you don't treat it carefully, one's health will deteriorate.

470
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,100
Master Jiang, I beg you.

471
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,660
Give me a chance to redeem myself. Let me take care of Madam.

472
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,310
I will do my very best to regain Madam's consciousness.

473
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:53,580
Don't pretend to be a good person in front of us. He will never trust you again.

474
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,900
If you don't agree, I will keep kneeling down here.
