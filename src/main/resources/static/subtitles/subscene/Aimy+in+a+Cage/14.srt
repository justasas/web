00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,440
I know this. Let me do it.

21
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,250
This is not the same fish you are used to.

22
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,930
So, let me do it.

23
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,550
Why do you know so much?

24
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,510
When my Mom was sick, I took care of her medications.

25
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,370
I didn't feel assured leaving this task to my servants. Thus, I gradually learned how to do it.

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,860
Madam, what did you say? Please say it again.

Madam.

00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,750
Why is it you?

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,680
Madam, you are finally awake.

58
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,270
We missed you very much. I'm going to tell the rest.

59
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,810
Madam is conscious.

60
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,920
Madam is conscious.

00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,410
Madam is conscious.

62
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,630
- Really? <br>- Madam is conscious.

63
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,840
Mom. You are awake. Can you recognise us?

64
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,980
Mom.

65
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,040
Yu Er.

66
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,690
Mom.

67
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,900
You are finally conscious.

68
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,820
Mom. You are finally conscious.

69
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,000
You scared us to death.

70
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,610
Cai Hong.

71
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,390
Thank you.

72
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,400
In my dream,

73
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,770
when I heard you singing,

74
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,700
my dream

75
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,960
became beautiful.

76
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,510
Madam. Thank you for waking up.

77
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,990
What are you doing?

78
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:08,300
I would like the rainbow bracelet back. It's very important to me. Could you return it to me?

79
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,770
No.

80
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,770
Also,

81
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,480
don't think that just because my Mom is conscious, I will forgive you.

82
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,770
Wu Long, you rascal.

83
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,450
Forget it if you don't want to help me. You scared me.

84
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,970
Come, sit here and be good.

85
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,880
Where does he keep the necklace?

86
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,790
What are you doing?

87
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,340
Wu Cai Hong, what are you doing?

88
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,990
I didn't do anything.

89
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,830
You still deny it? I saw you sneaking into my brother's room.

90
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,550
What are you looking for?

91
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,040
I... was looking for Wu Long.

92
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,450
I just saw Wu Long coming in here and I was afraid that he would mess up the room.

93
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,220
- I was just about to carry him out. <br>- Nonsense.

94
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,900
I saw you sneaking into my brother's room. You even searched his drawers.

95
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,590
Would Wu Long be in there?

96
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,700
I was really looking for Wu Long.

97
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,010
I'm going out first.

98
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,820
You are not going to tell the truth?

99
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,820
My brother is not here. I will teach you a lesson on his behalf.

100
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,080
My brother really hates his room being intruded into.

101
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,020
Even if I can't come in here, it's even more so for a servant like you.

102
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:31,510
Wu Cai Hong, I know there is a definite reason why you came to our house.

103
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,570
But in the end I was ignorant

104
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,970
and was just wishful thinking.

105
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,910
If I see you doing this again, it won't be that simple as getting a slap from me.

106
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,980
Get out.

107
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,080
You don't seem very happy.

108
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,000
Madam Jiang, I'm fine.

109
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,530
Your eyes are red and you still say that you are fine?

110
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,780
If you have any problems, I will decide for you.

111
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,030
It's just that I couldn't find a bracelet which is very important to me.

112
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,540
Don't be too anxious. I will tell the servants to look for it together with you.

113
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,730
No need, Madam. Thank you.

114
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,960
You are really too polite.

115
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,310
Brother.

116
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:00,250
I just saw Wu Cai Hong searching for stuff in your room.

117
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,610
I asked her what she was doing and she told me that she was looking for the cat.

118
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,940
How could the cat hide in the drawers?

119
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,350
I know what she is looking for.

120
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,520
Aren't you angry?

121
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,060
Don't you hate people intruding into your room?

122
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,680
She is looking for her bracelet.

123
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,880
Bracelet?

124
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,430
What bracelet? Brother, Wu Cai Hong is our enemy who killed father.

125
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,300
She certainly has tried her best to take revenge. You must always be cautious of her.

126
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,420
Enough, don't worry. Everything is fine.

127
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,240
Where did you keep that bracelet?

128
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,900
In the drawers.

129
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,590
What is its significance? Why aren't you returning it to her?

130
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,940
Enough, don't bother about it.

131
00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:01,740
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

132
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,800
<i>Hateful. It's such a worthless thing.</i>

133
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,020
<i>I really don't understand why brother wants to keep this?</i>

134
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,910
Did you go to my brother's room because of this?

135
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,160
This is my bracelet. Return it to me.

136
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,330
It's such a worthless thing. Let's just throw it away.

137
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,890
No. Brother Shao Tian gave this to me.

138
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,760
So, this is the case.

139
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,020
Zhou Shao Tian gave this to you?

140
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,270
So to say, this is a lover's keepsake.

141
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,780
You want it, right?

142
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,490
Brother Shao Tian personally weaved this bracelet.

143
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,930
It represents his heart. Even though it doesn't cost much,

144
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,240
as long as your gift is sincere,

145
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,160
no one can say that it's worthless.

146
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,220
Because you don't know, doesn't mean you can trample on other people's stuff.

147
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:10,270
So what if I trampled on your bracelet? No matter the reason, it won't change anything,

148
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,080
I'm the mistress now and you are my servant.

149
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,260
I can check on you, your love and your worthless bracelet

150
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,290
and trample it with my feet. So what?

151
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,690
I know that I'm a servant of the Jiang family.

152
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,750
You are also the lady of the family.

153
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:33,770
In your eyes, my bracelet is nothing to you. Hence, could you please

154
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,950
return my bracelet to me?

155
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:41,050
It's good that you know your position but I still won't return it to you.

156
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,070
So what?

157
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,900
You are really unreasonable. Return the bracelet to me.

158
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,490
Wu Cai Hong. Your sister pushed my mom down the stairs. Are you going to push me now?

159
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,410
Why would I push you? I only want you to return my bracelet to me.

160
00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:00,080
That day, why did my sister mistakenly pushed your mom down the stairs? Aren't you responsible too?

161
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,650
If your brother didn't instigated you to use the lipstick to frame Cai Yun,

162
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,490
would the both of you have exchanged words on that day?

163
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,860
If you both didn't exchange words that day and you didn't hit Cai Yun first, would Madam have involved herself in the tussle?

164
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,550
If you weren't so brutal,

165
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,600
-my sister would not have grabbed the wrong hands and pushed Madam down the stairs. <br> - and you took the rap for your sister.

166
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,910
If you feel bitter about this, go and tell my brother that it was your sister who pushed my mom and not you.

167
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,890
I will never talk about what happened regarding Cai Yun.

168
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,510
I only want my bracelet back. I'm reasoning with you.

169
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,950
That day Cai Yun's tussle caused such a great tragedy

170
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:43,240
It made the innocent Madam Jiang get hurt. I really hope that you can start anew.

171
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,600
Also, this bracelet is really very important to me.

172
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,920
Are you saying that I caused my mom to be injured?

173
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,260
Fine. Go and tell my brother then and see if he believes you.

174
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,650
I won't tell Jiang Yu.

175
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,100
I only hope that you can return my bracelet to me.

176
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:09,970
Also, I'm very sad too regarding Madam Jiang's injury.

177
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,570
I'm working very hard to redeem for it.

178
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:17,590
I hope that between us, we won't repeat the same mistakes.

179
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,940
Stop pretending to be a good person.

180
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,060
Redeem yourself?

181
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:28,330
Let me tell you. You will never be able to redeem yourself for what happened in the past.

182
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,710
Also,

183
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:37,940
let me remind you. Don't forget your status. You are only just a servant in the Jiang family.

184
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,130
You are being too extreme.

185
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,100
Return my bracelet to me.

186
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,010
What are you doing?

187
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:59,950
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

188
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,820
Is this that important to you?

189
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,670
Use the medicine. It will help in the healing,

190
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,700
otherwise you could get an infection.

191
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,340
- I'm leaving first. <br>- Thank you, Doctor.

192
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,730
Thank you, Doctor.

193
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,030
The bracelet representing Zhou Shao Tian's heart has not disappeared.

194
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,700
Did you overhear my conversation with Fei Fei?

195
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,990
How much did you hear?

196
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,060
Is that something you were afraid that I would overhear?

197
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,790
It's all because of this?

198
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,860
Was it worth it?

199
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,800
Come in.

200
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,750
Brother. You wanted to see me?

201
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,980
What you just said to Wu Cai Hong, was it all true?

202
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,540
Which part?

203
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,480
Everything.

204
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,120
I don't know what you mean.

205
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,400
Fei Fei.

206
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,110
In this house, living as two siblings...

207
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,460
I'm asking you.

208
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,390
It was clearly Wu Cai Yun who accidentally pushed Mom down the stairs.

209
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:12,140
Why did you say that Wu Cai Hong did it? Also, you were in the wrong first.

210
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,770
Why did you say that they intentionally pushed Mom down the stairs?

211
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,690
Is there any difference whether it was Wu Cai Hong or Wu Cai Yun who pushed Mom down the stairs?

212
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,490
They are both daughters of father's killer.

213
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,120
Of course, there is.

214
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,320
How could you frame her?

215
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,930
Because I hate Wu Cai Hong.

216
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,750
I hate how you protect her.

217
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,930
I hate how you are so careful about her.

218
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,940
Nonsense.

219
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,010
Fei Fei. When did you change?

220
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:49,200
Last time, you use a lipstick to frame Cai Yun, I already stated that I didn't like you acting like that.

221
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,530
I don't want my sister to do unethical things.

222
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,750
Where did that kind girl go to?

223
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,920
But brother, don't forget.

224
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,990
They are the daughters of the killer of our father.

225
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,670
So what?

226
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,250
We still need to be upright.

227
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:15,330
If we undertake unethical tactics for revenge, what's the difference between them and us?

228
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,760
<i>I'm afraid that Jiang Yu overheard my conversation with Fei Fei.</i>

229
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,850
<i>He surely knows now that it was Wu Cai Yun who pushed his mom down the stairs.</i>

230
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,440
<i>What if he finds Cai Yun and give her trouble?</i>

231
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,510
When I used the lipstick to frame Wu Cai Yun, why did you tell Wu Cai Hong that you instigated it?

232
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:42,390
Because you are my sister.

233
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,180
When you do something wrong, of course, I have to be responsible for you.

234
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,610
Fei Fei, tell me the truth. What exactly happened at the hospital the other day?

235
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,900
Let me tell you then.

236
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,000
You bumped into Wu Cai Yun at the hospital that day.

237
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,480
You both argued because of the lipstick. In the end, you took action.

238
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,530
Mom came forward to mediate and in the chaos,

239
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:16,500
Wu Cai Yun accidentally pushed Mom down the stairs. That's what happened.

240
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,550
Fei Fei.

241
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,550
Why didn't you tell me the truth earlier?

242
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,650
Because Mom was injured

243
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,910
and I couldn't accept it.

244
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,130
I feared you would blame me.

245
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,680
To add further,

246
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,120
Wu Cai Hong was the one who took the fall for her sister.

247
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,760
<i>So, I blamed him wrongly for the issue regarding the lipstick.</i>

248
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,010
I want to be alone.

249
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,430
<i>What should I do?</i>

250
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,010
<i>Should I tell him or not?</i>

251
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,750
Come in.

252
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,560
What is it?

253
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,840
You heard my conversation with Fei Fei just now?

254
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,340
So what if I heard it?

255
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,440
Cai Yun is still young. Thus, the mistake that she committed,

256
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,190
I hope that you will allow me to be responsible for her.

257
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,160
How are you going to do it?

258
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,140
We didn't intentionally push Madam Jiang down the stairs.

259
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,790
Thus, I'm willing to do anything for Madam Jiang.

260
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:58,860
I heard what you just said to Fei Fei.

261
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,270
I made a mistake about you regarding the incident about the lipstick.

262
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,330
It wasn't you who instigated Fei Fei to frame Cai Yun.

263
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:14,530
But even if I made a mistake about you, why did you protect your sister?

264
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,700
She is my sister. If she does something wrong, of course, I have to be responsible for her.

265
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,940
Since you can do this, why can't I?

266
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,530
In the past, Fei Fei wasn't like this.

267
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:39,620
In the past, she was very innocent and naive.

268
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:46,340
It's my fault. I didn't have the time to watch her grow up.

269
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:52,430
Ever since my father passed away, Fei Fei and my mom have been with me.

270
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,220
Thus, my mom and Fei Fei

271
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,980
need my protection for life.

272
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,350
I understand.

273
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,710
My stepmom and Cai Yun also need my protection.

274
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:22,090
♫<i> Gently, I gently tried to inquire </i>♫

275
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:28,320

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,100
<i>Don't!</i>

284
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,460
Miss.

285
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,330
Do you know me? Why do you keep following me?

286
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,470
Who are you? Why did you come here?

287
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,510
I was asked to go to the warehouse to bring this colored silk.

288
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,230
Miss. What gives you the right to question me?

289
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:43,030
I personally saw your hand

290
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,560
being cut off. You were also bleeding profusely.

291
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,720
It was this hand.

292
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,960
Miss. You are referring to this?

293
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,990
That was only just an act.

294
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,340
The hand was false and the blood was pig's blood.

295
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,820
You are fortunate that you are an employee of the Jiang family.

296
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,560
Why would Mr Jiang do something like this? Who do you take him for?

297
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,080
Looks like you know Mr Jiang very well.

298
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,030
Of course, I understand him. He is a good man. In the past, my name was Hua Zi.

299
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:17,040
I almost died in the streets. Mr Jiang saw me, fed me and even took me in.

300
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,260
He even gave me a job.

301
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:24,700
So that's to say, since he helped you, you helped him to do things that are against nature.

302
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,800
How could you say that about Mr Jiang? I have been with him for ten years.

303
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,820
I have never seen him do any harmful deeds.

304
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,320
- Really? <br>- Of course.

305
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,950
Miss. You are really strange.

306
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:44,010
<i>Could it be that Jiang Yu is not that bad as I think. Did I make a mistake about him?</i>

307
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:50,990
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

308
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,450
Wu Long. You are here?

309
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,120
Seriously.

310
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,570
When I saw you in Jiang Yu's room yesterday, I didn't have time to talk to you.

311
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,650
How did you become so heavy? Looks like Jiang Yu has been treating you well.

312
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,380
Wu Cai Hong.

313
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,050
Young Master Jiang wants to see you.

314
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,490
Why is he looking for me?

315
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,310
I don't know. Go there and you will find out.

316
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:26,120
Take a look. See which bracelet looks like yours.

317
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,720
Go ahead.

318
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,240
Take a look to see which threads you need for the bracelet.

319
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,100
Take a look.

320
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,450
Each colour is different.

321
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,640
Brother Shao Tian personally dyed the colours for this bracelet.

322
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,890
He also personally weaved it for me.

323
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,290
To me, it's second to none.

324
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:09,420
But thank you for taking trouble over this.

325
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,040
It was Fei Fei's fault. As her brother,

326
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,940
I should help her to redeem herself.

327
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,410
By the way, I just saw that person.

328
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,930
Who?

329
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,230
The man who had his hand cut off.

330
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,120
Why did you put on a show for Brother Shao Tian? Why did you do that?

331
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,670
I was forced to. <i>(had no choice.)</i>

332
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,620
I'm an innocent person who you accused of killing your father.

333
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,340
Of course, I want to find out the truth.

334
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,020
You are really not my father's killer?

335
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:53,850
If I'm really the killer, the fountain pen is such an important piece of evidence, would I leave it at home?

336
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,020
Furthermore, it was that easy for you to find it.

337
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:03,000
Why were you at the scene when something happened to my father then?

338
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,650
I definitely went to see your father that day. I went there to settle scores with him.

339
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:16,400
I told him that I started the process of acquiring Ling Long.

340
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,670
You have always wanted to defeat Ling Long.

341
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,090
Yes but

342
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:26,020
I used legal methods to fight. I have never used any underhanded tactics.

343
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:35,270
Tell me honestly then. The money that was stolen from Ling Long,

344
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,870
Old Cai and you really didn't do it?

345
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:46,880
I'm very sure that the money is in Zhou Shao Tian's hands. Why do you

346
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,720
think I pursued him?

347
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,410
I only wanted to force out the origin of the money and also to clear my name.

348
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,910
It will also show you clearly the person next to you

349
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,470
and the kind of person he is.

350
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,590
Jiang Yu. I can believe that

351
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,050
you didn't kill my father

352
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:12,440
but you can't suspect Shao Tian.

353
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,480
He wouldn't do that.

354
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,040
I know that you won't believe what I'm saying now

355
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:23,270
but I will show you the evidence in future.

356
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,120
Come with me to a place now.

357
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,320
- Where are we going? <br>- You will know once we are there.

358
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,010
I just don't believe that I will lose to Zhou Shao Tian.

359
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:57,020
See if there is anything you like. Just choose any one.

360
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,870
If you don't find anything to your liking here,

361
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:11,970
just tell me and I will personally dye it for you. There won't be a problem.

362
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,980
The colour is quite similar

363
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,000
but it's a bit off.

364
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:44,430
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

365
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,040
I finally found it.

366
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,050
You found it?

367
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,920
Over there.

368
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,440
I will do it myself.

369
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,200
Look at the condition of your hand. How are you going to do it?

370
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,950
I will help you to hold it then.

371
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,480
Pull this.

372
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,470
Show me your bracelet.

373
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,730
So, it's a seven coloured rainbow. <i>(Cai Hong is Mandarin for rainbow)</i>

374
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:14,980
When Brother Shao Tian gave me this bracelet, he said that it suited my name.

375
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,740
This Zhou Shao Tian really knows how to humour girls.

376
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:31,610
Unfortunately for him, rainbows only come after the rain.

377
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,980
He is so shady. He will never be able to catch a rainbow in his lifetime.

378
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,250
It doesn't seem to be nice for you to be talking about him this way.

379
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:47,920
You shouldn't speak ill of others. It is not what a gentleman would do.

380
00:36:50,580 --> 00:37:01,220
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

381
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,870
Here.

382
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,950
Then, I'm going back to work.

383
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,250
What are you doing?

384
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,990
You indecisive little guy. Now you push me aside.

385
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:37,390
But animals can't lie. He will be good to whoever is close to him.

386
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:41,970
Looks like you are treating my Wu Long nicely.

387
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:48,040
At least, he is better than you and he can differentiate between good and bad people.

388
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:54,340
So to say, are you saying that you are a good person?

389
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:59,020
At least, I dare to say that I didn't do anything unethical.

390
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,700
You can tell the truth then.

391
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,030
Right , Wu Long?

392
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,950
I'm going back to work.

393
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,760
<i>It's exactly like the previous one</i>

394
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,960
<i>but it's still not the original bracelet.</i>

395
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,350
Brother.

396
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,540
Fei Fei.

397
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,080
Where did you go? Looks like you are in a good mood today.

398
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,400
Is that so?

399
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,020
You are my brother. Of course, I can see your moods.

400
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:52,180
But brother, does your good mood have anything to do with Wu Cai Hong?

401
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,100
No.

402
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:00,700
Where did you take her to last night? You came back very late.

403
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,400
Aren't you a busybody?

404
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,020
Can't I even ask?

405
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,650
There is a new dye factory called Rong Da. They sent you the invitation.

406
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:17,870
The invitation arrived last night. Do you want to go?

407
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,980
We are in the same industry. Of course, we should go.

408
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,330
Okay, I know.

409
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,480
So how? Does it look nice?

410
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,610
Of course, you look good in this.

411
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,630
I'm asking you if the dress is nice.

412
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,970
You are beautiful and look good in anything.

413
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,190
I just knew it was useless asking you.

414
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,030
Miss. Why are you so happy today?

415
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,880
Because my brother and I are attending a launch ceremony today.

416
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,060
I can't embarrass him.

417
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:03,300
That is right. Don't give cheek and embarrass him.

418
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,320
You know how to flatter.

419
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,560
But you used to attend such events with Young Master in the past.

420
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,030
Why are you so anxious today?

421
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:22,060
<i>That's right. I keep thinking that person standing next to my brother</i>

422
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,900

423
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:29,390
