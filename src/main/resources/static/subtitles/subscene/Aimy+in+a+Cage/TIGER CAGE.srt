1
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:36,821
Faster!

2
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:42,849
Give me a bag.

3
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:51,083
Big Brother.

4
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:28,456
The real thing,
so it's lived up its name.

5
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,857
Heroine can be had in any quantity.

6
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:36,120
They say you've a way in NY.
Let's combine

7
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:37,955
to snatch your heroine businesses
from them.

8
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:40,357
Okay, it's mutually beneficial.

9
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:42,993
Now I want 20 kilos of that stuff.

10
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,059
Where's the money?

11
00:02:48,495 --> 00:02:49,585
Here.

12
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:52,888
Mind you.

13
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:55,892
Don't talk nonsense
in front of Mr. Big Brother.

14
00:02:57,195 --> 00:03:00,093
Trying to draw?
Are you looking for hell?

15
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:01,852
Great!

16
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:05,819
If you work with me,
the other families will go bust.

17
00:03:06,462 --> 00:03:09,053
He's my brother.
Get 20 kgs of stuff for him.

18
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:20,321
You bustard Ping!

19
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:27,186
Don't move, CID!

20
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:28,125
Don't move!

21
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,450
Don't move! Police, drop your gun!

22
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:00,617
Damn it!

23
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,057
Drop your gun!

24
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:22,817
Big brother, run!

25
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:43,953
Stay where you are!

26
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:49,194
Drop your gun and climb up slowly.

27
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:54,560
No monkey business! My gun has no eyes.

28
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,893
Put your hands on your ears!

29
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:02,789
I never flop in any mission!

30
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:06,053
Damn you!

31
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:21,089
Are you alright, Uncle Te?

32
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:22,455
Yes.

33
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,027
Well, an experienced fireman
gets his fingers hurt?

34
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:26,326
Nonsense!

35
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:05,650
Trying to run?

36
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:07,360
Get out of my way!

37
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:28,153
Stop, police.

38
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,251
Freeze!

39
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:50,320
Keep away!

40
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:53,491
Drop your gun! Drop or I'll kill her!

41
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:56,354
Come on, put it down! Hear me?

42
00:06:56,897 --> 00:06:59,294
Drop it or I'll shoot her dead.

43
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,360
Drop it!

44
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:05,756
Outrageous! You scum.

45
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:36,090
Are you sick of living?

46
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:10,293
Keep down, police!

47
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:29,658
Are you fed up with living?

48
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:34,159
After him!

49
00:08:56,763 --> 00:08:58,354
Shirley, don't come up! It's dangerous!

50
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:30,885
Get the frogmen to salvage.

51
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:31,858
Yes, sir!

52
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,557
Did you mean to get killed?

53
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,521
Sorry!

54
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:56,585
Mr. Huang

55
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,554
Cordon off the spot
and call an ambulance.

56
00:09:58,664 --> 00:09:59,459
Yes, sir!

57
00:10:05,097 --> 00:10:06,290
Mr. Huang...

58
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,590
Thank you all for the trouble.

59
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:11,353
I nearly forgot
to get back a bait for Shirley.

60
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,819
Uncle Te, see how much our haul is,

61
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:16,928
Yes, sir.

62
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:21,686
Hsiu, here you are, fixed.

63
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:22,626
Good.

64
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,285
Mr. Wei.

65
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,120
Here's a file from the USA.

66
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:40,524
This new drug syndicate

67
00:10:40,564 --> 00:10:41,552
is now in HK.

68
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:42,755
Watch their movements.

69
00:10:44,364 --> 00:10:45,455
Let's have more.

70
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,824
I've had enough.

71
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:47,989
Cheers!

72
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:49,960
Don't...
What?

73
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:51,290
Really can't drink.

74
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:53,590
You're lying.

75
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:54,628
Enough...

76
00:10:55,597 --> 00:10:56,893
Well, I'll drink more tomorrow.

77
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:57,928
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

78
00:10:58,297 --> 00:10:59,388
Listen,

79
00:10:59,464 --> 00:11:02,056
anyone making trouble tomorrow
will be transferred to Shataukok.

80
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,921
Are you trying to avenge
a personal grudge.

81
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,257
What do you mean?

82
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,421
Mr. Huang judge for us.

83
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:09,655
We celebrated for him
because we took him for a friend.

84
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:12,491
He's not taking us for friends.
What do you think?

85
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:15,053
Help me, or I'll get drunk for sure.

86
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:16,153
Okay.

87
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:21,754
You're getting married tomorrow.
Drink this,

88
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:23,693
or Shirley has to clean the house for me.

89
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:25,262
Right, Shirley will stay
to clear up the rubbish.

90
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:26,762
Don't think it's easy to be a housewife.

91
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:29,194
Do you want him to drink. I don't.

92
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,387
Well?
Drink it.

93
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:33,693
Don't drink.

94
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:35,320
Drink this big glass.

95
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:38,363
Don't side with him so soon.

96
00:11:40,964 --> 00:11:42,453
We bachelors...

97
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:44,393
really envy your true feeling.

98
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:48,229
You're lucky, you're quitting tomorrow.

99
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:49,593
But we really are depressed.

100
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:53,289
Why fight? Only yesterday
the doctor said my heart's weak.

101
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:54,260
What?

102
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:55,353
I can't stand the shock.

103
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:57,690
Sometimes you can't take
a doctor advice too serious.

104
00:11:57,764 --> 00:12:00,560
Sister, he can't stand the shock.
Can you?

105
00:12:00,697 --> 00:12:03,788
You don't drink this,
you must clean the house.

106
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:05,091
Go and collect the ashes.

107
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:09,322
Drinking's bad for health.
What about venting our feeling?

108
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:11,363
That suits me better. I'm a virgin.

109
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,396
I've lots of grievances, lets vent them.

110
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:15,319
Ah Yu, come here!

111
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:17,329
What's it, Hsiu?
What's wrong with you?

112
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:18,453
Fix him for me.

113
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:20,587
Is that an order or a friendly request?

114
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,924
Only a friend would tell you to do this.

115
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:24,291
Yes, sir.

116
00:12:25,165 --> 00:12:28,256
No peeping and no moving
of lowerjaws.

117
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,160
Anyone blowing the egg
to an opponent win.

118
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,324
Ready?

119
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:40,322
Ready?

120
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,122
Start!

121
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:02,692
Hsiu, I'm on your side. Why tease me?

122
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,094
Either we play today or never.

123
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:08,962
Even if you were my master,
I'd tease you.

124
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:10,925
Amy...

125
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:15,458
Terrific!

126
00:13:16,098 --> 00:13:17,189
Make fun of me?

127
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:20,027
Stop that. Amy really is coming.

128
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:21,859
I don't care about her.
She really is coming.

129
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:22,760
So what?

130
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:23,990
It's you who don't care about me.

131
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:26,820
Everything alright?

132
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:28,157
Amy.
What?

133
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:31,128
How dare you lay hands on my girl?

134
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:33,027
Protect me.
Stop fooling around.

135
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:34,529
Forget it!

136
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:36,522
Outrageous!

137
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:39,553
Bastard!

138
00:13:39,698 --> 00:13:41,187
How dare you?

139
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:43,059
Anyone teasing Amy will get it.

140
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,258
He's flaring up.

141
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:46,353
What's the matter with you?

142
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:47,362
It's alright.

143
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,589
They're always so wild.
Never mind them.

144
00:13:58,498 --> 00:13:59,395
Mr. Huang, stop him.

145
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:00,589
What's you up to again?

146
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:01,595
That bastard hit me.

147
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,825
Don't go so wild, will you?

148
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:04,696
Mr. Huang, now is the Happy Hour.

149
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:06,923
We'll go on even if Madam
ordered us to stop.

150
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:13,925
Dare you even to tease me?

151
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:14,794
Sorry, sir.

152
00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:16,023
We'll go down to accompany you.

153
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,397
Good, you dared to fling me down.

154
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:49,196
Come in!

155
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:50,457
It really got into my head.

156
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,521
Get me a cup of coffee, will you?

157
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:02,058
Thank you.

158
00:15:04,132 --> 00:15:05,530
For me?

159
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,461
I planned to give it to Shirley.

160
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,588
Now I think it suits you better.

161
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:14,028
It depends.

162
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:19,394
How could it suit me?

163
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:22,328
Not for tonight.

164
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:25,159
As of tomorrow,
you need to love Shirley.

165
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:26,254
You're to work like a slave.

166
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:31,764
You tease me last time.

167
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,321
Well have some tear-gas.

168
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:37,759
So you'll cry on your wedding day.

169
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:53,963
Don't exaggerate.

170
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,792
Okay, you win.

171
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:03,053
Make way.

172
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:04,596
Let me.

173
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,528
No, you're clumsy.

174
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,792
So much the better.

175
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,289
Let me taste this nice cup of coffee.

176
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,187
Your heart's weak.
Don't drink coffee anymore.

177
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:17,726
I only meant to fool them.

178
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,488
You've fooled me too.

179
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,757
No.

180
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:23,761
Stop lying, tell me the truth.

181
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,059
Do you love Shirley?

182
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:29,557
If you don't say it, it means you don't.

183
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,187
No, but...

184
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:35,326
I still can't make up my mind
after such a long time.

185
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:38,892
I love her then.

186
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:45,057
You're not sincere.

187
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,860
Have you finished talking?

188
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,462
Go now, They're pushing.

189
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,859
I'll go then.

190
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,091
Bye-bye!

191
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:54,494
Really heartless, idiot.

192
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:56,562
Take it off first.

193
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,157
Right.

194
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,698
Remember to collect
the bride at 10 tomorrow.

195
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,198
Wear a necktie.

196
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,923
Thank you. Bye-bye.

197
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:09,262
Try it at once.

198
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:33,690
Really beautiful.

199
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:40,355
The flower on the head is beautiful.

200
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,188
Hsiu!

201
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:33,831
Don't run.

202
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:57,731
Hsiu!

203
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,598
Call an ambulance at once!

204
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,593
Hsiu...

205
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:16,633
Shir... Shirley, I...

206
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:34,331
Hsiu...

207
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:54,198
What happened...

208
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:04,198
C.I.D.

209
00:20:58,201 --> 00:20:59,996
Heavenly Father of all men.

210
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:03,066
We pray especially for those we love

211
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:04,430
but can't see any more.

212
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:08,590
May you bless them and shine on them.

213
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,326
May the love, wisdom

214
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:14,763
and omnipotence,

215
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:18,299
be demonstrated in them.

216
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:21,423
We pray in Jesus' name, Amen.

217
00:21:37,535 --> 00:21:39,330
Why are you back from your leave?

218
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:41,390
There's no point in taking leave now.

219
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,700
Michael, I'm applying for return to duty.

220
00:21:46,134 --> 00:21:48,726
Good. Work may do you good.

221
00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:00,065
Master. I'm in trouble. You must help.

222
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:01,964
You made things so bad.

223
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,000
Who'd help you?

224
00:23:04,102 --> 00:23:07,397
Here's a potion of American ginseng.

225
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:08,899
See if it will help.

226
00:23:41,935 --> 00:23:43,231
Don't move. Police.

227
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:46,393
Yu, handcuff him.

228
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:49,493
Don't move!

229
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:54,264
Where's Swatow Hsiung?

230
00:23:54,435 --> 00:23:55,628
I don't know. Miss.

231
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:00,757
I don't know...

232
00:24:01,735 --> 00:24:02,531
Speak up!

233
00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:03,828
I really don't know.

234
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:06,231
You're his best friend! Speak up!

235
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:07,993
Speak up!

236
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:13,562
Are you going to speak or not?

237
00:24:18,435 --> 00:24:24,334
Maybe these 2 monsters may speak.

238
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,064
Sorry, I don't know anything.

239
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:27,032
Let's go.

240
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:28,495
Don't, Mr. Big.

241
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:30,132
Go over there!

242
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,434
Don't scare madam.

243
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:35,892
Be smart and speak.

244
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:36,866
I really don't know.

245
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:38,731
Don't blame me
if your bottom gets burnt.

246
00:24:38,836 --> 00:24:39,824
Hear that?

247
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:41,059
I really don't know.

248
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:43,761
Well, are you going to speak or not.
Speak up!

249
00:24:44,335 --> 00:24:45,323
Take off your pants!

250
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:47,133
Take off your pants!

251
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:49,167
You're not speaking? Scald him.

252
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:50,166
Good.

253
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:52,431
I enjoy doing it.

254
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:55,533
You don't care a damn about me.

255
00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:58,598
Speak up!

256
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:02,794
No?

257
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:08,429
No?

258
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:11,962
He's collapsed.

259
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,328
His bottom's got burnt.

260
00:25:15,402 --> 00:25:17,197
That one outside may last longer.

261
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:18,326
Okay, scald him.
Give it to me.

262
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:25,793
Take off your pants.

263
00:25:26,836 --> 00:25:30,030
I'll speak...
I only know he's sailing tomorrow,

264
00:25:30,202 --> 00:25:32,600
but I don't know where.

265
00:25:32,636 --> 00:25:35,125
Keep away...

266
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,364
Look, we've got so many complaint.

267
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:40,491
You took action without my approval,

268
00:25:40,736 --> 00:25:43,634
used violence to hurt suspects.
How can I protect you.

269
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:46,067
Inspector Ho Hsueh-ling,
you've let me down.

270
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:47,366
Sorry, sir.

271
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:49,263
What good to say sorry now?

272
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:50,665
How long have you been
in the police force?

273
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:51,962
With your relationship with Hsiu,

274
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:53,729
you shouldn't handle this case.

275
00:25:53,903 --> 00:25:55,301
We're legally...

276
00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:56,526
still unmarried.

277
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:57,464
Shut up!

278
00:25:57,636 --> 00:26:00,932
To talk about law, we'll all die martrs.

279
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:02,557
Vengeance makes us

280
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:04,327
no different from rascal.

281
00:26:04,502 --> 00:26:05,900
You're unfit to be a policeman.

282
00:26:08,536 --> 00:26:09,832
Sorry, sir.

283
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:13,027
Insp Ho's operation
got my verbal approval.

284
00:26:13,236 --> 00:26:14,724
I know the whole thing well.

285
00:26:14,936 --> 00:26:16,232
Don't cover her up.

286
00:26:16,502 --> 00:26:18,491
I only feel that I've a responsibility.

287
00:26:19,803 --> 00:26:22,792
Good fix it then.

288
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,658
If anything goes wrong again,
mind your future.

289
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:27,162
Yes, sir.

290
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:45,435
I don't mind bearing the blame for you.

291
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,967
But remember foolhardiness
doesn't always work.

292
00:26:48,036 --> 00:26:49,229
Mr. Huang!
Uncle Te, how's it?

293
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:50,098
We've a glue.

294
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:51,191
Swatow Hsiung will leave HK

295
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:53,201
at Sam Mun Pier at two.

296
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:00,463
Buddy, when will the ship sail?

297
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,661
After these drums have been moved.

298
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:12,957
Swatow Hsiung.

299
00:27:22,203 --> 00:27:23,998
Don't move! Sail quickly!

300
00:27:33,003 --> 00:27:34,697
Sail, or I'll shoot you dead.

301
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,065
Release the rope.

302
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:39,292
Brother, don't shoot,
it's loaded with gasoline.

303
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:40,596
My whole family's on it.

304
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:42,191
Don't shoot. I beg you.

305
00:27:42,503 --> 00:27:44,093
Release the rope, faster!

306
00:28:04,804 --> 00:28:05,701
Go to hell!

307
00:28:21,637 --> 00:28:22,534
Don't move!

308
00:28:27,804 --> 00:28:29,202
You're violating the law.

309
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,468
Terry, tell the bastard to bring
the boat back to shore.

310
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:37,995
Yu, keep the evidence on the spot
and bring it back.

311
00:28:38,171 --> 00:28:39,261
Yes, Mr. Huang.

312
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,432
Captain, show me your license and I.D.

313
00:28:43,436 --> 00:28:44,424
Not my fault, sir.

314
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,968
Back to the shore.

315
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:47,297
We'll take your statement then.

316
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:51,792
I wanted to kill him too.

317
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:52,995
No more.

318
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,868
We're police.

319
00:29:04,603 --> 00:29:05,694
What are you doing?

320
00:29:06,404 --> 00:29:09,302
Old Te.
I know the American ginseng case.

321
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:12,360
Give me a chance.
It's for everyone's good.

322
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:15,563
Save your nonsense
for the Tomb Festival.

323
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:19,899
Mr. Huang...

324
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:21,025
Fix all these.

325
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,761
Mr. Huang, do you know
the American ginseng case?

326
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:27,528
Mr. Huang.

327
00:29:28,204 --> 00:29:32,102
Be smart and let me go
or we'll both penrish.

328
00:29:36,737 --> 00:29:38,033
Kill me!

329
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:40,668
See how you'll make your report.

330
00:29:47,004 --> 00:29:47,799
Get away...

331
00:29:47,837 --> 00:29:49,633
A snatcher...
Don't move!

332
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,061
Go and see him.

333
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:56,135
Over here, you stay to watch him.

334
00:29:56,237 --> 00:29:57,225
Yes, Madam.

335
00:29:57,371 --> 00:29:59,064
Come here! Come here to mark the seat.

336
00:29:59,604 --> 00:30:00,695
Stop the others from coming.

337
00:30:00,737 --> 00:30:02,135
Old Te, were you scared?

338
00:30:02,237 --> 00:30:03,726
You need this gun for evidence.

339
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:06,696
Oh. I forgot.

340
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:07,928
He was stunned.

341
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:12,302
This coffee came from my friend
in Brazil. Try it.

342
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:13,425
Thank you, sir.

343
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,368
I've read the report
on yesterday's incidence.

344
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:20,401
Mr. Wei.

345
00:30:20,538 --> 00:30:21,834
We got no full marks,

346
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,368
but I'm satisfied with the result.

347
00:30:25,037 --> 00:30:27,833
Had we captured on alive,
we could get more clues.

348
00:30:28,004 --> 00:30:30,902
I like you for your serious attitude.

349
00:30:32,437 --> 00:30:34,925
You're already so busy.
Take 2 days' leave.

350
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:36,195
Thank you, sir.

351
00:30:52,638 --> 00:30:55,229
A fish has swallowed the bait.

352
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:57,033
Go and see.

353
00:30:58,938 --> 00:30:59,835
A big fish.

354
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:02,459
Even you've caught it,
must be a stupid fish.

355
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:06,998
So you're stupider!

356
00:31:07,137 --> 00:31:08,433
Is that possible?
It's going to drop down.

357
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:10,036
Catch it at once.
Be careful...

358
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:17,860
I've seen it. So it's a crafty fish.

359
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:20,029
Is it?

360
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:21,831
There's no lack of stupid fish.
Let's catch.

361
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:28,766
I daren't convey anything to you,

362
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,831
but you can trust me.

363
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:37,136
Let's me teach you yatching.
Some day we'll cross the Pacific.

364
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,567
Come!

365
00:31:50,172 --> 00:31:51,069
No...

366
00:31:51,205 --> 00:31:52,102
Turn...

367
00:31:52,305 --> 00:31:53,202
Which way.

368
00:31:53,404 --> 00:31:54,200
This away?

369
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,564
Right. Turn.

370
00:31:56,138 --> 00:31:57,728
This way?

371
00:31:57,938 --> 00:31:59,927
Go on.

372
00:32:00,471 --> 00:32:01,767
I did it.

373
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:12,835
Uncle Te.

374
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:15,927
Yu, spend more time on Amy

375
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:17,502
to strengthen the ties.

376
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:18,729
I wish I could.

377
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:21,327
But I'm a policeman.

378
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:24,059
Excuse me.

379
00:32:24,205 --> 00:32:25,102
Okay! Bye-bye.

380
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:26,460
This is Yu.

381
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:27,400
What happened?

382
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,267
Mr. Huang.

383
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:30,394
I've caught Uncle Te
dealing drug with foreigner.

384
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:31,436
Impossible.

385
00:33:31,572 --> 00:33:33,969
It's true.
I've the video tape for evidence.

386
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:36,469
Let's make immediate action.
What do you suggest?

387
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,232
No, it could be complicated.

388
00:33:38,305 --> 00:33:41,294
Bring all the tapes to the station
for me to see.

389
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:43,363
Anything important?

390
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:45,801
Nothing serious. I'll take you home.

391
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:47,267
Let's go.

392
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:55,032
Cindy wants me to remind you
today is Amy birthday.

393
00:33:55,172 --> 00:33:57,968
I know. I know.

394
00:33:58,772 --> 00:34:01,966
See the cake and flowers is ready.
Go and be pardon.

395
00:34:03,138 --> 00:34:05,229
What are you waiting for! Get in!

396
00:34:05,338 --> 00:34:07,236
Girls have to be soothed.

397
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:08,429
I know, you nosey.

398
00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:18,003
Go now. Amy will be off duty soon.

399
00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:19,396
You're meddlesome.

400
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:22,970
Only 15 minutes for fooling around.

401
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,334
Two first class airtickets.
Thank you.

402
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:33,897
Thank you.

403
00:34:42,072 --> 00:34:43,163
Amy.

404
00:34:45,206 --> 00:34:46,899
Can I help you, sir?

405
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:50,928
Yes. I want 2 tickets for a trip
with my girlfriend.

406
00:34:51,106 --> 00:34:54,197
It's her birthday. Happy birthday!

407
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,935
It's yours.

408
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:11,501
What's it on the tape? Let me show it.

409
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:20,765
What are you going to cook for me?

410
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:25,263
Let's eat cakes after dinner.

411
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:33,029
Don't touch my videotape recorder!
Open the door.

412
00:35:34,072 --> 00:35:35,163
Open up!
What are you doing?

413
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,227
It's none of your business.

414
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,728
Come out...

415
00:35:45,106 --> 00:35:46,504
Who told you to watch my videotape.

416
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,128
Well, you're keeping
such a serious thing from me.

417
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:49,966
What is it?

418
00:35:50,006 --> 00:35:51,199
Are you taking me for your brother.

419
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:53,628
Speak up...

420
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:55,638
Uncle Te's your master,

421
00:35:55,673 --> 00:35:57,366
but he's keeping it from you.

422
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,804
It means he doesn't trust me.

423
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:04,901
Who knows?
You're taking him for you dad.

424
00:36:04,972 --> 00:36:06,268
How do I know you're an accessory?

425
00:36:06,673 --> 00:36:08,968
Would I be an accessory to this?

426
00:36:09,173 --> 00:36:10,866
I went through everything with you

427
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:12,370
and you suspect me?

428
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,333
You're so impulsive.
How could I tell you?

429
00:36:18,506 --> 00:36:20,199
It would only ruin you.

430
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:21,828
What have you to fear now?

431
00:36:21,906 --> 00:36:24,805
I'm not afraid either. Be he a tiger,

432
00:36:24,972 --> 00:36:26,370
or my own dad.

433
00:36:26,506 --> 00:36:29,404
I'll take him if he sells drug.

434
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,631
I'll go and arrest him right now.

435
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:33,101
Let's go!

436
00:36:33,206 --> 00:36:34,797
Don't be so impulsive!

437
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:37,030
Any rash action will ruin everything.

438
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,135
Aren't we brothers?

439
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:54,600
Listen this is only between me
and Mr. Huang.

440
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,035
And me.

441
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,330
Yes...!

442
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:02,871
Remember, don't take individual action
if you discover anything. Okay?

443
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:09,266
Bad. I must explain to Amy.

444
00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:10,327
Don't do anything foolish!

445
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:18,497
Listen.

446
00:37:18,973 --> 00:37:19,961
It hurts!

447
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,631
Go now, or I'll call the police
and accuse you of trespassing.

448
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:23,898
You must be joking.

449
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:26,166
Who's joking with you?

450
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:26,933
Amy.

451
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,335
I won't see you anymore. Go away!

452
00:37:30,107 --> 00:37:31,402
My hand!

453
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,900
You're not going? I will.

454
00:37:36,573 --> 00:37:37,368
What are you doing?

455
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:38,403
Don't go.

456
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,403
Are you taking me for a criminal?

457
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,938
Yes. I sue you for willful damage
to a policeman's pride.

458
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:44,402
I must question you now.

459
00:37:44,573 --> 00:37:46,766
I've followed you all the way
and kept saying 'sorry'.

460
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,737
What else do you want?

461
00:37:47,907 --> 00:37:50,498
Mr. Fan, I want you to have
some respect for me.

462
00:37:50,773 --> 00:37:52,864
You come to see me
when you're in the mood.

463
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:54,962
You leave me behind and say sorry

464
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:56,369
when you're not.

465
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,528
What are you taking me for?

466
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,232
My girlfriend, worthy of my respect.

467
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,532
Have my action to show
how important you're to me.

468
00:38:02,606 --> 00:38:04,504
I'll keep you company
till tomorrow morning.

469
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,329
I'll quit as a policeman. Okay?

470
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:07,503
No.

471
00:38:07,706 --> 00:38:11,002
I'll give you as a citizen to go out.

472
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:13,971
I'll break with anyone else,
but I won't let you go.

473
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,036
Let me go!

474
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:19,298
No, you mean everything to me.

475
00:38:19,907 --> 00:38:22,100
I can't cook
if you don't let me go, jerk.

476
00:38:22,374 --> 00:38:24,862
Right, right, I must let you go.

477
00:38:26,407 --> 00:38:28,702
Let me see if you're hurt.

478
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,731
A policeman gets more sentence
for indecent assault.

479
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,238
I couldn't care less.

480
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,133
Yu, what are you up to?
Come and help.

481
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,830
I'm preparing a birthday gift for you.

482
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,166
Come and eat.

483
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:06,663
The big gift is here.

484
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:08,266
Am I sweet?

485
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:10,029
Take me.

486
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,334
Disgusting...

487
00:39:24,307 --> 00:39:25,897
Shirley, have you got the key?

488
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:27,098
Yes,

489
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,433
but Hsiu never allowed me to open it,

490
00:39:29,574 --> 00:39:30,971
and I don't know what it contains.

491
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:54,932
Did you give him this?

492
00:39:57,207 --> 00:40:00,105
He always kept everything to himself.

493
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,331
Over $10 million!

494
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:27,030
Lmpossible for a man
of his family background!

495
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,470
And these 2 passports!
What are they for?

496
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:31,630
This must be ill-gotten money.

497
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:36,668
These passports are to help
use another identity,

498
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:39,234
to get out of HK, in case of need.

499
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:42,334
Wish my reasoning was wrong.

500
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,729
I've recently got a tip-off that,

501
00:40:45,974 --> 00:40:48,065
someone abused his power
for dope-push.

502
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:51,230
I thought he was honest.

503
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:55,203
Shirley, I know how you feel.

504
00:40:55,774 --> 00:40:57,467
Please face up to reality.

505
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:01,729
There's indeed something wrong
with him,

506
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:04,462
but I'll help you find out the truth.

507
00:41:56,008 --> 00:41:59,804
Buy a flag, sir...

508
00:42:03,808 --> 00:42:05,001
Follow that white car in front.

509
00:42:06,141 --> 00:42:08,437
Royal HK policeman,
no more police affair.

510
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:10,104
No,

511
00:42:10,275 --> 00:42:12,070
I'm all yours tonight.

512
00:42:21,508 --> 00:42:22,599
GET LOST.

513
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:15,071
Police.

514
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:20,002
Drop your gun!

515
00:43:25,775 --> 00:43:27,764
Drop your gun too, old Te.

516
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:29,030
Terry, I...

517
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,700
Stay to speak to the judge.
Filing it to see.

518
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:39,038
Get you handcuffs and put them on,

519
00:43:41,675 --> 00:43:42,868
those two foreigners.

520
00:43:52,775 --> 00:43:53,968
Terry.

521
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:00,863
You're trafficking in drugs.

522
00:44:06,942 --> 00:44:09,931
As a policeman,
you know the law and violate it.

523
00:44:12,742 --> 00:44:16,731
I was as hot-tempered
when I was young.

524
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:21,235
I understood.

525
00:44:21,775 --> 00:44:23,673
Why did you do that?

526
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,773
I've followed you since I left school.

527
00:44:26,142 --> 00:44:28,937
I took you for my master, my dad,

528
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,004
but now it's all over between us.

529
00:44:32,543 --> 00:44:33,735
You're under arrest.

530
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:36,000
Arrest me? I was braver than you.

531
00:44:36,476 --> 00:44:39,169
What did I get for arresting
some small frys.

532
00:44:39,975 --> 00:44:41,373
2 lousy medals.

533
00:44:42,476 --> 00:44:45,465
When the weather's bad,
it hurts and I can't sleep.

534
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:48,404
They did it again once
they got discharged.

535
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:50,197
I am a small fry too.

536
00:44:50,476 --> 00:44:51,964
A small fry or a big shot.

537
00:44:52,242 --> 00:44:54,833
I don't care.

538
00:44:54,975 --> 00:44:59,873
Terry, you're still young
and you're your idea.

539
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:03,940
When you reach my age and are,

540
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:06,200
in my straitened circumstances.

541
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:09,398
You'll see how important money is.

542
00:45:09,509 --> 00:45:13,202
Shut up!
Don't find an excuse for yourself.

543
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,874
Terry, let me go.

544
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:27,705
Sorry, Uncle Te.

545
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:32,899
I know you're nice to me,
but I've no choice.

546
00:45:39,776 --> 00:45:42,867
I caught Te dealing in drugs

547
00:45:42,976 --> 00:45:45,168
with 2 foreigners
in Stephen Bay, Stanley.

548
00:46:32,177 --> 00:46:34,665
Come on.

549
00:48:16,976 --> 00:48:19,272
Stop...!

550
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:24,603
Don't move, or you'll die.

551
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:30,972
Sir,

552
00:48:31,143 --> 00:48:33,132
these 2 foreigners dealt in drugs
with Uncle Te.

553
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,732
I've got the tape for evidence.

554
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,308
Well done! You're done a great credit.

555
00:48:38,177 --> 00:48:39,268
Handcuff Uncle Te.

556
00:48:39,844 --> 00:48:41,036
Yes, sir.

557
00:49:25,811 --> 00:49:29,005
I'll fix everything with your boss.
Leave now.

558
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:31,639
Okay!

559
00:49:35,811 --> 00:49:36,902
Why do you want to kill him?

560
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:38,032
You'll die for sure if he doesn't.

561
00:49:38,178 --> 00:49:39,473
I'd rather go to jail...

562
00:49:41,443 --> 00:49:43,239
than to kill him.

563
00:49:45,244 --> 00:49:47,436
You're my best aide. I'll cover you up.

564
00:49:49,344 --> 00:49:50,536
I quit.

565
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,505
Finish this case for me first.

566
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:56,568
You know how to handle the things here.

567
00:50:18,278 --> 00:50:21,176
You gave personal assurance that,

568
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:25,204
everything would be okay.

569
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:29,906
Only about the stuff. I'm not your nanny.

570
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,471
I've overassessed you.

571
00:50:33,044 --> 00:50:34,442
You can't even finish a kid.

572
00:50:34,977 --> 00:50:37,772
Now the co-operation is over between us.

573
00:50:39,211 --> 00:50:41,507
Our market in New York is so big.

574
00:50:42,311 --> 00:50:45,300
Many in HK would vie to be my sidekick.

575
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:47,001
Okay, no problem.

576
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,642
Listen,

577
00:50:48,911 --> 00:50:50,900
no one dare touch any deals I touched.

578
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:54,904
Hong Kong is mine,
and you're not the only market in USA.

579
00:50:55,077 --> 00:50:56,475
Get out of HK and return to New York.

580
00:50:59,344 --> 00:51:00,640
Hold it, Michael!

581
00:51:01,111 --> 00:51:03,906
I came here to make money,
not to make enemy.

582
00:51:04,077 --> 00:51:06,270
Okay, I'll trust you one more time.

583
00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:09,300
Well, if you want co-operation,
do one thing for me.

584
00:51:10,478 --> 00:51:12,569
I want 200 kilos of stuff tomorrow night.

585
00:51:14,144 --> 00:51:15,735
This is my A/C No.,

586
00:51:16,378 --> 00:51:18,674
Credit the money into it.
You'll g et the stuff tomorrow night.

587
00:51:36,077 --> 00:51:37,566
The killer can never get away.

588
00:51:38,978 --> 00:51:40,568
We can get hold of him for sure.

589
00:51:41,578 --> 00:51:42,669
Morning!

590
00:51:43,578 --> 00:51:46,066
What's wrong?
Why are you all wearing a stone face?

591
00:51:46,178 --> 00:51:47,269
A bereavement?

592
00:51:48,144 --> 00:51:50,440
Ah Yu.
Ah Yu, come in!

593
00:51:52,178 --> 00:51:53,974
Shirley, please go out for a while.

594
00:51:57,878 --> 00:51:59,275
Ah Yu, close the door please.

595
00:52:05,545 --> 00:52:06,841
I've ascertained
Hsiu's drug-trafficking.

596
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:09,976
Is that so? Does Shirley know it?

597
00:52:14,278 --> 00:52:15,574
I'm not too sure.

598
00:52:17,711 --> 00:52:19,109
Would she be an accessory?

599
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:23,105
We must take more care from now on.

600
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,102
I don't think Shirley has a hand on it.

601
00:52:35,312 --> 00:52:37,402
Here's a cassette of
Te's drug-trafficking.

602
00:52:42,545 --> 00:52:44,341
It's of serious consequence.

603
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,067
Formerly it was Hsiu, now it's Uncle Te.

604
00:52:47,345 --> 00:52:50,038
How many more are involved
I don't know.

605
00:52:53,245 --> 00:52:56,143
Yu, have you got any other evidence?

606
00:52:56,445 --> 00:52:58,035
I've put a tape at Amy's.

607
00:52:59,312 --> 00:53:00,504
Is that so?

608
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:01,940
Don't worry.

609
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:03,738
Amy knows nothing about it.

610
00:53:05,479 --> 00:53:07,172
We must get it back as soon as possible.

611
00:53:07,678 --> 00:53:10,974
For Amy's safety,
don't tell anyone about it.

612
00:53:11,112 --> 00:53:12,305
I know what to do.

613
00:53:15,078 --> 00:53:16,476
Shirley, please come in.

614
00:53:19,245 --> 00:53:22,938
Yu, I want to talk to you.

615
00:53:24,345 --> 00:53:26,243
Keep cool.

616
00:53:27,145 --> 00:53:28,338
Something happened last night.

617
00:53:28,445 --> 00:53:29,342
What is it?

618
00:53:29,645 --> 00:53:30,634
Come in.

619
00:53:31,212 --> 00:53:32,303
Mr. Huang.

620
00:53:32,912 --> 00:53:37,208
Shirley,
put this important item in a safe.

621
00:53:42,112 --> 00:53:43,805
Aren't you afraid
she might be Te's accompany.

622
00:53:45,512 --> 00:53:46,807
Impossible.

623
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,005
Terry was killed yesterday.

624
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:55,167
What?

625
00:53:57,612 --> 00:54:01,601
He knew about Old Te.

626
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:10,743
I must go out for a while.

627
00:54:13,245 --> 00:54:15,643
Old Te, hold it! You creep!

628
00:54:16,312 --> 00:54:19,403
You ruined Terry. I'll kill you!

629
00:54:19,612 --> 00:54:20,407
Ah Yu.

630
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:22,477
Are you crazy? Uncle Te's taking
Terry for his own son. You're mistaken.

631
00:54:25,045 --> 00:54:27,034
Yu, don't get the wrong idea.
He won't do that.

632
00:54:29,145 --> 00:54:30,133
Are you crazy.

633
00:54:30,279 --> 00:54:31,074
Stop!

634
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:32,403
What happened?

635
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:34,172
A policeman trafficking in drugs
can do anything.

636
00:54:34,245 --> 00:54:37,643
Quiet! We're all friends.
Let's talk it over.

637
00:54:37,746 --> 00:54:38,541
Let me go!

638
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:40,577
I've proof of your drug-trafficking.

639
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:43,634
I've already reported to Mr. Huang.
I'll testify against you.

640
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,403
Yu, don't be impulsive.

641
00:54:46,779 --> 00:54:50,370
You did report to me,
but I can't accuse Te,

642
00:54:50,679 --> 00:54:52,077
before I see the evidence.

643
00:54:52,312 --> 00:54:53,608
It must be him.

644
00:54:58,479 --> 00:55:00,172
I've got tapes of your drug-trafficking.

645
00:55:00,312 --> 00:55:01,300
Nonsense.

646
00:55:01,546 --> 00:55:02,842
Shirley, run it for him.

647
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:04,772
Run it for him.

648
00:55:04,913 --> 00:55:06,004
Don't...

649
00:55:06,113 --> 00:55:07,010
Run it.

650
00:55:32,313 --> 00:55:33,505
How come?

651
00:55:34,246 --> 00:55:36,734
Obviously the cassette has been swapped.

652
00:55:36,913 --> 00:55:38,503
What? Where's the evidence?

653
00:55:39,113 --> 00:55:41,306
You yourself are under suspicion.

654
00:55:41,445 --> 00:55:42,638
You're exposing your own crime.

655
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:43,767
Last time Hsiu got killed

656
00:55:43,879 --> 00:55:45,777
because you planted a smoke bomb.

657
00:55:45,946 --> 00:55:48,037
This time Terry got killed
because you abandoned your duty.

658
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:48,975
What explanation can you give?

659
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:49,941
Search his locker!

660
00:55:50,846 --> 00:55:53,335
I saw him putting heroin in...

661
00:55:53,712 --> 00:55:55,507
I also saw you put heroin
into the locker.

662
00:55:55,612 --> 00:55:57,306
Let's search together.

663
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,675
I'm not afraid. You're finished.
Give me the key.

664
00:56:00,979 --> 00:56:01,967
Don't try anything foolish.

665
00:56:02,346 --> 00:56:03,334
Keep away!

666
00:56:05,213 --> 00:56:07,202
Uncle Te, the key!

667
00:56:07,746 --> 00:56:08,837
Pheasant.

668
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:10,872
Sorry, Uncle Te.

669
00:56:19,013 --> 00:56:20,104
Keep cool.

670
00:56:20,313 --> 00:56:21,404
Don't mess around.

671
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,777
Uncle Te, you really did it.

672
00:56:26,846 --> 00:56:28,937
You put aside my book
and said it was missing.

673
00:56:31,113 --> 00:56:32,409
Will you search more thoroughly?

674
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:33,842
We've searched everything.
There's nothing.

675
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,975
Let's search his home.

676
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:38,806
Ah Yu, your locker...

677
00:56:38,946 --> 00:56:39,741
Open it and see.

678
00:56:39,846 --> 00:56:40,642
Okay.

679
00:56:46,747 --> 00:56:47,644
Search!

680
00:57:06,013 --> 00:57:07,206
You really did it.
No.

681
00:57:07,313 --> 00:57:08,506
Yu, calm down.

682
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,671
Are you going to tell me this is flour?

683
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,972
This bag is not mine.

684
00:57:13,113 --> 00:57:14,010
Calm down.

685
00:57:14,213 --> 00:57:16,008
Believe me, Shirley, believe me.

686
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,476
Now I won't trust anyone.

687
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,373
I only believe in truth and evidence.

688
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,373
You're arrested for drug possession.

689
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,278
Shirley, I know Te is not alone
in the frame-up.

690
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:29,037
Soon I'll seek them out! Watch out.

691
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:31,235
Do you mean us? Don't frame us.

692
00:57:31,346 --> 00:57:32,835
Don't get us involved
because you're evil.

693
00:57:32,947 --> 00:57:34,845
Quiet, this is not a market.

694
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:37,837
You're the Discipline Unit.

695
00:57:38,547 --> 00:57:41,138
I'll investigate the accusation
between Yu and Uncle Te.

696
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,778
You'll also be subject to
internal investigation.

697
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:51,074
I'm drug Investigation
Special Operation Insp Ho.

698
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:52,611
You're suspected of drug possession.
What's your name?

699
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,871
Fan Shun-yu.

700
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,571
Occupation.

701
00:57:59,147 --> 00:58:01,544
A member of the Royal Hong Kong
Police Force,

702
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,578
with the Drug Investigation Dept
of the Special Operations.

703
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:05,744
Where do you live?

704
00:58:06,246 --> 00:58:07,542
You know it already.

705
00:58:07,647 --> 00:58:09,045
As a policeman, you should know...

706
00:58:09,147 --> 00:58:10,442
I know better in this respect.

707
00:58:10,513 --> 00:58:12,411
I've discovered heroin in your locker,
how do you explain that?

708
00:58:12,547 --> 00:58:15,741
I was framed. Why should I explain?

709
00:58:15,814 --> 00:58:18,712
Possess no drugs,
why should I be question.

710
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,871
There's no evidence
to support your state.

711
00:58:21,014 --> 00:58:22,604
You mean you've proof against me?

712
00:58:22,713 --> 00:58:25,009
Can you think of anything
to prove your innocence?

713
00:58:25,147 --> 00:58:26,635
Law requires evidence.

714
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,678
All your statement may be used
as evidence in court.

715
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,076
Okay, I'll give my statement.

716
00:58:30,446 --> 00:58:33,140
I deal in drugs, smuggling and,

717
00:58:33,247 --> 00:58:34,644
resort to killing, arson and robbery.

718
00:58:35,314 --> 00:58:37,711
Take it down as a matter of routine!
Come on.

719
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,745
Evidence in Court? Take it down!

720
00:58:39,814 --> 00:58:41,007
Ah Yu.

721
00:58:41,147 --> 00:58:43,942
My name is Fan Shun-yu,
I don't know you.

722
00:58:44,613 --> 00:58:48,205
I suspect Insp Ho Hsueh-ling's
conspiracy against me.

723
00:58:48,613 --> 00:58:50,704
Take it down! Sue me.

724
00:59:25,747 --> 00:59:28,543
The time is 20th Oct 1988 at 3 p.m.

725
00:59:28,747 --> 00:59:32,236
I'm Anti-Narcotics Bureau detective
Fan Shun-yu No. 3368.

726
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:34,776
I suspect my Sergeant Feng Chien-te
of drug-trafficking.

727
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,071
As a result of 3 days probe and trace.

728
00:59:37,247 --> 00:59:38,735
I've discovered him
dealing in drugs with...

729
00:59:38,914 --> 00:59:41,903
2 unidentified foreigners on a ferry,

730
00:59:42,447 --> 00:59:43,435
deduced that he used
his detective identity,

731
00:59:43,614 --> 00:59:47,307
to cover up his trafficking activities.

732
01:00:55,481 --> 01:00:56,276
Mr. Huang.

733
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,538
Mr. Huang?

734
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,936
I'm Old Te, I've searched
the whole house.

735
01:01:01,015 --> 01:01:02,106
There are many cassettes,

736
01:01:02,214 --> 01:01:03,908
but not the one you mention.

737
01:01:04,148 --> 01:01:05,238
Come back before we take any action.

738
01:01:25,714 --> 01:01:26,907
Any clues?

739
01:01:29,347 --> 01:01:30,938
Go back and take a rest.
I'll take charge here.

740
01:01:38,614 --> 01:01:39,602
Mr. Huang.

741
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:51,476
I believe you are innocent.

742
01:01:51,815 --> 01:01:54,213
Mr. Huang, you must help me on this.

743
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,639
Who else knows the old Te case,

744
01:02:01,781 --> 01:02:02,872
besides me?

745
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:07,106
Terry.

746
01:02:08,148 --> 01:02:10,137
You know Terry is impulsive.

747
01:02:10,448 --> 01:02:12,845
Now you've ruined him and yourself.

748
01:02:18,781 --> 01:02:21,577
The first thing is to prove
your innocence.

749
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:26,039
Take me to get the copy of cassette
you mentioned.

750
01:02:35,848 --> 01:02:37,144
Don't you trust me?

751
01:02:45,282 --> 01:02:46,179
Shun-yu.

752
01:02:46,382 --> 01:02:47,575
Have you seen the cassette
I taped yesterday?

753
01:02:47,715 --> 01:02:50,010
Yes. Besides Te, there's...

754
01:02:51,549 --> 01:02:53,139
Go on! Speak up!

755
01:02:53,282 --> 01:02:56,271
I don't know, I don't know anything.

756
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:57,778
Do you know or not?

757
01:02:57,981 --> 01:02:59,379
I know nothing.

758
01:03:06,882 --> 01:03:08,972
The cassette is very important to Yu.

759
01:03:09,148 --> 01:03:10,943
Bring it if you know where it is.

760
01:03:13,981 --> 01:03:15,880
There's no such a cassette.

761
01:03:16,015 --> 01:03:18,004
There must be.
I ran it on this VTR recorder last night.

762
01:03:18,148 --> 01:03:19,136
Have you ever taken it away?

763
01:03:19,248 --> 01:03:20,441
NO, I didn't even touch it.

764
01:03:20,582 --> 01:03:21,878
Just now you said got it.

765
01:03:21,949 --> 01:03:22,937
Without it,

766
01:03:23,081 --> 01:03:25,377
I can't clear myself. I'll be in jail.

767
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:28,413
Do you know it or don't you?

768
01:03:28,515 --> 01:03:29,503
I know...

769
01:03:29,715 --> 01:03:31,011
Now get it.

770
01:03:31,115 --> 01:03:32,513
You don't want Yu to get into trouble.

771
01:03:43,949 --> 01:03:47,040
I promise. I'll quit once I'm cleared.

772
01:04:03,415 --> 01:04:04,506
I'm so scared!

773
01:04:05,282 --> 01:04:07,271
Why? It's okay if you find the cassette.

774
01:04:07,482 --> 01:04:09,176
Well, Yu, we must leave.

775
01:04:09,382 --> 01:04:11,678
Amy's going to be alright,
I'll have someone watch her.

776
01:04:15,382 --> 01:04:16,178
I'm Michael,

777
01:04:16,348 --> 01:04:19,247
now at 5 Conduit Garden 26th floor.

778
01:04:19,749 --> 01:04:21,942
Send someone,
a woman needs protection.

779
01:04:23,149 --> 01:04:24,944
Yu, we're in a hurry.

780
01:04:26,149 --> 01:04:27,240
Excuse me.

781
01:04:28,149 --> 01:04:30,842
Shun Yu, I want no protection.

782
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:33,439
I'm alright, I'll return soon.

783
01:04:34,183 --> 01:04:34,978
Bye-bye!

784
01:04:35,183 --> 01:04:36,080
Let's go!

785
01:04:41,682 --> 01:04:42,978
Please call 3388,

786
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:46,478
Amy urgent. Tell her to call my home.

787
01:04:51,049 --> 01:04:53,742
Mr. Huang,
let's return to Hq Handcuff me.

788
01:04:54,016 --> 01:04:56,811
Okay, this will save us
from unnecessary complaints.

789
01:04:57,682 --> 01:04:59,580
Bear with it now
and soon you'll clear your's.

790
01:05:09,149 --> 01:05:10,445
Mr. Huang, sorry for the trouble.

791
01:05:10,715 --> 01:05:11,806
Don't mention it.

792
01:05:24,782 --> 01:05:27,180
Mr. Huang, it was these foreigners
who deal with Te.

793
01:05:27,316 --> 01:05:29,111
Turn around and arrest them!

794
01:05:49,982 --> 01:05:51,471
Amy, what happened?

795
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:55,777
Shirley, Michael masterminded
Te's dope-pushing.

796
01:05:55,882 --> 01:05:57,075
He won't do that.

797
01:05:57,183 --> 01:05:58,581
It's true.

798
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:02,047
He just took that cassette away,
I'm scared.

799
01:06:02,283 --> 01:06:04,476
Keep calm, don't go away.

800
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:06,481
Tell me in detail.

801
01:06:50,383 --> 01:06:53,372
Michael mastermined Te's dope-pushing.

802
01:06:53,483 --> 01:06:55,676
Believe me...

803
01:07:44,716 --> 01:07:45,613
Stop!

804
01:10:40,318 --> 01:10:41,306
Come in!

805
01:10:43,784 --> 01:10:45,477
Why are you coming to see me
at this hour.

806
01:10:51,951 --> 01:10:53,940
You're depressed, don't drink so much.

807
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:58,349
After so much has happened,
go for a pleasure tour.

808
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,146
Amy spoke to me over the phone
before her dead.

809
01:11:02,485 --> 01:11:03,677
Is that so?

810
01:11:05,385 --> 01:11:06,680
What did she say to you?

811
01:11:06,784 --> 01:11:08,273
Yu is innocent of drug possession.

812
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:11,042
A big shot is behind
Te's drug-trafficking.

813
01:11:11,285 --> 01:11:12,376
Who?

814
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,313
You should know better.

815
01:11:15,151 --> 01:11:18,049
Yes, I got Amy's phone too.

816
01:11:18,651 --> 01:11:20,345
You did drug-trafficking with Yu.

817
01:11:20,951 --> 01:11:22,746
Now I really understand you.

818
01:11:23,018 --> 01:11:24,211
Are you a human being?

819
01:11:24,385 --> 01:11:26,283
After all these, and you want
to make me the scapegoat.

820
01:11:26,351 --> 01:11:27,941
I can say it is you
who want to make me the scapegoat.

821
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:30,839
Yes, with my name and position
in the police force,

822
01:11:30,951 --> 01:11:32,440
my words will convince everyone.

823
01:11:32,751 --> 01:11:34,650
Now listen,
I Michael Huang am a drug-trafficking.

824
01:11:34,751 --> 01:11:35,944
What have got anything
to accuse me of it.

825
01:11:36,618 --> 01:11:38,413
I've a copy of
Te's drug-trafficking tape.

826
01:11:40,485 --> 01:11:44,076
I've a copy too.
His crime is not linked with me.

827
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:45,148
I can testify against you.

828
01:11:52,018 --> 01:11:52,915
Testify against me?

829
01:12:12,118 --> 01:12:14,516
That tape even if released to the world
won't serve any purpose,

830
01:12:14,752 --> 01:12:16,547
because only Te can testify against me.

831
01:12:18,819 --> 01:12:21,614
Vincent, yes, I'm Michael.

832
01:12:21,752 --> 01:12:23,149
Finish off Te right away.

833
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:24,649
I'll hand the stuff
over to you in person.

834
01:12:30,885 --> 01:12:34,578
We've been getting on well
because you're obedient.

835
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:36,874
But, unfortunately...

836
01:13:31,552 --> 01:13:32,848
Mr. Feng, telephone.

837
01:13:32,985 --> 01:13:33,882
Yes, speaking.

838
01:13:34,019 --> 01:13:35,712
The long distance call from Canada
is connect.

839
01:13:36,386 --> 01:13:37,283
Thank you.

840
01:13:39,618 --> 01:13:40,312
Darling.

841
01:13:40,419 --> 01:13:41,214
Daddy.

842
01:13:41,286 --> 01:13:42,274
Yes.

843
01:13:42,386 --> 01:13:43,283
What is it?

844
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,676
I'll fly to Canada
at 7 tomorrow morning.

845
01:13:46,819 --> 01:13:47,910
What?

846
01:13:48,785 --> 01:13:53,081
The Hq has approved
my early retirement for health reasons.

847
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:55,812
Have you received my remittance?

848
01:14:15,586 --> 01:14:16,676
Don't move.

849
01:14:28,553 --> 01:14:31,451
Old Te...

850
01:14:37,719 --> 01:14:38,809
No monkey business!

851
01:14:57,586 --> 01:14:58,483
Hell with you!

852
01:16:33,353 --> 01:16:36,648
Damn, I'll kill you...

853
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,313
Kill...

854
01:16:39,619 --> 01:16:40,710
Let's go.

855
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,411
Have you found out everything?

856
01:17:07,686 --> 01:17:09,982
This resignation letter
has explained everything.

857
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,108
I'm extremely sorry,

858
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,913
I didn't discover
my subordinate's misbehavour...

859
01:17:13,187 --> 01:17:14,483
till now.

860
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:18,208
I ready for disciplinary action
and investify.

861
01:17:18,587 --> 01:17:19,882
But I've a request.

862
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:21,611
I wish I could arrest these men myself.

863
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:25,316
I hope Mr. Wei will give me this chance
before I leave.

864
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,213
Good, go ahead.

865
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,611
Thank you, sir.

866
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,918
Ladies and gentleman,
we've ample evidence against.

867
01:17:32,053 --> 01:17:34,542
Insp Ho., Serg Feng

868
01:17:34,654 --> 01:17:37,949
and detective Fan for drug-trafficking.

869
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:39,382
I personally can't shirk the responsible
for this disgrace.

870
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,813
They're now fugitives with arms.

871
01:17:43,187 --> 01:17:44,880
We must bring them to book.

872
01:17:45,053 --> 01:17:47,042
Please put personal feelings aside.

873
01:17:47,353 --> 01:17:50,046
Shoot anyone on sight
who tries to resist.

874
01:18:55,021 --> 01:18:55,816
Bitch!

875
01:18:58,554 --> 01:19:01,952
I've already done what you want.
What about the stuff?

876
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:02,975
Let me finish off that bitch.

877
01:19:03,154 --> 01:19:05,551
No, I'll fix her for you.

878
01:19:05,687 --> 01:19:08,676
I'll take your life
if I can't get the cargo tonight.

879
01:19:13,254 --> 01:19:14,242
Come on.

880
01:21:26,855 --> 01:21:28,753
3388, yes.

881
01:21:28,955 --> 01:21:30,250
Fan and Te have got

882
01:21:30,354 --> 01:21:32,547
Michael's drug trafficking proof
in Jackson Road.

883
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,914
Tell her to come at once.
Yes, thank you.

884
01:21:55,888 --> 01:21:57,081
All the cargo is in the car.

885
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,882
Making fun of me? Damn you.

886
01:22:13,122 --> 01:22:14,213
Michael Huang.

887
01:22:18,088 --> 01:22:22,486
Damn killing you with I shot
is too good for you.

888
01:22:22,822 --> 01:22:25,118
I want you to be a limply in jail
all your life.

889
01:22:25,355 --> 01:22:27,150
You're wanted.
What have you got to arrest.

890
01:22:27,255 --> 01:22:28,243
My will power.

891
01:22:33,755 --> 01:22:36,846
Even by going to jail I must testify
against you double dealer.

892
01:22:37,088 --> 01:22:38,076
Come out!

893
01:22:38,855 --> 01:22:39,843
Come out!

894
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:41,115
Come out double-crosser.

895
01:22:41,721 --> 01:22:43,619
Be flexible my gun's still with you.

896
01:22:43,755 --> 01:22:44,652
Get out!

897
01:22:53,588 --> 01:22:58,283
Damn you double-crosser I'll kill you.

898
01:23:01,055 --> 01:23:03,544
I made much money for you
and you got men to kill me?

899
01:23:03,655 --> 01:23:04,951
I'll kill you double crosser!

900
01:23:33,222 --> 01:23:34,415
Go to hell!

901
01:23:40,922 --> 01:23:42,320
I must take your life.

902
01:23:55,055 --> 01:23:56,453
None can testify against me
when you're dead.

903
01:23:56,556 --> 01:23:57,647
Let's perish together.

904
01:24:23,956 --> 01:24:26,444
Scum, traitor, I'll kill you!

905
01:25:42,956 --> 01:25:43,944
Go to hell!

906
01:26:29,889 --> 01:26:31,787
I'm Anti Hareotics Insp. Huang.

907
01:26:31,923 --> 01:26:33,219
He's wanted, arrest him.

908
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:34,151
