The Cage of Love

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,110
<i>Episode 19</i>

20
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,250
If it wasn't for your help, I wouldn't have been able to leave unscathed.

21
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,920
Am I that great? I'm only just your subordinate who runs around doing errands.

22
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,000
I just act according to you instructions.

23
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,020
But

24
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,680
did you really kill Wu Hong Da?

25
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,250
Of course not.

26
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,680
Why are you so nervous then?

27
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,600
Don't worry. Even if you killed someone,

28
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,420
I wouldn't tell anyone.

29
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,370
I really didn't kill anyone.

30
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,080
I still suspect that Jiang Yu killed Wu Hong Da.

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,110
He had the motive to kill, intent to commit the crime, and owns an identical pen.

32
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,200
In order to mask the truth, he has done some dirty deeds against me.

33
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,920
By doing that, he sabotaged my love with Cai Hong.

34
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,700
Forget it. If you are fighting in the business arena,

35
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,670
one can lose their head and commit murder.

36
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,960
This is too scary.

37
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,390
You are too ethical.

38
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,720
How could you let Jiang Yu bully you again?

39
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,390
If this drags on, there will come a day when you will suffer.

40
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,090
I'm waiting for the opportunity now.

41
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,900
When the opportunity is here,

42
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,190
he won't be able to get away.

43
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,020
From what I can see, Jiang Yu and you are playing games with each other.

44
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,370
Can't even help oneself.

45
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,250
Okay.

46
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,090
Don't be too harsh on yourself.

47
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,950
Cai Hong. You haven't eaten anything for the whole day. Eat something.

48
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,150
Mrs Li. I'm really not hungry.

49
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,130
Eat something.

50
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,270
Young Master already said that if you don't eat anything, I'm not doing a good job.

51
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,190
I have to change and redo things until you eat.

52
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,500
Help me please.

53
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,550
I will eat then, Mrs Li.

54
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,760
Frankly, Young Master is doing this for your own good.

55
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,170
I don't know what the others think but I can

56
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,320
see clearly.

57
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,610
You don't need to twist it. Just eat it.

58
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,920
This is right.

59
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,030
Brother.

60
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,980
What do you take Wu Cai Hong as?

61
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,890
What do you mean? Of course, she is a servant.

62
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,580
But your attitude to her, is that of a servant?

63
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,280
I treat all my servants equally.

64
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,240
You are lying.

65
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,150
Would you take a servant to view the lotus pond?

66
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,570
Would you be concerned that your servant is not eating?

67
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,240
Brother, don't forget, she is Wu Hong Da's daughter.

68
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,190
I'm not a three year old kid. I don't need you to tell me what to do.

69
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,440
You know that I didn't say anything wrong.

70
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,650
You are angry because you have a guilty conscious.

71
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,700
What I said was right.

72
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,900
Your feelings towards Wu Cai Hong already surpasses that of an ordinary person.

73
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,920
Leave.

74
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,090
I can leave

75
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,520
but I would still like to advise you.

76
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,380
Don't let your personal feelings get in the way.

77
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,660
Did you see how Young Master treats Wu Cai Hong better than anyone?

78
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,880
Based on what you said, Wu Cai Hong is the young mistress.

79
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,920
We should treat her better in the future then.

80
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:51,360
If Wu Cai Hong becomes his wife, what will happen to us?

81
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,450
They may be childhood friends

82
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,640
but Miss has feelings for Young Master who is not interested.

83
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,900
But Miss's affections towards Master are unintentional. She lights up every time she see's him.

84
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,440
No wonder Miss hates Wu Cai Hong so much.

85
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,580
Even though they address her as the mistress of the house, her family name is Fang not Jiang.

86
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,570
She is also an outsider.

87
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:20,930
If she can't be the Young Master's wife, she will have to marry someone and leave the house sooner or later.

88
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,750
If a girl wants to marry, she should marry an authentic Young Master.

89
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,330
Look. Miss has placed so many thoughts on Young Master.

90
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,140
It was really rotten and a waste of time.

91
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,400
That's right.

92
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,380
<i>I will never leave this family.</i>

93
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,530
<i>I will also never leave Mom and Brother.</i>

94
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,430
<i>Wu Cai Hong. I won't let you and Brother be together.</i>

95
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,570
Miss Fang. Are you really inviting me out for tea? It can't be that simple.

96
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,810
I have already thought it through. I can help you.

97
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,030
You are not only helping me but yourself too.

98
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,760
Say whatever you want but let me state this first. I can help you

99
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,100
but you must never harm my brother.

100
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,320
I must not harm your brother?

101
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,450
But you have harmed Cai Hong a couple of times. What does this count?

102
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,910
Looks like you are not sincere in collaborating with me.

103
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,410
Miss Fang, let me advise you. You don't have much time.

104
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,380
If you don't manage it, I'm afraid that when Cai Hong enters the Jiang family

105
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,480
and becomes your sister-in-law,

106
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,030
what I would lose is just Cai Hong.

107
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,630
What you will lose is not only Jiang Yu.

108
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,900
Are you threatening me now?

109
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,370
Why would I collaborate with a menacing person?

110
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,730
Once a friend becomes an enemy, he becomes more dangerous than the enemy.

111
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,380
Yet once an enemy becomes a friend, he will be more reliable than a friend.

112
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,040
By helping me, you are helping yourself too.

113
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,620
Fine. How can I help you then?

114
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,110
Get the slave contract for me as soon as possible.

115
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,280
If I could do this, would I still be here?

116
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,570
I believe you will find the way.

117
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,440
I will wait for your news.

118
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,060
How was the investigation regarding the opium case at Ling Long?

119
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:47,320
There was a lead but the investigation midway, stopped.

120
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,420
We found the court official who handled this case twelve years ago but when we went to visit him,

121
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,360
he refused to reveal anything about that night.

122
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,020
He refused to talk? This means there was a major problem in the case.

123
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,820
Yes, I find it strange too. This court official is on extremely good terms with Jiang Wen Yuan.

124
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:22,530
Since Master Jiang's death, the top investigators have all left.

125
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,920
Thus, I feel that he knows some insider's information.

126
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,560
Please.

127
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,230
Please wait.

128
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,760
Old Master. Boss Zhou is here.

129
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,170
Leave.

130
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,820
If you are here to find out about the Ling Long case,

131
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,030
sorry, please go back.

132
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:03,810
Uncle Gao. I'm here to seek advice regarding the Ling Long case from twelve years ago.

133
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,730
At the same time, I'm also here to visit my mother's foe.

134
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,890
Do you still remember, three years ago, the aunt from the weaving and dyeing factory.

135
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,770
Are you referring to her husband, Zhou Da Liang who had lung disease?

136
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,330
I'm his son, Zhou Shao Tian.

137
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,680
Talking about this, you look exactly like your mother.

138
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,510
Uncle Gao. I visited you without advance notice today.

139
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,000
You definitely must have a request.

140
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:55,690
I know that you don't want to talk about it but I still would like to find out about the opium case at Ling Long.

141
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,720
Please do me a small favour.

142
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,360
Wasn't the case settled then?

143
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,180
It has been such a long time and that person has already died.

144
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,970
Why do you still want to talk about it?

145
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,430
If it weren't for my mother's wish, I wouldn't want to talk about this either.

146
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,180
Your mother's wish?

147
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,380
When my father got sick and was lying in bed,

148
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,870
Old Master Jiang took care of my mother.

149
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,810
He gave her some of Ling Long's business. Old Master Jiang knew about my family's hardship.

150
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,010
He gave wage advances to try to solve the urgent needs of my family.

151
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,120
If it weren't for Old Master Jiang's kindness,

152
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,980
I'm afraid that my mom wouldn't have been able to support me and her sick husband.

153
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,520
Boss Jiang was really a good person.

154
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,910
When Boss Jiang passed away, my mother has never talked bad about him.

155
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:51,950
She said that someone like Old Master Jiang would never use opium to frame anyone.

156
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,730
Unfortunately with our family situation the way it was, Jiang was unable to be compensated.

157
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,860
Only during the Winter Solstice Festival, his burning point for money was all for nothing.

158
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,760
Now with mixed effort, Old Jiang can rest in peace.

159
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,160
I couldn't pay him for his kindness to my family.

160
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,990
The only thing I can do is to prove Boss Jiang's innocence.

161
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,410
He will then rest in peace in heaven.

162
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,580
Your mother has such a son who is willing to redeem himself for the family,

163
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,440
that is her good fortune.

164
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:37,770
But the case happened twelve years ago, it won't be easy to turn around the case.

165
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:43,390
I have no choice but to seek your help now.

166
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,580
I won't be able to help you

167
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,910
but there are some matters that I can tell you.

168
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:59,500
Old Master Jiang and I were on very good terms. I know how he was too.

169
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,720
Just like what you said,

170
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,940
he would never do anything like that.

171
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:14,550
The years following the wrongful death of Boss Jiang, there were a lot of people who could have cried foul.

172
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:21,010
The strange thing is that he payed for other's grievances but everyone suffered in the end.

173
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,680
I'm ashamed for not speaking sooner but now I can help prove Jiang's innocence.

174
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:34,510
But I think when he was implicated and everyone was tight-lipped.

175
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:40,840
I wanted to find a home for windows and orphans and find a solution

176
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:47,340
but when I heard that they were kicked out by the tribe, they have been hiding in their hometown.

177
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:53,400
I sent men to find out about their whereabouts but there was no news.

178
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,330
I heard that Jiang Yu is very capable now and he has gotten back Ling Long.

179
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:04,070
At that time, I was a coward and didn't dare to speak up on his father's behalf.

180
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:09,990
I don't have the face to see him. Thus, I have never visited him.

181
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,050
If you are sure that Old Master Jiang was duped, where is the evidence?

182
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:22,100
The incident happened a long time ago. If there are any evidence, it would already have been burnt.

183
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,670
Boss Jiang was wronged and not only be my side of the story.

184
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:34,310
I think if you could find the case file from that year, perhaps you could read through the documents.

185
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:34,990
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

186
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,790
- Miss Lu. <br>- You are looking for me?

187
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,550
I'm here to ask for your help to investigate a case.

188
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,540
You are really insincere.

189
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,160
When you look for me, it's either to help you find a fountain pen or to investigate a case.

190
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,380
Can't you treat me to a meal or go to the movies?

191
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,380
As for dinner and movie thing, how could I dare to cross warlord Lu?

192
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,990
We are discussing business and nothing else.

193
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,550
Speak. What help do you need?

194
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:34,550
During the Xuantong years is when the opium trafficking case took place.

195
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:39,160
We are a republic country now and you want me to help you investigate an official court case?

196
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,540
On what ground do you think I am able to do that?

197
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,750
If you cannot do it, Miss Lu, no one can.

198
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,940
I would like to see the records of the case. You are the only one who can help me with this.

199
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,130
Fine.

200
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,990
Since you said that we are presently discussing business now and nothing else,

201
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,830
if I can help you with this difficult request,

202
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,190
how are you going to thank me?

203
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,590
Tell me.

204
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,280
I want Ling Long's secret formula.

205
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,080
I think you are mistaken. I was with Ling Long for many years and have never heard about this.

206
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,320
I know that you don't have it. Anyway, it's not that urgent just as long as you will help me.

207
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,710
When doing business, it's for mutual benefits. Please do something for me.

208
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,950
If you think that you can't do it, let's not transact this business then.

209
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,780
I agree.

210
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,440
Don't play me. I know many secrets about you.

211
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,020
I'm leaving.

212
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,870
<i>Cai Hong, be patient. I will come and get you soon.</i>

213
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:24,140
<i>I will be able to show Jiang Yu's true colour soon and reveal the truth for you.</i>

214
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,470
Is everyone here?

215
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,400
Yes.

216
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,470
Today is the 15th of July, Ghost Festival, and the day for us to remember Old Master.

217
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:47,350
Mom. I have already prepared everything.

218
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:57,320
Every year, we have prepared for this festival. There was no other exception.

219
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,950
Especially when Old Master will be back today. Everyone, don't delay it.

220
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,860
Yes.

221
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,720
Go and do whatever you are assigned to do.

222
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,230
Yes.

223
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,670
Have you heated up the buns?

224
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,490
Yes, it should be ready soon.

225
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,490
Let me take a look.

226
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,200
Let me take a look. Are you okay?

227
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,750
Let me see.

228
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,600
Move aside.

229
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,030
What's wrong?

230
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,800
Did you scald yourself? Are you okay?

231
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,240
Let me take a look.

232
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,860
It's not me.

233
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,600
It's Miss.

234
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:55,980
Brother, you still don't admit that you treat Wu Cai Hong differently?

235
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,670
I was flustered just now and didn't check who was hurt.

236
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,720
That's because the problem is you didn't see who was hurt.

237
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,160
Your subconscious behavior is being driven by your inner thoughts.

238
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,450
Brother, I'm your sister.

239
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,730
We went through hard times for twelve years.

240
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,090
We got back Ling Long together to take revenge for father.

241
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:28,520
Other than your mother, I'm your closest relative in this world.

242
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,370
But why was

243
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:35,010
the first person that you were concerned about today was Wu Cai Hong and not me?

244
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:39,490
In your heart, Wu Cai Hong is more valuable than me.

245
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,510
You are still not going to admit it?

246
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,910
I have matters to attend to. I'm leaving first.

247
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,700
What you are feeling inside?

248
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,080
Why must you force me to talk about this?

249
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,560
Fei Fei. What exactly do you want?

250
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,030
I want Wu Cai Hong to leave this house.

251
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,210
Since you can't control your own feelings,

252
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,420
don't let your emotions bring you down.

253
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,010
Brother. You won't let me and Mom

254
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,790
and also our father who is in heaven be disappointed with you, right?

255
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:25,820
I will repeat myself. I will decide my own affairs.

256
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,080
Brother, you are really foolish.

257
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,910
Do you think you can run away from this problem?

258
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,150
Come back, dear.

259
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:55,210
It has been many years. How are you doing in that world?

260
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,940
Shao Tian has the ability now.

261
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,490
We are doing better than before.

262
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,500
If you need anything there,

263
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,070
just appear in Shao Tian and my dreams.

264
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,570
I know what you are worried about.

265
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:26,120
Don't worry. I don't have any grudges now.

266
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,070
He will understand me one day.

267
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,440
What you do mean by saying all that?

268
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,740
If there is anything on your mind, just tell me directly.

269
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,060
You don't need to complain in front of dad.

270
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,660
Shao Tian. You have misunderstood me.

271
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,950
I don't have any misunderstandings with you.

272
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,940
Father.

273
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,940
If you didn't pass away early,

274
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,010
you could be enjoying this.

275
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,920
I know that because our family was poor, you didn't have the will to live.

276
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,910
I have my own factor now. I can make big bucks.

277
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
Everything that I have done

278
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,110
was for you.

279
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:59,500
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

280
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,340
How could you be just like a ghost?

281
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,210
Would be there be such a beautiful female ghost just like me?

282
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,940
Or one that would also be this thoughtful?

283
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,330
Guess what this is.

284
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,540
This is the opium case regarding the Jiang family.

285
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,110
Don't forget what you promised me.

286
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,060
Of course, I will find Ling Long's secret formula as soon as possible.

287
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,890
This is the way.

288
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,770
I already read this report.

289
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:08,570
According to what is written in the report, Jiang Family should have transported 100 tons of opium before.

290
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,690
Only for this amount,

291
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:16,730
the owed tax amount and the fine could bankrupt Jiang Family.

292
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,760
But, most of the drug smugglers had an accomplice.

293
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,340
In this report, Jiang Wen Yuan was the only one found guilty.

294
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,590
This point doesn't add up.

295
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:33,020
Think about it. It's such a big amount. Where did it come from?

296
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,900
How was it transported? Where was it stored?

297
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,290
If it was really stored in Ling Long, 100 ton

298
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:45,520
they wouldn't be able to hide it. I find this rather amusing.

299
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,760
Perhaps, all these weren't recorded here.

300
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,940
Because it could not be explained clearly, why try to make it worse?

301
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,900
Even more strange, I searched the records of Huzhou regarding the past 12 years,

302
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:06,090
on it, there is no mention of the opium case 12 years ago.

303
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,120
To put on a show, why was it recorded?

304
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,110
So, twelve years ago, Jiang Wen Yuan's case

305
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,380
was a case of mis-identity.

306
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:31,130
Exactly. Also the true criminal was the police chief at the time.

307
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:36,070
And the ultimate victor was Wu Hong Da.

308
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:43,160
<i>Cai Hong. I can finally get you out from there.</i>

309
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,900
However, according to the predictions,

310
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,670
could it be that the Jiang family in this case is Jiang Yu's family?

311
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,510
Of course.

312
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:59,540
Wu Cai Hong's father is Wu Hong Da. Jiang Yu's father is Jiang Wen Yuan.

313
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,720
Wu Hong Da, as the Police Chief, killed Jiang Wen Yuan because of money.

314
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,090
He took their family business, Ling Long Fabric Plant.

315
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:19,030
Tell me what is Jiang Yu's motive for getting close to Cia Hong.

316
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,430
Revenge

317
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:27,220
but if Jiang Yu really falls in love with Cai Hong now...

318
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,510
Who cares whether it's real love or not.

319
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:40,930
If Cai Hong were to find out that he got close to her just to take revenge for his father, what do you think she will think?

320
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:47,180
If I were Wu Cai Hong, I would definitely hate him to death.

321
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:53,630
The acquisition went well yet I am afraid of hurting Cai Hong.

322
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,900
It is the result of revenge and Wu Hong Da's death.

323
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:04,390
Then, Ms. Wu will naturally come back into your arms.

324
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:09,060
You exerted that much effort just to win a woman.

325
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,150
You are really passionate.

326
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,330
Thanks.

327
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:00,920
Old Master, you can rest in peace now.

328
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,320
The children have already grown up to be adults.

329
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,390
Your son has done well. He has taken revenge for you.

330
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:28,900
I will never be able to repay the kindness of the Jiang family.

331
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:36,540
I will always take care of the Jiang family and repay you back for your kindness. Mom is getting old

332
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,230
and brother has grown up.

333
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:45,250
Don't worry. I will take good care of Mom for you

334
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:50,010
and I will also take good care of brother too.

335
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,020
It's getting late.

336
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,970
Son. Go with Fei Fei to release the water lantern.

337
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,410
Madam.

338
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,910
Cai Hong, what is it?

339
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:21,910
Today is the Ghost Festival. Could you let me take time off?

340
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:25,360
I will like to release a water lantern for my father.

341
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,780
It's rare for someone to be this filial. Go now.

342
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,010
Thank you, Madam.

343
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:48,070
Quick.

344
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,120
Why are you keeping a close watch on my brother?

345
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:35,500
I know what you are thinking in your heart but it's just your fantasy.

346
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:41,370
This is just a dream. The deeper you get involved, you will only get hurt more.

347
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,340
Because my brother will never really like you.

348
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,420
I don't know what you are talking about.

349
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,510
I want to hide it so it is not exposed.

350
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:58,040
Ask yourself then what exactly you are thinking of.

351
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,990
Cai Hong.

352
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,050
Brother Shao Tian.

353
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,090
What are you doing here?

354
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:27,960
I'm here to tell a story to Cai Hong about what happened between the Jiang and Wu families twelve years ago.

355
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,410
Cai Hong. Jiang Yu is a consummate liar.

356
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,630
You have been tricked.

357
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,060
Brother Shao Tian. What are you talking about?

358
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,500
You are only just a tool for his revenge. Everything that he has done,

359
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,550
it was because of the opium case at Ling Long twelve years ago.

360
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,500
Your dad's death, Ling Long's confiscation,

361
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,340
it was all part of his plan.

362
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,750
Cai Hong, come over here.

363
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,940
- Stay far away from that liar. <br>- Zhou Shao Tian, what are you doing?

364
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,260
I want you to see his true colour.

365
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,520
Brother Shao Tian, don't do this.

366
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,860
Cai Hong!

367
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,630
Cai Hong.

368
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,850
Brother, don't you want your life?

369
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,750
Move aside.

370
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,690
Brother.

371
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,910
Brother.

00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,400

- Brother. <br>- Cai Hong. <br>- Do you know what you are doing now?

390
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:55,820
You risked your own life for Wu Hong Da's daughter.

391
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,010
Did you think about Mom and me? Have you gone crazy?

392
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,560
What she and Brother Shao Tian said,

393
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,890
is it true?

394
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,370
Cai Hong.

395
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,710
Take your hands away from her.

396
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,500
Cai Hong. Are you okay?

397
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,920
I'm taking you to the hospital.

398
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,590
Brother, come to your senses.

399
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,700
Don't keep making this mistake.

400
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,050
It's a dead end ahead. Give up.

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

402
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,330
Doctor, how is she?

403
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,760
I have already done tests on Miss Wu.

404
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,370
Her injury is not grave. She only has some superficial wounds. She was only shocked.

405
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:44,640
it took a toll on her physical strnght, so she is very weak now.

406
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,780
When she wakes up and feels much better, she can be discharged then.

407
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,940
Thank you.

408
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,520
No.

409
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,530
This can't be true.

410
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,200
No.

411
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,900
This is not true.

412
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,760
Cai Hong.

413
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,050
What's wrong with you?

414
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,920
Brother Shao Tian, what's going on?

415
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:38,260
Did I have a nightmare last night?

416
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,610
Cai Hong. Everything that happened last night

417
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,960
was real.

418
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,430
Are you saying that

419
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,940
my father

420
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,030
was Jiang family's enemy?

421
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,000
Is this true too?

422
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,860
Twelve years ago, your father was innocent.

423
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,300
Jiang Yu's father, Jiang Wen Yuan, was the owner of Ling Long.

424
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:18,010
He was charged with possession of opium. Jiang Wen Yuan condemned him

425
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:22,960
and seized his home. Later Jiang Wen Yuan died

426
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,130
and your father became the new owner of Ling Long.

427
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,410
I found someone to investigate this case.

428
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:36,620
This is indeed a messed up case.

429
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,980
It was your father, Wu Hong Da.

430
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,940
It can't be.

431
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,490
My father would never do something harmful like this.

432
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:56,450
Cai Hong. I'm telling you this not for you to keep go after your father's mistake.

433
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,870
That happened in that era.

434
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:05,240
This incident happened twelve years ago. Your father is no longer here. He's already dead.

435
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:10,940
I wanted you to learn so that you can see Jiang Yu's true colour.

436
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,640
He is only using revenge to take back what he has lost.

437
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,310
Come to your senses. Don't be tricked by that rascal.
