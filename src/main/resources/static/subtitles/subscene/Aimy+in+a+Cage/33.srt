19
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,700
<i>Episode 33</i>

20
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,790
Mom. Cai Hong is here.

21
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,740
Don't let her come in.

22
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,750
Madam. I only want to visit you.

23
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,850
During the fire,

24
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,060
you risked your life to save me.

25
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,610
I should thank you,

26
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,760
but I really can't face you.

27
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,260
When I look at him, I think of my husband's

28
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,740
miserable death caused by your dad

29
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,900
Thus,

30
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,620
I'm requesting of you,

31
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,090
don't let me see you again.

32
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,690
I know. My dad had done something unforgivable.

33
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,350
I can't do anything about what happened.

34
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,580
Thus, I would like to beg for your forgiveness.

35
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,330
Madam. As long as you are willing to forgive me,

36
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,160
I'm willing to do anything.

37
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,640
I'm willing to pay any price.

38
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,520
Mom. Cai Hong is already kneeling down.

39
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,000
Let her kneel down.

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,310
I will never dote on her.

41
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,540
Fei Fei, shut the door.

42
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:11,410
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

43
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,410
It's useless for you to wait here. Looking at the scenery?

44
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,380
Not only will I admit that you treat Cai Hong very well.

45
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:48,410
When I look at you sometimes, I also think that if I let Cai Hong go, it's for her own good.

46
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,910
Letting you be with her is the best choice.

47
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,390
But sometimes, I also feel that

48
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,420
only I would be able to give up everything in order to protect her.

49
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,380
Regardless of who she is, why don't I let her stay with me?

50
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,450
I will feel assured this way.

51
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,410
I have thought about the same thing as you.

52
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,960
Too bad I am not you.

53
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,970
My companion and care

54
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,480
may not make her happy.

55
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,290
The one is Cai Hong's heart is you.

56
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,830
I could do more for Cai Hong than you.

57
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,190
It was the best for Cai Hong to be with me

58
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,680
but later, I realised that

59
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,350
no matter what I do, it won't be what she wants.

60
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,380
What she wants is you.

61
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,230
If you and Cai Hong get together, the path will be tough

62
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,450
but if you retreat because of these hardships,

63
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,290
that means I would have misjudged you.

64
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,330
I know that you are not that kind of person.

65
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,280
It's because I know that even if I'm not happy with it,

66
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,620
I'm willing to hand Cai Hong over to you.

67
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,300
You must protect her and give her happiness.

68
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,230
Aren't you going to see her now?

69
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,990
Cai Hong, are you okay?

70
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,170
- Stop kneeling. Get up. <br>- Don't bother about me.

71
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,450
It's my father's mistakes. As his daughter,

72
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,070
I must pay the debts on behalf of my father.

73
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,640
Jiang Yu.

74
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,170
Mom. I'm taking Cai Hong back first.

75
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,430
Have a good rest.

76
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,930
Karma.

77
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,040
Mom, have some tea.

78
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,290
Frankly, Cai Hong is very pitiful.

79
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,420
She hasn't recovered from her injuries and she kneeled down on the cold floor.

80
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,230
Even more so even though she got injured because of others,

81
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,880
she needs to shoulder the consequences of her father's mistakes.

82
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,730
This is not fair either.

83
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,910
It would have been great if the fire would have burned away the grudges between the two families.

84
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,020
The most pitiful one is brother. He's caught in the middle.

85
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,430
Like a saw that

86
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,950
has pierced his heart.

87
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,200
Why are you looking at me?

88
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,860
Do you know that

89
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,200
by doing this, I will misunderstand.

90
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,860
I don't think you will misunderstand.

91
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,540
In any case, it's not a misunderstanding.

92
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,260
Cai Hong. I was wrong in the past.

93
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,080
I didn't treasure you well.

94
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,840
Sorry.

95
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,820
But if

96
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,090
we were together,

97
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,650
your mom will be hurt.

98
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,210
You told me that

99
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,820
hatred can be resolved.

100
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,480
You have always been working hard

101
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,120
and paying for it.

102
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,780
Starting from today, I won't let you fight the battle alone.

103
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,100
I will stay with you. Let's work hard together.

104
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,860
We have the biggest problem between us.

105
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,690
It's the grudge between the Wu and Jiang families.

106
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,710
Cai Hong.

107
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,900
Life is short and life is fragile.

108
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,670
Anything can happen in any day.

109
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,700
Just like two days ago. I almost lost you in the fire.

110
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,780
I don't want to wait till I have lost it before I try to get it back.

111
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,630
We should treasure them when we can enjoy them.

112
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,710
As for the grudge between our families,

113
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,700
let's face it together.

114
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,630
But Madam...

115
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,690
I believe that as long as we work hard together,

116
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,600
we can move her heart.

117
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,580
She will definitely accept us.

118
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,670
Are you willing to face it together with me

119
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,620
and face the trials together?

120
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,500
I'm willing.

121
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,620
Miss.

122
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,480
Uncle Lai.

123
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,850
All these materials don't have the right feel.

124
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,550
When we get the Jiang's secret formula, then Miss will be able to dye the way you want.

125
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,400
I don't want to wait anymore.

126
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,170
When are we going to start to kidnap Madam Jiang?

127
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,040
These few days, our people have been spying at the hospital.

128
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,450
There are many eyes at the hospital. Jiang Yu is always at the hospital too.

129
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,870
We can't take action.

130
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,450
Why don't we wait?

131
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,730
I don't want to wait anymore.

132
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,080
If I continue to wait, I'm afraid that I will go crazy one day.

133
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,900
If they collect evidence against me,

134
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,300
the Military Governor will shoot me.

135
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,790
In the eyes of these men,

136
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm not worth anything.

137
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,120
I will send men to take action now.

138
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,600
Uncle Lai.

139
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,530
Once we have gotten the secret formula,

140
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,490
let's leave this place.

141
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,480
I don't want this kind of life anymore.

142
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,680
Doctor, is the medical examination over?

143
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,360
Yes.

144
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,030
Don't worry, Miss Wu.

145
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,190
Your injuries are recovering well.

146
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,550
Will they leave any scars?

147
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,380
Even if there are scars, you will be just as beautiful. Everything's fine.

148
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,260
Don't talk nonsense.

149
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,890
Don't worry. As long as she takes her medicines on time,

150
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,970
and she doesn't get injured again in the future,

151
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,490
I guarantee that there won't be any scars.

152
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:17,260
But there may be a mark on your forehead.

153
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,240
Okay, have a good rest. Call me if there is anything.

154
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,230
Doctor, I will see you out.

155
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,960
- Okay, go back. <br>- Take care.

156
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,840
What's wrong?

157
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,320
Nothing.

158
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,440
The weather is nice today. Go out for a walk with me.

159
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,220
The doctor already told you to rest well. Don't wander anywhere.

160
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,390
I have some matters to attend to. I'm going out for a while.

161
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,090
Where are you going?

162
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,180
I'm not telling you. I will be back soon.

163
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,060
You are already keeping secrets from me so soon?

164
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,270
Are you regretting now?

165
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,970
It's too late.

166
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,430
Boss Jiang.

167
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,690
Let's go.

168
00:16:50,030 --> 00:17:02,380
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

169
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,730
- Hello, Sir. <br> - Hello.

170
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,850
May I ask what you need?

171
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:20,230
I would like to customise a necklace.

172

Hello, Madam Jiang.

We are here to examine you.

Please come with us to the medical room.

176
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,040
I don't have a medical examination today.

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,090
To add further. I'm recovering well.

178
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,650
Look. I'm going to be discharged soon.

179
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,440
It's like this, Madam Jiang. This will be the last medical examination

180
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,420
to make sure that you can recover completely and get discharged.

181
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,160
Where is my previous doctor?

182
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,980
I'm very familiar with the doctors here. Why haven't I seen you before?

183
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,850
These few are not bad.

184
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,280
Yes, and this too.

185
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,810
Many rich housewives have seen these.

186
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,980
How about this?

187
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,920
Sir. You have really good taste.

188
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,430
This is our shop's treasure.

189
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,240
This necklace picks people to wear

190
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,850
to be their Miss.

191
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,680
Madam Jiang, are you there?

192
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,060
Who... who is it?

193
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,500
It's Cai Hong. Can I come in to see you?

194
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,130
Get lost. I already told you many times that I don't want to see you.

195
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,070
Make the person outside leave

196
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,900
- I didn't. <br>- If you try it, I will shoot you.

197
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,030
I'm not feeling very well.

198
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,790
I don't want to see any guests.

199
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:34,080
Madam. Your voice doesn't sound normal. Where are you unwell?

200
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,840
Don't bother me. Just leave.

201
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,050
Why don't I call the doctor to see you?

202
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,610
No need. Just leave.

203
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,450
Madam. I'm really worried about your health.

204
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,510
I'm coming in now.

205
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,610
Don't bother me. Leave now.

206
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,620
Even if you don't want to see me, I can't just ignore that.

207
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,690
I'm really coming in now.

208
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,700
Why didn't you listen to me?

209
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,480
Don't move.

210
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,500
You better be sensible.

211
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,560
Let's go.

212
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,160
Don't be rash.

213
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,910
I'm telling you, this is the hospital. If there is a gunshot sound, you wont be able to escape.

214
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,010
As long as you listen to me, I won't kill you.

215
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,910
We only want Madam Jiang.

216
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,510
Are you using her to threaten Jiang Yu?

217
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,410
This is none of your business.

218
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,410
If you are smart, don't foil our plan. Don't waste time. Take her away.

219
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,440
Don't capture Madam. Exchange her life for mine.

220
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,280
No. Let her go.

221
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,910
Madam Jiang.

222
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,830
All of you better stay still.

223
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,670
Don't try to play any tricks.

224
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,680
I know. You are trying to stall for time, right?

225
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,880
Believe me or not, I will kill her.

226
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,670
I know who you are.

227
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,560
Lu Man must have sent you here.

228
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,090
Miss Lu doesn't want you to come here and kill anyone.

229
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,280
She wants you to come here

230
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,040
because she knows that Madam Jiang is very important.

231
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,650
She sent to you do her bad things. <i>dirty work. </i>

232
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,290
When the time comes, even if she lets you off,

233
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,890
the police won't let you go.

234
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,130
Rotten wench. Shut up.

235
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,610
If you speak again, I will kill you.

236
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,650
Jiang Yu. He treats me well.

237
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,240
I'm very important to him.

238
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,270
Believe me. Use me to help hand over the secret formula.

239
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,160
Don't listen to her nonsense.

240
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,960
No. She's lying.

241
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,450
Take me away and you will achieve your goal.

242
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,930
Don't do this.

243
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,840
If you make noise again, I will kill you.

244
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,930
Cut the crap. Take them both along.

245
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,010
No It's too dangerous for you to do this.

246
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:48,320
Many doctors and nurses in the hospital recognise Madam Jiang. I don't know anyone here. I'm the safest.

247
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,610
Trust me. Jiang Yu will use all means to help me.

248
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,830
Okay, just take her along.

249
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,580
- Let's go. <br>- No, don't take her away.

250
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,240
Madam.

251
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,740
Shut up. Let's go.

252
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,510
Madam.

253
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,210
Cai Hong.

254
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,410
Cai Hong.

255
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,320
Mom.

256
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,400
Mom.

257
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,410
Mom!

258
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,200
Mom. Doctor!

259
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,320
- Is anyone there? <br>- What's wrong?

260
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,310
Something has happened to my mother.

261
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,160
What's wrong with Mom?

262
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,550
I don't know either.

263
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,180
When I just came in, she was already in this state.

264
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,840
Madam Jiang's head suffered a powerful blow.

265
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,390
Fortunately, it's not serious. She will be when she wakes up.J

266
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,760
She was in her room. How did she get hurt?

267
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,550
Er... this we cannot conclude why either.

268
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:32,190
- I'm going to prescribe some medicines for Madam Jiang. <br>- Thanks, Doctor.

269
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,500
Fei Fei, keep watch on Mom. Take good care of her. I'm going out for a while and will be back soon.

270
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,150
Brother!

271
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,140
Cai Hong!

272
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,640
- Did you see Miss Wu? <br>- No.

273
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,320
- Did you see Miss Wu? - No

274
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,410
Cai Hong!

275
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,920
Cai Hong!

276
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,200
Mr Jiang. Madam Jiang is awake. She keeps crying.

277
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,490
Go there now.

278
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,780
Fei Fei. What should we do?

279
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,890
Mom.

280
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,850
- Yu Er. <br>- You are awake. Are you okay?

281
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,500
Cai Hong has been taken away by the bad people.

282
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,630
What should we do?

283
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,580
- You must think of a way to save her? <br>- Cai Hong has been taken away?

284
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,480
I don't know.

285
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,710
Two fake doctors came in

286
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,740
and wanted to take me away. Cai Hong, that foolish girl,

287
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,720
to save me, she...

288
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,750
Do you know those two doctors?

289
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,080
No.

290
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,930
Cai Hong seemed to know those two bad people.

291
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,680
It seems like they are employees of Miss Lu.

292
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,070
Yu Er.

293
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,580
Save her now.

294
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,940
Yu Er. You must think of a way to save her.

295
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,140
Cai Hong.

296
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,110
Cai Hong.

297
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,210
- Cai Hong. <br>- Cai Hong is missing. Where did she go?

298
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,170
- Cai Hong was kidnapped by someone. <br>- Kidnapped?

299
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,560
Who kidnapped her?

300
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,920
Lu Man's men.

301
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,890
Jiang Yu. It's always you! Every time when something happens to Cai Hong, it's always because of you.

302
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,410
Why weren't you with her? Where did you go?

303
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,160
Do you think I wanted it to be like this? I don't want it either.

304
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,810
Where did she go?

305
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,270
Where did she go? Say something!

306
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,480
I'm going to find Lu Man. I'm going alone.

307
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,920
What's the use of finding Lu Man?

308
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,140
If she took Cai Hong away, why wouldn't she run away? Use your brain!

309
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,980
What you can only do now is to wait. Wait till she states her terms.

310
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:02,070
Lu Man, I won't let you off.

311
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,230
Miss Lu.

312
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,890
Please.

313
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,020
Miss Wu. We meet again.

314
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,330
So, it's you.

315
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:39,260
You kidnapped me just for the Jiang family's secret formula, right?

316
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,660
Miss Wu is smart. You are right on the mark.

317
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,180
If I didn't guess wrongly,

318
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,800
I'm guessing that you killed my father too.

319
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,040
<i>Boss Wu. I was here early by a few minutes.</i>

320
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,890
<i>I didn't see anyone on the way here.</i>

321
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,370
<i>I even thought I got the time wrong.</i>

322
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,280
<i>Today is my birthday. I let the staff off.</i>

323
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,670
<i>Old Master Wu, you are hurt.</i>

324
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,090
<i>So how? Do you want to go to the hospital?</i>

325
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,740
<i>I'm fine. It's just a small injury.</i>

326
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:54,810
<i>Boss Wu. I'm here to help Ling Long get through the hard times.</i>

327
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,100
<i>Okay then. Let's discuss real business.</i>

328
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,350
<i>Okay then. I will get to the point then.</i>

329
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,800
<i>I am aware of Ling Long's situation. <br> I am willing to help.</i>

330
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,200
<i>but...</i>

331
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:15,120
<i>But what. As long as I can do it,</i>

332
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,220
<i>I will definitely do my best.</i>

333
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,360
<i>I am someone that doesn't like to force people.</i>

334
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,210
<i>The request that I want, as long as you are willing,</i>

335
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,000
<i> you can definitely do it.</i>

336
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,030
<i>Please speak.</i>

337
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:36,710
<i>I want the Jiang family's secret formula. The price is negotiable.</i>

338
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,910
<i>I already told you that</i>

339
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,550
<i>I don't have the secret formula.</i>

340
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,850
<i>A straightforward person does not resort to insinuations.</i>

341
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,590
<i>I know that the Jiang family's secret formula is with you.</i>

342
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:08,160
<i>Moreover, Ling Long and the secret formula don't belong to you either.</i>

343
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,630
<i>Hand over the secret formula in exchange for cash to save Ling Long. Think about it.</i>

344
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,440
<i>This transaction will be worth it.</i>

345
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,800
<i>You are thinking too much.</i>

346
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,150
<i>I will repeat myself. I don't have any secret formulas.</i>

347
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:27,060
<i>You should think carefully.</i>

348
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,890
<i>This is your last lifeline.</i>

349
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,490
<i>I don't need to think anymore then.</i>

350
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:44,440
<i>I'm telling you. If you don't hand over the secret formula today, don't think of leaving here alive.</i>

351
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,910
<i>Shoot then.</i>

352
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,850
<i>Fire the gun!</i>

353
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,240
<i>Let me tell you. Even if I have it,</i>

354
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,710
<i>I won't give it to you.</i>

355
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,410
<i>Do you want to fire the gun? Fire then!</i>

356
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,360
<i>Go away.</i>

357
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,200
<i>- Give it to me. <br>- Let go.</i>

358
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,570
<i>Give me the secret formula now.</i>

359
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:12,110
<i>I'm telling you. Even if I die,</i>

360
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,710
<i>I will never give it to you.</i>

361
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,300
<i>Give it to me.</i>

362
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,380
<i>Dad!</i>

363
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,200
<i>Dad!</i>

364
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,790
It was me

365
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,880
who killed him.

366
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,320
ut you don't have the evidence.

367
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,390
Without any evidence, what can you do?

368
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,130
I will have the evidence sooner or later.

369
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,030
By doing this,

370
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,290
you are not afraid that God will punish you?

371
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,520
Don't talk to me about God.

372
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,950
I don't believe in this.

373
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,730
God will never come.

374
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:56,850
If you are that worried, why didn't God open his eyes

375
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,380
and deliver you to me instead?

376
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:06,300
By the way, you seems to be Jiang Yu's girlfriend.

377
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,180
Frankly, I planned to kidnap Madam Jiang

378
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,260
and use her to threaten Jiang Yu to trade her for the secret formula.

379
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,300
But little did i know, you would fall into my trap.

380
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,640
I will use you then to trade with Jiang Yu.

381
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,170
You are wrong then. I'm not Jiang Yu's girlfriend.

382
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,350
I lied to you.

383
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:35,410
Jiang Yu will never come.

384
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,130
My father harmed his father.

385
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,300
Wu's family and Jiang's family have death feud

386
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,350
Consider your plan as a having failed.

387
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:55,110
Do you know what kind of people I hate the most?

388
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,500
Those who lie to me.

389
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,930
If you are not Jiang Yu's girlfriend, you better pray to God to help you.

390
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:07,170
If not, you have only one life.

391
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,410
You will not succeed!

392
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,450
Is it? That might not be the case.

393
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,270
I can tell that

394
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,350
Jiang Yu doesn't treat you like anyone else.

395
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,740
He will definitely come to save you.

396
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,800
I almost forgot. Zhou Shao Tian too.

397
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,930
Why don't we do this? Let's play a game and bet on

398
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,960
which of these two men will save your first?

399
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,400
If they are late,

400
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,060
I will kill them for you.

401
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,760
Okay?

402
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,770
You are a lunatic.

403
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,790
<i>Jiang Yu, don't come.</i>

404
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,010
<i>Don't ever come.</i>

405
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,760
<i>Brother Shao Tian.</i>

406
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,170
<i>Don't come either.</i>

407
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,090
<i>You must not come either.</i>

408
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,920
Mr Jiang. Someone delivered a letter for you.

409
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,410
Who? <br>- I'm not very sure. He gave it and left.

410
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,000
- Thanks. <br>- Don't mention it.

411
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:56,400
<i>Jiang Yu, bring the Jiang's family secret formula alone<br> and meet me at the street tonight. </i>

412
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,120
<i>Don't be late. Don't report this to the police.</i>

413
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,720
<i>Otherwise Cai Hong will die.</i>

414
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,910
<i>Good luck</i>

415
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,690
What do you plan to do?

416
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,970
Why aren't you saying anything?

417
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,510
Is it because you can't bear to part with your family's secret formula?

418
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,070
How could I do that?

419
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,230
I know that the secret formula is priceless to you.

420
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,930
In the past, no matter how I forced you, you wouldn't hand over.

421
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,080
This secret formula is precious to Jiang's house.

422
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,410
Are you willing to take it out in exchange for Cai Hong's life?

423
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,520
Don't even talk about the secret formula. Even if it's my life, I would use it to trade for her.

424
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,810
It is no expense.

425
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,830
I know Lu Man very well.

426
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,640
I'm worried that once you hand over the secret formula to her,

427
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,160
she won't let you and Cai Hong come out alive.

428
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,120
This is what I'm most worried about.

429
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,980
We must think of a flawless plan.

430
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,920
Why don't we do this? It's still better that I go to Lu Man's place alone.

431
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,740
Go and seek Director Chen's help. We will meet again later.

432
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:25,940
But Lu Man has a spy within the police force. You must be extra careful.

433
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,980
Miss.

434
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,790
Come in.

435
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,810
Miss. Everything has been arranged. We are only just waiting for Jiang Yu.

436
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,970
This is...

437
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,970
the pin that your mom left.

438
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,500
Yes.

439
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,450
This is the only thing my Mom left me.

440
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,620
I'm going to wear this today

441
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,620
and prove to her that I will definitely get the secret formula.

442
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:48,560
I want to create her favourite gown again.

443
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,680
I want to prove to her that

444
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,810
I will bring back Wang's house glory.

445
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,760
Ke Ke.

446
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,590
I am sure your mom will understand your kindness.

447
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,050
Your wish...

448
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,360
your mom in heaven,

449
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,610
will protect you and make it come true.

450
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,760
Uncle Lai.

451
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,840
All these years,

452
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,120
I have been around those wealthy and powerful men everyday,

453
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,630
drinking with them, serving them.

454
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,270
I had enough.

455
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,500
Starting from today,

456
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,600
I am going to end that kind of dirty life.

457
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,920
Once I get the secret formula,

458
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,120
I want to start a new life.

459
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,930
Then I won't need to waste my energy serving those people.

460
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,720
Those disgusting people.

461
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,540
There will come a day,

462
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,250
I will get those who took advantage of me

463
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,480
and cut off their limbs.

464
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,370
Ke Ke. Don't worry. Even if I sacrifice my life today,

465
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:13,510
I will help you to fulfill your wish.

466
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,900
Are all the men ready?

467
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,610
Yes.

468
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:28,300
Don't even talk about Jiang Yu. Even a fly wouldn't be able to escape.

469
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,770
Don't be too complacent.

470
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,680
Jiang Yu is very sly.

471
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,520
Zhou Shao Tian is very toxic.

472
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,530
Tell our people to be on high alert.

473
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,650
Once we get the secret formula, all will get rewarded.

474
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,440
Yes.

475
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,010
Miss. Why are we preparing these?

476
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,540
Jiang Yu is very sly.

477
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,820
I won't know whether he will bring the real or fake secret formula.

478
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,640
Thus, I want to personally see him dye the cloth

479
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,040
and make sure that the secret formula is real.

480
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,360
But this secret formula is from Jiang ancestors,

481
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,770
Would Jiang Yu bring it? th

482
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,290
I can only take a gamble.

483
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,290
I want to see

484
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,840
in Jiang Yu's heart whether the secret formula is important or

485
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,310
if Wu Cai Hong is more important.

486
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,590
What about Zhou Shao Tian?

487
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,010
He will never let this rest.

488
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,490
Zhou Shao Tian.

489
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:02,670
When you meet Jiang Yu later, don't bring him straight here first.

490
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,760
Take him for a few rounds.

491
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,330
If you find that there are people following him, get rid of them.

492
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,900
Yes.

493
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,540
Wu Cai Hong.

494
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,610
I almost forgot.

495
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,560
You are Wu Hong Da's daughter.

496
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,670
You definitely know about the secret formula.

497
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,920
So what if I do?

498
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,240
Even if I know, I won't tell you.

499
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,150
You have such a tight mouth.

500
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,220
Tell me then.

501
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,150
What should I use to make you talk?

502
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,930
Why don't we try this needle

503
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,820
and see if it will make you talk?

504
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:35,370
If you hand over the secret formula to me now,

505
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,930
I won't let you die.

506
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,750
Dream on.

507
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,700
If it doesn't belongs to you, it won't.

508
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,540
You will never obtain the secret formula.
