00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,300
<i>Episode 28</i>

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,300
Cai Hong?

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,300
You father really gave you a nice name.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,800
After the storm is gone and all clouds disappear,

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,670
you are able to see the rainbow.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,600
Are you comforting me?

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Can everything dissapear

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,900
and the sky clear after the rain?

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,800
If this is the case,

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,000
once I find Old Cai,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,600
and save Brother Shao Tian,

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,100
the grudge between the Jiang and Wu families,

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,940
will it

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
also be lifted?

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,500
I will do my best

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,300
to find Old Cai.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,200
As long as we can end the grudges between our families,

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,600
I will do my best.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,600
Why are you still not sleeping? You are going to die soon and you are still reflecting?

20
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,800
Forget it. He is going to die the day after.

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,000
Let him do whatever he wants.

22
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,200
<i>Cai Hong,</i>

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,000
<i>from far away you share this moment with me.</i>

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,200
<i>I have only two days left.</i>

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,100
<i>How could I possibly sleep?</i>

26
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,200
Miss. Zhou, Shao Tian's man, Ma Li is here to see you.

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,800
Can he just see her like this? Where is the rule?

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,600
Miss. We already taught him a lesson just now,

29
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,000
but he said that he has a very important news to tell you.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Please see him.

31
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
Miss.

32
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,000
Aren't you Zhou Shao Tian's confidante?

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,600
Why are you looking for me?

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,700
Miss Lu.

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,400
Ever since my brother was caught,

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,100
I haven't been living well.

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,000
I would like to follow you.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,510
I would like you to employ me.

39
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,400
You are already beaten in such a state and you still want to follow me?

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,600
It's truly touching.

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,400
But I don't lack any staff here.

42
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,800
I already have enough staff.

43
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,200
What I lack is someone who can get things done.

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,300
Someone who is smart.

45
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,200
Miss Lu. I have a very important news

46
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,200
which I would like to tell you.

47
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,000
After you have heard me out,

48
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,670
you can consider whether you want to take me in or not.

49
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,700
Speak.

50
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,000
Frankly, I know that you are looking for the secret formula.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,700
I know where it is.

52
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,600
Where is it?

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,600
It's with Old Cai's wife, Madam Lin.

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,400
Why should I believe you?

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,900
My brother and I grew up together.

56
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,200
I'm his most trusted person. He doesn't hide anything from me.

57
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,400
When he was caught by the police,

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,900
my brother went to visit him in jail.

59
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,200
He had a condition for saving him.

60
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,600
That's how he forced Old Cai to reveal the whereabouts of the secret formula.

61
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
The secret formula is with Madam Lin but it was a pity that

62
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
before my brother could get it,

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,800
he was caught by the police.

64
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,800
Do you know

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,500
what will happen to you if you lie to me?

66
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,600
I know.

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,200
I wouldn't dare lie to you.

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Frankly speaking, if my brother wasn't caught,

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,400
I would rather take the knife to my neck,

70
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,200
than ever reveal the whereabouts of the secret formula.

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,800
But it's a pity that it's useless for my brother to have the secret formula now.

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,200
I want to survive.

73
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,900
Thus, I'm exchanging this news for a way out.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Jiang Yu has been looking for me for the past two days.

75
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,800
He wants to know where the secret formula is.

76
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,300
He promised to give me lots of money

77
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,200
but I didn't tell him about this.

78
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,500
It's because, in the past, I helped my brother to go against him

79
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,300
and did a lot of things.

80
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,600
Even if I were to tell him this,

81
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,000
he would never let me off.

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,700
I could only ask you for help.

83
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,700
You are still considered smart.

84
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,000
Miss Lu. You must use this time now.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,400
With Jiang Yu's slyness, it won't be long

86
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,800
before he finds out that the secret formula is with Madam Lin.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,800
Zhang Xun.

88
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Take Ma Li out.

89
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,000
Give him some money as he goe.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,600
Thank you, Miss Lu.

91
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,600
Thank you.

92
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,400
Miss. Did you believe what Ma Li just said?

93
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't believe him entirely.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,400
I only believed eighty percent.

95
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,800
We are also not in rush to take any actions. Let's keep watch on Jiang Yu and Wu Cai Hong first.

96
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,400
Miss. Do you really want to retain Ma Li?

97
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,700
Of course not.

98
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,000
This kind of person, he betrayed Zhou Shao Tian today.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,600
He will betray me tomorrow.

100
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,800
What I want is only the information that he's holding.

101
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,700
Uncle Lai.

102
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,600
Find someone to watch Ma Li. Don't let him to see or hear anything.

103
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,300
If not, we might be bitten by him later.

104
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,100
Also, find out the address of Madam Lin as soon as possible.

105
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,030
- Just in case.
<i>(lit. just for a rainy day - when needed)</i>
- Yes.

106
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,000
If you need to order anything, please call me.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,100
Okay.

108
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,000
Would you like to order something?

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,200
Our homemade snacks are really good.

110
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,600
We will call you later.

111
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,200
Please have tea first.

112
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,000
Please enjoy.

113
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,200
Miss Lin.

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,300
Please sit here.

115
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,200
Waiter.

116
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,600
Please sit.

117
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,000
What would you like to order?

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
Miss Lin. What would you like to drink?

119
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,300
No need.

120
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,510
- A pot of Longjing (tea) is good.
- Yes.

121
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,000
By the way, why are you looking for me?

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Regarding Old Cai,

123
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,600
you must be very sad and worried.

124
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,100
Frankly, me too.

125
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,400
I asked you here because I would like to get back

126
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,200
the secret formula that Old Cai took from my father.

127
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,600
Secret formula?

128
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
I didn't know that Old Cai had this secret formula.

129
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,320
I don't know what you are talking about.

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,800
Miss Lin.

131
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,600
This secret formula belonged to my father.

132
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,100
Even more so when my father treated him very well.

133
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,700
Regard this as compensation for his crime.

134
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,000
Miss Wu.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,600
I know that Old Cai

136
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,000
stole the money from Ling Long.

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He was wrong. He has committed a big crime.

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He has wronged the Wu family and Old Master Wu

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,500
but I really didn't know that he had the secret formula.

140
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,200
Thus, even if I really want to give it to you,

141
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't have it.

142
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,100
Since this is the case, I won't insist on it.

143
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,000
But I would like to advise you.

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Even if you don't want to do this for Old Cai, you should think for yourself.

145
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,000
The Zhou Shao Tian, who has been taking care of your family,

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,200
has already been betrayed.

147
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,300
Have you thought of what you are going to do in the future?

148
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,200
I guarantee that as long as you return the secret formula to me,

149
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,900
you won't have to worry about you and your son's living expenses.

150
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,300
I know what you mean.

151
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,840
I also would like to thank you for thinking on my behalf

152
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,900
but regarding the secret formula, I really don't have it.

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
What happened?

154
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,160
I met Miss Lin. She has already gone back

155
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,500
but someone was following me this morning.

156
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,200
Looks like we have hooked Miss Lu.

157
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,300
But Brother Shao Tian will be sentenced to death tomorrow.

158
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,100
What should we do?

159
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,200
It will be my turn to set the stage now.

160
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,600
Watch my performance next.

161
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,000
Your injury...

162
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Is your injury much better?

163
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,000
It's not big deal. It will be fine soon.

164
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,600
Be careful too.

165
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:41,960
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

166
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Miss!

167
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,600
Miss!

168
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,600
Is there any news?

169
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I followed Wu Cai Hong and saw her meeting with Madam Lin.

170
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,000
I found out her address.

171
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,400
What did Wu Cai Hong say to her?

172
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,600
I overheard Wu Cai Hong asking her

173
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,400
to hand over Old Cai's secret formula.

174
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,540
Madam Lin didn't admit that she had the secret formula.

175
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,800
Even Wu Cai Hong has gotten in the scene too.

176
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,000
Could the secret formula really be with Madam Lin?

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
But...

178
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,400
Madam Lin insisted that she didn't know about the secret formula.

179
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,900
Of course, she wouldn't admit it.

180
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,000
If she were to admit it,

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
it would mean that Old Cai could be even more implicated.

182
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,200
I'm afraid that in the murder's case

183
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,400
he would not be able to escape anymore.

184
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,100
That's right.

185
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,200
Indeed, there are so many connections in this case.

186
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,900
Uncle Lai. Prepare the rickshaw for me.

187
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm going to visit Madam Lin.

188
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,500
We must not let Wu Cai Hong and Jiang Yu

189
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,700
snatch it first.

190
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,000
She is here. Keep this now.

191
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,000
Madam Cai. As long as you hand over the secret formula, you can name the price.

192
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
Mr Jiang.

193
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,400
I already said many times that

194
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,600
I really don't have the secret formula.

195
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,100
Think about this carefully.

196
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,400
The secret formula is useless to you.

197
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,500
You can't use it to dye textiles nor would you dare to take it out.

198
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,600
As long as you are willing to hand over the secret formula to me,

199
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
I can give you a big sum of money

200
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,600
to let you and your son spend it for the rest of your lives.

201
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,000
You don't have to embarrass me. No matter what you say,

202
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,800
I will still reply the same thing.

203
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,600
I... really don't have the secret formula.

204
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,600
This is not about money. Old Cai already said that

205
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,800
he wouldn't sell it at any cost.

206
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,700
What I meant is that

207
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,200
Old Cai said that we really don't have the secret formula.

208
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,800
Let's do this then, Mrs Cai.

209
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,300
Reconsider carefully what I just told you.

210
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,380
I will come again tomorrow with the cash.

211
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,500
Miss Lu?

212
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,200
What a coincidence.

213
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,000
What a coincidence.

214
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Madam Cai.

215
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,800
I really hope that you will seriously think about it.

216
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,400
I'm taking my leave.

217
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,000
Miss. You are...

218
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,700
You are Mrs Cai, right? I'm Lu Man.

219
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,000
I also run a dyeing factory.

220
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm here for the same thing as that gentleman just now.

221
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,000
I... I really don't have the secret formula. Don't come here anymore.

222
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,400
This is your husband's knotted button, right?

223
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,000
This... You...

224
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Do you get it now?

225
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,200
I'm here not to talk nonsense with you.

226
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,600
I only want to exchange the secret formula with Old Cai.

227
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,200
If you are agreeable, your husband can go home soon.

228
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,100
If you don't,

229
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,950
I guarantee that you will never see him again.

230
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Okay, I will do whatever you want

231
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,930
as long as you don't hurt my husband.

232
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,000
Fine.

233
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
How are you going to make me believe that you are holding the secret formula now?

234
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,000
My husband gave me this textile which was dyed according to the secret formula.

235
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,200
So, the secret formula is really with you.

236
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,700
You caused me to waste so much energy on others?

237
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,000
Give me the secret formula.

238
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,400
Give me the secret formula and I will release Old Cai.

239
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,000
The secret formula is already in my head.

240
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,200
I want to ensure my husband's safety first

241
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,000
before I hand it over to you.

242
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,300
You even know how to talk terms.

243
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,000
Fine.

244
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,600
I will send someone to pick you up tonight

245
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,200
to see your husband.

246
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,900
How is my husband now?

247
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,000
He is fine.

248
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,170
Won't you be seeing him this evening?

249
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,600
Uncle Lai.

250
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,000
Once you have gotten the secret formula,

251
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,900
don't let them live.

252
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,600
I'm not going anymore.

253
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,000
Once the task is completed, bring the secret formula to me.

254
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,000
You must not make any mistake. Understand?

255
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,100
Miss, don't worry.

256
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,600
I will complete everything.

257
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm taking you to see Old Cai.

258
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,300
Let's go.

259
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,400
Dear.

260
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,500
Dear.

261
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,800
Madam Lin. You have seen your husband.

262
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,400
You can hand over the secret formula now.

263
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,800
We don't have the secret formula at all.

264
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,800
How could the secret formula of the Jiang family be with us?

265
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,200
Just because of a piece of secret formula,

266
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,600
you beat my husband into such a state.

267
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,990
Are you humans? I'm going to beat you.

268
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,200
If you don't hand over the secret formula today,

269
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,200
I will send you to see the King of Hades.

270
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,800
The secret formula has never been with us.

271
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,700
Jiang Yu gave me this piece of cloth.

272
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,000
This is all part of the plan by Jiang Yu and the police.

273
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,400
Just wait for the police to catch you.

274
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,690
You beat my husband into this state.

275
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,800
- You will get your retribution.
Police!

276
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Don't move!

277
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,800
Men, take cover!

278
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,300
Let's go.

279
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Quick, let's go.

280
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
What now, Doctor? Is he awake?

281
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,600
The patient's injuries are very serious. He has many broken bones.

282
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,800
Not only does he has many injuries, they even cut off three of his fingers.

283
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,000
He has excessive bleeding that was full of infection.

284
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,600
Even though we have already tried our best to do a blood transfusion and patch up his wounds

285
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,400
but when he will he conscious,

286
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
it will depend on God.

287
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,200
His injuries are very severe. You must be mentally prepared.

288
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,400
Okay, doctor. It has been tough for you. Thank you.

289
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
It's okay. This is what I should do.

290
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,400
Cai Hong.

291
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,600
Take a break first.

292
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
Old Cai is still unconscious.

293
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,600
If he doesn't regain his consciousness, everything will be too late.

294
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,000
What should we do about Brother Shao Tian? We are running out of time.

295
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,600
We have already tried our best.

296
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,500
We can only depend of Old Cai now.

297
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
It's time to eat.

298
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,800
Zhou Shao Tian. This is your last meal.

299
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Director wanted me to prepare some nice food for you.

300
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Once you have eaten, have a good journey.

301
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,000
Do not have any worries.

302
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
If you have any last words, I will help you to relay them.

303
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,600
Even more so when you have known Director Chen for a while.

304
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,200
If there is anything, he will help you to do it.

305
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:53,100
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

306
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,200
Old Cai. Wake up.

307
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,800
What can be so important that you can't wake up.

308
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,200
Brother Shao Tian is running out of time.

309
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,200
- Cai Hong.
- Old Cai, please wake up.

310
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,400
I'm begging you, Old Cai.

311
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,600
- I'm begging you.
- Old Cai, don't be like this.

312
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,900
Jiang Yu. What should we do? I can't see Brother Shao Tian die this way.

313
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,800
Help me to think of a solution.

314
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,200
If Old Cai doesn't wake up, Brother Shao Tian will really lose his life.

315
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,200
I'm begging you.

316
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,800
I really don't want him to die.

317
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,600
Old Cai. Did you hear what I said?

318
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,400
I'm begging you to save Brother Shao Tian.

319
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,200
Old Cai.

320
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Wake up, Old Cai.

321
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,000
Old Cai.

322
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,800
Wake up.

323
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,400
<i>No.</i>

324
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,000
<i>I must save Brother Shao Tian.</i>

325
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,400
Hello, Police Chief Li. It's me, Jiang Yu.

326
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,800
It's like this. Old Cai is still in a coma.

327
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,000
Can you postpone Zhou Shao Tian's execution?

328
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,400
I say, Brother Jiang.

329
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,200
Don't make it difficult for me. How can this be possible?

330
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,400
Many reporters and citizens are watching this.

331
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,600
If there is no evidence, we can't suspend the execution of Zhou Shao Tian.

332
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,200
We have no legal authority.

333
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,500
How are we going to face the people of Huzhou?

334
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,120
No.

335
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,600
Old Cai is the most important witness in this case.

336
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,800
His testimony is extremely important.

337
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,800
It could take weeks (for Old Cai to recover), but Zhou Shao will.

338
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,600
Brother Jiang. Zhou Shao Tian's case has already been closed.

339
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,400
He showed the people with the case that he had no objections.

340
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,200
Do you need to do this?

341
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,500
We really can't just simply reverse the case.

342
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,400
Just because there was a real haste in investigating the case in the past,

343
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,600
there were so many grievances.

344
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
This can't carry on.

345
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,400
What the world needs now is fairness.

346
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,800
Okay, Brother Jiang. It's not that I don't want to help you

347
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,400
but I really can't do anything.

348
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,500
Cai Hong.

349
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,200
Don't be sad.

350
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,600
Ever since I was born,

351
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,200
I have been plagued by poverty.

352
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,800
When I was young,

353
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,300
I personally saw my father killed.

354
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,200
When I grew up, because of revenge,

355
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,900
I bit the bullet. <i>made bad choices</i>

356
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,000
There was no light in my life.

357
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,200
Until I met you.

358
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,300
During the darkness in my life,

359
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,600
you were the rainbow.

360
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,700
I have had you long enough.

361
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,900
Sorry.

362
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,200
I'm apologising on behalf of my father.

363
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
You don't need to apologise.

364
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,300
You are not in the wrong at all.

365
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,000
Cai Hong.

366
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,600
As long as you are willing to believe me,

367
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,900
even if I die, I won't have any regrets.

368
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,000
You won't die.

369
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,500
Do you know that

370
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,300
there still is a word in this world.

371
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,400
It's called a 'miracle.'

372
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,700
Jiang Yu

373
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,400
has already gone to find other evidence.

374
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,700
Perhaps, Old Cai may regain his consciousness.

375
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,600
No need.

376
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,200
Don't let him waste any more time.

377
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,800
Since I have committed a crime,

378
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,700
I don't need any miracles to happen.

379
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,000
Zhou Shao Tian. It's almost time. We should be on the way.

380
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Cai Hong.

381
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You were willing to visit me

382
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,700
and being able to see you,

383
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,300
I don't have any more requests.

384
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,600
At the final moment,

385
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,300
being able to see you,

386
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,190
I feel very blessed.

387
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,200
<i>Kill him!</i>

388
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,600
<i>Kill him!</i>

389
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,800
<i>You cruel and ungrateful thing.</i>

390
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,600
<i>Zhou Shao Tian, you murderer.</i>

391
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,800
<i>Kill him!</i>

392
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,200
<i>Scum!</i>

393
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,800
<i>God has eyes.</i>

394
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,200
<i>Scum! Kill him!</i>

395
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,200
<i>Zhou Shao Tian. How could Huzhou have such a beast like you?</i>

396
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,200
<i>Old Master Wu was so kind to you and you murdered him.</i>

397
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,100
<i>You are really ungrateful!</i>

398
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,300
<i>Ungrateful!</i>

399
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,800
Where is Miss Wu?

400
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,900
She went out and didn't say when she would be back.

401
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,600
Old Cai.

402
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,800
Your wife died while trying to save you.

403
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,000
We can't let those bad people get away.

404
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Wake up now.

405
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,000
<i>Shao Tian. Mom will see you off.</i>

406
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
<i>When I'm gone,</i>

407
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,500
<i>I will look for you and father soon.</i>

408
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,000
<i>Our family will be reunited</i>

409
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,100
<i>and will never separate again.</i>

410
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,000
<i>Shao Tian, don't be afraid.</i>

411
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,800
<i>Mom is here with you.</i>

412
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,800
Sorry, let me through.

413
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,600
Get ready.

414
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,700
- Wait!
- Stop!

415
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,500
Executioner. Chief Police Li has issued an order.

416
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,400
Stop the execution of the death penalty on Zhou Shao Tian.

417
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,300
Wait.

418
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,800
He said to stop the execution of the death penalty on Zhou Shao Tian?

419
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,000
Where is Chief Police Li's order?

420
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,700
He told me to verbally tell you.

421
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,600
Sorry. Without his order, we can't do that.

422
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,440
Even more so, who are you?

423
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,200
To add further, even if there is an urgency,

424
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,600
and Chief Police Li wanted to verbally relay the order,

425
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,200
he would't send you here. He would send his subordinate.

426
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,200
This order is faked and made up. Stop interfering.

427
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,000
Human's life depends on it!

428
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,600
You said that I faked his order? If what I said is true,

429
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,400
once you kill him, you won't be able to revive him.

430
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,800
I can't let you just disregard a human life.

431
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,200
You dare to say that the police disregard a human life?

432
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
This is a brave accusation.

433
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,400
Do you know that you are interfering with the police enforcement right now?

434
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,800
I think you must be tired of living. Men!

435
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,200
- Pull her away so her insolent gaze will not disrupt the execution!
- Yes!

436
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,500
- Miss.
- Don't shoot. I'm telling the truth.

437
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,800
- Retreat.
- I'm telling the truth.

438
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
Wait!

439
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,200
<i>Zhou Shao Tian was the fiancee of Miss Wu.</i>

440
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,600
Wait!

441
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,800
<i>What is this? Hidden secrets?</i>

442
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,100
<i>She even doesn't want her father because of this man.</i>

443
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,100
This important witness has something to say.

444
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,100
Wait.

445
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,400
What do you have to say?

446
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,200
I can be the witness.

447
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,800
Zhou Shao Tian didn't kill Wu Hong Da.

448
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,900
Don't worry. Chief Police Li's order will be here soon.

449
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,000
Old Cai. Can you speak?

450
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,500
I know that your injuries are very serious but

451
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,600
you are a very important witness to us.

452
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,400
I hope that you will think carefully first before you answer my questions.

453
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,600
Whatever I know,

454
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,000
I will tell you.

455
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,200
On the day of Wu Hong Da's incident,

456
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,600
Zhou Shao Tian said that you were with him at 12 noon.

457
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,200
Is this true?

458
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,000
Yes.

459
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,800
That day, when Boss wanted to talk to me,

460
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,000
I felt that something was wrong.

461
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,800
I went to find Zhou Shao Tian

462
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,400
and wanted to escape with him.

463
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,900
But I didn't imagine that he wouldn't want to leave.

464
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,600
Because of this,

465
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,600
I quarreled with him.

466
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,700
When it was 12 noon, on the street, I saw

467
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,600
many people running towards Lin Long.

468
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,900
It was very chaotic and they were shouting,

469
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,000
"Someone died."

470
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,300
Based on your testimony, Zhou Shao Tian wasn't at the scene.

471
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,100
Yes.

472
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,300
But on the day of Old Master's incident,

473
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,800
other than me, Zhou Shao Tian and Mr Jiang,

474
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,200
he saw another person.

475
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,830
Who was it?

476
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,000
Who was that person?

477
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,700
I don't know.

478
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,800
It is just that when master answered the phone

479
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,000
he was very polite.

480
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,600
He said that he was waiting for the other party.

481
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,200
I felt that

482
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,900
that person on the phone must be a big shot.

483
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,600
Big shot? So prominent that even Wu Hong Da would treat her politely?

484
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,650
Who would it be?

485
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,400
Old Cai. Do you still remember who kidnapped you?

486
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,200
I didn't see that person clearly.

487
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,000
One of them covered her face.

488
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,300
She even threatened me

489
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,200
to hand over the secret formula.

490
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,400
I only know that she was a young woman.

491
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,000
Young woman?

492
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Director Chen.

493
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,700
I think we should talk to Zhou Shao Tian.

494
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
<i>At this time,</i>

495
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,510
<i>Zhou Shao Tian should already be dead.</i>

496
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,400
<i>Don't blame me for being cruel.</i>

497
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,600
<i>Blame yourself for loving the wrong person.</i>

498
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,400
Miss. Someone just came with news that Zhou Shao Tian didn't die.

499
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,190
What? How could this be possible?

500
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Leave first.

501
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,800
I heard that Old Cai regained his consciousness.

502
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,900
Jiang Yu brought him to the execution site. Not long after that,

503
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,200
the orders from Chief Police Li arrived.

504
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,000
It said that there was an important witness and testimony.

505
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Now that Zhou Shao's excution was postponed temporarily

506
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
everyone is asking about the real culprit.

507
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,600
Miss.

508
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,800
What should we do now?

509
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,200
Zhou Shao Tian didn't die?

510
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,800
Miss. We should get ready soon.

511
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,200
If the police find out that Zhou Shao Tian didn't kill Wu Hong Da,

512
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,400
they will definitely suspect others.

513
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,600
He said, that on the day of Wu Hong Da's death, he met three people.

514
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,400
They were Jiang Yu, Zhou Shao Tian and Old Cai.

515
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,000
In the past, the police didn't get their testimonies

516
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,200
but it's different now.

517
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,000
If they collect all three testimonies,

518
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
- it wouldn't be advantageous to us...
-Enough, don't say anymore!

519
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,300
Uncle Lai. Sorry, I was too anxious just now.

520
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,000
Don't keep this in your heart.

521
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,300
I understand.

522
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,000
Zhou Shao Tian's fate is still undecided.

523
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,800
God is helping him.

524
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,000
Let's not panic.

525
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,990
Even if they suspect us, they can't find any evidence now.

526
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,980
Furthermore, I'm the Military Governor's woman.
