00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:24,651
- [gun cocking]
- [Zip] Got that John Blaze shit.

3
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:27,195
Forget about making somebody's day.

4
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,113
These two Desert Eagles here?

5
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:33,785
Fly, pelican, fly.

6
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,795
Do I even need to say it?

7
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,424
[chuckles]

8
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:54,681
[sighs] Come on, Zip.

9
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:57,100
You should find a new profession.

10
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:58,768
Cottonmouth is done.

11
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,062
You ain't heard?

12
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:05,399
Cottonmouth's getting out,
so you ain't done shit.

13
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:06,776
Boom!

14
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:34,846
[inaudible]

15
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:43,021
[Audrey] Detective.

16
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:45,857
Remember who you are.

17
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,779
Next time, it would behoove you
to have actual evidence.

18
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:52,321
You know, something besides

19
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:54,741
the dogged harassment
of a misguided beat cop.

20
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,284
You calling me a dog?

21
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:59,412
No, I believe the brother said "dogged,"

22
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,330
as in determined.

23
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,499
Although, true...

24
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:07,586
the word is derived from the description
of a dog's persistence.

25
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:11,841
See, that's the problem with a bitch.

26
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:16,262
Once they get their mouth on a bone...

27
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,722
they can't let go.

28
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,269
We'll see who's somebody's bitch

29
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,897
when your ass is in prison...

30
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,607
Cornell.

31
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,695
[chuckles]

32
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:35,573
[Stokes chuckling]

33
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:41,412
[woman] There he is!

34
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,707
[reporters clamoring]

35
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,047
[theme music playing]

36
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,786
[newscaster] <i>Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes'</i>
<i>release this morning</i>

37
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,454
<i>was a blow to local law enforcement...</i>

38
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,622
[Stokes laughing]

39
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,418
Mariah ain't gonna like that shit.

40
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,920
Neither should you.

41
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:56,630
I just shot a cop and walked away free.

42
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,092
What's there not to like?

43
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:02,720
Zip and Amos picked up the truck
from the docks right after I shot Scarfe.

44
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,765
Domingo got his guns back last night.

45
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,726
Everyone else will fall in line.

46
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:12,313
Jamaicans, Haitians, Dominicans.

47
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,481
Hell...

48
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,859
even the Koreans.

49
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:17,861
All loyal.

50
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:20,654
We're all good.

51
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,159
So...

52
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,038
when do I get my Judas?

53
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,124
You don't.

54
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,334
You're too hot right now.

55
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,129
Luke Cage is a luxury, Cornell.

56
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,008
He's, uh... he's ice cream.

57
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,011
And you need to keep steak on the table.

58
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,514
And how do I do that
with Luke Cage around?

59
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,851
All he has to do is [shouting] show up

60
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:54,147
and hoods scatter
like roaches with the lights on!

61
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,068
Guns, drugs, all street traffic
is a mess right now because of him!

62
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:00,987
[breathing heavily]

63
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,575
Niggas act like he can walk on water.

64
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,619
Can he?

65
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,125
I'm done talking, Shades.

66
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,131
Tell Diamondback I need
to holler at him.

67
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,801
You sure that's the way
you want to play this?

68
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:27,931
Okay.

69
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,699
[door closes]

70
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,083
So what about all that evidence?

71
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:40,794
Without Scarfe to corroborate,
that ledger is useless.

72
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,796
Even the whole thing with Spurlock

73
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,341
and the bodies Cottonmouth
burned there won't stick.

74
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,719
Spurlock is going to eat the charge
and take the years.

75
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,430
He won't testify.

76
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:54,350
He'd be his own client. [sighs]

77
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,311
[Claire] So that's it?

78
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,149
Setbacks happen all the time.

79
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,651
You can still do something about this.

80
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,111
Why me?

81
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,157
Because you're not afraid of Cottonmouth,
and he's obviously afraid of you.

82
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,284
What do you expect me to do?

83
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:14,203
I tried to do things the right way.
Cops let him go.

84
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:17,081
Cops can only do so much.

85
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,083
You have the power to do more.

86
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,793
Look at what's happening
in Hell's Kitchen.

87
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,837
You mean that cat running
around beating people up?

88
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,131
That's what you want me to be?

89
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,884
Sometimes, if you want justice...

90
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,469
you have to get it yourself.

91
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,767
If Hell's Kitchen's so great,
why'd you run uptown?

92
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,228
Why did you?

93
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:42,315
There is nothing that can hurt you.

94
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:44,858
So what the hell are you afraid of?

95
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,570
[phone ringing]

96
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,333
[Fish] Pop's Barber Shop.

97
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,379
It's for you.

98
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:07,923
[Stokes on phone] <i>Let's parley.</i>

99
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,469
Either we can be gentlemen about this...

100
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,222
or we can get into some gangster shit.

101
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,890
Parley's just fine.

102
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,894
Your gangster shit hasn't worked out
so well for you recently.

103
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,563
[chuckles]

104
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,022
Harlem's Paradise.

105
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,317
Bring your apron.

106
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:29,403
[laughing]

107
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:33,324
[hangs up phone]

108
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,535
What'd he say?

109
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,915
Enough.

110
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,176
Might as well take all that down now.

111
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,888
No. There's still plenty of work
to be done.

112
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,391
Not for me.

113
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,185
They just made it official an hour ago.

114
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,771
But you had nothing to do with Scarfe.

115
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,524
My shop, my watch.

116
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,694
[inaudible]

117
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,821
All right, here we go.

118
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,199
You've got to play this smart, Detective.

119
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:17,410
IA's gonna be up your ass
with a flashlight.

120
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,537
I can handle Ridley.

121
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,123
She was my lieutenant at the 31st.

122
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,875
Listen, you still have
a future here, Misty.

123
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,919
My advice to you
is to let go of this board

124
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,837
and everyone you have pinned on it.

125
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,882
Cottonmouth needs to be in handcuffs.

126
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,636
Don't let this twist you to the point
where you can't see which way is up.

127
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,279
[exhales]

128
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,324
Mercedes?

129
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,285
Priscilla.

130
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,664
I prefer Inspector Ridley.

131
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,792
Priscilla, I heard they started
calling you Inspector Gadget

132
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,920
- behind your back once you got promoted.
- [chuckles]

133
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,757
This is gonna be fun.

134
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,386
[reporters clamoring]

135
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,600
Councilwoman Dillard and I
don't agree on much.

136
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,268
But she's a good woman who loves Harlem,

137
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:27,480
and I'm a strong believer in party first,
no matter what.

138
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,440
I came as a friend in her time of need.

139
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,318
Mr. Boone, is it true you're here
to ask the councilwoman to resign?

140
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,862
He's here because I asked him here.
Damon.

141
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,905
[all clamoring]

142
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,115
[Mariah] Let him through.

143
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,825
[clamoring continues]

144
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,370
Wait, wait, wait. First question, go.

145
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:45,080
Was your affordable housing initiative
funded by drug money?

146
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:49,126
My cousin has never been
accused of selling drugs.

147
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,629
I thought you all said
he was running guns.

148
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,464
- Will you please make up your mind?
- [chuckles]

149
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,759
Councilwoman, have you been questioned
by the NYPD about your cousin?

150
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,429
Family first, Robin.

151
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,557
I love my cousin Cornell Stokes.

152
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,852
The charges against him
are categorically false,

153
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,896
which is why they let him go.

154
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:12,232
He is an integral part
of my New Harlem Renaissance

155
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:16,362
and our movement to rebuild
Harlem for our Harlemites.

156
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:17,446
Okay? That's it.

157
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,116
- Get out of the rain. Go, go!
- [all clamoring]

158
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:24,537
[clamoring continues]

159
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,416
[Mariah] Ah! This is low...
even for you.

160
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:31,043
[Boone] I wasn't lying.
I'm here as your friend.

161
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,422
[Mariah] Pretty boy Stanford Carpetbagger.

162
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,508
You've been trying to knock me
off my spot for years.

163
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:40,260
How much of what they're saying is true?

164
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,806
Damn.

165
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,641
That bad?

166
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:48,727
You're...

167
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,146
tainted.

168
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,400
And the infection is contagious.

169
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,111
So what do you recommend, Dr. Boone?

170
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:02,325
You step aside
and let me take your seat.

171
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:05,243
Then I can support your initiatives
on the inside.

172
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:06,995
And push your permits through.

173
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,747
A year from now,

174
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:12,042
all four of your complexes
could be up and running.

175
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,627
That's cute.

176
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,800
You've been trying to knock me
out of my spot for six years, Damon.

177
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,887
It didn't work then.
It's not working now.

178
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,014
Find a new hobby.

179
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,183
You can't stay on top forever, Mariah.

180
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,436
You're gonna fall.

181
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,064
And I'll enjoy every second when you do.

182
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,066
You need to leave now.

183
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,278
Show your Marigny ass out.

184
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,381
[indistinct clamoring]

185
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,258
Do you need anything?

186
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,677
Scotch. Neat.

187
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,309
[Alex] Mariah?

188
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,356
How the hell did you get in here?

189
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,900
We need to talk.

190
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,073
Alone.

191
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:31,121
So, this Luke Cage
was a bartender at Harlem's Paradise?

192
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,124
Actually, I believe he was the dishwasher.

193
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,043
<i>He was filling in for Dante that night.</i>

194
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,753
[Ridley] <i>One man is linked</i>
<i>to a criminal,</i>

195
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,464
the death of four people,
the destruction of a restaurant,

196
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:42,007
and you don't find him suspicious?

197
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,009
Of course I do.

198
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,845
[Ridley] <i>Step back.</i>
<i>Take a look at your board.</i>

199
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:51,892
Who is the one person that is linked
to every single location up there?

200
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,395
It's not just this case
that depends upon on it.

201
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,855
Your career is also in the balance.

202
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,861
[breathing heavily]

203
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,031
Shit.

204
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,115
[bangs]

205
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,244
[Stokes playing keyboard]

206
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,927
[indistinct chatter]

207
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,234
[playing keyboard]

208
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:45,028
Damn, Cornell, you just playing that,
like, out of thin air like that?

209
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,864
You don't need to, uh, write it down?

210
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,532
I just see it in my head.

211
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:51,994
[laughing] This boy
is a damn prodigy, Mabel.

212
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:55,623
That prodigy needs to keep it down.

213
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,415
Mariah's trying to study.

214
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,542
[scoffs] Like a little music

215
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,794
is gonna disturb all that hoein'
you got goin' on over there.

216
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,213
That hoein' is what keeps the lights on.

217
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,422
Look, all I'm saying is that

218
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:08,844
Cornell should be in one of them schools
like, um... Juilliard.

219
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,805
[Mabel] There's only
one school that matters.

220
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,141
- Cornell is really good.
- [Uncle Pete] Mmm.

221
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,519
[smacks lips]
Did I ask you anything, Little May?

222
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:17,770
[Uncle Pete] The girl's got a point.

223
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:20,856
- [Mabel] She don't need you to defend her.
- I know she don't.

224
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,775
Because she's gonna be a lawyer,

225
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,943
and she's gonna be able
to defend her damn self.

226
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,779
Ain't that right, baby?

227
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,824
- Hey, Mariah.
- Snap, crackle, pop!

228
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,451
- How you doing, Henry?
- [young Pop] Good, ma'am.

229
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,622
Hey, yo, Cottonmouth.

230
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,331
- You coming?
- [stops playing]

231
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,125
You know I hate that name.

232
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,419
Well, I could just called you Corny.

233
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,673
- Is that better?
- Hey! He's practicing.

234
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,966
All right? He needs to stay right here.

235
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,635
He needs to get a little dirt on him.

236
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,344
[chuckling]

237
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,058
Actually, Pete's right.

238
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,685
You stay here, Cornell.

239
00:16:58,602 --> 00:16:59,978
You can go.

240
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,648
You stand right here with me.

241
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,991
My husband, his brother, and me...

242
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:17,495
built this here Harlem game
brick by brick.

243
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,123
Numbers, pussy, guns.

244
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:25,546
But you know good and goddamn well
the one thing I never sell is drugs.

245
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,966
So what the hell made you go
and do something so stupid?

246
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:32,510
- I thought I was helping your ass.
- Helping me?

247
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,807
Man, this crack game is blowin' up.

248
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,476
Salvador Colon and all them,
they making mad loot,

249
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,895
and your old ass is getting left...
[yelps]

250
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,355
[screaming]

251
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,775
[wailing]

252
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,948
Finish your studies upstairs, baby girl.

253
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,369
Uh-uh, not you.
You stay right there, Cornell.

254
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,080
[Donnie wails and whimpers]

255
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:03,917
And your dumb ass ain't inventive enough
to think of some shit like this.

256
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,254
Who gave you this idea, huh?

257
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,047
[Uncle Pete] Who the hell
are you looking at?

258
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,215
Hmm?

259
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,010
[Mabel] Take out this trash, Cornell.

260
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,595
No.

261
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,180
Cornell ain't ready
for nothing like this, Maybelline.

262
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:20,643
Well, he need to learn
how to piss standing up.

263
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,812
[sighs]

264
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,107
[panting]

265
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,612
- [Uncle Pete] Come on, nigga!
- [Donnie yelling]

266
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,321
Cornell, you go with your Uncle Pete.

267
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,657
[Uncle Pete] Stand up!

268
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,659
- And keep it down.
- [Donnie whimpering]

269
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,620
I got white folks in the front room.
I don't want to scare 'em off.

270
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,246
[door closing]

271
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,165
- [blows landing]
- [Uncle Pete grunting]

272
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,083
[muffled yells and screams]

273
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,384
[Donnie] Please! Please! I'm sorry!

274
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,552
[Donnie screaming]

275
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,652
[Stokes playing keyboard]

276
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,698
[breath trembling]

277
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,121
[inhales deeply]

278
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,805
[knuckles cracking]

279
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,892
[Luke] Even though I hate your ass...

280
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:47,187
I gotta admit...

281
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,940
you got talent.

282
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,443
You could have been somebody.

283
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,783
This is the first time I've ever seen
you flunky-free.

284
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:04,496
I guess now that you're untouchable...
you don't need them.

285
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,125
So, what?

286
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,211
You here to take me in or take me out?

287
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,379
Hey.

288
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,715
You called me.

289
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,635
And unlike you, I'm not a murderer.

290
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,013
I'm taking you in.

291
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:24,349
You're gonna sit down with Misty Knight
and you're going to confess...

292
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,059
to everything.

293
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,686
That's what you think's about to happen?

294
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,900
'Cause last time I checked...

295
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,444
you were no longer a sheriff...

296
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,407
Carl.

297
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,117
Hmm.

298
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,828
You ain't doing much of anything.

299
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,039
Carl Lucas.

300
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:51,001
[laughing] That's a square-ass name, man.

301
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:55,422
Oh, if my mama named me that,
I'd change my name to Luke Cage, too.

302
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,757
[chuckles]

303
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,428
See...

304
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,390
I don't know shit about going to prison.

305
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,601
But I figure if you escaped,

306
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,188
faked your death,
and all that other slick shit,

307
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,315
eventually it's bound
to catch up with you.

308
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,359
And you gotta go back.

309
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,238
You're not turning me in.

310
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,241
You wouldn't snitch.

311
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,451
Well...

312
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,955
there is honor amongst thieves.

313
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,584
But you ain't no thief.

314
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,046
Gave a speech at a church,

315
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,382
knocked down a few doors
in the projects and now...

316
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,010
you Harlem's Captain America.

317
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:44,429
Nigga, please.

318
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,640
How they gonna feel
about their folk hero

319
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:51,019
when they find out he ain't nothing more
than a goddamn criminal?

320
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:55,107
And you act like you better than me.

321
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,527
You ain't better than me.

322
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,283
You got caught.

323
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,661
I was framed. I'm innocent.

324
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,539
[chuckles] Aren't we all?

325
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,917
[laughing]

326
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,252
Hmm.

327
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,882
I'mma keep your little secret.

328
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:24,386
I've got use for bulletproof niggas.

329
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,806
I own you now.

330
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:33,145
And if you refuse...
then back to Seagate you go.

331
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:37,065
I'll charter the yacht my damn self.

332
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:43,906
See, you thought I only had
a hand in one of the pies.

333
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,992
But I own the whole goddamn bakery, son.

334
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,505
[Stokes laughing]

335
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,573
Do you remember me...

336
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,616
from when I was a kid?

337
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,535
No.

338
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:34,789
Are you one of those that used to
follow Cornell around like a puppy?

339
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:35,915
Hmm.

340
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,793
I didn't have shit.

341
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,338
I grew up in the street.

342
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,592
But the one name that always rang out...

343
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:47,970
was "Stokes."

344
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,930
You needed a Thanksgiving turkey?

345
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,101
Go see Mama Mabel Stokes.

346
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,393
School clothes?

347
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:58,063
Mama Mabel Stokes.

348
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:01,483
Your old man put his hands on you?

349
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,776
See Mama Mabel Stokes...

350
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,073
and it would never, ever happen again.

351
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,908
- Your point?
- Your family name meant something.

352
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:14,829
Harlem's Paradise meant something.

353
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:19,751
Everyone from David Dinkins to Pappy Mason
showed that woman love.

354
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,130
But what does that family represent now?

355
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,259
A washed-up gangsterland?

356
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:32,305
An empty politician who'll be lucky...

357
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,100
at this time next year...

358
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,603
to be a greeter at the Harlem Hair Expo?

359
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,106
You don't talk to me like that.

360
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:44,067
I can talk to you any way I want.

361
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:48,363
Because you got no power to shut me up.

362
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,157
Do you like how it feels?

363
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,618
Being so powerless?

364
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,704
Being pushed around by other people?

365
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,044
What do you think?

366
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:03,920
I think...

367
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:07,340
that when you get the nerve...

368
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,469
you're gonna be surprised...

369
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:14,013
at just what you're capable of.

370
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:39,789
[Claire] So that's how
you're gonna play this? You're running?

371
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,210
There's nothing I can do.

372
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:46,003
Enough with this defeatist bullshit.

373
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,589
What the hell is going on?

374
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,259
Cottonmouth knows about my past, Claire.

375
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,846
If I don't work for him,
he's gonna out me.

376
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,224
I'll go back to prison.

377
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,728
I've been through too much hell
to let that happen.

378
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:05,022
Yeah, I... I sympathize. I really do.

379
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:06,816
But if you run...

380
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,985
you'll be running
for the rest of your life.

381
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,530
You think you're the first person
to tell me that?

382
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,991
I told Pop I was done running.

383
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,369
I stayed and he died.

384
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:21,581
I didn't run when they came after Connie,
and they lost everything because of me.

385
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:22,832
Who's next?

386
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,751
I'm no good for anyone.

387
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,255
You can't take the blame
for everything that happened.

388
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:30,507
People need you.

389
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,551
Yeah, well,
sometimes I'm no good for people.

390
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:37,264
If people see that you're one of them,
that's good.

391
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,974
If you stand and fight,
they'll follow you.

392
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,019
If I go to prison,
who's gonna wanna follow me?

393
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:48,983
Half the people uptown have fathers,
cousins, uncles, brothers in prison.

394
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,569
You're no different than anybody else.

395
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:54,447
You get your wish. You're not special.

396
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,410
Instead of running, if you make a move

397
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:01,120
and you take him down once and for all?

398
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:03,331
You stop him, you save this community,

399
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,124
and you free yourself.

400
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:07,877
Or...

401
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:17,970
[hip-hop music playing]

402
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,597
[Stokes] Turn up the bass.

403
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,110
I ain't one to apologize.

404
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,197
Then don't.

405
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,366
But I was feeling myself a little earlier.

406
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,826
My bad.

407
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,745
I ain't mean to come at you like that.

408
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,334
You're under a lot of stress.

409
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,086
It's that nigga, Luke Cage.

410
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,922
I invited him over.

411
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,132
Had to let him know.

412
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,136
What'd you do?

413
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,556
I gave him the business.

414
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,933
All that Seagate shit you told me about.

415
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:06,644
What?

416
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:10,732
Diamondback didn't want you to do that.
He's got plans for him.

417
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:13,360
Well, Diamondback ain't my daddy.

418
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:14,736
What's he know about Cage?

419
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,572
Did you spook him? Is he gonna run?

420
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,741
He will fall in line.

421
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:23,536
No doubt.

422
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:32,795
[winces] Sometimes pain is the only thing
that gets 'em going.

423
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,798
They can't do that to their wife
so they take it out on you.

424
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,927
Where the hell have you been?

425
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,888
We needed you an hour ago.

426
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:46,226
Look at what happened.
Sister Boy didn't have any protection.

427
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:50,522
At least the bastard had enough sense
not to hit him in the face.

428
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:53,691
Maybe Sister needs to learn
how to throw her hands up like a brother.

429
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,610
[breathing heavily]

430
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:58,154
While you out there in the street
running around with your friends,

431
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,365
my people in here getting hurt.

432
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:03,410
You better have a damn good reason
for not being here when I needed you.

433
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,537
Pete took me to an audition.

434
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,790
You expect me to believe
that an audition took six hours?

435
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,125
He stopped in Spanish Harlem.

436
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,921
Puerto Ricans?

437
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:20,092
Like that... Tato Lopez and Sal...

438
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:23,305
I heard Salvador.
That's who Pete talked to.

439
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:24,639
Where were you?

440
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:28,768
[sighs] I kicked it
with Salvador's little brother, Domingo.

441
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,603
We watched <i>Video Music Box.</i>

442
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,021
What'd they talk about?

443
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,648
They were in the back room.

444
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:36,150
They were gone for a while.

445
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:40,322
You done good.

446
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:46,453
[sighs] You done good.

447
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,458
Hey. HD, Blu-ray,
I got all the best angles of the incident.

448
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,960
I got everybody in here.
You know you want to see it.

449
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,588
- People actually pay money for that?
- Yo.

450
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:59,674
- Yo. It's you! You one of them!
- No.

451
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,801
Come on, let's talk. My man's got a RED,

452
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:04,387
next time you do something,
I could film you.

453
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:05,680
We could both get paid.

454
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,849
For real. 4K for four K,
you know what I'm sayin'?

455
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,309
Hey, hey. I know you hear things.

456
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,897
Look, I hear and see everything.

457
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:18,234
The streets know what you've been up to.
Everyone's talking about it.

458
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,027
But I ain't no snitch.

459
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:21,779
Not everyone deserves discretion.

460
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,781
I'm not asking you to get involved.

461
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,575
I'm not even asking you to speak.

462
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,328
I just need to borrow your eyes.

463
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:31,748
All right.

464
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:34,376
Who you looking for?

465
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,712
Domingo Colon.

466
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,255
[speaking Spanish]

467
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:42,425
[groans]

468
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:48,431
[Luke] Domingo Colon!

469
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,268
I'm guessing that's you.

470
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,647
- [man grunting]
- [Luke grunting]

471
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,033
- [man groans]
- [guns cocking]

472
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:10,453
I guess you guys
haven't heard about me, have you?

473
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,539
- Take him out.
- [guns firing]

474
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:13,831
[bullets ricocheting]

475
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:29,972
I'm about sick
of always having to buy new clothes.

476
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,061
[man screams]

477
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,738
[Luke] Where are the guns?

478
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,198
I don't know what you're talking about.

479
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:49,742
The ones you got back from Cottonmouth.

480
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:51,327
The ones my friends died over.

481
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:54,330
What, you think you can go after everyone?

482
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:55,957
I kinda do.

483
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,462
I can pick you up...

484
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:02,589
walk you over to the bridge...

485
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,382
and throw your ass in the Hudson.

486
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,389
And here's the thing.
It's not the fall that kills you.

487
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:14,517
It's the impact against the water.

488
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:18,480
And when the water fills your lungs,
right before you black out,

489
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:20,022
you'll ask yourself...

490
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:23,818
"Why didn't I just give Luke Cage
what he wanted?"

491
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,196
The guns are downstairs.

492
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:32,159
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

493
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,551
You got this one in a double XL?

494
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,137
You'll like this.

495
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,017
I already know what he looks like, Bailey.

496
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,685
But aside from your board...

497
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:01,856
this is the only photo of him. Anywhere.

498
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:04,358
- Nothing else?
- Nope.

499
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,529
Why do you seem so excited by that?

500
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:11,323
[chuckles] 'Cause he is too damn clean.

501
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,118
You know, he's so clean, it's...
it's freaky.

502
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,286
In what way?

503
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:18,623
He has, uh, no credit cards.
No email address.

504
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:21,000
But he has a social security number.

505
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:24,796
Yeah, but no bank account.
No Facebook. No porn.

506
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:27,464
Why do you find no porn so disturbing?

507
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:29,050
[scoffs]

508
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:31,803
This guy, he doesn't exist.

509
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:33,638
He was created.

510
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,932
He's the figment
of someone's imagination.

511
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:39,393
Who the hell is this guy?
And... and who made him?

512
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,813
Yeah. Who you telling?

513
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,816
But he's innocent.

514
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,693
- I give you my word.
- [woman on phone] <i>That may be.</i>

515
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:48,736
<i>But all this tension</i>
<i>is hurting the council</i>

516
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,780
<i>- and it's harming the party.</i>
- Yeah.

517
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,033
When will you make the announcement?

518
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:57,453
<i>Charlene will send a press release</i>
<i>at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.</i>

519
00:33:57,537 --> 00:34:01,082
<i>I'm going to have to ask you to resign,</i>
<i>effective immediately.</i>

520
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,542
I hear you.

521
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,800
You realize that I will fight this
with every ounce of my energy, right?

522
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,051
Right?

523
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,511
<i>It's painful for all of us,</i>
<i>but it's necessary.</i>

524
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:15,638
<i>We have no other choice.</i>

525
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,056
- Okay.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

526
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,516
[glass shatters]

527
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,477

[sniffles]

530
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:44,416
- Tony.
- [Tony on speakerphone] <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

531
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,628
- Bring the car around.
<i>- Right away.</i>

532
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,423
[sniffles and exhales]

533
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,550
[Stokes playing keyboard]

534
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:45,728
On his deathbed...

535
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,231
what did you promise Buggy?

536
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:57,699
That you'd take care of me and...
our business.

537
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:01,035
What the hell
are you talking about, Mabel?

538
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:04,538
I've always put this shit
before anything else.

539
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:12,004
You were my woman before you was his.

540
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:13,715
But I let that go.

541
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:16,843
You always protect your family.

542
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,054
No matter what.

543
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:22,098
So you betrayed me?

544
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:25,642
To some goddamn Puerto Ricans?

545
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:26,978
This... [grunts]

546
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:35,236
This shit... should have been mine.

547
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:38,865
And you know it.

548
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:41,658
[sighs]

549
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,829
Now, Salvador and his brothers

550
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:47,498
have agreed to let us come in
on the ground floor.

551
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,252
We can own this whole goddamn city.

552
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:54,756
I already have everything I need.

553
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:59,093
Pigs get fat...

554
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:02,221
but hogs...

555
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:05,099
get slaughtered.

556
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:10,772
This was all about you.

557
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,109
You know what?

558
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,694
You always stay ready with a plan, bitch.

559
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,657
[smacks lips] So what is it?

560
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,961
[breath shuddering]

561
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,505
[gun cocks]

562
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,726
You don't have to do this, Cornell.

563
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:53,856
And all that talent you have?

564
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,033
What are you doing?

565
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,120
You're not built for this.

566
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:12,458
Why do you think
I pay for all those lessons, man?

567
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:16,838
You can be something
better than all of us.

568
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,759
You deserve this
for what you did to our family.

569
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:25,512
What you did to me!

570
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:27,723
Hey, Little May, don't...

571
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:30,893
What are you talking about?
[stutters] You laughed with me.

572
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:33,187
It was... it was a game.
[chuckles nervously]

573
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,396
Cornell.

574
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:38,192
I told you what to do.

575
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:41,988
Stand up straight.

576
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:45,449
And do it.

577
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:48,452
- [gun cocks]
- [Uncle Pete] Look at me.

578
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:51,998
[shouts] Look at me!

579
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:55,918
- Every time...
- [gun firing]

580
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:13,936
You know the rule, baby. Family first.

581
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,188
Always.

582
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,817
Yes, ma'am.

583
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,413
You could have called first.

584
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:35,082
Oh, now I need an invite.

585
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,962
Can't imagine the kind of pressure
you're under.

586
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,008
Especially after that shit-show
of an interview.

587
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,843
You need to drop this Luke Cage shit.

588
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:49,680
Shut it down.
Get your head back in the game.

589
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:52,474
Don't lecture me about the game.
I was born to this shit.

590
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:56,312
I finally got his bitch-ass in my pocket.

591
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:59,190
My party chairwoman called me tonight

592
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:01,483
to tell me I had to step down
from the council.

593
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:06,655
The fundraising for my complexes dried up
since you got arrested.

594
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,950
My reputation is in the shithole!

595
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:11,660
Maybe Madam Councilwoman
need to step off her high horse

596
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,869
and get her hands dirty.

597
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:14,705
We family, Cornell.

598
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,166
- Mama Mabel taught us that...
- Mama Mabel, Mama Mabel!

599
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,500
Go on with that shit.

600
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,965
All the things
I could've did with my life...

601
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:26,425
my music...

602
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:32,223
But who does she send
to that uppity-ass boarding school? You.

603
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,767
She put you in school
and forced me to run the streets.

604
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,394
You idiot.

605
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:41,023
She sent me away
to keep me away from Pete!

606
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,526
You know damn well
what that woman made me do.

607
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,113
I was 14 years old.

608
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:48,948
Uncle Pete betrayed us.

609
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:52,076
Uncle Pete was the only one
who ever had my back.

610
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:58,290
Mama Mabel was always
sheltering you, protecting you.

611
00:40:58,374 --> 00:40:59,375
And for what?

612
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:02,836
All that education,
and you just as shady as me.

613
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:05,047
Me protected?

614
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:09,926
All I did your whole life was protect you!

615
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:14,056
Your junkie mama dropped you off
at Mabel's and never looked back!

616
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,849
Your daddy didn't want you!

617
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:20,104
Who was there changing your diapers?
Tending your needs?

618
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:21,522
Dealing with your whining?

619
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:25,026
I saw the way you used to flirt
with Uncle Pete when I was little.

620
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,194
[laughs]

621
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:31,198
Running around half-naked all the time.

622
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:32,992
You wanted it, Mariah.

623
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,661
You wanted it and you know it.

624
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,831
[Mariah screams] No!

625
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,418
[screaming] No!

626
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:49,466
- I did not want it!
- [groaning]

627
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,551
No!

628
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:53,762
You shut up!

629
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:57,933
- No, I didn't want it!
- [breathing heavily]

630
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,188
[grunting]

631
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:05,982
[bones crunching]

632
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:08,360
I didn't want it!

633
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:13,074
[gasps]

634
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:17,203
[Shades] Look at you.

635
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:26,503
You got the nerve...

636
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:31,967
and you stepped up.

637
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,470
I didn't... I didn't want this.

638
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:36,555
[Shades sighs]

639
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:37,848
[Mariah shudders]

640
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:39,891
Deep down...

641
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:44,313
[whispers] I think you did.

642
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:48,900
First time...

643
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,321
is always the hardest.

644
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:02,206
Do you think...

645
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:04,583
they have rubber gloves in the kitchen?

646
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:09,004
Next to the dishwashing station.

647
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:13,092
[chuckles] That's a great idea.

648
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,807
Look what Luke Cage did to your cousin.

649
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,445
[Misty] Nice sweatshirt.

650
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:35,071
You box now?

651
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:38,367
What I do is more like CrossFit.

652
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,288
Always full of surprises.

653
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,500
And I hate that.

654
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,877
I don't know shit about you.

655
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:53,299
Nobody does. And that's the problem.

656
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:59,930
But out of all the people in the world,
Scarfe went to you for protection.

657
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:03,142
- Why?
- You'd have to ask him that.

658
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:06,187
How convenient for you that I can't.

659
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:09,105
Look, you texted me. What do you want?

660
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:11,983
You see that van parked over there?

661
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,069
I bet if you looked inside,

662
00:44:14,153 --> 00:44:16,905
it's filled with all of those
Justin Hammer guns from the heist.

663
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:20,576
You think being a vigilante
makes this all right?

664
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:24,413
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you've caused?

665
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:27,123
Misty, I know what you're going through.

666
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,292
[scoffs]

667
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:32,045
Finding out your partner was corrupt,
losing him...

668
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,590
- It's messin' with your head...
- Do not talk to me

669
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,925
[voice breaking]
like you know what I'm going through.

670
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:40,554
I'm gonna take care of Cottonmouth.

671
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:43,056
You need to be ready
to move on him when I do.

672
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:48,562
What's your big plan? Huh?

673
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,439
You gonna take over Harlem?

674
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,358
- I don't want Harlem.
- Then what do you want?

675
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:53,442
To be left alone.

676
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:55,319
If that's what you truly want...

677
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:59,990
then you will give me
all the information you have right now.

678
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:01,157
On the record.

679
00:45:01,242 --> 00:45:04,661
Tell me everything you have and end it.
Right here.

680
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,037
I'm not going to do that, Misty.

681
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,333
- Then that makes you an accessory.
- To what?

682
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:12,085
After what happened this morning,
you expect me to trust the system?

683
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:15,464
- The system is not your enemy.
- Really?

684
00:45:16,465 --> 00:45:18,259
How's the system
been treating you lately?

685
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,677
I should kill Cottonmouth.

686
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,221
But I won't.

687
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:26,057
I want him to suffer.

688
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:29,728
He should know what it feels like
when your life is over,

689
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:32,981
while everyone else's life goes on
as if you don't exist.

690
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:36,277
You sound like you're speaking
from experience.

691
00:45:37,403 --> 00:45:39,070
You should trust me, Misty.

692
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:41,114
Like Pop did.

693
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,287
If you gave me one good reason why...
[scoffs]

694
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,538
I would.

695
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:02,969
Anonymous tip?

696
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:07,140
Every cop needs a good snitch.

697
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,144
You're not out of the doghouse.

698
00:46:12,313 --> 00:46:13,980
Not by a long shot.

699
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,908
- [sighs]
- [phone ringing]

700
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:32,499
Detective Knight.

701
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:36,587
What?

702
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,173
Oh, shit!

703
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,427
[Claire] Okay, so I'm just trying
to picture it in my head.

704
00:46:44,345 --> 00:46:46,763
Was it mustard yellow? Or canary yellow?

705
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:50,183
[Luke chuckles] It was all I could grab.

706
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:53,395
I couldn't go running around Georgia
looking like a runaway slave.

707
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:54,771
[Claire clicks tongue]

708
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:57,190
[laughing] Oh, God.

709
00:46:58,108 --> 00:47:00,110
What did your father say
when he saw you?

710
00:47:02,738 --> 00:47:03,739
Nothing.

711
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:07,493
He doesn't know I'm alive.

712
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:12,330
He wouldn't want to see me anyway.

713
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:14,583
I'm his...

714
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:17,002
shame.

715
00:47:20,506 --> 00:47:23,675
The last thing my father wanted to do
was to raise a black criminal.

716
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,637
He did everything in his power
to give me the kind of life

717
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,263
so that wouldn't happen.

718
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,474
And yet...

719
00:47:31,392 --> 00:47:32,809
I still went to jail.

720
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:36,062
That wasn't your fault.

721
00:47:36,146 --> 00:47:38,106
He didn't see it that way.

722
00:47:38,732 --> 00:47:40,734
I tried to explain.

723
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:43,987
I made calls. I sent letters...

724
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,072
and he returned every last one of them.

725
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:50,577
Then why let your father's last memory
of you be as a criminal?

726
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:52,287
A dead criminal.

727
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:55,331
I think he'd be very proud
to know who you are now.

728
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:00,629
Anyway, thank you.

729
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:02,589
For what?

730
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:07,719
I can't imagine there are that many people
who know the saga of Luke Cage.

731
00:48:08,804 --> 00:48:10,556
It means a lot that you trust me.

732
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:15,060
I didn't come to Harlem
to be a hero, Claire.

733
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,270
I came because I needed time
to figure shit out.

734
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:18,522
So did I.

735
00:48:20,441 --> 00:48:21,733
You're right.

736
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:23,944
I can't keep running.

737
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,156
But I want you to know
what you're getting into.

738
00:48:29,866 --> 00:48:31,618
If Cottonmouth talks,

739
00:48:31,702 --> 00:48:36,122
or if anybody connects the dots
that Luke Cage is Carl Lucas...

740
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:37,666
I go back to Seagate.

741
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:40,293
You knew the risks
and you did it anyway.

742
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,253
That's what makes you a hero.

743
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,674
Maybe I should get a mask after all.

744
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:47,551
[groaning] No.

745
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:52,055
Too much in Harlem
happens in the shadows.

746
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:55,851
People fear what they can't see.

747
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:58,770
And that's what makes you different.
They see you.

748
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,732
It makes them trust you.

749
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:13,785
Hey, Carl.

750
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:16,329
One Judas for another.

751
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:23,378
I may have a lawyer friend who can help.

752
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,880
Oh, really?

753
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:28,592
[gunshot]

754
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:34,765
Luke?

755
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:44,816
- Luke?
- [groans]

756
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,359
- [gunshot]
- Luke?

757
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:47,528
[Luke groans]

758
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:55,827
[yelling]
