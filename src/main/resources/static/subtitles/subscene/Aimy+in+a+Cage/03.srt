I got the recipe back

and I guarantee

30
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,620
Ling Long will soon resurface in Huzhou.

31
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,020

Father, who killed you?

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,640
Master, why didn't you bring me along?

35
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,900
You left me living alone.

36
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,400
What meaning do I have now in living?

37
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,680
-Mother! <br>-Cai Yun!

38
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,440
What should we do?

39
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,270
Stop standing. Pack these things up.

40
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,600
But Madam and Miss have not said anything.

41
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,350
From today onwards,

42
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,290
everyone

43
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,140
has to listen to Secretary Zhou's arrangement.

44
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,270
Why are you still standing? Start moving!

45
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,900
-Lord<br>-Mother.

46
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,860

What's wrong?

49
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,540
Are you reminding me to not bring unhappy emotions to her?

50
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,890
You are going to meet your owner.

51
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,230
Are you as happy as I am?

52
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,500
You only know how to eat.

53
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,030
Mother, why not ask Mrs Li to serve and you eat first?

54
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,550
Brother has not come back until now. When he comes back, I'll eat with him.

55
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,400
Fei'er, you eat with me. When your brother works, there is no end.

56
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,700
Who knows what time he'll be back?

57
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,280
Later, let Mrs Li heat up some rice for him.

58
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,370
No worries. I am not hungry yet. You eat first.

59
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,750
Madam, you just eat first.

60
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,510
Miss and Mister have a strong sibling bond.

61
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,490
When Mister drinks hot soup, Miss drinks hot soup too.

62
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,430
When Mister eats cold rice, Miss eats with him.

63
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,430
They go through thick and thin together.

64
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,680
Don't you agree?

65
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,870
Mrs Ling, your words are unclear.

66
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,570
Our family, Fei'er loves to stick with her brother since youth.

67
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,930
The words he says are more effective on her

68
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,070
than my words.

69
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,310
Mother!

70
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,210
It seems to me, that pretty soon

71
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,450
we'll have to call Miss "young Madam." At that time, you can just wait to hold a grandson.

72
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,680
Mrs. Li, what are you saying?

73
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,130
I'll go out first.

00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:43,570
Brother, you only came back now? You have not eaten dinner right? I will bring it to you.

77
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,400
There is no need. I have no appetite.

78
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,370
-Brother<br>-Come in.

79
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,030
I cooked some porridge for you. No matter what, you should still eat something.

80
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,300
If this carries on, how can your body take it?

81
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,890
Okay, just put it here.

82
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,820
Here.

83
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,520
Oh right, I met with Mister Du who came from Hangzhou.

84
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,690
The Du family has a large fabric factory in Hangzhou.

85
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,270
They want to leave all dyeing to our Yao Sheng.

86
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,270
-How was your talk?<br>-He suddenly has something going on so he didn't turn up.

87
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,150
-Suddenly had something going on?<br>-Yes.

88
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,800
I heard that there was an accident on the way to Huzhou. It was unintentional.

89
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,950
I will meet him again in the next few days.

90
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,500
Alright. Fei Fei, have a early rest. It is late already.

91
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,570
Okay. Then you rest early too.

92
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,430
Got it.

93
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,770
If she suddenly has something going on,

94
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,070
it is not standing me up right?

95
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,060
Quickly say yes.

<i>May Buddha protect us.</i>

99
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,340
Are you sick? Just go have it looked at.

100
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,260
Right now, there is money.

101
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,000
You can take medicine. If you are sick, you don't have to bear with it.

103
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,710

106
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,720
We only just began a little with our revenge plan.

107
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,050
He then suddenly died.

108
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,930
Could it be that this is retribution?

109
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,860
Brother, then our plan to swallow Ling Long

110
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,740
does it still have to progress accordingly?

111
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,480
Did Wu Hong Da, after forcing our father to die,

112
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,480
let Ling Long go so easily?

113
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,720
Everything progresses according to the plan.

114
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,110
Without Wu Hong Da, this obstruction, our plan

115
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,930
will progress faster and more smoothly.

Everyone calm down and listen to me.

119
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,310
I am Wu Hong Da's eldest daughter, Wu Cai Hong. This situation is..

120
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,680
What is there to explain? Aren't the facts in front of us?

121
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,370
Yes. I've heard for a while now that Ling Long is no longer profitable!

122
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,440
In the past, we gave Master Wu some face

123
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,610
so we didn't ask for payment.

124
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,970
Now that the rats have left this sinking ship, <br>what will you use to pay us back?

125
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,510
<i>Yeah! Return our money!</i>

126
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,930
<i>-Return our money now!</i><br>-Let me tell you guys...<br>-Return the money to us now!

127
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,900
Your Ling Long still owes me half a year's payment for goods!

128
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,730
In order to build a new workshop, Ling Long <br> still owes us several thousand taels!

<i>-Give us back our money now! Exactly!<br>-Return our money! Return our money!</i>

131
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,390
-Don't worry, everyone, <br><i>-Give us back our money!</i><br>-Ling Long has money.

132
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,290
It's just that some of it is at the An Yuan Trading Company in Shanghai. It will mature very soon.

133
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,410
-When that time comes, then we can give you your money back.<br>-Only a ghost would believe you!

134
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,810
I sent someone to Shanghai to inquire about this!

135
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,420
There never was an An Yuan Trading Company!

136
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,570
Ling Long's money has been scammed completely gone!

137
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,750
<i>Return the money! Return the money!</i>

138
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,440
-It's awful! Old Cai is gone - Ling Long's accountant Old Cai has run off!<br>-What? Run off?

139
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,380
If we can't get the money back, let's check the warehouse

140
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,850
to see if there's anything of value in there. <br>Take as much stuff as they have there.

148
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,400
<i>Quickly grab it! Quickly get out of the way!</i>

149
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,830
You guys put it down, let go!

150
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,070
<i>-Go over there!</i><br>-Don't take anything!

151
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,230
<i>-Take them all!</i><br>-Please, I'm begging you!<br>-Move!

152
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,550
Don't take these!

are you alright?

156
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,260
Don't be afraid.

157
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,800
No matter what happens, I'll always be with you.

158
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,550
Secretary Zhou! Secretary Zhou!

159
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,830
Secretary Zhou, come here!

160
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,310
The Xiang Fa Dyeing Factory is <br>scooping up Ling Long's workers right now.

161
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,050
It seems like they will give workers with experience like us

162
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,850
an increase of one percent in wages. Let's go together.

163
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,070
If you want to go, then go by yourself!

164
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,450
-If you kick us out...<br>-Quickly get out!<br>-Where will we live?

165
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,390
-This is going too far!<br>-Go, drive them out!<br>-Hurry up and get lost!

166
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,740
-Stop!<br>-Aunt!<br>-What are you guys doing?!

167
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,410
Shao Tian! Cai Yun. They said that Ling Long <br>borrowed 50,000 taels.

168
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,000
50,000 taels?!

169
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,890
Yes. This sum of money was due last month.

170
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,110
Look clearly. It's written in black and white.

171
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,360
There is Boss Wu's genuine signature on here.

172
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,860
It is indeed Boss Wu's genuine signature. So it shouldn't be a fake.

173
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,090
The loan agreement said that if this amount is not paid back before the due date,

174
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,310
then we can take the Wu mansion as payment. <br>We came here to collect the house.

175
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,330
-Everyone, can you extend the deadline a few days?<br>-Yes, can you extend the deadline a few days?

176
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,200
I will definitely think of a way to raise money <br>to the best of my abilities.

177
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,800
Zhou, I don't know what your background is.

178
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,340
Even Wu Hong Da himself couldn't solve this mess. <br>And we're supposed to count on you?!

179
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,590
You're like a toad wanting to ascend into the sky. <br>Don't kid yourself!

180
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,430
Enter the house! Go. Go.

181
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,640
You can't do this! Don't close the door!

182
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,740
Open the door! Hurry up and open the door!

183
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,010
Hurry up and open the door! This is our home!

184
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,980
What reason do you guys have to kick us out?!

185
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,410
Yes! Hurry up and open the door!

186
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,980
-Madam, what should we do now?!<br>-Open the door!

187
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,970
How would I know what to do?!

188
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,090
Master,

189
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,870
it hasn't been long since you died,

190
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,670
and these people just bully us like this!

191
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,390
-Madam!<br>-Mom!

192
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,310
<i>Wu Cai Hong...</i>

193
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,790
<i>you have to pull yourself together.</i>

194
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,940
<i>Starting today,</i>

195
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,690
<i>-you will take father's place and support this family.</i><br>-Open the door! Open the door!

196
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,960
<i>Protect your sister and aunt well.</i>

197
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,590
We're here. This is it.

198
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,260
Come in.

199
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,370
Mom, go. Let's go in.

200
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,600
Go.

201
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,750
Take a look. This is the house you wanted to rent.

202
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,810
-It's nothing. It's nothing. <br>-Are you alright?

203
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,680
This has fallen into disrepair for a while. <br>It'll be fine once I go find a carpenter to fix it.

204
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,580
What kind of a place is this?! <br>How can it be so messy?!

205
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,530
The warehouse in our previous Wu residence

206
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,950
was way tidier than this place.

207
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,970
I'm telling you, no one has lived in this place for a long time.

208
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,350
Also, I'll clean the place up before you move in.

209
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,110
Yes. I think this place is alright actually.

210
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,900
Then if you feel this place isn't bad,

211
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,090
did you want to pay this month's rent first?

212
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,340
- Here. <br>- All right.

213
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,870
Everyone, since you'll be busy, I won't disturb you.

214
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,460
Brother Shao Tian, sorry for troubling you again.

215
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,720
It should be me who apologizes, Cai Hong.

216
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,040
Right now, there really is no other way. <br>You guys will have to live in such a simple and crude house.

217
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,540
At present, I can only do this much with my abilities.

218
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,350
However, trust me. I definitely won't let you <br>live here for too long.

219
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,320
Brother Shao Tian, luckily we have you. If it weren't for you,

220
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,800
our family would already be living on the streets.

221
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,750
We won't be living on the streets. No matter how big a house is,

222
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,620
in the end, it's just a shelter from wind and rain.

223
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,560
The most important thing right now <br>is that our whole family is together.

224
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,640
Cai Hong, I really won't let you live in this place

225
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,190
for too long. Sooner or later, there will be a day

226
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,400
where I can definitely let you live in a mansion again.

227
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,660
Brother Shao Tian, you treat my sister so well. <br>I really admire her.

228
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,240
-Admire what?<br>-Mom!

229
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,850
Silly girl. You need to find someone with a rich family

230
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,110
and take me away from this terrible place as soon as possible.

231
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,860
-This is what is admirable. <br>-What are you talking about?

232
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,600
It's really dirty here.

233
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,590
Shouldn't it be cleaned?

234
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,880
-I'll do it.<br>-I'll go with you.

235
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,780
I'll come too.

236
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,650
What do you mean you're going? <br>You'll get yourself dirty.

237
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,400
Honestly...

238
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,090
Brother Shao Tian. It was really troublesome for you today.

239
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,440
Cai Hong, don't always view me as an outsider.

240
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,460
The house was only a small matter.

241
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,450
As for Ling Long, what are your plans?

242
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,380
I just hate myself for

243
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,580
not learning about business affairs from <br>my dad when he was alive.

244
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,640
Otherwise it wouldn't be like now, with no ideas at all.

245
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,960
All of the inventory and raw materials in the warehouse

246
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,670
have been looted by the creditors.

247
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,650
With Ling Long's situation right now, <br>I reckon there won't be any banks

248
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,230
that would be willing to lend us money. But we still have Ling Long's factory.

249
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,290
The workers are still here,

250
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,190
and we still have Ling Long's sign.

251
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,120
So, what does Brother Shao Tian mean?

252
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,200
Since there is no way we can start operations to manufacture and we also owe so much debt,

253
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,850
how about, selling Ling Long first?

254
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:20,040
After we pay off the debts, we can discuss <br>other matters at a later time.

255
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,930
No.

256
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,440
Ling Long was dad's lifetime of effort.

257
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,520
How could I sell it off?

258
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,310
Cai Hong, I know that this kind of decision

259
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,920
is really hard for you.

260
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,860
But the circumstances right now <br>are difficult no matter how you look at it.

261
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,830
You can't reason with the market, <br>let alone appeal to its emotions.

262
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,620
Yao Sheng could be planning a hostile takeover right now.

263
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,810
They are most likely already collaborating with the creditors.

264
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,620
One side is demanding debt payment <br>while the other is forcing prices to lower.

265
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,640
But, Ling Long was dad's life and blood.

266
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,780
But if we continue to hold it off like this,

267
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,550
the longer we delay the more passive we'll appear.

268
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,620
If we act now,

269
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,730
we might be able to fetch a good price.

270
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,310
Otherwise, I'm afraid we won't even get the chance to break even.

271
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,190
Perhaps that's exactly what Yao Sheng wants.

272
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:34,400
I never thought that<br>Ling Long would become forfeit in my hands.

273
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,300
Cai Hong, where there's still life

274
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,920
there's always hope.

275
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,510
Then we'll count on you, Brother Shao Tian.

276
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,460
I'll go take care of some other arrangements first.<br> You take care of yourself.

277
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,800
That's right, Miss Wu has decided to sell Ling Long.

278
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,010
If you'd like to make an offer, you can come over tomorrow and we'll discuss it in person.

279
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,350
That's right. Yes, yes.

280
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,130
I'll see you tomorrow.

281
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:45,100
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

282
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,490

283
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,380
<i>Cai Hong, come here, Daddy will hold you.</i>

284
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,820
<i>Cai Hong, what Dad cares most about right now</i>

285
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,420

00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,720

<i>-and to see you live a stable and secure life.<br>-Aiya, I know!</i>

292
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,580
<i>You always want me to get married. Who would I marry?</i>

293
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,290
<i>Dad!</i>

294
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,040
Wei! That day, why did you stand me up?

295
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:03,280
Something came up. It wasn't on purpose.

296
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,260
"Something came up?" To make up for standing me up,

297
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,650
I threw your cat in the river to feed the fish.

298
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,630
You, to Wu Long-

299
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,890
I, I was just teasing you...

300
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,010
She's fine. Your cat is at my place, eating and drinking so well she's nearly as fat as a pig.

301
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,830
-I was just joking...<br>-I don't like this joke!

302
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,770
Let's decide on a new time and place.

303
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,570
This time, I'll definitely go pick up Wu Long.

304
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,860
Your cat's name is Wu Long?

305
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,980
Then, what's yours? Every time I see you,

306
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,640
I can't just call you “Hey," right?

307
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,730
Contact me soon.<br> I don't wish for your cat to grow too fat to walk,

308
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,990
and for you to resent me for that. I'll wait.

309
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,140
Who was that?

310
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,970
The person who picked up Wu Long.<br>If there are no issues, I'll return first, Brother Shao Tian.

311
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,690
Sure. I won't send you off today.I still have to contact some

312
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,740
parties who might be willing to buy Ling Long. You can go first.

313
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:55,330
Miss Wu, hello. Our household's young lady has something to discuss with you.

314
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,340
Your household's young lady？

315
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,710
Miss Wu, hello. I am Lu Man.

316
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,530
Miss Lu, how did you know my family name is Wu?

317
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,290
The current head of Ling Long dying factory.<br>Miss Wu Cai Hong,

318
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,020
I'm a loyal customer of your Ling Long.

319
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,360
I hear you now have plans to sell Ling Long,

320
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,840
so I specially came over to discuss it with you.

321
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,480
But I just took over the business.

322
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,590
There are still lots of things I don't understand. It's better that you talk to Secretary Zhou.

323
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,050
But he is an outsider.

324
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,440
How could he become the head of the Wu family?

325
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,270
To add further, there are certain things

326
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,510
that only Secretary Zhou would know.

327
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,480
For example, your asking price.

328
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,450
In addition to your factory, equipment and staff,

329
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,470
is there something like a secret formula?

330
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,170
I know that you are in need of money now. Don't worry.

331
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,530
I will definitely give you a good price.

332
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,000
What's wrong? You are not happy with my terms?

333
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,390
It's not that. It's just that I don't know much about it.

334
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,340
I don't know anything about a secret formula.

335
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,170
It's better that you talk to Secretary Zhou.

336
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,050
Since this is the case,

337
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,930
okay then. Sorry to impose on you.

338
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,840
The shareholders are already here.

339
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,320
A businessman who wants to buy Ling Long is also here.

340
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,990
Cai Hong, don't worry.

341
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,800
Don't be nervous. What you should do is take a deep breath.

342
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,170
Do not add your own distress to this trying time.

343
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,500
Don't worry.

344
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,350
Leave everything to me.

345
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,270
<i>Look. How could they sell it?</i>

346
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,540
<i>-How did it come to this? <br> -Wouldn't we be losing money? <br> -Precisely.</i>

347
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,980
<i>How much is it going to cost?</i>

348
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,820
<i>How much could they get from the sale?</i>

349
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,860
<i>I never imagined that Ling Long would be in this state today.</i>

350
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,490
<i>Who doesn't know about this?</i>

351
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,630
- Everyone is here. <br>- Cai Hong is here.

352
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,270
So far only one company, Yao Sheng, is here.

353
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,890
Let's talk while we wait.

354
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,310
Dear Sir, Miss Wu is here.

355
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,210
Can we start now?

356
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,640
It's you.

357
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,060
You are Wu Hong Da's daughter?

358
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,460
You are Yao Sheng's boss?

359
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,590
You both know each other?

360
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,710
It can be considered so.

361
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,910
Let's start now. We invited the shareholders here today

362
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,530
and also those who are interested in buying the company.

363
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,400
We are here to discuss the matter about Ling Long.

364
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,140
The sale agreement that I've drafted, I believe this gentleman has already seen it.

365
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,560
I wonder what is your opinion.

366
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,590
My offer, is five percent of your selling price.

367
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,410
Five percent? Are you kidding?

368
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,210
This is outrageous!

369
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,630
At this price, we'll be getting no return on our money.

370
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,540
- This is our blood, sweat and tears... <br>- Everyone, stay calm.

371
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,460
This gentleman... <br> After all, our Ling Long is a time-honored brand.

372
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,710
Even though we have run into some problems

373
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,180
Ling Long's buildings, machines

374
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:04,130
and the experienced workers. These are of valued costs.

375
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,860
So our asking price is definitely reasonable.

376
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,870
If it's as you say, then you don't need to sell Ling Long.

377
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,520
You are taking advantage of us.

378
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,950
Us Yao Sheng isn't a living Buddha. <br> (meaning a compassionate person)

379
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,290
We are also businessmen.

380
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,620
You are really looters.

381
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,990
Hence, Miss Wu,

382
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,330
you also acknowledge that your house is on fire?<br>- You!

383
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:37,050
Other than our offer, no one else would want to state the price.

384
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,200
I should say this.

385
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,100
No one would dare to make an offer.

386
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,800
If you don't believe me, you can ask around.

387
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,970
I stated it very clearly. Today's five percent

388
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,020
will be four percent tomorrow and three percent the day after.

389
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,570
Starting from now, it will be less one percent every day.

390
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,710
Everyone, make your decision.

391
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,210
What should we do?

392
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,510
Make it five percent then.

393
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,990
Compared to being bankrupt, I support the sale.

394
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,440
He is the only one offering us silver anyway. <br><i>(silver was a common currency in this period).</i>

395
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,800
We can always build another factory in the future. Let's sell it. <br>- I disagree.

396
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,220
You don't agree? Even if you don't, we should sell it.

397
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,130
If you don't sell it, we will be paupers.

398
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:18,930
That's right. Even if we total up all our shares, it's still not enough.

399
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,970
Don't talk to her anymore. What does she know?

400
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,620
Everyone, don't be anxious first.

401
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,220
The Wu family is still the biggest shareholder of Ling Long.

402
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,130
Let's listen to Miss Wu's views.

403
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,870
Give her some time to consider.

404
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,650
What do you think?

405
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,850
<i>Let's just sell it.</i>

406
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,130
<i>What should we do if we don't sell it? This is happening too fast.</i>

407
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,870
<i>How much is it worth?</i>

408
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,830
I shouldn't have picked you up and let stay here.

409
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,910
- Hello. <br>-Jiang Yu.

410
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,460
Can you meet me in half an hour at Chaoyin River's bridge?

411
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,540
Return Wu Long to me.

412
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,720
You don't need to wait anymore.

413
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,610
I already beat your cat to death.

414
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,920
It's true this time.

415
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,100
You bastard! Return Wu Long to me.

416
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,110
Monster.

417
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,640
Cai Hong.

418
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,860
The autopsy report is out.

419
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,930
Dad.

420
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,350
I really never imagined that

421
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,240
she was Wu Hong Da's daughter.

422
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,230
Based on the autopsy report,

423
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,860
it still can't be confirmed if your father killed himself or was murdered.

424
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,320
But there is a great suspicion that he has been murdered.

425
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,260
Wu Hong Da received a fatal wound to the head. But the autopsy showed

426
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,370
that there was also another, not too serious wound on his shoulder.

427
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,830
He also had bruises.

428
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,570
They were obviously caused during a struggle.

429
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,420
Judging from the sight of the wounds,

430
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,840
they were caused by some sharp metal object.

431
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,940
Accordingly to the Ling Long's porter testimony

432
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,680
Yao Sheng's boss, Jiang Yu,

433
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,120
came to visit Ling Long on that very day.

434
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,680
Cai Hong. Could you tell us

435
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,100
what could your father and Yao Sheng's boss be talking about?

436
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,810
Jiang Yu has been planning a hostile take over of the company.

437
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,140
It's possible that he's the killer of my father.

438
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,410
Where is it?

439
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:41,870
Jiang Yu. You killed my father. You did it.

440
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,070
- Calm down, Cai Hong. <br>- You executed my father to take over Ling Long!

441
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,660
You didn't even hesitate, right?!

442
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,140
Miss. What you are doing now to Mr Jiang Yu,

443
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,140
you need the law to be responsible for this.

444
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,170
Sorry, Mr Jiang. This way, please.

445
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,670
That's right. On the day Wu Hong Da died,

446
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,710
I definitely went to see him at Ling Long but I didn't kill him.

447
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,770
First, when I left Ling Long,

448
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,360
Wu Hong Da personally escorted me to the main entrance.

449
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,980
At that time, Wu Hong Da was still alive.

450
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,500
If the door keeper is not blind, he should have seen everything.

451
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,370
Well, we still need the door keeper to verify this.

452
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:35,840
Also, when I left Ling Long that day, it was noon.

453
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,840
After that I had lunch with Director Lee.

454
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,490
Shouldn't you call him

455
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,110
and investigate this?

456
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,220
Director Lee, my name is Chen Shijie. It is like this.

457
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,470
I'm investigating Wu Hong Da's case now.

458
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,860
There is a current suspect who said that he was not at the crime scene

459
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,840
because at noon that day, you were having lunch with him.

460
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm calling you to confirm this.

461
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,970
Yes. You definitely were having lunch with him?

462
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,830
You didn't find anything out of the ordinary?

463
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,870
Okay, sorry to disturb you.

464
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,040
That's it. Thank you.

465
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,920
Jiang Yu has an alibi that he was not at the crime scene.

466
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,400
Furthermore, his witness is my superior.

467
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,240
Director Lee.

468
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,720
Jiang Yu's alibi sounds true on the surface.

469
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,620
So in theory he can be ruled out as the murder's suspect.

470
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,800
We will still investigate the case. Go back first and wait for my news.

471
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,220
Bastard. Just because you are rich, you think you

472
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,160
are unpunishable, right? <br>- Cai Hong!

473
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,280
Before accusing me of anything,

474
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,280
please review the evidence first.

475
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,740
If not, I will let my lawyer contact you.

476
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,040
<i>Cai Hong! Dad's imploring you.</i>

477
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,940
<i>Take revenge for me. You must take revenge for your father.</i>

478
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,410
Dad.

479
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,370
<i>I can't sit here and do nothing.</i>

480
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,720
<i>I must take revenge for Dad.</i>

481
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,240
<i>I must find the evidence.</i>

482
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:40,650
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

483
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,430
I will accept the five percent.

484
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,550
I'm really very sorry.

485
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,510
That was the price before I was investigated by the police.

486
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,530
I have changed my mind now.

487
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,650
My asking price now is

488
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,720
two percent.

489
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,120
How can you loot us in such way?

490
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,390
One and a half percent.

491
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,940
Did you ever think about

492
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,660
how the major shareholders of Ling Long will survive?

493
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,350
One percent.

494
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,560
It's a deal.

495
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,880
Let's have a good collaboration.

496
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,050
But I have a condition.

497
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,950
I want to work at Ling Long.

498
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,780
I hope you

499
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,560
will give me a fair opportunity to earn the money.

500
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,440
In this industry, there is only a winner or loser. There is no fairness.

501
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,790
I don't want to see you again.

502
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,060
You better stay far away from me. If not,

503
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,320
you will regret it.

504
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,070
If you really want to do this,

505
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,450
then, I will

506
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,750
I will tell everyone how you lowered the price for Ling Long

507
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,670
and also before my father's death on that day,

508
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,880
you went to Ling Long to find him regarding this issue.

509
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,510
I will go to all the newspapers.

510
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,190
You forgot that I wasn't at the scene.

511
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,320
The police need evidence but what the reporters

512
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,520
need are stories.

513
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,550
If I leak out the details about you and Ling Long,

514
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:03,000
I wonder what the reporters will write.

515
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,000
Since you want to remain at Ling Long so much,

516
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,620
I will fulfill your wish.

517
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,200
You better not regret this.

518
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,040
<i>- Leave the side open. <br>- All right.</i>

519
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,450
<i>- Keep it steady. <br>- Be careful.</i>

520
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,270
<i>- Can you do it? <br> - Place it over there.</i>

521
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,700

522
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,420
