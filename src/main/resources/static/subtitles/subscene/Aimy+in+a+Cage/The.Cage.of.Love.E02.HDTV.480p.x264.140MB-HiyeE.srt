The Cage of Love

00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,110
<i> Episode 2 </i>

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,070
Boss. You are looking for me?

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,350
Ling Long is in trouble.

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,400
There's a dye factory called Yao Sheng, selling their products at a lower price, to drive Ling Long out of business.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,060
How can this be?
Our Ling Long is a well-known brand,

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,770
with many customers and quality goods.

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,930
Yao Sheng used dyes imported from France.

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,170
The textiles they produce are okay,
but their price is 10 percent cheaper than ours.

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,730
However, the cost of importing dyes is expensive.

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,390
How could their textiles be cheaper than ours?

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,530
I think that Yao Sheng is disregarding costs,

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,180
and doing cut-throat competition.

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:58,200
Have someone look up Yao Sheng's backing.
Also, take a look and see how much money we have left in our account.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,920
We must defeat them this time.

16
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,160
Yes.

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,900
Shao Tian.

18
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,940
What's wrong? Why do you look hassled?

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,610
Shao Tian. Listen to me. I just transferred the money out.

20
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,790
Wu Hong Da suddenly wants to check the balance of the accounts.

21
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,630
He says it's to deal with the cut-throat competition.

22
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,940
Tell me what we should do.

23
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,280
It was such a big sum of money and you dared to steal it.
It's causing a stir now.

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,960
You're so scared that you're about to piss.

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,480
If they investigate the huge sum of money, we will be in trouble.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,690
You don't know Wu Hong Da. He is very cruel.

27
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,190
Of course, I know what kind of person he is.

28
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,610
I schemed about this money for a long time.

29
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,620
Don't worry.

30
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,610
I'm his eyes. You are his hands.

31
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,290
We know very well what actions he will take.

32
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,700
Shao Tian. Didn't you say that we would leave Huzhou once the money was in our hands?

33
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,040
When will we leave?

34
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,000
Very soon.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,040
I have a plan. Don't be impulsive.

36
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,020
Shao Tian. The money will be in our hands soon.
Why aren't we leaving?

37
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,900
It can't be that you really like the Miss of the Wu family?

38
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,390
You want to be their son-in-law?

39
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,930
I'm saying, Shao Tian. Stop dreaming.

40
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,770
If Miss knew you are scheming with her father behind her back,
she would chew and spit you out in a second.

41
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,260
Don't get involved in my affairs.

42
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,370
I know what to do.

43
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,870
Have you seen this person?

44
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,140
No.

45
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,570
Hello. Have you seen this person?

46
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,420
Okay, you can leave first.

47
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,710
Manager Jiang.

48
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,480
Madam Jiang's illness is not stable. It's worse than before.

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,390
And there wasn't any symptoms before her illness started.

50
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,510
We, the medical staff, have been trying our best to help her,

51
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,240
but have had little success.

52
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,870
When she is discharged, you and Miss Fang must work hard to persuade her.

53
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,970
Perhaps, she might accept the advice of her family members.

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,990
It has been many years. When my mom thinks of unhappy events,

55
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,560
she becomes like this.

56
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,430
We have tried many methods and consulted many doctors

57
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,270
but there is no progress.

58
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,410
Mom. What are you doing?

59
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,690
Give me the scissors.

60
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,920
Yu Er. I don't want to live anymore.

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,170
If I die, you don't have to suffer so much.

62
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,840
Madam Jiang. Let's talk it over. Your son is here.

63
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,240
- Don't do anything foolish.
- It's useless.

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,060
They forced my husband to die.

65
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,550
They are thinking of forcing me and the Wu family.

66
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,710
- Mom.
- Don't move.

67
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,020
Okay, I won't move. Don't do anything either.

68
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,160
Don't move.

69
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,380
You have suffered for the past few years.

70
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,000
I didn't take good care care of you. Instead, you had to take care of me instead.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,360
When I'm dead, you don't have use your savings to treat me.

72
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,730
I really can't drag you down any longer.

73
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,050
Mom, don't say this. You are not dragging me down.

74
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,360
When I die,

75
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,410
I can be free. You can be free too.

76
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,460
Aunt.

77
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,370
Mom.

78
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,960
Doctor, help me to treat her wound.

79
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,580
Aunt. You said that you wanted to be free and didn't want to drag anyone down.

80
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,620
Actually, you are trying to run away and using the pain as your excuse.

81
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,810
Do you think that if you die, they will really be relieved?

82
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,690
You are wrong.

83
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,860
Your death will only bring them more pain.

84
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,200
They will only hate themselves for not being able to protect their own mother.

85
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,600
They will also be in pain as to why you wouldn't shoulder this with them.

86
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,060
You are also leaving all your pain to them.

87
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,970
They will never be able to forgive you and themselves.

88
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,040
Four years ago, my mom and I were in the same situation as you.

89
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,650
To relieve me, she chose to kill herself.

90
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:09,620
These years, I've been living in a painful abyss.

91
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,630
If you want your son to be like me,

92
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,970
everyday living while blaming oneself, then do it!

93
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,710
Remember, next time find someplace where there'll be no one around.

94
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,500
No one will disturb you again.

95
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,740
Everything should be alright. Take a rest soon.

96
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,520
Nurse. Where is the outpatient clinic?

97
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,150
Over there.

98
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,040
Thanks.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:09,910
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

100
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,670
Sorry about just now.

101
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,640
Your apology doesn't sound sincere.

102
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,870
I never thought you also had experienced
the same hardships I did.

103
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,930
My mom was just like your mom.

104
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,890
For many years, she had to endure the pain caused by her illness.

105
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:46,300
The many years of suffering caused her to turn from gentle to bad-tempered.

106
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,030
Her love for me also

107
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,830
made her decide to free herself for my sake.

108
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,920
When she made her decision, she didn't consider my feelings.

109
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,990
Up until my mom left me,

110
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,650
it was too late to feel regretful.

111
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,610
If before she made this absurd decision,

112
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,900
I could have told her what was in my heart,

113
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,990
she wouldn't have done that.

114
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,940
Twelve years ago, our family suffered a catastrophe.

115
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,960
From then on, my mom developed a mental illness.

116
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,310
For these twelve years, we've always been cautious.

117
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,560
Not knowing which word or which situation would provoke her.

118
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,050
But the more we didn't dare say,
the tighter the knot in my mom's heart got.

119
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,560
Her illness became more serious.

120
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,260
I didn't expect that you causing a scene, would instead undo the knot in her heart.

121
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,320
Since I did you such a big favour,

122
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,910
shouldn't you declare something to me?

123
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,690
Declare what?

124
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,920
That fountain pen.

125
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,600
How could be you so stubborn?

126
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,890
Yes, you did help me but you also hurt my mom.

127
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,550
Hence, we are considered even. We don't owe each other anything.

128
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,750
In that situation just now, if I didn't do that, would she have came to her senses?

129
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,310
Rotten Stone Head. I did you such a big favour

130
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,580
and you are still unwilling to let me have the pen?

131
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,000
Aren't you being a little stingy?

132
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,600
If you find out my name, I will then reconsider if I should give it to you.

133
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,670
- Rotten Stone Head.
- And also,

134
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,360
don't hassle the doctors and the nurses.

135
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,500
I already told them to protect the information of the patient.

136
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,850
If not, I will sue them.

137
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,750
I don't need to ask them. I already know your rotten name.

138
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,850
It's Rotten Stone Head.

139
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,960
Brother Shao Tian, why are you here?

140
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,670
I went to your house to look for you. They told me that you were at the hospital.

141
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,580
I witnessed your heroic deed in saving someone.

142
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,390
Our little heroine is injured. Let me bandage your wound.

143
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,970
It's already done.

144
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,550
That fast?

145
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,510
-Who was that man?
-Are you referring to Rotten Stone Head?

146
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,490
He is the guy who snatched my pen.

147
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,940
Cai Hong, I like you.

148
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,620
I want to take you for my wife.

149
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,930
Cai Hong. You don't need to answer me right now.

150
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,620
You really don't need to.

151
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,620
You just need to know that in this world,

152
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,690
there is always someone waiting for you by your side.

153
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,990
No matter when or where, no matter the circumstances,

154
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,420
I will always be waiting for you.

155
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,020
Brother.

156
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,310
Here's today's newspaper. It has news about Ling Long.

157
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,130
Petty devil. Petty devil.

158
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,330
You're really narrow-minded.

159
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,610
I saved your mom

160
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,760
and you still won't let me have the pen.

161
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,900
I should visit his mom but I hit her yesterday.

162
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,980
Would she remember and hate me?

163
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:25,050
No. In order to give my Dad a surprise, I must find out his name.

164
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,850
Wu Long.

165
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,910
Kitty, I don't have time to play with you today.
I have a very important task to do.

166
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,970
See you later. Keep the rabbit company.

167
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Who is it?

168
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,430
Come in.

169
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,010
Aunt.

170
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,490
It's you.

171
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,570
-Don't get up.
-Come here.

172
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,700
Lie down. Don't get up.

173
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,090
Come and sit.

174
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,800
Aunt, sorry about yesterday.

175
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,910
I'm here to apologise to you today.

176
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,100
You really don't need to apologise to me.

177
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,110
Yesterday, fortunately, you slapped me and made me come to my senses.

178
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,710
Otherwise I would still be bashing my head against a brick wall.

179
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:34,950
Actually, I have been hurting my family all these years.

180
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,410
Once I'm discharged, I will treat you to a meal.

181
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,750
I don't need the meal but if you really want to thank me,

182
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,970
you can tell me your son's name.

183
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,430
If you have any matters with him, you can wait for him to come later.

184
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,670
Why don't you ask him yourself?

185
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,960
He won't tell me when he sees me.

186
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,330
Why?

187
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,940
It's a long story.

188
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,010
Hello, Mr Jiang.

189
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,710
Mom.

190
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,360
Mom.

191
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,510
You are here.

192
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,790
Mom, what are you doing?

193
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,980
I'm tired of lying down and wanted to move around.

194
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,670
Yu... Jiang Yu.

195
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,580
Is your work done at the factory?

196
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:58,580
Jiang Yu. If you are busy, you don't need to visit me.

197
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,620
I'm fine.

198
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,740
Son, don't worry. I'm really fine.

199
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,040
Mom, are you really okay?

200
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,030
What are you doing?

201
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,500
Mom. What is she doing here?

202
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,850
What are you both doing?

203
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,630
We didn't do anything.

204
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,410
I only promised her that I would call your name.

205
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,970
I already know your name.
It's Jiang Yu.

206
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,980
Let's go.

207
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,520
Let's go.

208
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,000
I only just called his name. What's wrong?

209
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,970
Take this.

210
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,640
Where is my fountain pen?

211
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,430
Don't you remember what I said the other time?

212
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,240
I said that once you found out my name, we would discuss this again.

213
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,350
I didn't promise that I would give you the pen immediately.

214
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,900
Rotten Stone Head. A kid knows what a promise is.

215
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,470
You are going to be a scoundrel over a pen?

216
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,170
Even I feel ashamed for you.

217
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,660
Okay. Even if I promised to give you the fountain pen,

218
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,270
it was agreed on that you couldn't spend any money.

219
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,090
You bribed my mom. You broke the pact first.

220
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,630
When did I bribe your mom?

221
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,480
Did you make this appear from thin air?

222
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,290
This is to declare my sincerity. That's why I bought this for her.

223
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,040
I didn't have any intentions to bribe her at all.

224
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,950
In any case, I have only two words. Definitely not.

225
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,520
Then I also have two words. Shame-less.

226
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,730
Okay. Seeing how pitiful and miserable you are,

227
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,390
I will give you another chance. Don't spend a single cent or go through my mom,

228
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,980
just find out my favourite food.

229
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,790
I will consider whether to let you have the pen then.

230
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,520
Jiang Yu. You don't keep your promise.

231
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,970
I don't believe that I can't find the exact same pen.

232
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,220
Miss. There was really only one of that pen. I'm not lying to you.

233
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,510
There is only one in Huzhou. It can't be that there is also only one in this world.

234
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,370
Miss. If you really like that fountain pen,

235
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,550
I can send a telegraph to the overseas manufacturer to order another one,

236
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,600
but it will take a long time. It takes around twenty days.

237
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,950
Twenty days? My father's birthday celebration is in ten days. It will be too late for me.

238
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,270
Why don't you look around my shop for another gift?

239
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,980
I don't want to. I only want that fountain pen.

240
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,380
<i>I will treat you to a meal another day. What do you like to eat?</i>

241
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,500
<i>I can treat you to anything.</i>

242
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,090
Stop the rickshaw.

243
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,350
It's really you.

244
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,180
Come. What are you doing here?

245
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,980
Where is your fierce owner?

246
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,890
Did you leave home? Are you afraid of her too?

247
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,980
Why don't we do this? I will take you to visit my home.

248
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,590
Okay, let's go.

249
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,720
Brother. What are you doing?

250
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,280
A cat is here. So cute.

251
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,990
-I picked it up.
-You picked it up?

252
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,360
This is not something you would usually do.

253
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,000
- You don't like animals, right?
- Who says so?

254
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,030
So cute.

255
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,150
Don't play with her anymore.
Go to the kitchen and find her something to eat and drink.

256
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,450
- Okay.
- Go now.

257
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,930
Are you hungry?

258
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:28,040
Meow, it's time to eat.

259
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,990
Wu Long, it's time to eat.

260
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,930
Wu Long?

261
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,980
Transfer the money back.

262
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,380
- What?
- Transfer the money back.

263
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,370
You...

264
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,930
Are you saying to transfer the money back to the company?

265
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,430
Yes.

266
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,840
Transfer the money back to Ling Long.

267
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,740
No. Shao Tian, what do you mean?

268
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,970
At first, I didn't want to touch the money but you forced me to do it.
You are reversing it now.

269
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,920
You are not playing with Wu Hong Da. You are playing with me.

270
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,200
Just do what I tell you to do.

271
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,820
You don't have the right to discuss terms with me.

272
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't care what methods you use. Transfer the money back discreetly.

273
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,150
Once it's done,

274
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,740
I won't treat you unfairly.

275
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,490
Okay, I will do according to what you say

276
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,330
but Shao Tian, you should know that

277
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,380
for such a huge sum of money, it's not easy to move it.

278
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,400
Now that we are going to transfer it back, it will create problems.

279
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,430
Such a huge amount cannot appear from nowhere. We need to have some kind of contract or something else.

280
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,760
I think we should find a suitable time.

281
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,060
Take action fast

282
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,390
before Wu Hong Da finds out.

283
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,990
I will assist you when necessary.

284
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,360
Brother.

285
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,680
We received news about Ling Long.

286
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,020
They said that the company is in trouble.

287
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,590
They had problems with generating their normal turnover. People are starting to complain.

288
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,400
Relay this instruction down. Starting from now,

289
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,450
we will offer basic unit prices for all small customers

290
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,580
and immediate execution of the given orders.

291
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,950
This will help us to win over Ling Long's small customers

292
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,630
and completely dry off their cash flow.

293
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,550
Wu Hong Da will no longer be considered so almighty.

294
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:06,260
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

295
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,790
Come in.

296
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,910
Boss. This lady said that she's your friend.

297
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,090
Miss Lu Man.

298
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,370
I have not seen the handsome face of Boss Wu for few days now.

299
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,670
Miss Lu Man's visit graces our humble home. Is Master Lu in good health?

300
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,700
In very good health. When he knew I was paying you a visit today,

301
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,020
he especially instructed me to send his regards to you.

302
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,980
Shao Tian. Go back to work first.

303
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,070
Okay.

304
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,830
Miss Lu. This way, please.

305
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,550
Please sit.

306
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,730
Miss Lu. Why are you looking for me?

307
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,930
I heard that you ran into a small problem.

308
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,090
Other people are eyeing Ling Long with curiosity.

309
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,610
There is a cashflow problem in your company.

310
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,970
Will those problems not turn Ling Long into a chopping board?

311
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,040
I might have a perfect solution for your current problems, Boss Wu.

312
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,130
Ling Long definitely has a small problem lately

313
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,540
but it's still better that we solve it ourselves.

314
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,270
Boss Wu, the whole Huzhou city is dominated by Master Lu.

315
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,650
Nothing can escape my eyes.

316
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,950
Miss Lu. Why do you want to help me?

317
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,500
You are a smart man.

318
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,990
I'm here today

319
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:40,490
to use this cheque to buy something.

320
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,020
What do you want to buy?

321
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,000
Ling Long's trade secrets.

322
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,660
All of Ling Long's dye recipes are made public.

323
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,350
I don't have any trade secrets.

324
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,290
Boss Wu.

325
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,230
I am getting bored by this childish play.

326
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,360
What I want is not your trade secrets,

327
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,450
but the secrets of the Jiang family.

328
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,990
<i>You are dreaming.</i>

329
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,870
Miss Lu Man, I am grateful for your kindness,

330
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,600
but I really don't have any trade secrets.

331
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,990
I have never heard of this.

332
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,270
Maybe Boss Wu is just not willing to part with it yet.

333
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,190
So be it then.

334
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:59,140
I would also frown if you'd give away such precious things so quickly.

335
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,420
This is my phone number.

336
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,350
If you change your mind, please call me.

337
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,970
We can discuss the price.

338
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,990
Brother.

339
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,510
What's wrong?

340
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,820
These acounts are giving me a headache.

341
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,680
There are some which I can't balance. Please help me to take a look.

342
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,330
Where? Let me see.

343
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,490
It's here.

344
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,050
This money is from Henghua Cloth Square, coming through with the start-up funds.

345
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:50,250
We have agreed on two points per annum, giving them 3 years to pay us off.

346
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,050
Then in what tables should I put it?

347
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,100
I have taught you this so many times already. They go into the receivable accounts.

348
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,050
Here.

349
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,850
<i>I don't want anything except this.</i>

350
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,610
<i>I have never seen such a rude, stingy and mannerless man like you!</i>

351
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:47,450
<i>You see, he has a strikingly handsome face.
He has a Grecian nose, strong brows and bright-eyed, with an uncommon demeanor.</i>

352
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:52,000
<i>No matter how you look at him, upon meeting you'll fall for him, he is definitely a very handsome man.</i>

353
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,200
<i>Brother, I spent my most beautiful days in the shelter provided by the Jiang family.</i>

354
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,980
<i>You didn't abandon me during my most difficult times.</i>

355
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,030
<i>In your eyes, I'm so stupid. I can't even do the accounts.</i>

356
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,600
<i> I will still allow you to teach me.</i>

357
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,040
What's wrong?

358
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,940
Are you blaming me for not taking you to find your owner?

359
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,980
Okay.

360
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,990
I will take you to find her tomorrow. Okay?

361
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,820
It's just a darn fountain pen. What's so great about it?

362
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,210
I will knit this scarf myself.

363
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,580
In my Dad's eyes, it will be priceless.

364
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,680
Miss.

365
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:00,430
I searched everywhere since yesterday and I can't find Wu Long.

366
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,440
Could she really be lost?

367
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,320
- Cai Hong.
- Brother Shao Tian.

368
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,300
- Wu Long is missing. I'm going to find her.
- I will go with you.

369
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,990
Let's go then.

370
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:30,830
How are we going to find your owner?

371
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,310
If I can't find her, I will rear you forever. I'm not bad as your owner either.

372
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,980
Okay, I know. Let's just wait a while longer.

373
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,020
Wu Long.

374
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,100
Wu Long.

375
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,410
Wu Long.

376
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,760
Wu Long.

377
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,870
Cai Hong. I already looked over there. I can't find her.

378
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:00,340
Wu Long went out with me. She must be near the hospital.

379
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,070
She can't really be lost.

380
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,940
Look at how anxious you are. Your head is full of sweat.

381
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:15,670
I will do it myself.

382
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,020
Let's go home.

383
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,020
<i>Jiang Mansion </i>

384
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,620
Stop the rickshaw.

385
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,370
Forget it. No need.

386
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,960
Wait.

387
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,100
Do I know you?

388
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,800
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

389
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,010
- Don't you want the pen?
- No.

390
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,270
- Do you want the cat then&gt;
- No!

391
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,050
Are you talking about Wu Long?

392
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,840
This is not a new game of yours, right?

393
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,270
It's up to you whether you believe me or not.

394
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,010
I believe you.

395
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,070
If you do this, wouldn't your boyfriend be unhappy if he sees?

396
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,960
First, I don't have a boyfriend.

397
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,100
Secondly, if I had a boyfriend, he would not like you to be so stingy.

398
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,790
The cat is at my home but...

399
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:50,670
Must I find out what's your favourite food or must I find out where you live?

400
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,870
What I wanted to say was...

401
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,690
I don't have time today but tomorrow is fine.

402
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,670
Okay, state the meeting place and time.

403
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:05,330
Then tomorrow at 3pm at Chaoyin Bay Bridge.

404
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,060
Okay, it's 3pm then. Don't break the appointment.

405
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,520
If you do, I'm going to throw your cat into the river to feed the fish.

406
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,960
See if you dare!

407
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,660
Let's go.

408
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,290
Why did you call me here?

409
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,670
Shao Tian. There is a big problem.

410
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,370
Wu Hong Da has been conducting investigations for the past few days.

411
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,940
He told everyone to move the ledger books to his office.

412
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,190
Think of a solution.

413
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,030
How can I think of a solution?

414
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,620
Shao Tian. All the ledger books are locked inside his safe.

415
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,000
He is the only one who knows the combination to the safe.

416
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,320
He already doesn't trust me.

417
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,320
I already feel like he is aware of this matter.

418
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,920
It's all your fault. We would have left with the money.

419
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,360
Who would have thought this would come back to bite us one day.

420
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,910
Don't expect me to fix it. You are the only one who can get those books.

421
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,930
Tomorrow is Wu Hong Da's 40th birthday celebration.

422
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,130
He will definitely have a banquet in his mansion.

423
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:21,050
There will be many people. He definitely keeps the ledger books in the company.

424
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:29,970
We will take action tomorrow.

425
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,640
Look.

426
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,930
It's really beautiful. Did you draw this?

427
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,940
You really drew this?

428
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,140
Is this me?

429
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,270
- Do I look young?
- Younger by five years.

430
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,500
I really look young.

431
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,190
Dad is always a young hero in my eyes.

432
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:52,620
This is a drawing of the entire Wu family.

433
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,070
If the future, when you go out for business, you can take this along with you.

434
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,750
It will seem like your whole family is with you.

435
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,910
Great.

436
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,590
By the way, where is your sister?

437
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,210
Is she sleeping late again?

438
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,150
This wench.

439
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,700
Who drew this? I already heard.

440
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:19,230
Dad, today's your birthday. I wish you all the best, joy and peace.

441
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,410
Here's your present.

442
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,950
Sister's present is a high end product. My drawing can't be compared it.

443
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,050
That may not be so.

444
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,710
Here.

445
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,880
Dad, take a look.

446
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,230
This is...

447
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,830
I personally made this scarf.

448
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,650
For me?

449
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,990
- I thought it was for Shao Tian.
- Yes, me too.

450
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,540
Let me try it. So how?

451
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,490
It's the first time Cai Hong knitted anything. It's really not bad.

452
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,600
Dad. In the future, I will knit a better one for you.

453
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,780
This is already good enough. I like it.

454
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,910
Dad. I can knit a scarf for you now. In the future, I will cook for you.

455
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:07,000
I will also help you in your business, when you are too old to do it by yourself.

456
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And I will stick to your side through thick and thin.

457
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,530
Anyways, father, please look forward to your daughter taking care of you.

458
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,410
Okay, I will be waiting for it.

459
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,650
Dad, I can do it too. In the future, I will be filial to you too.

460
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,760
Okay, I will be waiting for the both of you.

461
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,220
Look at how filial they both are. The weather's hot. Take it off.

462
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,390
No. Cai Hong gave this to me. I must wear it every day.

463
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:34,320
I'm going to the factory for a while. There are some matters I need to settle.

464
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,530
Dad. Today is your birthday. Can't you give yourself a day off?

465
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,440
That's right. Even the workers in the factory thought that you were taking a day off for your birthday.

466
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,460
What's so urgent that you have to settle it yourself?

467
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,480
I made an appointment with a very important person.

468
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,140
I will be back for the birthday celebration.

469
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,230
Come home early then.

470
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,970
Dad, take care.

471
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,390
You both, listen to me.

472
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,500
Regarding this banquet...

473
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,030
No, move it a bit.

474
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,250
Mom. What's wrong?

475
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,200
I'm anxious. Look, the guests are already here.

476
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,190
Your father is still not back yet.

477
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,290
Dad is too much. Once he's busy with work, he forgets everything.

478
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,810
Why don't we do this? You take care of the guests and I will look for Dad.

479
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,290
Okay, go and be back soon.

480
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,410
Don't worry, Mom.

481
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,080
Be careful.

482
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,910
I'm really so anxious.

483
00:35:52,940 --> 00:36:05,990
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

484
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,280
Who are you?

485
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,500
I am Yao Sheng's boss, Jiang Yu.
<i>(yao - brilliant, dazzling; sheng - rise; name of the company)</i>

486
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,580
I'm Jian Wen Yuan's son.

487
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,450
<i>Give it to me.</i>

488
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:50,530
<i>Give it to me.</i>

489
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,710
You said that you are Jiang Wen Yuan's son?

490
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,930
I get it now.

491
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:38,160
No wonder Yao Sheng was pressing us harder and harder to the brink.

492
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,460
So, you are Jiang Wen Yuan's son.

493
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:47,980
It all stems from the wrong deed I have committed.

494
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,910
12 years have passed without notice.

495
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,750
I made you wait for a long time.

496
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,480
Those twelve years,

497
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,790
I have been living in guilt and remorse.

498
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,930
Come off it.

499
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,100
When you caused my father to die at that time,

500
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,860
you took away Ling Long together with our family's secret recipe.

501
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:22,280
For the past 12 years you have been stepping on a river of blood and tears shed by my family.

502
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,280
You have been enjoying things originally belonging to our family.

503
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,480
Did you ever think about how we lived for the past twelve years?

504
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,000
You are telling me now that you have a guilty conscious?

505
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,850
You are here to take revenge.

506
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,950
This is what you should do.

507
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,910
Because that year,

508
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:47,510
I committed an unforgivable crime to your Jiang family.

509
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,710
It has been twelve years.

510
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:54,130
I knew that this day would come sooner or later.

511
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:58,990
I will pay back for everything that I have done.

512
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,990
Now that you are here,

513
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,990
I feel relieved now.

514
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,260
I won't ask to beg for forgiveness.

515
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,130
I'm begging you

516
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,020
to let my family off.

517
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,730
I'm sorry.

518
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,000
Do you think that being sorry

519
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:50,580
can erase 12 years of our pain and suffering?

520
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,410
I'm back this time,

521
00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:00,030
not only to take back the company and trade secrets.

522
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:04,980
I'm also going to take back everything which belongs to the Jiang family.

523
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,950
I'm also going to double the pain that we have suffered

524
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,970
and return it back to you.
