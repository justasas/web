Father!!

Father.

11
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,700
I got the recipe back

12
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,910
and I guarantee

13
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,620
Ling Long will soon resurface in Huzhou.

14
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,020
Don't worry.

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,330
Father, who killed you?

17
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,640
Master, why didn't you bring me along?

18
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,900
You left me living alone.

19
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,400
What meaning do I have now in living?

20
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,680
-Mother!
-Cai Yun!

21
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,440
What should we do?

22
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,270
Stop standing. Pack these things up.

23
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,600
But Madam and Miss have not said anything.

24
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,350
From today onwards,

25
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,290
everyone

26
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,140
has to listen to Secretary Zhou's arrangement.

27
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,270
Why are you still standing? Start moving!

28
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,900
-Lord
-Mother.

29
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,860

What's wrong?

32
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,540
Are you reminding me to not bring unhappy emotions to her?

33
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,890
You are going to meet your owner.

34
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,230
Are you as happy as I am?

35
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,500
You only know how to eat.

36
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,030
Mother, why not ask Mrs Li to serve and you eat first?

37
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,550
Brother has not come back until now. When he comes back, I'll eat with him.

38
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,400
Fei'er, you eat with me. When your brother works, there is no end.

39
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,700
Who knows what time he'll be back?

40
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,280
Later, let Mrs Li heat up some rice for him.

41
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,370
No worries. I am not hungry yet. You eat first.

42
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,750
Madam, you just eat first.

43
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,510
Miss and Mister have a strong sibling bond.

44
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,490
When Mister drinks hot soup, Miss drinks hot soup too.

45
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,430
When Mister eats cold rice, Miss eats with him.

46
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,430
They go through thick and thin together.

47
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,680
Don't you agree?

48
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,870
Mrs Ling, your words are unclear.

49
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,570
Our family, Fei'er loves to stick with her brother since youth.

50
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,930
The words he says are more effective on her

51
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,070
than my words.

52
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,310
Mother!

53
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,210
It seems to me, that pretty soon

54
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,450
we'll have to call Miss "young Madam." At that time, you can just wait to hold a grandson.

55
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,680
Mrs. Li, what are you saying?

56
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,130

Brother, you only came back now? You have not eaten dinner right? I will bring it to you.

60
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,400
There is no need. I have no appetite.

61
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,370
-Brother
-Come in.

62
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,030
I cooked some porridge for you. No matter what, you should still eat something.

63
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,300
If this carries on, how can your body take it?

64
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,890
Okay, just put it here.

65
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,820
Here.

66
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,520
Oh right, I met with Mister Du who came from Hangzhou.

67
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,690
The Du family has a large fabric factory in Hangzhou.

68
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,270
They want to leave all dyeing to our Yao Sheng.

69
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,270
-How was your talk?
-He suddenly has something going on so he didn't turn up.

70
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,150
-Suddenly had something going on?
-Yes.

71
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,800
I heard that there was an accident on the way to Huzhou. It was unintentional.

72
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,950
I will meet him again in the next few days.

73
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,500
Alright. Fei Fei, have a early rest. It is late already.

74
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,570
Okay. Then you rest early too.

75
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,430
Got it.

76
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,770
If she suddenly has something going on,

77
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,070
it is not standing me up right?

78
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,060
Quickly say yes.

We only just began a little with our revenge plan.

90
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,050
He then suddenly died.

91
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,930
Could it be that this is retribution?

92
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,860
Brother, then our plan to swallow Ling Long

93
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,740
does it still have to progress accordingly?

94
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,480
Did Wu Hong Da, after forcing our father to die,

95
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,480
let Ling Long go so easily?

96
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,720
Everything progresses according to the plan.

97

Without Wu Hong Da, this obstruction, our plan

98
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,930

I am Wu Hong Da's eldest daughter, Wu Cai Hong. This situation is..

103
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,680
What is there to explain? Aren't the facts in front of us?

104
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,370
Yes. I've heard for a while now that Ling Long is no longer profitable!

105
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,440
In the past, we gave Master Wu some face

106
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,610
so we didn't ask for payment.

107
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,970
Now that the rats have left this sinking ship,
what will you use to pay us back?

<i>Yeah! Return our money!</i>

<i>-Return our money now!</i>
-Let me tell you guys...
-Return the money to us now!

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,900
Your Ling Long still owes me half a year's payment for goods!

111
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,730
In order to build a new workshop, Ling Long
still owes us several thousand taels!

-Don't worry, everyone,
<i>-Give us back our money!</i>
-Ling Long has money.

115
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,290
It's just that some of it is at the An Yuan Trading Company in Shanghai. It will mature very soon.

116
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,410
-When that time comes, then we can give you your money back.
-Only a ghost would believe you!

117
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,810
I sent someone to Shanghai to inquire about this!

118
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,420
There never was an An Yuan Trading Company!

119
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,570
Ling Long's money has been scammed completely gone!

-What? Run off?

122
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,380
If we can't get the money back, let's check the warehouse

123
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,850

Don't be afraid.

00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,800
No matter what happens, I'll always be with you.

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,830
Secretary Zhou, come here!

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,310
The Xiang Fa Dyeing Factory is
scooping up Ling Long's workers right now.

144
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,050
It seems like they will give workers with experience like us

145
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,850
an increase of one percent in wages. Let's go together.

146
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,070
If you want to go, then go by yourself!

147
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,450
-If you kick us out...
-Quickly get out!
-Where will we live?

148
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,390
-This is going too far!
-Go, drive them out!
-Hurry up and get lost!

149
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,740
-Stop!
-Aunt!
-What are you guys doing?!

150
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,410
Shao Tian! Cai Yun. They said that Ling Long
borrowed 50,000 taels.

151
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,000
50,000 taels?!

152
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,890
Yes. This sum of money was due last month.

153
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,110
Look clearly. It's written in black and white.

154
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,360
There is Boss Wu's genuine signature on here.

155
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,860
It is indeed Boss Wu's genuine signature. So it shouldn't be a fake.

156
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,090
The loan agreement said that if this amount is not paid back before the due date,

157
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,310
then we can take the Wu mansion as payment.
We came here to collect the house.

158
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,330
-Everyone, can you extend the deadline a few days?
-Yes, can you extend the deadline a few days?

159
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,200
I will definitely think of a way to raise money
to the best of my abilities.

160
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,800
Zhou, I don't know what your background is.

161
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,340
Even Wu Hong Da himself couldn't solve this mess.
And we're supposed to count on you?!

162
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,590
You're like a toad wanting to ascend into the sky.
Don't kid yourself!

163
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,430
Enter the house! Go. Go.

164
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,640
You can't do this! Don't close the door!

165
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,740
Open the door! Hurry up and open the door!

166
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,010
Hurry up and open the door! This is our home!

167
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,980
What reason do you guys have to kick us out?!

168
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,410
Yes! Hurry up and open the door!

169
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,980
-Madam, what should we do now?!
-Open the door!

170
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,970
How would I know what to do?!

171
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,090
Master,

172
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,870
it hasn't been long since you died,

173
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,670
and these people just bully us like this!

174
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,390
-Madam!
-Mom!

175
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,310
<i>Wu Cai Hong...</i>

176
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,790
<i>you have to pull yourself together.</i>

177
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,940
<i>Starting today,</i>

178
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,690
<i>-you will take father's place and support this family.</i>
-Open the door! Open the door!

179
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,960
<i>Protect your sister and aunt well.</i>

180
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,590
We're here. This is it.

181
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,260
Come in.

182
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,370
Mom, go. Let's go in.

183
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,600
Go.

184
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,750
Take a look. This is the house you wanted to rent.

185
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,810
-It's nothing. It's nothing.
-Are you alright?

186
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,680
This has fallen into disrepair for a while.
It'll be fine once I go find a carpenter to fix it.

187
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,580
What kind of a place is this?!
How can it be so messy?!

188
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,530
The warehouse in our previous Wu residence

189
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,950
was way tidier than this place.

190
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,970
I'm telling you, no one has lived in this place for a long time.

191
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,350
Also, I'll clean the place up before you move in.

192
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,110
Yes. I think this place is alright actually.

193
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,900
Then if you feel this place isn't bad,

194
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,090
did you want to pay this month's rent first?

195
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,340
- Here.
- All right.

196
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,870
Everyone, since you'll be busy, I won't disturb you.

197
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,460
Brother Shao Tian, sorry for troubling you again.

198
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,720
It should be me who apologizes, Cai Hong.

199
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,040
Right now, there really is no other way.
You guys will have to live in such a simple and crude house.

200
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,540
At present, I can only do this much with my abilities.

201
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,350
However, trust me. I definitely won't let you
live here for too long.

202
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,320
Brother Shao Tian, luckily we have you. If it weren't for you,

203
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,800
our family would already be living on the streets.

204
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,750
We won't be living on the streets. No matter how big a house is,

205
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,620
in the end, it's just a shelter from wind and rain.

206
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,560
The most important thing right now
is that our whole family is together.

207
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,640
Cai Hong, I really won't let you live in this place

208
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,190
for too long. Sooner or later, there will be a day

209
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,400
where I can definitely let you live in a mansion again.

210
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,660
Brother Shao Tian, you treat my sister so well.
I really admire her.

211
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,240
-Admire what?
-Mom!

212
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,850
Silly girl. You need to find someone with a rich family

213
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,110
and take me away from this terrible place as soon as possible.

214
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,860
-This is what is admirable.
-What are you talking about?

215
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,600
It's really dirty here.

216
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,590
Shouldn't it be cleaned?

217
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,880
-I'll do it.
-I'll go with you.

218
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,780
I'll come too.

219
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,650
What do you mean you're going?
You'll get yourself dirty.

220
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,400
Honestly...

221
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,090
Brother Shao Tian. It was really troublesome for you today.

222
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,440
Cai Hong, don't always view me as an outsider.

223
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,460
The house was only a small matter.

224
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,450
As for Ling Long, what are your plans?

225
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,380
I just hate myself for

226
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,580
not learning about business affairs from
my dad when he was alive.

227
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,640
Otherwise it wouldn't be like now, with no ideas at all.

228
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,960
All of the inventory and raw materials in the warehouse

229
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,670
have been looted by the creditors.

230
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,650
With Ling Long's situation right now,
I reckon there won't be any banks

231
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,230
that would be willing to lend us money. But we still have Ling Long's factory.

232
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,290
The workers are still here,

233
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,190
and we still have Ling Long's sign.

234
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,120
So, what does Brother Shao Tian mean?

235
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,200
Since there is no way we can start operations to manufacture and we also owe so much debt,

236
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,850
how about, selling Ling Long first?

237
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,040
After we pay off the debts, we can discuss
other matters at a later time.

238
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,930
No.

239
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,440
Ling Long was dad's lifetime of effort.

240
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,520
How could I sell it off?

241
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,310
Cai Hong, I know that this kind of decision

242
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,920
is really hard for you.

243
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,860
But the circumstances right now
are difficult no matter how you look at it.

244
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,830
You can't reason with the market,
let alone appeal to its emotions.

245
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,620
Yao Sheng could be planning a hostile takeover right now.

246
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,810
They are most likely already collaborating with the creditors.

247
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,620
One side is demanding debt payment
while the other is forcing prices to lower.

248
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,640
But, Ling Long was dad's life and blood.

249
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,780
But if we continue to hold it off like this,

250
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,550
the longer we delay the more passive we'll appear.

251
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,620
If we act now,

252
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,730
we might be able to fetch a good price.

253
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,310
Otherwise, I'm afraid we won't even get the chance to break even.

254
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,190
Perhaps that's exactly what Yao Sheng wants.

255
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,400
I never thought that
Ling Long would become forfeit in my hands.

256
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,300
Cai Hong, where there's still life

257
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,920
there's always hope.

258
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,510
Then we'll count on you, Brother Shao Tian.

259
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,460
I'll go take care of some other arrangements first.
You take care of yourself.

260
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,800
That's right, Miss Wu has decided to sell Ling Long.

261
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,010
If you'd like to make an offer, you can come over tomorrow and we'll discuss it in person.

262
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,350
That's right. Yes, yes.

263
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,130
I'll see you tomorrow.

264
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:51,100
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

265
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,490
<i>Daddy! Hug!</i>

266
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,380
<i>Cai Hong, come here, Daddy will hold you.</i>

267
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,820
<i>Cai Hong, what Dad cares most about right now</i>

268
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,420
<i>isn't titles or money,</i>

269
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,720
<i>it's you.</i>

270
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,080
<i>Everything your dad has done has been for you</i>

271
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,000
<i>and for this family.</i>

272
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,340
<i>Don't worry, I'll definitely live to 100 years</i>

273
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,850
<i>to see you get married, see you have children,</i>

274
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,490
<i>-and to see you live a stable and secure life.
-Aiya, I know!</i>

275
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,580
<i>You always want me to get married. Who would I marry?</i>

276
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,290
<i>Dad!</i>

277
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,040
Wei! That day, why did you stand me up?

278
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,280
Something came up. It wasn't on purpose.

279
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,260
"Something came up?" To make up for standing me up,

280
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,650
I threw your cat in the river to feed the fish.

281
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,630
You, to Wu Long-

282
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,890
I, I was just teasing you...

283
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,010
She's fine. Your cat is at my place, eating and drinking so well she's nearly as fat as a pig.

284
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,830
-I was just joking...
-I don't like this joke!

285
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,770
Let's decide on a new time and place.

286
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,570
This time, I'll definitely go pick up Wu Long.

287
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,860
Your cat's name is Wu Long?

288
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,980
Then, what's yours? Every time I see you,

289
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,640
I can't just call you “Hey," right?

290
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,730
Contact me soon.
I don't wish for your cat to grow too fat to walk,

291
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,990
and for you to resent me for that. I'll wait.

292
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,140
Who was that?

293
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,970
The person who picked up Wu Long.
If there are no issues, I'll return first, Brother Shao Tian.

294
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,690
Sure. I won't send you off today.I still have to contact some

295
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,740
parties who might be willing to buy Ling Long. You can go first.

296
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,330
Miss Wu, hello. Our household's young lady has something to discuss with you.

297
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,340
Your household's young lady？

298
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,710
Miss Wu, hello. I am Lu Man.

299
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,530
Miss Lu, how did you know my family name is Wu?

300
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,290
The current head of Ling Long dying factory.
Miss Wu Cai Hong,

301
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,020
I'm a loyal customer of your Ling Long.

302
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,360
I hear you now have plans to sell Ling Long,

303
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,840
so I specially came over to discuss it with you.

304
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,480
But I just took over the business.

305
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,590
There are still lots of things I don't understand. It's better that you talk to Secretary Zhou.

306
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,050
But he is an outsider.

307
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,440
How could he become the head of the Wu family?

308
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,270
To add further, there are certain things

309
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,510
that only Secretary Zhou would know.

310
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,480
For example, your asking price.

311
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,450
In addition to your factory, equipment and staff,

312
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,470
is there something like a secret formula?

313
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,170
I know that you are in need of money now. Don't worry.

314
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:04,530
I will definitely give you a good price.

315
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,000
What's wrong? You are not happy with my terms?

316
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,390
It's not that. It's just that I don't know much about it.

317
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,340
I don't know anything about a secret formula.

318
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,170
It's better that you talk to Secretary Zhou.

319
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,050
Since this is the case,

320
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,930
okay then. Sorry to impose on you.

321
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,840
The shareholders are already here.

322
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,320
A businessman who wants to buy Ling Long is also here.

323
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,990
Cai Hong, don't worry.

324
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,800
Don't be nervous. What you should do is take a deep breath.

325
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,170
Do not add your own distress to this trying time.

326
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,500
Don't worry.

327
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,350
Leave everything to me.

328
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,270
<i>Look. How could they sell it?</i>

329
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,540
<i>-How did it come to this?
-Wouldn't we be losing money?
-Precisely.</i>

330
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,980
<i>How much is it going to cost?</i>

331
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,820
<i>How much could they get from the sale?</i>

332
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,860
<i>I never imagined that Ling Long would be in this state today.</i>

333
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,490
<i>Who doesn't know about this?</i>

334
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,630
- Everyone is here.
- Cai Hong is here.

335
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,270
So far only one company, Yao Sheng, is here.

336
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,890
Let's talk while we wait.

337
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,310
Dear Sir, Miss Wu is here.

338
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,210
Can we start now?

339
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,640
It's you.

340
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,060
You are Wu Hong Da's daughter?

341
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,460
You are Yao Sheng's boss?

342
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,590
You both know each other?

343
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,710
It can be considered so.

344
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,910
Let's start now. We invited the shareholders here today

345
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,530
and also those who are interested in buying the company.

346
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,400
We are here to discuss the matter about Ling Long.

347
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,140
The sale agreement that I've drafted, I believe this gentleman has already seen it.

348
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,560
I wonder what is your opinion.

349
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,590
My offer, is five percent of your selling price.

350
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,410
Five percent? Are you kidding?

351
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,210
This is outrageous!

352
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,630
At this price, we'll be getting no return on our money.

353
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,540
- This is our blood, sweat and tears...
- Everyone, stay calm.

354
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:01,460
This gentleman...
After all, our Ling Long is a time-honored brand.

355
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,710
Even though we have run into some problems

356
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,180
Ling Long's buildings, machines

357
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,130
and the experienced workers. These are of valued costs.

358
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,860
So our asking price is definitely reasonable.

359
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,870
If it's as you say, then you don't need to sell Ling Long.

360
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,520
You are taking advantage of us.

361
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,950
Us Yao Sheng isn't a living Buddha.
(meaning a compassionate person)

362
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,290
We are also businessmen.

363
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,620
You are really looters.

364
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,990
Hence, Miss Wu,

365
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:36,330
you also acknowledge that your house is on fire?
- You!

366
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,050
Other than our offer, no one else would want to state the price.

367
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,200
I should say this.

368
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,100
No one would dare to make an offer.

369
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,800
If you don't believe me, you can ask around.

370
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,970
I stated it very clearly. Today's five percent

371
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,020
will be four percent tomorrow and three percent the day after.

372
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,570
Starting from now, it will be less one percent every day.

373
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,710
Everyone, make your decision.

374
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,210
What should we do?

375
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,510
Make it five percent then.

376
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,990
Compared to being bankrupt, I support the sale.

377
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,440
He is the only one offering us silver anyway.
<i>(silver was a common currency in this period).</i>

378
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,800
We can always build another factory in the future. Let's sell it.
- I disagree.

379
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,220
You don't agree? Even if you don't, we should sell it.

380
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,130
If you don't sell it, we will be paupers.

381
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,930
That's right. Even if we total up all our shares, it's still not enough.

382
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,970
Don't talk to her anymore. What does she know?

383
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,620
Everyone, don't be anxious first.

384
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,220
The Wu family is still the biggest shareholder of Ling Long.

385
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,130
Let's listen to Miss Wu's views.

386
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,870
Give her some time to consider.

387
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,650
What do you think?

388
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,850
<i>Let's just sell it.</i>

389
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,130
<i>What should we do if we don't sell it? This is happening too fast.</i>

390
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,870
<i>How much is it worth?</i>

391
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,830
I shouldn't have picked you up and let stay here.

392
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,910
- Hello.
-Jiang Yu.

393
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:36,460
Can you meet me in half an hour at Chaoyin River's bridge?

394
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,540
Return Wu Long to me.

395
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,720
You don't need to wait anymore.

396
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,610
I already beat your cat to death.

397
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,920
It's true this time.

398
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,100
You bastard! Return Wu Long to me.

399
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,110
Monster.

400
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,640
Cai Hong.

401
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,860
The autopsy report is out.

402
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,930
Dad.

403
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,350
I really never imagined that

404
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,240
she was Wu Hong Da's daughter.

405
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,230
Based on the autopsy report,

406
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,860
it still can't be confirmed if your father killed himself or was murdered.

407
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,320
But there is a great suspicion that he has been murdered.

408
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,260
Wu Hong Da received a fatal wound to the head. But the autopsy showed

409
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,370
that there was also another, not too serious wound on his shoulder.

410
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,830
He also had bruises.

411
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,570
They were obviously caused during a struggle.

412
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,420
Judging from the sight of the wounds,

413
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,840
they were caused by some sharp metal object.

414
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,940
Accordingly to the Ling Long's porter testimony

415
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,680
Yao Sheng's boss, Jiang Yu,

416
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,120
came to visit Ling Long on that very day.

417
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,680
Cai Hong. Could you tell us

418
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,100
what could your father and Yao Sheng's boss be talking about?

419
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,810
Jiang Yu has been planning a hostile take over of the company.

420
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:33,140
It's possible that he's the killer of my father.

421
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,410
Where is it?

422
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,870
Jiang Yu. You killed my father. You did it.

423
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,070
- Calm down, Cai Hong.
- You executed my father to take over Ling Long!

424
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,660
You didn't even hesitate, right?!

425
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,140
Miss. What you are doing now to Mr Jiang Yu,

426
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,140
you need the law to be responsible for this.

427
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,170
Sorry, Mr Jiang. This way, please.

428
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:15,670
That's right. On the day Wu Hong Da died,

429
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:19,710
I definitely went to see him at Ling Long but I didn't kill him.

430
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,770
First, when I left Ling Long,

431
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,360
Wu Hong Da personally escorted me to the main entrance.

432
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,980
At that time, Wu Hong Da was still alive.

433
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,500
If the door keeper is not blind, he should have seen everything.

434
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,370
Well, we still need the door keeper to verify this.

435
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:41,840
Also, when I left Ling Long that day, it was noon.

436
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,840
After that I had lunch with Director Lee.

437
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,490
Shouldn't you call him

438
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,110
and investigate this?

439
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,220
Director Lee, my name is Chen Shijie. It is like this.

440
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,470
I'm investigating Wu Hong Da's case now.

441
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,860
There is a current suspect who said that he was not at the crime scene

442
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,840
because at noon that day, you were having lunch with him.

443
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm calling you to confirm this.

444
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,970
Yes. You definitely were having lunch with him?

445
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,830
You didn't find anything out of the ordinary?

446
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,870
Okay, sorry to disturb you.

447
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,040
That's it. Thank you.

448
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,920
Jiang Yu has an alibi that he was not at the crime scene.

449
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,400
Furthermore, his witness is my superior.

450
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,240
Director Lee.

451
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,720
Jiang Yu's alibi sounds true on the surface.

452
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,620
So in theory he can be ruled out as the murder's suspect.

453
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,800
We will still investigate the case. Go back first and wait for my news.

454
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,220
Bastard. Just because you are rich, you think you

455
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,160
are unpunishable, right?
- Cai Hong!

456
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,280
Before accusing me of anything,

457
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,280
please review the evidence first.

458
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,740
If not, I will let my lawyer contact you.

459
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,040
<i>Cai Hong! Dad's imploring you.</i>

460
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,940
<i>Take revenge for me. You must take revenge for your father.</i>

461
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,410
Dad.

462
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,370
<i>I can't sit here and do nothing.</i>

463
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,720
<i>I must take revenge for Dad.</i>

464
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,240
<i>I must find the evidence.</i>

465
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:46,650
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

466
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,430
I will accept the five percent.

467
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,550
I'm really very sorry.

468
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,510
That was the price before I was investigated by the police.

469
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,530
I have changed my mind now.

470
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,650
My asking price now is

471
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,720
two percent.

472
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,120
How can you loot us in such way?

473
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,390
One and a half percent.

474
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,940
Did you ever think about

475
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,660
how the major shareholders of Ling Long will survive?

476
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,350
One percent.

477
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,560
It's a deal.

478
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,880
Let's have a good collaboration.

479
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,050
But I have a condition.

480
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,950
I want to work at Ling Long.

481
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,780
I hope you

482
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,560
will give me a fair opportunity to earn the money.

483
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,440
In this industry, there is only a winner or loser. There is no fairness.

484
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,790
I don't want to see you again.

485
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:34,060
You better stay far away from me. If not,

486
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,320
you will regret it.

487
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,070
If you really want to do this,

488
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,450
then, I will

489
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,750
I will tell everyone how you lowered the price for Ling Long

490
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,670
and also before my father's death on that day,

491
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,880
you went to Ling Long to find him regarding this issue.

492
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,510
I will go to all the newspapers.

493
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,190
You forgot that I wasn't at the scene.

494
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:59,320
The police need evidence but what the reporters

495
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,520
need are stories.

496
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,550
If I leak out the details about you and Ling Long,

497
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,000
I wonder what the reporters will write.

498
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,000
Since you want to remain at Ling Long so much,

499
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,620
I will fulfill your wish.

500
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,200
You better not regret this.

501
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,040
<i>- Leave the side open.
- All right.</i>

502
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,450
<i>- Keep it steady.
- Be careful.</i>

503
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,270
<i>- Can you do it?
- Place it over there.</i>

504
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,700
<i>Come.</i>

505
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,420
♫<i> How am I to choose </i>♫

506
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,930
♫<i> the colour between you and me? </i>♫

507
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:43,380
♫<i> The world is too elusive</i>♫

508
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:49,000
♫<i> to know what end result may be. </i>♫

509
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,200
♫<i> I hear your question, </i>♫

510
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,500
♫<i> I keep everything inside without telling you. </i>♫

511
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:08,600
