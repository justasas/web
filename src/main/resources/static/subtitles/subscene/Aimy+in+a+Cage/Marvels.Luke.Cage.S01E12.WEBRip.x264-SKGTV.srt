1
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:15,686
[Green] All right, here's
the plan. Triple-cuff him.

2
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,522
Alpha team, you take point
positions in the convoy.

3
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:20,816
Bravo team will bring up the rear.

4
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:22,275
Remember, we're clear to engage,

5
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:25,486
so if he so much as looks
at you funny, light him up.

6
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:26,905
[officer 1] Copy that.

7
00:00:26,988 --> 00:00:29,825
You hear that, freak? I got
something special for you.

8
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:34,788
This isn't necessary.

9
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:37,332
Yeah, it is.

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,461
[indistinct chatter]

11
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:45,966
[groans]

12
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,344
No. You need to let us
finish. Ms. Knight. Ms. Knight!

13
00:00:49,427 --> 00:00:52,430
It's Detective Knight, and I'm fine.

14
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:57,018
I need a moment with Cage.

15
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:59,479
[Green] Misty, we have special orders.

16
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:01,898
Mario, come on.

17
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:04,317
I was just held hostage.

18
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:06,862
I just need a minute with him.

19
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:13,869
All right. We'll be right
here. We got your back.

20
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:16,204
[officer 2] Clear!

21
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:18,414
You going down.

22
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,251
It's about damn time.

23
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:26,381
Cottonmouth, Officer Albini,
what just popped off in there...

24
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:30,761
Look, your friend is in the wind.

25
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:38,059
They've got public enemy number one in
handcuffs for the whole world to see...

26
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:41,104
so they're not looking for anybody else.

27
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:47,443
Every officer in your detail
has those modified Judas bullets.

28
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:50,321
I wouldn't try anything if I were you...

29
00:01:51,657 --> 00:01:53,700
before I got to the precinct.

30
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:58,538
You're not that crazy, are you?

31
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,457
Always.

32
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:08,006
Take his ass to jail.

33
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,134
Come on.

34
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:18,187
[officer 2] All right,
let's go. We're rolling.

35
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,104
[sirens wailing]

36
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,279
Three sets of cuffs?
Isn't that overkill?

37
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:34,157
The camera's on. We need to
look like we're in control.

38
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:37,285
[officer 1] It's a shit detail.

39
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:40,371
You'd think ESU would be in the
back with those guns pointed at him.

40
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:42,290
We've got the same guns
and bullets they do.

41
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:44,668
You know, my wife says
it's the end of days,

42
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:46,586
people like him popping up.

43
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:50,506
They've been saying that
since Eve bit the apple.

44
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,175
Cage? He's evolution.

45
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:55,136
[stammers] Whatever
he is, it's just scary.

46
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,723
Makes me feel small. Insignificant.

47
00:02:57,806 --> 00:02:59,640
Insecure?

48
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:02,894
You know what they say. Once
you go black, you never go back.

49
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:04,896
At least that's what your
wife keeps telling me.

50
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,026
I was fast asleep when she came home.
Your daughter already wore me out.

51
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,569
[officer 2] Just sit tight.

52
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:18,243
God damn it.

53
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:20,829
Homeless lady. Can't they
move her out of the way?

54
00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:23,224
[Green on loudspeaker] You are
in the path of a police convoy.

55
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:24,916
Clear the road immediately.

56
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:27,961
[tires screeching]

57
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,963
[officer 3] Come on!

58
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:32,758
[Green on loudspeaker] Cage
must not escape. Fire at will!

59
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:35,468
[officer 3] Go, go, go, go, go!

60
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:38,013
He went down the south side.

61
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:41,307
[guns firing]

62
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:44,310
[officers shouting indistinctly]

63
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:46,538
[officer 4 on radio] <i>Somebody
give me a sitrep right now!</i>

64
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:48,857
[officer 5] Team two...
Let's go, let's go!

65
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:52,110
[officers shouting indistinctly]

66
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,046
[sirens wailing]

67
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:15,133
[shotgun cocks]

68
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:22,640
Young cops always wanna chase somebody.

69
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:25,143
Me, I'd rather be where
they're already going.

70
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:29,773
They told us these Judas bullets
can kill someone like you.

71
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:32,650
You don't want to die? Don't run.

72
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:34,735
I'd rather die than go back to prison.

73
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,822
[scoffs] Live free or die?

74
00:04:36,905 --> 00:04:38,715
You wanna get all New
Hampshire about this shit?

75
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,075
Fine with me.

76
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:43,578
- Cop killers don't survive these streets.
- I didn't kill a cop.

77
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:47,290
My problem isn't with you or yours.

78
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:49,000
It's much bigger than that.

79
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:51,586
Some people are calling
you a hero for what you did.

80
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,713
Connie's, Pop's...

81
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:56,091
I'm no hero.

82
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:59,135
But I do need to take out the
person responsible for all this.

83
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:03,264
- You don't recognize me, do you?
- [sirens continue wailing]

84
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:09,020
I've seen you at Pop's before.

85
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:12,523
Pop cut my hair for 12 years.

86
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:14,359
He didn't think he was a hero, either.

87
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:17,112
He was just trying to do some
right after years of wrong.

88
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,202
I hope I'm right about you.

89
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:28,081
More people rooting
for you than you think.

90
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:31,835
- What are you gonna tell your people?
- The truth.

91
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:33,837
I had you in my sights,
but you outran me.

92
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,338
I'm getting old.

93
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:38,967
Luke?

94
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:42,262
You better catch that
slippery son of a bitch.

95
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:55,650

Moments after the tumultuous
events at Harlem's Paradise,

98
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:14,479
<i>fugitive and alleged cop killer Luke
Cage was brought out in handcuffs.</i>

99
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:16,064
<i>And now the city's most...</i>

100
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:18,191
[Turk] Hey, I'm glad
you called me, Willis.

101
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:21,444
Luke Cage is on the run.
They got Shades in bracelets,

102
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:23,696
but they're gonna be onto
you before long, brother.

103
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,573
Best believe that.

104
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:28,659
Getting ghost and liquidizing
your cash, that was the right move.

105
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:32,830
<i>- Luke Cage must be approached with...</i>
- [Stryker] I wouldn't touch any of that.

106
00:07:32,913 --> 00:07:33,914
[door opens]

107
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,584
[door closes]

108
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,212
People don't test me more than once.

109
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,632
- I overstand.
- Hmm.

110
00:07:44,842 --> 00:07:46,677
What you need me for?

111
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:50,556
I understand you're a man
of discretion and taste

112
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,103
with numerous connections willing
to pay full price for my wares.

113
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:57,438
I can still collect from the shadows.

114
00:07:57,522 --> 00:07:59,857
- Bad news, Diamondback.
- Take those off!

115
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:05,863
I went to your crib. The
files you had are gone.

116
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:14,539
[choking]

117
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:16,624

[laughs]

120
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:28,428
- I had you, didn't I?
- [coughing]

121
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:30,430
[Stryker continues laughing]

122
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:35,185
I couldn't resist.

123
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:39,939
I like you, Zip.

124
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:43,068
You've got ambition.
It'll take you far...

125
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:45,320
as long as you stay in your place.

126
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:48,281
The first of the 48 laws of power.

127
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,617
Never outshine the master.

128
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:54,412
That was the mistake Shades made.

129
00:08:54,495 --> 00:08:57,707
He questioned me. He doubted
me. He tried to reach too far.

130
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,585
He was on some Icarus shit.

131
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:04,464
Do you know who that is?

132
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:07,550
Yeah, he had a verse with Kendrick.

133
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,053
- Right?
- No...

134
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:14,140
Icarus was the boy who flew too
close to the sun with fake wings.

135
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:18,018
Shades is no problem.
He's still in custody.

136
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:19,562
Not for long.

137
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,400
- You gonna blow the joint up?
- No, he's going to be bailed out.

138
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:28,488
The hell for? That don't make no sense!

139
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:30,823
See? The questioning.

140
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:32,783
That's how it starts.

141
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:34,327
[sighs]

142
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:43,961
I'm gonna have an opening.

143
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,964
You gonna step up?

144
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,259
I'm down to do whatever you need.

145
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:52,387
- No problem.
- [Stryker] Good boy.

146
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:55,014
So are you down?

147
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:57,808
I'm down.

148
00:09:57,892 --> 00:10:01,061
As long as the business is
business, I'm good with it.

149
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:03,314
Till then, I'm out of here, man.

150
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:05,900
Show Turk out, Zip.

151
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:14,909
Romeo would roll over in his grave,

152
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:17,828
the way you hop-skipping
with these cats nowadays.

153
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:20,248
He was a man on these
streets. You's a boy.

154
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:22,167
What the hell are you talking about?

155
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,877
You're down here in
his pocket, same as me.

156
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,796
I'm doing business with him, yes.

157
00:10:27,713 --> 00:10:31,634
But I ain't his boy. And I
definitely ain't his bitch.

158
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:43,604
- [door slams]
- [Zip scoffs]

159
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:46,941
These old-ass niggas talkin' about
shit they don't even know about.

160
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:49,569
So... what's in the box?

161
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:53,489
One of the seven deadly sins, my boy...

162
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:56,534
which I plan to unleash
on dear old Carl.

163
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:57,785
Which one?

164
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:00,913
Wrath.

165
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:07,044
[in Spanish] This Diamondback
needs to be dealt with.

166
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:14,260
Ernesto is right, Domingo. This
is the perfect time to do it.

167
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:16,637
We've got the muscle.

168
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:23,143
Plus, with the Cuban, Jamaican,
Dominican and Haitian leaders dead,

169
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:28,107
we can control the
drugs, guns, all of it...

170
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:31,277
and walk out like kings.

171
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:35,240
[in English] I was there
when he took them all out.

172
00:11:36,282 --> 00:11:37,617
Right next door.

173
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:41,496
We got the drugs.

174
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,456
We got that money.

175
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,042
But with the guns, we
can control everything.

176
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:50,255
Here, the islands, further south...

177
00:11:52,423 --> 00:11:55,260
We'd be unstoppable. Hmm?

178
00:11:55,343 --> 00:11:58,178
[Ernesto in Spanish]
So what are you saying?

179
00:12:00,556 --> 00:12:02,141
[in English] We take him out.

180
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,270
We go after what's ours.

181
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:07,522
[Ernesto scoffs and chuckles]

182
00:12:09,524 --> 00:12:11,191
Let's go find Diamondback.

183
00:12:13,903 --> 00:12:15,112
[sighs]

184
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:18,991
- [camera shutter clicking]
- [officer 1] Turn and face the camera.

185
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:26,973
[officer 2] All right,
let's go. Move it.

186
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:45,393
You're supposed to be in the hospital.

187
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:50,022
Push yourself too hard too soon and
you could make it worse, you know.

188
00:12:50,105 --> 00:12:52,567
- I appreciate your concern.
- No, you don't.

189
00:12:54,444 --> 00:12:56,612
I need you at 100%.

190
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:59,490
I need to prove Luke Cage is innocent.

191
00:13:00,616 --> 00:13:02,410
Well, the hostages
have all been consistent

192
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:04,173
that Luke Cage never
held them at gunpoint.

193
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:06,706
[Misty] He was set up.
You know it, Priscilla.

194
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:08,541
Half this damn department knows it.

195
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:11,544
We need to be going
after Willis Stryker.

196
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:13,671
Well, then why is Luke Cage running?

197
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:18,926
He's a black man being
chased by the cops...

198
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:20,511
oh, with special bullets.

199
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:23,639
Accused of killing a cop,

200
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:26,016
and you're asking why
he's running? Come on.

201
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:34,984
Look at how relaxed
Hernan "Shades" Alvarez is.

202
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:37,528
He knows he's not going
anywhere anytime soon,

203
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:39,113
so he's resting up.

204
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,949
He knows he's guilty.

205
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,834
See this perp?

206
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:56,964
Look how his foot is bouncing. Nervous.

207
00:13:57,047 --> 00:14:00,426
- No wonder his street name is Sugar.
- [chuckles]

208
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,571
I don't even have to say a word,
and here come the waterworks.

209
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:04,514
He's probably innocent...

210
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:07,767
or less guilty than whoever
he's about to give up.

211
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,268
That's a detectives' wives' tale.

212
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:11,396
You can't prove guilt
or innocence by that.

213
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,814
Oh, but you can...

214
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:15,691
- because Luke gave you his word.
- Luke...

215
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:18,528
Right now, his actions are
speaking louder than his words.

216
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:19,987
Luke Cage...

217
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:22,740
saved my life.

218
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:27,161
I don't dispute that we should
be bringing in Diamondback,

219
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:30,330
but to get to the truth, we
need to bring them both in.

220
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:33,459
[indistinct chatter]

221
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:39,465
Okay, well, let me lead the charge.
Make sure Luke is brought in safely.

222
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,051
He threw away his chance when
he jumped out that damn van.

223
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:45,137
Now they will shoot him on
sight with the mayor's blessing.

224
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:53,187
You know what? At least let
me take a crack at Shades.

225
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,565
He's in deep with all the players.

226
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:58,401
He doesn't scare me.

227
00:14:58,484 --> 00:14:59,902
- Detective...
- I can handle him.

228
00:14:59,985 --> 00:15:01,654
You just got shot.

229
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:04,364
- I need you to go home, get some rest.
- [sighs]

230
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:08,536
I'll interview Shades.

231
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:23,217
[Mariah] My grandmother
loved Harlem's Paradise.

232
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:30,433
She took care of all the small details.

233
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:31,976
She loved it.

234
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:37,648
From the murals...

235
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:40,860
the glasswork, all the way
down to the table linens.

236
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:44,321
No fine point was overlooked.

237
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,034
- [glass shattering]
- This was her legacy.

238
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:54,749
My family's in tatters, and it's
all because of Diamondback. Shit!

239
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,959
[stammers]

240
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:58,919
Uh, I know, I know...

241
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,839
[sighs] I need to get
out in front of this.

242
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:07,302
Release a statement about Damon
Boone and how much I respected him.

243
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:09,179
That is not what I was gonna say.

244
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:12,141
Well, yeah, just... Please, no lectures.

245
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,147
This is just a thing.

246
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:23,193
Things can be rebuilt, and when you
do, you rebuild it as your legacy.

247
00:16:23,277 --> 00:16:24,779
Not just the clubs.

248
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:31,827
I want to be a part of that.

249
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:39,459
Here's what I think.

250
00:16:39,544 --> 00:16:42,505
Controlling the narrative is everything.
We can't have any loose threads.

251
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:43,964
So anyone who might have overheard

252
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:47,301
anything you said to
Diamondback or Shades in here...

253
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:48,803
is a threat.

254
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:51,597
You're absolutely correct.

255
00:16:52,765 --> 00:16:54,349
[chuckles]

256
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:56,393
How may I be of service?

257
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:03,651
I wouldn't want you to
do anything untoward.

258
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:05,736
Never.

259
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:08,864
Okay.

260
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:11,784
[indistinct chatter]

261
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:37,852
I don't have time for this.

262
00:17:38,978 --> 00:17:40,896
- [cash rustling]
- [man 1] Don't move.

263
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,940
He'll blow your head
off. He's crazy like that.

264
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:44,609
Don't try no shit.

265
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:51,824
My bad, Meth. I grew
up on that Wu-Tang shit.

266
00:17:51,907 --> 00:17:54,368
- But you know how it is.
- [Method Man] Are you serious?

267
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,162
Are you really trying to
have a conversation right now?

268
00:17:57,246 --> 00:17:59,432
I'm just tryin'... I'm just
sayin'... You're the man, yo.

269
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:01,852
Pull your mask down! You supposed
to be watchin' the damn door, Bryce!

270
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:04,003
What I say about using my
government name, Michael?

271
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:05,337
[door chimes]

272
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:08,483
Damn, homie. You look like you
went through a cheese grater.

273
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:09,967
Oh, snap, you Luke...

274
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,719
- [gun firing]
- [bullet ricocheting]

275
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:14,221
- [glass shattering]
- [gasping]

276
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,018
I ain't mean that.

277
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:24,774
Give me your phone.

278
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:26,025
The phone, fool.

279
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:29,045
Yo, my bad, man. You know, I
just got a little nervous and shit

280
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:31,697
- when you threw my mans across the...
- [grunts]

281
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:35,660
It's you.

282
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:39,747
- Yeah, it's you.
- [chuckles]

283
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,331
No, man, it's you.

284
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:45,210
Yo, man, "P.L.O. Style" was
my joint back in the day.

285
00:18:45,294 --> 00:18:47,797
Sweet Christmas. [chuckles]

286
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:49,924
Yeah, man, one second.

287
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:56,096
Hey. It's me.

288
00:18:57,306 --> 00:18:59,141
Yeah, they'll be looking for me.

289
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,103
I'll lay in the cut.
I'll see you in a few.

290
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:09,652
You a double XL?

291
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:11,278
[scoffs] Way ahead of you, homie,

292
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:27,544
Call the cops.

293
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:29,981
I know a lot of people who would
pay you for this kind of protection.

294
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:31,882
They can keep their money.

295
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:34,760
Salute.

296
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:40,432
[laughs]

297
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:43,268
You ever see anything like that before?

298
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:44,979
Harlem, baby.

299
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:47,189
Harlem.

300
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:48,733
[cell phone ringing]

301
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:52,027
- Hello?
- [Candace] <i>Detective Knight?</i>

302
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,654
- Candace?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

303
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:56,741
<i>What number are you calling me from?</i>

304
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:59,576
A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS.

305
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:01,078
I need to see you.

306
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:04,248
- Come into the precinct.
<i>- No. No.</i>

307
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:07,918
You saw how quickly Mariah sent
that lawyer and got me out of there.

308
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:12,297
You didn't wanna talk to me
before. What makes you trust me now?

309
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:14,216
<i>Because Luke Cage does.</i>

310
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,345
He saved my life. And
you saw right through me.

311
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:23,726
<i>- You want the truth, right?</i>
- Where are you?

312
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:25,853
<i>- Look, if you can't help...</i>
- Candace.

313
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:28,438
<i>Tell me a place, and I will be there.</i>

314
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:36,488
[Ridley] You should be at Rikers
right now, but I held you...

315
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:40,242
because I think you
have something to say.

316
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:42,787
Lawyer.

317
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:46,832
[chuckles] I know your
record, Mr. Alvarez.

318
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,961
Came up in Harlem, rolled around
with Cottonmouth in the late '90s,

319
00:20:51,045 --> 00:20:53,047
spent some time at Spofford, Sing Sing,

320
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,841
then you made it to the
big time, went to Seagate.

321
00:20:56,842 --> 00:20:58,052
[sighs]

322
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,638
Lawyer.

323
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:05,100
Cornell Stokes is dead,
but you're still alive.

324
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:08,728
And I've never seen an
arraignment happen so quickly.

325
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:10,773
Two million dollar bail...

326
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:13,275
and someone paid it in cash.

327
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:16,611
Who's your new sponsor?
Is it Willis Stryker?

328
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,781
Law...

329
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:20,825
yer.

330
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:25,579
You were part of a
hostage situation, Hernan.

331
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:29,541
Even if your lawyer does get you out...

332
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:33,045
you won't be walking away from that.

333
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:36,590
That's multiple kidnapping
and weapons charges.

334
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:40,302
How does 25 years to life
sound to you? Minimum.

335
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,387
Are you serious?

336
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:45,099
Yep.

337
00:21:49,103 --> 00:21:50,354
Okay.

338
00:21:51,605 --> 00:21:52,857
[scoffs]

339
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:55,275
Okay.

340
00:21:56,443 --> 00:21:57,486
[scoffs]

341
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:00,447
I... I was in the club.

342
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,698
[clears throat]

343
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:04,368
I saw what happened.

344
00:22:06,036 --> 00:22:07,662
I know who did it.

345
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:11,541
- Okay.
- [inhales deeply]

346
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:15,462
We can protect you, but
I need a name to verify.

347
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,589
Who was it?

348
00:22:21,051 --> 00:22:22,761
Was it Stryker?

349
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:28,976
He goes by...

350
00:22:31,728 --> 00:22:32,938
lawyer.

351
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,484
You need me to spell it?

352
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,861
[laughing]

353
00:22:42,364 --> 00:22:43,490
[door slams]

354
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:59,798
- You call this safe?
- We're hiding in plain sight.

355
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:03,052
I've got you. For now.

356
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:06,471
Lie to me again, Candace, I walk away
from here, and you are on your own.

357
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:08,807
- It's not bullshit.
- We'll see.

358
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:13,270
How did you even get out of Harlem's
Paradise without being stopped?

359
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:17,024
They were so busy trying to
arrest Luke, I just walked away.

360
00:23:19,944 --> 00:23:21,736
So what is it?

361
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,700
What do you need to tell
me that's so important?

362
00:23:23,738 --> 00:23:24,949
[sighs]

363
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,911
I was at the club the
night Cottonmouth died.

364
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,789
I already know that.

365
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,584
I mean right after.

366
00:23:43,258 --> 00:23:44,801
[sighs]

367
00:23:55,145 --> 00:23:56,188
[beeps]

368
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:01,651
Mariah killed him.

369
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:05,405
[Shades] The trash bag is for
the clothes you're wearing now.

370
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:08,617
Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too.

371
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,995
Someone from Spurlock's
will incinerate them.

372
00:24:12,037 --> 00:24:16,291
The secret to any good lie is it
has to run parallel to the truth.

373
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:19,294
[Misty] <i>How do you know this?</i>

374
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:21,421
[Candace] <i>I heard them talking about it.</i>

375
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:22,672
[Shades] Do what I say.

376
00:24:22,756 --> 00:24:25,759
[Candace] <i>The guy who always</i>
<i>wears sunglasses, he was there.</i>

377
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,681
<i>It was his idea to say Luke
Cage killed Cottonmouth.</i>

378
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:38,147
[grunts]

379
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:42,901
I was so scared.

380
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:45,362
I snuck out of there,
back to the lockers.

381
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:48,282
And, um, I was trying
to calm myself down.

382
00:24:49,908 --> 00:24:51,868
When I went upstairs,
the guy with the glasses

383
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:54,579
offered me $50,000 to tell a story.

384
00:24:56,748 --> 00:24:57,957
So I told one.

385
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:02,754
- Why are you coming clean now?
- 'Cause I can't live with this.

386
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:06,091
Especially after Luke saving my life.

387
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:10,054
If you can guarantee my safety,

388
00:25:10,137 --> 00:25:13,223
I will testify about
everything I just told you.

389
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:17,477
[phone beeps]

390
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:24,984
Mariah scares me more than Cottonmouth.

391
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:31,533
I asked her if she thought Luke did
it, mostly to see if I could trust her.

392
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:34,035
To see if she would tell me the truth.

393
00:25:38,957 --> 00:25:41,793
She looked me right
in my eye and said...

394
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,423
"You never know what
anyone is capable of."

395
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:50,427
[breath trembling] It
was the way she said it.

396
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:54,598
She... she would kill me if
she knew I was speaking to you.

397
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:56,391
I truly believe that.

398
00:25:58,477 --> 00:26:00,061
Thank you for helping me.

399
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:06,110
I'm gonna nail Mariah
Dillard's ass to the wall.

400
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,200
- Who else knows that you're here?
- Just my friend Leslie.

401
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:16,828
Don't call anyone else, not even Leslie.

402
00:26:18,163 --> 00:26:19,763
As a matter of fact, give me your phone.

403
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,376
Come on.

404
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:30,342
Okay. Now, I picked this
up... on the way, just in case.

405
00:26:31,885 --> 00:26:33,845
It's already got my
number programed in there,

406
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:36,556
so if I call or text, you know it's me.

407
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,853
Is your arm okay?

408
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:44,689
[sighs] My trigger finger is just fine.

409
00:26:46,775 --> 00:26:48,693
Come on, let's go.

410
00:26:48,777 --> 00:26:50,862
- Where?
- Soledad's.

411
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:52,281
Her daughter Claire

412
00:26:52,364 --> 00:26:54,741
is the one who treated your
ankle at Harlem's Paradise.

413
00:26:54,824 --> 00:26:55,992
She'll be there, too.

414
00:26:56,993 --> 00:26:58,828
I'm gonna take you there myself.

415
00:27:13,802 --> 00:27:16,388
[Method Man] No lie. Bullets
was flying everywhere and shit.

416
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:21,268
You trying to tell me that
those are bullet holes?

417
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:23,937
Man, Meth, I love you,
but get out of here.

418
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,272
I... I don't believe that.

419
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:28,024
HB, I thought the same thing...

420
00:27:28,107 --> 00:27:32,404
until shorty pulled the
biscuit and let two off on Cage

421
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:34,030
and they bounced off.

422
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:35,699
Bullets ricochetin' and shit.

423
00:27:35,782 --> 00:27:37,542
[stammers] Look, I'm
telling y'all the truth.

424
00:27:37,576 --> 00:27:39,345
I see y'all over there,
y'all don't believe it.

425
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:40,412
Trust me, it's the truth.

426
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:43,332
[stutters] And after he
smacked fire out these dudes,

427
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:46,918
he left the hoodie, told me
and Gomez to call the police.

428
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,296
You know I ain't calling
no po-po. Then he bounced.

429
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:51,756
- Say word.
- Word, Sway. I'm telling you.

430
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,343
He even balled the dude's
gun up like some old homework.

431
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:58,930
But my thing is, though, if he
innocent, so what he running for?

432
00:27:59,848 --> 00:28:02,183
Bulletproof always gonna
come second to being black.

433
00:28:02,267 --> 00:28:05,019
HB, you should know
that. You from Jers. Jers!

434
00:28:05,103 --> 00:28:07,314
Wow! Sound like he
stunted on you right there.

435
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:09,083
He did stunt. It was a
stunt. It was a stunt.

436
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:10,775
- Why you gotta stunt on me?
- [laughs]

437
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:11,901
No, I mean, seriously.

438
00:28:11,985 --> 00:28:15,405
Seriously, though, what I'm just
saying, like, if that was me...

439
00:28:15,489 --> 00:28:17,407
- [Heather B] Right.
- And I was on the run.

440
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,118
- Why even get involved?
- [Sway] Hmm.

441
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:21,245
But he did.

442
00:28:21,995 --> 00:28:25,790
And those dudes was nervous,
so anything could've happened.

443
00:28:25,874 --> 00:28:28,752
As far as I'm concerned,
Luke Cage saved my life, man.

444
00:28:28,835 --> 00:28:30,504
That's what's up, man.

445
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:33,507
You know what, that don't
sound like no cop killer to me.

446
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,133
For real, for real.

447
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:40,305
You know, there's somethin'
powerful about seeing a black man

448
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:43,099
that's bulletproof and unafraid.

449
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,143
- Come on, y'all. You know?
- Yeah, yeah.

450
00:28:45,227 --> 00:28:46,787
[Method Man] Streets
got mad love for Cage.

451
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:50,064
I got mad love for Cage, man,
and... and he one of ours.

452
00:28:50,148 --> 00:28:51,900
Yeah, yeah. But you know what?

453
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:53,693
We got mad love for you, too.

454
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:55,404
- No doubt.
- You one of ours, man.

455
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:57,882
You know, the show's almost
over, man. You gonna spit for us?

456
00:28:57,906 --> 00:29:00,575
- Of course.
- Oh, man! He 'bout to spit!

457

00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:23,635
[man] <i>Yo, I remember when Larry Davis
was on the run back in the day.</i>

511
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:26,054
<i>Cops came at him 'cause
they were just as corrupt,</i>

512
00:31:26,137 --> 00:31:28,056
<i>dangerous and jacked up as he was.</i>

513
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:32,310
<i>I don't think we're getting the full
story on Luke Cage yet, for real.</i>

514
00:31:32,394 --> 00:31:34,396
[Sway] <i>I wouldn't put it
past the government, man.</i>

515
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:37,607
<i>Um, you know, we're gonna be
searching for the answers for you,</i>

516
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:38,983
<i>and once we get the facts,</i>

517
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:41,653
<i>we're gonna put it right here
on Sway's Universe, all right?</i>

518
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:44,322
<i>Thanks for your call, citizen. We
got another person on the line.</i>

519
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:46,658
- [beeps]
- [smooth jazz playing]

520
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:50,579
- [man] Now. Come on!
- [woman] All right.

521
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:52,581
[indistinct shouting]

522
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:55,750
Oh, come on, man. You
know he's not here.

523
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:08,262
I understand playing against the computer,
but, um, how do you beat yourself?

524
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:10,181
Chess is a game of anticipation.

525
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,144
If you know every single possible move,

526
00:32:15,228 --> 00:32:19,023
you can anticipate your adversary's
next move before he does.

527
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:20,149
Oh.

528
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:22,110
That's deep.

529
00:32:22,986 --> 00:32:25,697
If we find out you've been hiding
him, there'll be hell to pay.

530
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,342
Yeah, well, just don't break the
hinges on that door on your way out.

531
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:30,910
I just got it fixed.

532
00:32:58,563 --> 00:33:01,107
[smooth jazz continues on radio]

533
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:09,866
That was a close shave.

534
00:33:10,784 --> 00:33:11,910
Bad pun.

535
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:16,164
What the hell did you
even come back for, man?

536
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,959
[sighs] I had to.

537
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:21,795
For Harlem.

538
00:33:21,878 --> 00:33:24,380
Take care of Diamondback before
he made it bad for everybody.

539
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:27,216
Well, forget Harlem.
Forget your brother!

540
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,012
You're on the road in a brand
new car and a woman that fine?

541
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:33,181
And you're bulletproof.

542
00:33:33,264 --> 00:33:35,600
[scoffs] You'd have never
seen my black ass again.

543
00:33:35,684 --> 00:33:38,269
I'd rob the occasional
bank and never look back.

544
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:39,646
[chuckles]

545
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:45,401
You got every cop in the
city looking for you, brother.

546
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:49,531
Negroes writing Luke
Cage ballads and shit.

547
00:33:51,575 --> 00:33:53,952
So... what's the plan?

548
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:58,832
To box in all the players.

549
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:03,628
Well...

550
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:07,716
Shades is in jail.

551
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:11,094
Mariah's out, but she
ain't exactly on your side.

552
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:12,679
Now you could tail both of 'em,

553
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:16,099
but no telling how long that'll take
for them to lead you to your prey.

554
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:21,771
What about Misty?

555
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:24,482
No, she's got her hands full already.

556
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:26,335
She's trying to clear my
name inside the precinct

557
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,402
and bring me in at the same time.

558
00:34:28,486 --> 00:34:30,614
- We gotta be careful with her.
- [sighs]

559
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,407
That leaves you one other option.

560
00:34:34,576 --> 00:34:36,953
Someone else to find Diamondback.

561
00:34:39,623 --> 00:34:40,665
[softly] Here.

562
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:42,792
Turk.

563
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:46,420
Turk may be a pawn, but he's not dumb.

564
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:48,590
If he thinks he's being
set up, he'll disappear.

565
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:49,924
[dialing]

566
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:52,218
You let me worry about that.

567
00:34:53,762 --> 00:34:55,805
Hey, Turk, it's Bobby.

568
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:59,017
Listen, I might be able to get my
hands on about 30 pairs of Jordans.

569
00:35:00,018 --> 00:35:02,228
They're the vintage Air Jordan 5s.

570
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:05,481
Let's just say they fell
off the back of a truck.

571
00:35:06,608 --> 00:35:08,067
Okay, when?

572
00:35:17,744 --> 00:35:18,828
Who's this?

573
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,998
First name Law, last name Yer.

574
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:27,003
Must be pretty damn connected to get
a lawyer and not even know who she is.

575
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:28,963
Membership has its privileges.

576
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:32,425
[indistinct chatter]

577
00:35:36,763 --> 00:35:38,472
He sprung you?

578
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:42,977
You think this is funny, don't you?

579
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,230
You got this all figured out, huh?

580
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:49,233
No...

581
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:51,903
actually, I don't.

582
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:23,226
When did Diamondback bring in new hires?

583
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:25,937
Well, after the club, he
had to change things up.

584
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,939
Recruit some new faces.

585
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:41,619
I bet while you were inside,

586
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:44,247
cops tried to do some
recruiting of their own.

587
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,209
Don't ever question my loyalty.

588
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:09,981
- The man upstairs?
- [scoffs]

589
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:12,525
You are just full of questions.

590
00:37:13,818 --> 00:37:15,111
Matter of fact...

591
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:16,821
[groans]

592
00:37:20,033 --> 00:37:21,409
[straining]

593
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:22,827
[thudding]

594
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:38,092
[grunting]

595
00:37:41,137 --> 00:37:42,638
[Shades gasping]

596
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,780
[gunshot]

597
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:01,950
[panting]

598
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,496
[laughs]

599
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:10,333
Let's go to the penthouse.

600
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:15,213
[groans]

601
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:17,506
[breathing heavily]

602
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,182
- [door slams]
- [breath trembling]

603
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:29,268
I was just following orders!

604
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:38,777
You're a goddamn puppet.

605
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:41,155
Who gave you the order?

606
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,532
[grunts]

607
00:38:47,328 --> 00:38:48,746
- Who?
- [grunts]

608
00:38:50,874 --> 00:38:52,500
Diamondback!

609
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:57,296
You stopped playing your
position. Asked too many questions.

610
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,883
Diamondback said you
needed to be dealt with.

611
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,471
Romeo would be ashamed of you.

612
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:06,890
[Zip laughing]

613
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:09,558
You're such a disappointment.

614
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:12,478
You're the second person
who told me that today.

615
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:16,149
I'm my own man, Shades.

616
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:20,819
Tell him yourself.

617
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,047
[chuckles]

618
00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:50,016
Nice.

619
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:58,482
[sighs] Sorry, Romeo... He had to go.

620
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:01,319
[sirens wailing in the distance]

621
00:40:03,821 --> 00:40:06,782
It's a good thing her friend
Leslie knew where she was.

622
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:08,993
- I'm glad you found the park.
- Mmm-hmm.

623
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:10,328
So where is she now?

624
00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:13,915
She left with Detective Knight.
Traffic got thick and I lost them.

625
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:16,084
I'm sorry. I'm not used to
doing anything like this.

626
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:17,418
We'll find her again.

627
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:20,338
Just knowing that she
can't be trusted is helpful.

628
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,299
You did a good job, Alex.

629
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:25,093
Hey, you're my rock!

630
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,180
Later.

631
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:31,057
[cell phone ringing]

632
00:40:43,236 --> 00:40:44,862
What do you want?

633
00:40:44,946 --> 00:40:47,781
[Stryker] <i>That's no way to
speak to a business partner.</i>

634
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:50,409
After what you did to my club,

635
00:40:50,493 --> 00:40:52,620
do you really think I'm
gonna shuck and jive with you?

636
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:55,331
<i>You might wanna check your attitude.</i>

637
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:59,293
<i>If you're not of any use to me,
then you're not useful to anyone.</i>

638
00:40:59,377 --> 00:41:03,131
<i>Shades would tell you,
if he was still alive.</i>

639
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,759
What the hell are you talking about?

640
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:08,802
<i>I had to let him go.</i>

641
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:13,641
<i>So now, I'm giving you the chance
to tell me where you stand.</i>

642
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:17,811
<i>I've taken Shades and Damon Boone
off the table so you can grow.</i>

643
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:20,064
<i>I'd hate for us to part, too.</i>

644
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:24,318
I wasn't particularly fond of Shades...

645
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:30,074
and the death of Damon
Boone, although unnecessary,

646
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:31,950
was appreciated.

647
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:38,291
But you need to know this.
I'm out of the political game.

648
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:42,878
I'm focusing on Harlem's
Paradise. Using it for a...

649
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:47,633
a power base for community relations.

650
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,386
That's a smart move.

651
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:52,263
But you've made some dumb ones also.

652
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:56,017
You should never talk about
murder on an open line.

653
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:03,857
Open it.

654
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:22,751
Seed money... for your New
Harlem Renaissance project

655
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:24,712
and refurbishing the club.

656
00:42:25,713 --> 00:42:27,173
My apologies.

657
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:34,055
It's a very generous donation...
but nothing in this world is free.

658
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:35,514
You're right.

659
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,062
My only condition is loyalty.

660
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,024
Stick with me and Harlem will
be remade in your own image.

661
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:49,320
We'll be doing this for years to come.

662
00:42:51,114 --> 00:42:53,241
Harlem is already in my image.

663
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,329
You staying?

664
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:01,749
Once I'm finished with
Carl, I'll evaporate.

665
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,460
But don't worry.

666
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:08,131
You'll still feel the
occasional cool breeze.

667
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:12,718
Sweet dreams, Mariah.

668
00:43:18,391 --> 00:43:19,433
[door opens]

669
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:20,851
[sighs]

670
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:21,977
[door closes]

671
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:44,417
- [thudding]
- [Turk gasps]

672
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,377
- You ratted out Chico.
- [breathing heavily]

673
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,045
You got Pop killed.

674
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:50,173
Man, the writing was on the wall.

675
00:43:50,256 --> 00:43:53,592
Somebody would have seen
him. Might as well be me.

676
00:43:53,676 --> 00:43:56,470
How was I supposed to know Tone
was gonna shoot up the shop?

677
00:43:56,554 --> 00:44:00,308
Whole damn world know Pop's
was Switzerland. Forever.

678
00:44:00,391 --> 00:44:01,600
I should crush you.

679
00:44:01,684 --> 00:44:04,853
[chuckles] You won't,
though. You need me.

680
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:06,480
[inhales sharply] Where's Diamondback?

681
00:44:07,398 --> 00:44:09,608
I don't know... [screaming]

682
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:12,778
What the... [yelps]

683
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:17,115
- Hey!
- You still stalling?

684
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:21,078
[Turk whimpering]

685
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:23,706
All right! All right!

686
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:26,209
He's at a warehouse by the Harlem River.

687
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:28,126
Near 145th, all right?

688
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:33,757
I gave you what you
wanted! Now let me out!

689
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:35,968
Sit tight, Mr. Barrett.

690
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:37,970
Trash pickup is tomorrow.

691
00:44:38,053 --> 00:44:41,474
You can breathe just fine.
There's food in there, too.

692
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:44,893
[banging]

693
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,313
You can't leave me in here!

694
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:50,107
There's baby diapers in here, man!

695
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:52,067
Hey!

696
00:44:52,985 --> 00:44:55,153
Come on!

697
00:44:55,238 --> 00:44:56,614
[door opening]

698
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,372
[door slams]

699
00:45:22,348 --> 00:45:24,308
[Domingo] Looks like you downgraded.

700
00:45:25,268 --> 00:45:27,060
I liked the club better.

701
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:30,648
I'm a man who needs his space.

702
00:45:32,275 --> 00:45:34,192
Space is a good thing.

703
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:37,464
- Especially when you come to kill a man.
- [guns cocking]

704
00:45:37,488 --> 00:45:38,656
Whoa, whoa.

705
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,077
[guns cocking]

706
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:52,085
Someone did your boy
Zip and his two homies.

707
00:45:52,169 --> 00:45:54,672
That's not Cage's style...

708
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:58,091
so I'm guessing Shades didn't
appreciate you bailing him out.

709
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:09,520
You know when a rattlesnake is
at its most dangerous, Domingo?

710
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,399
When it's cornered.

711
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:42,428
I'm gonna rip your head off!

712
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:48,183
[groans]

713
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:05,826
[gunshots continue]

714
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,041
- [whirring]
- [chuckles]

715
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,547
"And behold a pale horse...

716
00:47:19,507 --> 00:47:23,469
and he that sat upon
him, his name was Death."

717
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:34,104
[exhales]

718
00:47:34,187 --> 00:47:35,313
[sniffs]

719
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:14,061
You really need a security system.

720
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:19,066
- You waiting for me?
- No.

721
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:22,903
I bet he told you I was dead.

722
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:27,199
Diamondback got to you, didn't he?

723
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:29,409
No, he didn't.

724
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:31,454
[scoffs]

725
00:48:34,457 --> 00:48:37,209
What are you doing with
a gun? It's not you.

726
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:38,544
Shut up.

727
00:48:40,713 --> 00:48:41,880
[sighs]

728
00:48:43,048 --> 00:48:44,800
I have something for you.

729
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:51,389
Figured...

730
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,269
you'd want this.

731
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,694
Your prints... Cornell's blood.

732
00:49:11,368 --> 00:49:13,871
Then you'll have nothing
to blackmail me with.

733
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:16,206
I don't need it.

734
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:18,876
We're in this together now.

735
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:23,046
[bottle thuds]

736
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:27,134
You and I have come a long way.

737
00:49:28,636 --> 00:49:33,348
You know, sometimes you have to reach
across the aisle to get things done.

738
00:49:35,433 --> 00:49:37,394
You're talking about Luke Cage?

739
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:42,315
It's incredible... how
much you and I think alike.

740
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,819
We're at war.

741
00:49:46,779 --> 00:49:50,824
And right now, the enemy
of my enemy is my friend.

742
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,579
Maybe. But it might not take.

743
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,166
You did beat his ass
and give him his powers.

744
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:00,876
- Mmm-hmm.
- And...

745
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:05,172
Cornell's flunky killed Pop. You
think he really is gonna jump?

746
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:06,757
Just jump on our bandwagon?

747
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,801
Absolutely.

748
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:12,304
'Cause we have something that
he wants more than anything.

749
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:16,975
His old life.

750
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,979
A chance to clear his name. Right here.

751
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:28,904
If we send Luke after Diamondback
and they kill each other...

752
00:50:29,947 --> 00:50:31,740
all of our problems are swept away.

753
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:33,533
- [exhales]
- No matter who wins.

754
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:36,411
[chuckles] Even better.

755
00:51:34,177 --> 00:51:35,721
[Domingo groaning]

756
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:43,771
I should've known you'd
turn up. [breathing heavily]

757
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:46,649
What the hell happened here?

758
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:50,068
Diamondback.

759
00:51:50,152 --> 00:51:51,444
[groaning]

760
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:53,864
[faint beeping in distance]

761
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:08,211
[beeping continues]

762
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,894
Sweet sister.

763
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:25,688
[beeping continues]

764
00:52:42,537 --> 00:52:44,915
[Luke panting] Slow.

765
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:47,710
Take it easy.

766
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,880
What did he use?

767
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:54,049
How did Diamondback do that?

768
00:52:55,592 --> 00:52:57,886
[breathing heavily] Something
I've never seen before.

769
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,972
[siren wailing in the distance]

770
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:02,140
Even you can't stop him.

771
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:06,353
[exhales softly]

772
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:20,242
These just came in.

773
00:53:21,284 --> 00:53:24,496
- [sighs] Elephant punches all over again.
- Mmm-hmm.

774
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:25,705
That's gotta be Cage, right?

775
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:27,540
[cell phone ringing]

776
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:35,340
- Hello?
- [Luke] <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

777
00:53:35,423 --> 00:53:38,010
<i>You guys find Domingo?</i>

778
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:39,928
- Yeah.
<i>- Meet me.</i>

779
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:41,221
Where?

780
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,497
Should I thank you for this?

781
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:10,625
All credit goes to Diamondback.

782
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:13,378
I don't suppose we'll find his body.

783
00:54:13,461 --> 00:54:16,673
We found Zip's, though, and two
other thugs in an old building.

784
00:54:16,756 --> 00:54:19,509
Shot up. Right after they
picked up your other boy.

785
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:21,761
Shades.

786
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:25,682
Don't you ever get tired
of people getting out?

787
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:27,684
Yes.

788
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:33,648
Look, it's not safe for you to be
here. If you don't find Diamondback...

789
00:54:33,731 --> 00:54:36,609
Then he wins, and my life
is forever a living hell.

790
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:40,864
Is there anything I can do?

791
00:54:41,781 --> 00:54:43,450
See what else Turk knows.

792
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:45,994
He's in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd.

793
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:48,288
Near Mount Olivet and the shop.

794
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:51,166
A Dumpster?

795
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:58,340
[sighs]

796
00:55:05,848 --> 00:55:08,516
Even if we handle Diamondback...

797
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,104
he's not gonna forgive us for
framing him for Cornell's death.

798
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:14,731
We could hurdle that easy.

799
00:55:15,815 --> 00:55:18,193
The only people who know what
really happened in the club

800
00:55:18,276 --> 00:55:20,070
are you and me.

801
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:25,909
I'll regret that night
for the rest of my life.

802
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:28,495
You did what you had to do.

803
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:30,622
You shouldn't regret that.

804
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:36,253
What were you even doing
at the club that night?

805
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:43,218
I was going there to kill him.

806
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:46,679
You beat me to it.

807
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:54,354
Cornell never needed my political money.

808
00:55:55,272 --> 00:55:57,607
And he was never going to pay it back.

809
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:03,613
He just wanted me in all the way.

810
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:06,074
So what are you saying?

811
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:15,167
He saw things in me... that
I avoided my whole life.

812
00:56:18,461 --> 00:56:23,175
Now I am becoming that
person he always saw...

813
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:27,845
and I always denied.

814
00:56:32,725 --> 00:56:34,061
You ready?

815
00:56:35,853 --> 00:56:37,564
I stay ready, baby.

816
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,675
I should've kept my coat
on. Hell just froze over.

817
00:57:05,758 --> 00:57:06,801
[door closes]

818
00:57:06,884 --> 00:57:09,972
- Where's Luke Cage?
- I'm right here.

819
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:13,600
- We have a problem.
- So do I.

820
00:57:13,683 --> 00:57:16,937
I can't decide which one of
you I'm gonna knock out first.

821
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,814
- Where's Diamondback?
- I don't know.

822
00:57:19,897 --> 00:57:23,026
The parley between the three
of us is more important.

823
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,112
You have the nerve to use that term?

824
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:27,322
Right here? Where Pop died?

825
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,950
Cough up Diamondback's location,

826
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:32,160
or I'll stomp you like
we were back at Seagate.

827
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:33,870
Luke, be cool, brother.

828
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:37,207
Whoa, whoa. No one
needs to stomp anyone.

829
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:40,085
Pops made this place
Switzerland for a reason.

830
00:57:40,168 --> 00:57:42,504
Cage, we have a mutual enemy,

831
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:45,632
and the only way to bring him down
is for us all to come together.

832
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:47,842
There's no way I'm helping you.

833
00:57:47,925 --> 00:57:50,512
We came to offer you a truce.

834
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:53,765
In exchange for helping
you find Diamondback,

835
00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:55,350
you drop your beef with us.

836
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:57,560
You both framed me for murder.

837
00:57:57,644 --> 00:58:00,397
There's nothing you can offer me
that's going to make me let that go.

838
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,525
Uh... how about your freedom?

839
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:07,862
Right here is everything you need

840
00:58:07,945 --> 00:58:10,907
to prove that Diamondback
framed Carl Lucas.

841
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:24,046
Even if Carl Lucas is exonerated...

842
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:27,049
Luke Cage is now wanted for
the murder of Cottonmouth.

843
00:58:27,132 --> 00:58:28,966
I'll tell them the truth.

844
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:32,429
Diamondback killed
Cornell and Damon Boone.

845
00:58:32,512 --> 00:58:34,056
You'll go free.

846
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:37,934
What the hell is this?

847
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:41,646
Mariah Dillard, you're under arrest
for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

848
00:58:41,729 --> 00:58:43,416
I thought you said you
were going after Turk?

849
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,126
[Misty] I've been tracking
you since you called.

850
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,444
I wasn't going to let
you just ghost me again.

851
00:58:47,527 --> 00:58:51,156
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Shades, back off!

852
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:54,034
Misty, stand down.
We're working this out.

853
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:55,785
Oh, so you workin' with them now?

854
00:58:55,868 --> 00:58:58,580
- He knows where Diamondback is.
- I didn't say that.

855
00:58:58,663 --> 00:59:02,125
Well, whatever you know, Hernan, you
should share it with the whole class.

856
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:04,086
I ain't telling you shit.

857
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:08,173
Grenade!

858
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:10,217
[screaming]

859
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:16,764

What type of Jean Paul
Gaultier shit is this?

What are you, a pimp stormtrooper?

No, I'm the angel of death.
