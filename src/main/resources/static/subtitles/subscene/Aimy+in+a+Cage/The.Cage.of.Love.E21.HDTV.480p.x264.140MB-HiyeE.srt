00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,350
If Wu Hong Da is dead,

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,980
the hidden place for the secret formula will be gone.

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,770
<i> In addiction to your workshop, as well as equipment,</i>

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,370
<i>is there something like...erm...</i>

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,890
<i>a secret formula?</i>

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,090
<i>That's right.</i>

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,450
<i>On the morning of Old Master's incident, I saw him take out a piece of paper from his safe and keep it with him.</i>

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,030
<i>I think it was that secret formula.</i>

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,340
<i>If I were Master Jiang, I would definitely find Wu Hong Da for the secret formula</i>

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,140
<i>but I'm afraid Wu Hong Da won't give it to him that easily.</i>

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,330
<i>Wu Hong Da is dead.</i>

14
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,760
<i>The secret formula may have been lost.</i>

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,980
Brother Shao Tian. I have decided to work at Rong Da.

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,880
But I want to find the secret formula too and the proof that Jiang Yu is the killer.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,030
Just like what you said,

18
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,170
if Jiang Yu did it,

19
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,950
I will leave it to the police to take care of it.

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,680
But if it's not him,

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,740
I will sever all ties with him.

22
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,970
Fine.

23
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,760
I will definitely help you.

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,350
Headline!

25
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,600
Cao Kun was elected the fifth president of the Republic of China.

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,710
There will be an extravagant celebration showing off the best made silk fabrics.

27
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,940
Headline!

28
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,360
Headline!

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,760
Kiddo, give me one.

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,680
Here.

31
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,920
Mr. Zhang, on behalf of the president, we welcome you to our office.

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,080
Your first stop was at Ling Long. We are very grateful.

33
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,360
Now that the president has taken office,

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,160
he is in need of a lot of silk.

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,980
I heard that the silk at Huzhou is second to none.

36
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,830
Your Ling Long also has a hundred year old history in Huzhou.

37
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,780
Hence, I came here especially to visit you.

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,780
It's just that I didn't know there was a change of ownership.

39
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,380
The owner may have changed but the product is still superior.

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,990
Is that so?

41
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:52,960
Looking at how confident you are, I can be reassured.

42
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,000
But...

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,570
President Cao is not an ordinary person.

44
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:07,470
Don't worry. Our products are not ordinary products.

45
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,900
Mr Zhang. Let me show you around the factory.

46
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,400
Okay.

47
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:35,890
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

48
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,610
Hello, General Manager Zhou.

49
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,120
Cai Hong. Why are you making yourself suffer? I didn't let you come here to do such tasks.

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,100
I just knew you would be like this.

51
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,310
Give me some time.

52
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,850
I will get back everything for you here.

53
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,800
We will live happily just like in the past.

54
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,370
Previously I watched casually.

55
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:15,420
It was my father who created this palace <i>success</i>.

56
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,880
I did not know he would one day collapse.

57
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,600
But now, I can use my own hands

58
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,280
to work honestly.

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,800
This is also another kind of happiness.

60
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,340
It has been hard on you.

61
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,730
By the way,

62
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,230
since the President has come into office, he has come to Huzhou to buy silk.

63
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,650
Of course, everyone is talking about this.

64
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:52,020
I heard that he has gone to Ling Long. I was thinking, should't Rong Da compete with him?

65
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,070
Of course, we should.

66
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,720
Furthermore, I think this is the best opportunity for Jiang Yu to use his secret formula.

67
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,530
What has this to do with Mr Zhang?

68
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,340
- A silk contest.
- What?

69
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,980
Let's have a silk contest.

70
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,010
Silk contest?

71
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,690
For the presidential celebration let's hold a silk competition

72
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,390
to choose the best silk in Huzhou.

73
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,900
You and I know the implication of the silk contest.

74
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,360
The party who loses will have to withdraw from the dyeing industry in Huzhou.

75
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,690
We can use this as contest. As long as Jiang Yu is willing to take part,

76
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,570
he will have to use his secret formula.

77
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,330
As long as he uses the secret formula,

78
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,290
he won't be able to disassociate himself from my father's death.

79
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,710
But this is just my own views.

80
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,980
I can't let Rong Da take on such a big risk.

81
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,100
If we lose, we will have to withdraw from this industry in Huzhou.

82
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,050
My Rong Da is also your Rong Da. Miss Lu has given me free rein.

83
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:55,010
After all, Rong Da is exquisite and has potential. Ling Long will have to leave the community. It'll be one less rival.

84
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,600
I can tell that you are determined to get the proof of your father's killer.

85
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,280
I'm very happy that you are willing to trust me.

86
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,210
I would also like to help you find the evidence that I didn't misjudge Jiang Yu.

87
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,040
- But what if Rong Da loses...
- There are not buts.

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,850
Cai Hong. You should know very well how my skills are. I won't lose to Ling Long.

89
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,500
We can force the secret formula out from Jiang Yu.

90
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,930
Okay. Even if we bring up the silk contest,

91
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,960
Jiang Yu is such a sly person. He won't take the bait so easily.

92
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,590
Unless Miss Lu is willing to help us fully.

93
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,500
Let's go and see her now.

94
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,600
Silk contest?

95
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,950
This is a good idea.

96
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,110
I also wanted to know who is better. Rong Da or Ling Long.

97
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,930
But the risk is extremely high.

98
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,150
The loser will have to withdraw from the industry in Huzhou.

99
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,580
Even more so, I don't want to drag Rong Da down because of this.

100
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,380
This is not a problem. It's more important to find the killer of your father.

101
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,120
Don't worry. I will definitely help you with this.

102
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,960
To add further, don't you trust Mr Zhou?

103
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,230
Miss Lu, I would like to thank you first.

104
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,850
Don't thank me. I didn't really help you much.

105
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,620
By agreeing to the silk contest, you have already helped me a lot.

106
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,910
Brother Shao Tian. I will go back first and notify the reporters

107
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,020
and tell them to go to Ling Long.

108
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,120
Thank you for just now.

109
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,170
What is there to thank me for? Stop pretending to be clueless.

110
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,960
Rong Da is not my company, it's yours.

111
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,740
As for me, I'm only just acting along with you.

112
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,040
I'm thanking you for playing along with me.

113
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,780
Frankly, there is something I don't understand.

114
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,330
Tell me.

115
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,680
With your talent, you can work anywhere where people are considered top.

116
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,740
What is the secret charm of Miss Wu?

117
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,620
Unless you'd rather be King Zhou in a war drama saving your princess.

118
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,720
It's not that complicated. Cai Hong only wants to find out her father's killer.

119
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,030
I'm only doing my best to help her.

120
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,620
As long as I can fulfill her wish,

121
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,550
I will be satisfied.

122
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,920
<i>Zhou Shao Tian is clearly an amazing person.</i>

123
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,730
<i>Actually, he's a major fool.</i>

124
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,750
<i>As long as I use his weakness for Wu Cai Hong, I will be able to control him.</i>

125
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,950
<i>Yet would a woman want such a fool like him?</i>

126
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,390
<i>What a pity that not everyone is just Wu Cai Hong.</i>

127
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:16,000
Be careful.

128
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:24,070
You said you are a very shrewd woman, yet you seem to be envious of others.

129
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:31,320
My shrewdness was forced, so I have no choice but to be shrewd.

130
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,720
But if there is someone to rely on, which woman wouldn't want to be a princess

131
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,050
and be protected?

132
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,530
Not bad. Ling's Long's silk is beyond comparison.

133
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,960
With this, the President will be satisfied.

134
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,570
I think I don't need to visit the other companies.

135
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,230
Congratulations, Mr Jiang.

136
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:09,280
The people of the President will take an extreme fancy to your product. You have really good luck.

137
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,100
At the same time, it's also great advertisement for Ling Long.

138
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,020
What you said is extremely right.

139
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,960
I am also extremaly grateful to you, Mr Zhang, for giving us this opportunity.

140
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,150
Let's do this.

141
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:26,740
If you are not in a rush, why don't you stay a few more days in Huzhou and let me show you around.

142
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,020
Fine.

143
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,370
Welcome Mr Zhang to Huzhou.

144
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,830
Mr Zhang, please look over here.

145
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,520
I heard that President Hang came to our area to buy silk,

146
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,810
but you only visited Ling Long.

147
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,420
It seems like there is only one dyeing factory in Huzhou and that is Ling Long.

148
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,110
I say, Governor Liu,

149
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:55,980
by making this arrangement, you are making the other dyeing factory envious and not be of service.

150
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,190
It's like this. I brought Mr Zhang to Ling Long dyeing factory

151
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,900
because Ling Long is our long standing dyeing factory.

152
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,000
I didn't intentionally want to be biased.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,300
How may I address you?

154
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,300
Let me do the introductions. This is Miss Lu Man, the boss of Rong Da.

155
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,570
She is also a good friend of the Military Governor.

156
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,530
Miss Lu.

157
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,360
Nice to meet you.

158
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,050
Let me do the introductions too.

159
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,430
She is the daughter of Huzhou's biggest dyeing factory, Boss Wu Hong Da,

160
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,770
Wu Cai Hong.

161
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:40,740
So this is Miss Wu. I still remember your father was very famous in the capital.

162
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,960
It's such a pity.

163
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,110
Miss Wu. Shouldn't you be working at Ling Long?

164
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,190
I'm working with Miss Lu now.

165
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,020
Rong Da?

166
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:57,230
Yes. Zhou Shao Tian is our General Manager at Rong Da. He was also my father's most capable man.

167
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,230
Moreover, our goods are very cheap.

168
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,140
Mr Zhang. Why didn't you consider us too?

169
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,060
What are you trying to do? You even come here to steal our business.

170
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,420
Isn't this too much?

171
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,900
Fei Fei.

172
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:20,720
Dear reporter friends, Mr Zhang's came to buy the finest silk in our area.

173
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,090
It's a blessing to Huzhou.

174
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:27,960
Our company also wants to participate in this event.

175
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,590
Is there anything wrong in this?

176
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,590
<i>There is nothing wrong.</i>

177
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,650
Mr Zhang, since you have come here to buy the finest silk,

178
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,940
the procurement of goods should be preferential.

179
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,350
Don't you think I'm right?

180
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,060
It's logical.

181
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,870
Ling Long is the biggest dyeing factory in Huzhou and it has also been established for a hundred years.

182
00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:00,150
Our Rong Da might be just a beginner, but I do not want to lose such a good opportunity to offer the President our goods as well.

183
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,970
Thus, I would like to invite the reporters to be our witness.

184
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,170
We want to compete openly and fairly with Ling Long.

185
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,220
Compete opening and fairly with Ling Long?

186
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,940
What should we compete in?

187
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,040
Silk contest.

188
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,780
The seniors in Huzhou know that any dyeing factory

189
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,730
can compete with each other.

190
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,750
The losing party will lose the business

191
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,930
and withdraw from the industry.

192
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,880
But I wonder if the other party is willing.

193
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,920
Do you really want to use this method?

194
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,770
If we don't use this method, how would we know

195
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,310
how could we know who has the best silk in Huzhou?

196
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,420
Fine. In front of all the reporters now,

197
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,420
I challenge Ling Long to a contest. If Rong Da loses,

198
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,060
we will withdraw forever from the Huzhou dyeing industry.

199
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,810
Mr Jiang. Do you dare to accept our challenge?

200
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,420
Miss Lu is a true heroine.

201
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,170
Ling Long will accept the challenge.

202
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:43,310
Okay. If Ling Long wouldn't show this courage,

203
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,960
how could it maintain its old name and fame, huh?

204
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,560
<i>Silk contest? I have heard of it but have never seen it.</i>

205
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,980
- Are you okay?
<i>- We have never seen or heard of this.</i>

206
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,390
<i>This is something we haven't seen for a long time.</i>

207
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:11,940
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

208
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Brother. Wu Cai Hong has gone overboard.

209
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,960
She chose to go against us.

210
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,490
Brother. Why did you accept Rong Da's challenge for a silk contest that easily?

211
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,330
They definately have bad intentions.

212
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,060
I know.

213
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,050
They are using this to go against Ling Long.

214
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,430
Lu Man is an outsider. How could she possibly know about the silk contest?

215
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,320
Wu Cai Hong must be behind this.

216
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,370
And that Zhou Shao Tian, what the devil is he up to?

217
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,630
He even got the reporters there to stir the fire and gave us no chance to back out.

218
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,030
Enough. I already know this.

219
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,460
Are you okay?

220
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,150
What could happen to me?

221
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,690
Brother. You are not cold towards Wu Cai Hong.

222
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:15,020
She is going against you by doing this. I'm afraid that you won't come to your senses and would feel hurt.

223
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,880
Why would I think of that?

224
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,740
Ever since her father caused the death of my father,

225
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,030
we have both decided to be mere acquaintances.

226
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,900
It's good that you think this way.

227
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,440
Brother. You must win the silk contest.

228
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,520
Miss Lu said that if you lose, you will withdraw from Huzhou.

229
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,490
She is just an outsider. If she loses, she loses

230
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,010
and can just leave but we can't lose.

231
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,930
The brand of Ling Long is due to father's blood, sweat and tears.

232
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,270
I have my own solution.

233
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,890
Enough, go back to work.

234
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,760
I would like to be alone.

235
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,780
Okay, I'm going out first.

236
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,070
<i>Jiang Yu. Why did you do this?</i>

237
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,330
<i>Why did you do this?</i>

238
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,940
<i>Why did you kill my father?</i>

239
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,600
<i>Why? It's fine if you take revenge on me</i>

240
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,350
<i>but why did you do that?</i>

241
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,170
<i>I hate you. Return my father to me.</i>

242
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,240
<i>Return my father to me.</i>

243
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,890
<i>Jiang Yu, I hate you!</i>

244
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Miss Lu is great.

245
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,450
You forced Jiang Yu into a corner

246
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,420
and obediently agreed to accept our silk contest.

247
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,470
I have already set the stage for you.

248
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,990
How we force him to use his secret formula will depend on you.

249
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,960
I have only one motive. Get the secret formula for me.

250
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,670
I will do my best.

251
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,330
I never imagined that Wu Cai Hong could think of such a cruel tactic

252
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,870
to let him take out the secret formula and leave the industry.

253
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,950
Beautiful.

254
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,320
But our security pledge is too big.

255
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,880
We have pledged everything.

256
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,860
Do I help you with this before the contest?

257
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,360
Thanks.

258
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,790
I was fifteen years old when I joined Ling Long. Just like then, I followed my teachers

259
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,080
and learned how to dye. If I didn't even have confidence in this,

260
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,230
Wu Hong Da wouldn't have kept me by his side as his right hand man.

261
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,320
Don't worry. I will use the fairest methods

262
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,870
to force Jiang Yu to take out his secret formula and lose badly.

263
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,240
Fine. Even though I didn't personally fund Rong Da

264
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,760
but since I have shares in it, even if we can't get the secret formula, we can't lose.

265
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,880
If we won't be able to quadruple our profit,

266
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,590
my own name will be on stake.

267
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,060
Don't you live up to the trust I have in you?

268
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,600
But of course.

269
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,760
<i>It can't be that your father shouldn't die?</i>

270
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,760
<i>He did so many unethical things.</i>

271
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,060
<i>Even death is too good for such person.</i>

272
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,740
What do you want now?

273
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,900
I know that you don't want to see me here.

274
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,760
I didn't want to come here either.

275
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,770
I only wanted to tell you to come to discuss the rules for the contest at Drunken Fairy restaurant tomorrow.

276
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,010
There are so many people at Rong Da. Why did they send you instead?

277
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,220
I already said what I needed to say.

278
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:03,310
You forced Ling Long and Rong Da into a situation which we both can't back out from.

279
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,990
Do you think I don't know what you are trying to do?

280
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,910
I'm going to kick you out of Huzhou.

281
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,320
Twelve years ago, your father kicked us out of Huzhou.

282
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,030
This time,

283
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,430
don't even dream about it.

284
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,360
Brother Shao Tian. I would like discuss the rules for the contest with Ling Ling tomorrow.

285
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,840
What's wrong, Cai Hong? Did something happen?

286
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,840
Why do you look so bad today?

287
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,920
It's nothing.

288
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,750
I only just want to find my father's killer as soon as possible.

289
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,320
Don't worry. I will do the preparations immediately.

290
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,890
Headline. Rong Da competes with Ling Long.

291
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,500
- Headline.
- Give me one.

292
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,330
Headline. Rong Da competes with Ling Long.

293
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,450
Wait.

294
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,630
You want a newspaper too?

295
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,060
Give me one too.

296
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,350
Here.

297
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,840
I can't read. Could you read it to me?

298
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,320
Look. Ling Long is going to compete with Rong Da in a silk contest.

299
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,250
The rule is that the loser will withdraw from the dyeing industry.

300
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,910
Madam. Go back and read it slowly.

301
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,730
Headline!

302
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,910
Everyone is talking in the street that you and Ling Long are having a silk contest. What is going on?

303
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,810
This doesn't seem to concern you.

304
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,310
Miss Wu is already back.

305
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,690
Why do you still want to pressure Jiang Yu

306
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,960
especially when the Jiang family was our saviour?

307
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,760
Old Master Jiang helped us. It was his business.

308
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,950
Jiang Yu stepped over our heads everywhere. I was even framed for murder.

309
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,020
I need to prove my innocence.

310
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,090
I know that you are innocent. You don't need to prove anything.

311
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,670
I'm doing this to prove my innocence to Cai Hong.

312
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,820
Mom, take your medicine.

313
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,640
Why haven't I seen Cai Hong for the past few days?

314
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,400
Where did she go?

315
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,110
Did something happen to her family?

316
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,080
She and her friend started a factory recently.

317
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,210
Now that she has money, I sold her contract.

318
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,380
So to say, she's going to marry someone?

319
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,830
She won't be back anymore?

320
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,890
She won't be back again.

321
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,350
Cai Hong, seriously.

322
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:27,410
She left without telling me first.

323
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,820
It's such a pity.

324
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,830
Frankly, I have an affinity to her.

325
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,280
If you don't find it funny,

326
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,020
I wanted to marry her off to you.

327
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,220
Everyone must have already heard.

328
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,880
The silk contest is in three days.

329
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,330
This is an opportunity.

330
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:02,360
We must use our best flowers to create the best silk

331
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:08,520
We must show off Rong Da's great product.

332
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:14,130
But don't worry. We will redouble your wages for your hard work.

333
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,810
All right?

334
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,370
The dyes are here.

335
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,070
Your hands are stained.

336
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,980
I'm going to wash them now.

337
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,670
Pull it up.

338
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,890
So beautiful.

339
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,590
That's great.

340
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,710
So beautiful.

341
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,930
Brother, are you tired? Let me wipe off your sweat.

342
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,520
No need.

343
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,170
Hold this properly.

344
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,730
- How could you suddenly change?
- My bet is on Rong Da.

345
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,160
- Rong Da!
- Ling Long!

346
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,520
My bet is on Ling Long.

347
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,020
Come.

348
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,590
It's a rare sight.

349
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,700
Okay, thanks.

350
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,030
It has been a long time since we saw such a major silk contest.

351
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:33,310
So many people! Were it not for the President wanting to buy silk, we would not have such treat.

352
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,400
Hurry up.

353
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,350
Let me through.

354
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,040
The bet is not small. Rong Da.

355
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,060
I want to bet on Rong Da. Rong Da looks good. Although I have not won at the auction before,

356
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,650
I won't be wrong this time.

357
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,320
Come. Do you have any money?

358
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,340
My bet is for ten dollars.

359
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,080
I'm betting on this. Thanks.

360
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,820
Bet on Rong Da.

361
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,780
Second Miss. Madam Wu.

362
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,360
Madam Wu.

363
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,050
You also...

364
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,290
Madam Wu. You look extremely good today.

365
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:12,510
Is that so? How about Shao Tian today?

366
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,750
He is also extremely good.

367
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,530
That's great too. I bet with quite a big sum.

368
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,790
Mom. Do you only know about money

369
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,880
and others?

370
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,870
Second Miss is right.

371
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,480
What did you say? My daughter and I are talking. How dare you butt in?

372
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,270
Tell me where to go now.

373
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,310
When you go through the door, it's on the right...

374
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,570
What did you say? How could we hear you if you cover your mouth?

375
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,920
Where is it?

376
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,090
Once you enter the door, keep walking to the right

377
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,380
and you will see the stage. Next to it is Rong Da's seat.

378
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,070
You can just sit over there.

379
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,070
Where is it? Take us there.

380
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,120
I can't do that. I'm waiting for Miss Lu Man. She will be here soon.

381
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,140
Okay, let's go then.

382
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,470
Madam Wu, take care.

383
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,530
Brother Ma Li, see you later.

384
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,010
Brother Ma Li?

385
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,730
See you later.

386
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,490
What are you looking at? Where are the entrance tickets?

387
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,450
Why were you smiling at that idiot?

388
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,340
- I find him interesting.
- He is an idiot.

389
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,760
- He is not.
- He keeps looking at you.

390
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,940
He must have bad thoughts in his mind. I have seen enough of such men.

391
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,400
- Understand?
- Ma Li is not that kind of person.

392
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,160
Have you seen many people?

393
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,540
Because of you I had to walk even further.

394
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,620
Which side is it?

395
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,250
We came in from that way.

396
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,920
Where did we exactly come in from?

397
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,690
Ma Li seems to have said that it's on the right.

398
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,590
- Seriously, you.
- I'm right.

399
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,080
You can't even tell the difference from left and right.

400
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,730
You dragged me to the wrong place. If I didn't call you, you would have brought me to the wrong place.

401
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,320
Isn't it over there?

402
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,480
You were the one who dragged me along.

403
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,150
It's clearly you who were the one who dragged me instead.

404
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,420
Enough, let's sit over there.

405
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:07,930
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

406
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:35,370
You two. Are there any problems with cloth appliances?

407
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,440
- No problem.
- No problem.

408
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,160
Fine. Since this is the case, please take a rest in the rooms next door first.

409
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,140
We will call you out later.

410
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,570
It's such a big event. Did they need to do this?

411
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,180
Did you buy it?

412
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,530
- Yes.
- Show it to me.

413
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,660
- It's $50 on Ling Long.
- Okay, leave.

414
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,210
Governor.

415
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,970
You bought it too?

416
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,660
Yes. So what if I bought it?

417
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,930
Don't tell me that you didn't buy it?

418
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,540
I wanted to but I'm keeping guard on this. How could I go out?

419
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,150
Governor. Please get someone to watch this. I will be back soon.

420
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,170
You, seriously.

421
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,800
We have already checked the items here and you want someone else to keep watch over them?

422
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,550
Bet less.

423
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,810
If you bet too much, you will lose a lot.

424
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,140
What will you do if your wife runs off with someone else?

425
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,440
You must keep guard over these items carefully.

426
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,260
Yes.

427
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,680
Bet less?

428
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,570
For the past nineteen years, I haven't even gambled once.

429
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,090
I must bet on this.

430
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,320
Victory to Rong Da!

431
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,450
Victory to Rong Da!

432
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,560
Victory to Rong Da!

433
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,860
Governor Liu.

434
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,860
Madam Wu. You are here too?

435
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,470
- And Miss Wu too?
- Hello, Governor Liu.

436
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:28,440
Madam Wu. You are really blessed. Your second daughter is tall and pretty.

437
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,730
These youngsters still need a lot of guidance from you.

438
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,170
Who says so?

439
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,920
By the way, where are Cai Hong and Shao Tian?

440
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,970
They are at the room behind. When the contest starts, I will call them out.

441
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,730
It has been hard on you.

442
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,020
Madam Wu. Sorry, I need to take my leave.

443
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,870
Governor Liu is a good man. He is very upright.

444
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,060
- How do you know?
- Of course, I do.

445
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,430
I played mahjong with him. He is a nice man.

446
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,310
- Stepmom, Cai Yun.
- Sister.

447
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,430
Cai Hong. Why did you come out? What are your preparations?

448
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,060
We are almost done.

449
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,990
Warlord Lu, President Zhang, thank you for coming.

450
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,230
Please pardon me.

451
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,290
Miss Lu, you worked had.

452
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,960
It has been hard on you.

453
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,710
Governor Liu is known for his heartwarming speeches at General Assembly.

454
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,160
Guilty as charged, isn't it?

455
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,430
I'm here for the fun of it.

456
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,040
Yes. To be able to have such competition,

457
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,480
is really an eye-opener.

458
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,240
By the way, Governor Liu,

459
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,480
do you mind if I watch this?

460
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,940
How could I have any objections. It's my honour to have you both here.

461
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,320
- Warlord Lu, please.
- No need.

462
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,090
I will only stay a while.

463
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,370
Mr Zhang, please make yourself at home.

464
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:44,090
I will, it's Governor Liu to you.

465
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,800
Yes. Mr Zhang, this way, please.

466
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,470
Look. There are already many people ahead. This way, please.

467
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,950
After you.

468
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,070
This rascal, Zhou Shao Tian, has already given you a lot of trouble.

469
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,520
What is he doing with this silk contest?

470
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,910
General Du, don't you know about this?

471
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:24,420
The silk contest is to force Jiang Yu to take out his secret formula.

472
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,970
As long as the secret formula shows up, it proves that Jiang Yu killed Wu Hong Da.

473
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,860
When that time comes, wouldn't the secret formula belong to us?

474
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,860
You can do this

475
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,540
but you also put me into the spotlight.

476
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,190
If there are any troubles, I will not let you of the hook.

477
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,280
General Du, how could you say this?

478
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,320
I have been with you for a long time.

479
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,290
Have I ever let you down?

480
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,110
That's good then.

481
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,870
The President is responsible before the Hong people.

482
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:11,930
He even received personal orders to get the silk from here.

483
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:17,010
I also hope that Rong Da will get this business.

484
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,900
Don't worry. I will definitely do my best.

485
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,660
Welcome everyone to the silk competition.

486
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,530
We are very honoured that

487
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:54,340
Warlord Lu, as well as President Zhang graced us with their presence.

488
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:58,020
We are very thankful.

489
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,020
Great.

490
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,140
The silk competition is the biggest event in Huzhou's weaving and dyeing industry.

491
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,020
Even though silk is a so-called light good,

492
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,280
the event cannot be taken lightly.

493
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,500
I, Governor Liu, am very honoured to be the host of the silk contest again.

494
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,130
The last silk contest was sixteen years ago.

495
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:30,530
At every silk contest, there will always be a losing competitor who has to leave the industry.

496
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,490
Sixteen years ago, Ling Long factory was the one who remained.

497
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,800
Sixteen years later, the one who was challenged to the contest

498
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,160
was the Ling Long factory.

499
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,470
Let's invite the contestant from Ling Long, Boss Jiang Yu

500
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,960
to the stage.

501
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,230
<i>Great.</i>

502
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,910
<i>Ling Long!</i>

503
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,970
<i>Victory for Ling Long.</i>

504
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,930
Today, the owner of the exquisite Lin Long factory is challenging

505
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,710
Rong Da factory. Their contestant is

506
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:14,100
their General Manager who is also someone we are familiar with in the industry.

507
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,330
Mr Zhou Shao Tian.

508
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,680
<i>Great.</i>

509
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:26,280
<i>Victory to Rong Da.</i>

510
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,400
<i>Go, Rong Da!</i>

511
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,850
<i>Go, Rong Da!</i>

512
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,070
<i>Great.</i>

513
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,840
Both Lin Long and Rong Da are the pride of our district.

514
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:58,750
I hope that both of you, as well as our audience will behave gracefully.

515
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,480
This silk contest will take place in three parts.

516
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,740
This Sunday we will have the first round.

517
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,510
Both parties need to, before the incense stick burns out,

518
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,520
produce a textile that is second to none.

519
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,100
The time is the time it takes the incense stick to burn.

520
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,520
When it ends, everyone here will vote.

521
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,340
The one who receives the most votes is the winner.

522
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:55,120
Everyone, when you entered the door, you were given a lily. It's for you to use as votes.

523
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:01,030
Great.

524
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,510
Great.

525
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:09,310
Okay, I will now announce

526
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,910

Brother.

528
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,390
What are you doing? Why are you doing anything?

529
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,090
Everything's fine. Go back.
