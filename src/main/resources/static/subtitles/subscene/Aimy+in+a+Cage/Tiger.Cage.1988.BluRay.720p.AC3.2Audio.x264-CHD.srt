1
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,909
Faster!

2
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,595
Give me a bag

3
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,315
Big Brother

4
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,999
The real thing, so it's lived up is name

5
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,595
Heroine can be had in any quantity

6
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,670
They say you've a way in NY.

7
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,039
Let's combine.

8
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,918
To snatch your heroine business from them

9
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,594
Okay, it's mutually beneficial

10
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,958
Now I want 20 kilos of that stuff

11
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,116
Where's the money?

12
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,391
Here. Mind you.

13
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,469
Don't talk nonsense in front of Mr Big Brother

14
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,077
Trying to draw? Are you looking for hell?

15
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,793
Great! If you work with me

16
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,957
the other families will go bust

17
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,273
He's my brother.

18
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,236
Get 20 kgs of stuff for him

19
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,271
You bustard Ping!

20
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,355
Don't move, CID!

21
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,588
Don't move!

22
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,153
Don't move! Police, drop your gun!

23
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,156
Damn it!

24
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,749
Drop your gun!

25
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,640
Big brother, run!

26
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,435
Stay where you are!

27
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,994
Drop your gun and climb up slowly

28
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,638
No monkey bsiness! My gun has no eyes

29
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,119
Put your hands on your ears!

30
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,155
I never flop in any mission!

31
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,675
Damn you!

32
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,235
Are you alright, Uncle Te?

33
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,719
Yes

34
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,398
Well, an experienced fireman
gets his fingers hurt?

35
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,716
Nonsense!

36
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,915
Trying to run?

37
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,628
Stop, police

38
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,670
Keep away!

39
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,880
Drop your gun! Drop or I'll kill her!

40
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,071
Come on, put it down! Hear me?

41
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,915
Drop it or I'll shoot her dead

42
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,269
Outrageous! You scum

43
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,310
Are you sick of living?

44
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,310
Get back in!

45
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,756
Keep down

46
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,395
Are you fed up with living?

47
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,110
After him!

48
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,271
Shirley, don't come up! It's dangerous!

49
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,992
- Get the frogmen to salvage
- Yes, sir!

50
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,829
Did you mean to get killed?

51
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,791
Sorry!

52
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,836
Mr Huang

53
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,959
Cordon off the spot & call an ambulance

54
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,870
Yes, sir!

55
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,875
Mr Huang...

56
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,275
Thank you all for the trouble

57
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,596
I nearly forgot to get back

58
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,238
a bait for Shirley

59
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,793
Uncle Te, see how much our haul is

60
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,915
Yes, sir

61
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,268
Hsiu, here you are, fixed

62
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,156
Good

63
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,276
Mr Wei

64
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,148
Here's a file from the USA

65
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,872
This new drug syndicate...

66
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,950
is now in HK

67
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,110
Watch their movements

68
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,075
- Let's celebrate
- Drink more

69
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,792
Cheers!

70
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,758
- Don't...
- No more,please

71
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,955
- Really can't drink
- What...

72
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,474
- You're lying
- Enough

73
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,113
Well, I'll drink more tomorrow

74
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,030
Let's talk about it tomorrow

75
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,556
Listen

76
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,513
anyone making trouble tomorrow
will be transferred to Shataukok

77
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,957
Are you trying to avenge a personal grudge

78
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,915
What do you mean?

79
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,918
Mr Huang judge for us

80
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,355
We celebrated for him
because we took him for a friend

81
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,914
He's not taking us for friends.

82
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,750
What do you think?

83
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,956
Help me, or I'll get drunk for sure

84
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,149
Okay

85
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,116
You're getting married tomorrow. Drink this

86
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,955
Or Shirley has to clean the house for me

87
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,792
Right, Shirley will stay to clear up the rubbish

88
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,153
Don't think it's easy to be a housewife

89
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,470
Do you want him to drink. I don't

90
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,072
- Well?
- Drink it

91
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,395
Don't drink

92
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,153
Drink this big glass

93
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,399
Don't side with him so soon

94
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,595
We bachelors really...

95
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,398
envy your true feeling

96
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,472
You're lucky, you're quitting tomorrow

97
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,039
But we really are depressed

98
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,835
Why fight?

99
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,071
Only yesterday the doctor said my heart's weak

100
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,717
What?

101
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,789
I can't stand the shock

102
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,311
Sometimes you can't take a doctor
advice too serious

103
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,437
Sister, he can't stand the shock. Can you?

104
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,917
You don't drink this, you must clean the house

105
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,752
Go and collect the ashes

106
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,632
Drinking's bad for health.
What about venting our feelings?

107
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,876
That suits me better. I'm a virgin

108
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,871
I've lots of grievances, lets vent them

109
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,670
Ah Yu, come here!

110
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,870
What's it, Hsiu?

111
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,836
What's wrong with you?

112
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,995
Fix him for me

113
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,390
Is that an order or a friendly request?

114
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,875
Only a friend would tell you to do this

115
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,036
Yes, sir

116
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,193
No peeping and no moving of lower jaws

117
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,431
Anyone blowing the egg to an opponent win

118
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,955
Ready!

119
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,756
Ready!

120
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,996
Start!

121
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,232
Hsiu, I'm on your side. Why tease me?

122
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,948
Either we play today or never

123
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,830
Even if you...

124
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,230
were my master, I'd tease you.

125
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,919
Amy...

126
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,595
Terrific!

127
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,350
Make fun of mel?

128
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,514
Stop that. Amy really is coming

129
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,069
I don't care about her

130
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,756
- So what?
- It's you who don't care about me

131
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,516
Everything alright?

132
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,271
Amy

133
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,356
What?

134
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,832
How dare you lay hands on my girl?

135
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,678
- Protect me, Madam
- Don't go

136
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,430
Forget it!

137
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,630
Outrageous!

138
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,549
Bastard, how dare you?

139
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,432
Anyone teasing Amy will get it

140
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,872
He's flaring up

141
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,950
What's the matter with you?

142
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,870
It's alright

143
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,274
They're always so wild.

144
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,190
Never mind them

145
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,909
- Mr Huang, stop him
- Your guys...

146
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,670
What're you up to again?

147
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,749
That bastard hit me

148
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,159
Don't go so wild, will you?

149
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,119
Mr Huang, now is the Happy Hour

150
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,350
We'll go on even if Madam ordered us to stop

151
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,513
Dare you even to tease me?

152
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,875
Sorry, sir. We'll go down to accompany you

153
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,550
Good, you dared to fling me down

154
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,276
Come in!

155
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,475
It really got into my head

156
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,988
Get me a cup of coffee, will you?

157
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,675
Thank you

158
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,438
For me?

159
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,598
I planned to give it to Shirley

160
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,875
Now I think it suits you better

161
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,433
It depends

162
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,999
How could it suit me?

163
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,993
Not for tonight

164
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,872
As of tomorrow

165
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,996
you're to work like a slave

166
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,759
You tease me last time

167
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,630
Well have some tear-gas

168
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,230
So you'll cry on your wedding day

169
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,791
Don't exaggerate

170
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,874
Okay, you win

171
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,590
Make way

172
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,077
Let me

173
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,957
No, you're clumsy

174
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,309
So mush the better

175
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,072
Let me taste this nice cup of coffee

176
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,989
Your heart's weak. Don't drink coffee anymore

177
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,680
I only meant to fool them

178
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,592
You've fooled me too

179
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,875
No

180
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,919
Stop lying, tell me the truth

181
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,314
Do you love Shirley?

182
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,955
If you don't say it, it means you don't

183
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,838
No, but...

184
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,195
I still can't make up my mind
after such a long time

185
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,869
I love her then

186
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,072
You're not sincere

187
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,593
- They're pushing
- Go now

188
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,356
I'll go then

189
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,509
- Bye-bye
- Bye-bye

190
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,471
Really heartless, idiot

191
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,559
Take it off first

192
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,630
Right

193
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,438
Remember to collect the bride at 10 tomorrow

194
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,954
Wear a necktie

195
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,315
Thank you. Bye-bye

196
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,352
Try it at once

197
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,790
Really beautiful

198
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,794
The flower on the head is beautiful

199
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,869
Hsiu

200
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,916
Don't run

201
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,839
Call an ambulance at once!

202
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,956
Hsiu

203
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:09,069
Shir...Shirley, I...

204
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,272
Hsiu...

205
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,516
What happened...

206
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,156
C.I.D.

207
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,558
Heavenly Father of all men

208
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,349
We pray especially for those we love

209
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,669
but can't see any more

210
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,112
May you bless them

211
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,475
& shine on them

212
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,555
May thy love, wisdom & omnipotence

213
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,916
Be demonstrated...

214
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,670
in them

215
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,310
We pray in jesus' name, Amen

216
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,518
Why are you back from your leave?

217
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,679
There's no point in taking leave now

218
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,239
Michael, I'm applying for return to duty

219
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,359
Good. Work may do you good

220
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,669
Master. I'm in trouble. You must help

221
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,877
You made things so bad.

222
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,951
Who'd help you?

223
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,510
Here's a potion of American ginseng.

224
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,233
See if it will help

225
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,194
Don't move. Police

226
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,314
Yu, handcuff him

227
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,310
Don't move!

228
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,275
Where's Swatow Hsiung?

229
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,153
I don't know. Miss

230
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,592
I don't know...

231
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,394
I really don't know

232
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,995
You're his best friend! Speak up!

233
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,676
Speak up!

234
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,990
Are you going to speak or not?

235
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,513
Maybe these 2 monsters...

236
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,715
may speak

237
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,916
- Sorry, I don't know anything
- Let's go

238
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,395
Don't, Mr Big

239
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,870
Go over there!

240
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,678
Don't scare madam

241
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,517
Be smart and speak

242
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,316
I really don't know

243
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,752
Don't blame me...

244
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,398
if your bottom gets burnt

245
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,230
Hear that?

246
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,549
I really don't know

247
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,636
Well, are you going to speak or not

248
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,511
Speak up!

249
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,790
Take off has pants!

250
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,715
Take off has pants!

251
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,995
You're not speaking? Scald him

252
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,075
Good

253
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,153
I enjoy doing it.

254
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,593
You don't care a damn about me

255
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,272
Speak up!

256
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,116
No?

257
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,676
No?

258
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,716
He's collapsed

259
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,235
His bottom's got burnt

260
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,753
That one outside may last longer

261
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,195
Okay, scald him

262
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,030
Take off your pants

263
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,556
I'll speak... I only know he's sailing tomorrow

264
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,834
But I don't know...

265
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,234
where

266
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,030
Keep away...

267
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,153
Look, we've got so many complaint

268
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,391
You took action without my approval

269
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,357
Used violence to hurt suspects.

270
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,430
How can I protect you

271
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,234
Inspector Ho Shih-ling, you've let me down

272
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,436
Sorry, sir

273
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,596
What good to say sorry now?

274
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,029
How long have you been in the police force?

275
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,349
With your relationship with Hsiu

276
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,157
you shouldn't handle this case

277
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,799
We're legally...

278
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,234
still unmarried

279
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,990
Shut up!

280
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,032
To talk about law

281
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,632
we'll all die martyrs

282
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,519
Vengeance makes us...

283
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,074
no different from rascal

284
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,959
You're unfit to be a policeman

285
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,791
Sorry, sir, Insp Ho's operation...

286
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,155
got my verbal approval

287
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,789
I know the whole thing well

288
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,429
Don't cover her up

289
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,918
I only feel that I've a responsibility

290
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,398
Good fix it then

291
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,389
If anything goes wrong again, mind your future

292
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,676
Yes, sir

293
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,079
I don't mind bearing the blame for you

294
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,950
But remember foolhardiness doesn't always work

295
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,315
- Mr Wang!
- Uncle Te, how's it?

296
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:02,957
We've a glue

297
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,236
Swatow Hsiung will leave HK

298
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,195
at Sam Mun Pier at two

299
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,911
Buddy, when will the ship sail?

300
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,353
After these drums have been moved

301
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,869
Swatow Hsiung

302
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,238
Don't move! Sail quickly!

303
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,633
Sail, or I'll shoot you dead

304
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,035
Release the rope

305
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,472
Brother, don't shoot, it's loaded with gasoline

306
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,471
My whole family's on it.

307
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,435
Don't shoot. I beg you.

308
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,559
Release the rope, faster!

309
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,910
Go to hell!

310
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,710
Don't move!

311
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,554
You're violating the law

312
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,956
Tai-li, tell the bastard
to bring the boat back to shore

313
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,476
Yu, keep the evidence on the spot
and bring it back

314
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,716
Yes, Mr Wong

315
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,510
Captain, show me your licence and I.D.

316
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,350
Not my fault, sir

317
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,112
Back to the shore.

318
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,553
We'll take your statement then

319
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,796
I wanted to kill him too

320
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,116
No more

321
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,989
We're police

322
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,589
What are you doing?

323
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,233
Old Te. I know the American ginseng case

324
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,798
Give me a chance. It's for everyone's good

325
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,995
Save your nonsense for the Tomb Festival

326
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,469
Mr Hueng...

327
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,515
Fix all these

328
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,191
Mr Heung, do you know the American ginseng case?

329
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,156
Mr Heung

330
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,519
Be smart & let me go

331
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,111
or we'll both perish

332
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,713
Kill me! See how you'll...

333
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,116
make your report

334
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,312
Get away...

335
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,960
- A snatcher...
- Don't move

336
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,756
Go and see him

337
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,156
Over here, you stay to watch him

338
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,316
Yes, Madam

339
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,113
Come here! Come here to mark the seat

340
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,870
Stop the others from coming

341
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,393
Old Te, you need this gun...

342
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,113
for evidence

343
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,312
Oh. I forgot

344
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,510
He was stunned

345
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,513
This coffee came from my friend in Brazil

346
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,357
Try it

347
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:34,997
Thank you, sir

348
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,476
I've read the report on yesterday's incidence

349
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,551
Mr Wei

350
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,198
We got no full marks

351
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,549
but I'm satisfied with the result

352
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,475
Had we captured on alive

353
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,234
we could get more clues

354
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,634
I like you...

355
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,631
for your serious attitude

356
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,913
You're already so busy. Take 2 days' leave

357
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,030
Thank you, sir

358
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,233
A fish has swallowed the bait.

359
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,915
Go & see

360
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,836
A big fish

361
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,479
Even you've caught it, must be a stupid fish

362
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,389
So you're stupider!

363
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,709
Get it back right away

364
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,756
Over there! Catch it, get it back

365
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,113
Take care

366
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,395
I've seen it. So it's a crafty fish

367
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,871
Is it?

368
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,790
There's no lack of stupid fish.

369
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,755
Let's catch

370
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,159
I daren't convey anything to you

371
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,310
Let's me teach you yatching.

372
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,912
Some day we'll cross the Pacific

373
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,399
Come!

374
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,348
No...

375
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,909
Turn...

376
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,830
Which way

377
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,830
This way?

378
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,319
Right. Turn

379
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,670
I did it

380
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,836
Uncle Te

381
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,316
Spend more time on Amy...

382
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,913
to strengthen the ties

383
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,239
I wish I could

384
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,074
But I'm a policeman

385
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,836
Excuse me

386
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,795
Okay! Bye-bye

387
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:56,797
This is Yu

388
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,792
What happened?

389
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,558
Mr. Hueng. I've caught Uncle Te...

390
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,993
dealing drug with foreigner

391
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,031
Impossible

392
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,760
It's true. I've the video tape for evidence

393
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,270
Let's make immediate action. What do you suggest?

394
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,112
No, it could be complicated

395
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,554
Bring all the tapes to the station for me to see

396
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,236
Anything important?

397
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,956
Nothing serious. I'll take you home

398
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,670
Let's go

399
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,590
Cindy wants me to remind you...

400
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,953
today is Amy birthday

401
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,032
I know. I know.

402
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,471
See the cake & flowers is ready.

403
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,993
Go & be pardon.

404
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,509
What are you waiting for! Get in!

405
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,917
Girls have to be soothed

406
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,715
Go now. Amy will be off duty soon

407
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,115
You're meddlesome

408
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,032
Only 1 5 minutes for fooling around

409
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,556
Thank you

410
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,950
Thank you

411
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,670
Amy

412
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,917
Can I help you, sir?

413
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,552
Yes.

414
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,075
I want 2 tickets for a trip with my girlfriend

415
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,638
It's her birthday. Happy birthday!

416
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,388
It's yours.

417
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,915
What's it on the tape? Let me show it

418
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,432
What are you going to cook for me?

419
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,152
Let's eat cakes after dinner

420
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,998
Don't touch my videotape recorder! Open the door

421
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,309
- Open up!
- What are you doing?

422
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,389
It's none of your business

423
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,435
Come out...

424
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,109
Who told you to watch my videotape

425
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,953
Well, you're keeping such a serious thing from me

426
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,671
What is it?

427
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,749
Are you taking me for your brother

428
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,433
Speak up...

429
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,511
Uncle Te's your master

430
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,318
but he's keeping it from you

431
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,072
It means he doesn't trust me

432
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,190
Who knows? You're taking him for your dad

433
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,474
How do I know you're an accessory?

434
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,435
Would I be an accessory to this?

435
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,432
I went through everything with you

436
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,794
and you suspect me?

437
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,239
You're so impulsive. How could I tell you?

438
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,152
It would only ruin you

439
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,753
What have you to fear now?

440
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,031
I'm not afraid either. Be he a tiger

441
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,793
Or my own dad.

442
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,030
I'll take him...

443
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,756
if he sells drug

444
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,075
I'll go & arrest him right now

445
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,757
Let's go!

446
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,591
Don't be so impulsive!

447
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,752
Any rash action will ruin everything

448
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,795
Aren't we brothers?

449
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,270
Listen

450
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,433
this is only between me & Mr Huang

451
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,477
And me

452
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,869
Yes...!

453
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,672
Remember, don't take individual action...

454
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,837
if you discover anything. Okay?

455
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,159
Bad. I must explain to Amy

456
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,350
Don't do anything foolish!

457
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,030
Listen

458
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,670
It hurts!

459
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,909
Go now, or I'll call the police

460
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,712
and accuse you of trespassing

461
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,035
You must be joking

462
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,116
Who's joking with you?

463
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,597
Amy

464
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,431
I won't see you anymore. Go away!

465
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,674
My hand!

466
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,953
You're not going? I will

467
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,750
What are you doing?

468
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,956
Don't go

469
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,030
Are you taking me for a criminal?

470
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,678
Yes. I sue you for willful damage

471
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,830
to a policeman's pride

472
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,195
I must question you now

473
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,555
I've followed you all the way

474
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,549
and kept saying 'sorry'

475
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,595
What else do you want?

476
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,553
Mr Fang. I want you to have some respect for me.

477
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,236
You come to see me when you're in the mood

478
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,112
You leave me behind

479
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,633
& say sorry when you're not

480
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,636
What are you taking me for?

481
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,949
My girlfriend

482
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,554
worthy of my respect

483
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,075
Have my action to show how important you're to me

484
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,119
I'll keep you company till tomorrow morning

485
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,073
I'll quit as a policeman. Okay?

486
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,111
No

487
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,556
I'll give you...

488
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,670
as a citizen to go out

489
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,229
I'll break with anyone else,
but I won't let you go

490
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,029
Let me go!

491
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,511
No, you mean everything to me

492
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,629
I can't cook if you don't let me go, jerk

493
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,673
Right, right, I must let you go

494
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,432
Let me see if you're hurt

495
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,557
A policeman gets more sentence
for indecent assault

496
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,392
I couldn't care less

497
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,995
Chun-yu, what are you up to? Come & help

498
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,997
I'm preparing a birthday gift for you

499
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,314
Come and eat

500
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,952
The big gift is here

501
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,395
Am I sweet?

502
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,395
Take me

503
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,549
Disgusting...

504
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,113
Shirley, have you got the key?

505
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,355
Yes

506
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,837
but Hsiu never allowed me to open it

507
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,638
And I don't know what it contains

508
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,395
Did you give him this?

509
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,997
He always kept everything to himself

510
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,595
Over $10 million! Impossible for a man

511
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,919
of his family background!

512
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,470
And these 2 passports! What are they for?

513
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,631
This must be ill-gotten money

514
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,873
These passports are to help use another identity

515
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,670
To get out of HK, in case of need

516
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,753
Wish my reasoning was wrong

517
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,474
I've recently got a tip-off that

518
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,552
Someone abused...

519
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,834
his power for dope-push

520
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,553
I thought...

521
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,354
he was honest

522
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,273
Shriley, I know how you feel

523
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,553
Please face up to reality

524
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,271
There's indeed something wrong with him

525
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,115
But I'll help you find out the truth

526
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,993
Buy a flag, sir...

527
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,672
Follow that white car in front

528
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,838
Royal HK policeman, no more police affair

529
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,759
No

530
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,115
I'm all yours tonight

531
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,915
GET LOST

532
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,590
Police

533
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,630
Drop your gun!

534
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,873
Drop your gun too, old Te

535
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,195
Terry, I...

536
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,828
Stay to speak to the judge. Fling it to see

537
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,516
Get your handcuffs & put them on

538
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,070
Those two foreigners

539
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,110
Terry

540
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,554
You're trafficking in drugs

541
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,711
As a policeman, you know the law and violate it

542
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,868
I was as hot-tempered when I was young

543
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,150
I understood

544
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,951
Why did you do that?

545
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,431
I've followed you since I left school

546
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,838
I took you for my master, my dad

547
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,790
But now it's all over between us

548
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,550
You're under arrest

549
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,910
Arrest me? I was braver than you

550
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,234
What did I get for arresting some small frys

551
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,274
2 lousy medals

552
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,153
When the weather's bad

553
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,559
it hurts & I can't sleep

554
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,873
They did it again once the got discharged

555
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,829
I am a small fry too

556
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,632
A small fry of a big shot

557
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,634
I don't care

558
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,835
Terry, you're still young & you've your idea

559
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,471
When you reach...

560
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,239
my age & are

561
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,511
In my straitened circumstances.

562
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,877
You'll see how important money is

563
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,988
Shut up! Don't find an excuse for yourself

564
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,874
Terry, let me go

565
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,719
Sorry, Uncle Te

566
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,311
I know you're nice to me, but I've no choice

567
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,758
I caught Te dealing in drugs with...

568
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,116
2 foreigners in Stephen Bay, Stanley

569
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,756
Come on

570
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,115
Stop...!

571
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,755
Hey guy, move and you are death

572
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,157
Sir

573
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,311
these 2 foreigners dealt in drugs with Uncle Te

574
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,318
I've got the tape for evidence

575
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,116
Well done! You've done a great credit

576
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,036
Handcuff Uncle Te

577
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,750
Yes, sir

578
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,036
I'll fix everything with your boss. Leave now

579
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,876
Okay!

580
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,268
Why do you want to kill him?

581
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,549
You'll die for sure if he doesn't

582
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:56,839
I'd rather go to jail than to kill him

583
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,750
You're my best aide.

584
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,829
I'll cover you up

585
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,315
I quit

586
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,432
Finish this case for me first

587
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,714
You know how to handle...

588
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,995
the things here

589
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,436
You gave me personal assurance that

590
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,434
Everything would be okay

591
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,473
Only about the stuff.

592
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,359
I'm not your nanny

593
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,118
I've overassessed you.

594
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,512
You can't even finish a kid

595
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,839
Now the co-operation is over between us

596
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,555
Our market in New York is so big

597
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,478
Many in HK would vie to be my sidekick

598
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,278
Okay, no problem

599
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,789
Listen

600
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,277
no one dare touch any deals I touched

601
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,509
Hong Kong is mine,
and you're not the only market in USA

602
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,313
Get out of HK & return to New York

603
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,394
Hold it, Michael!

604
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,640
I came here to make money, not to make enemy

605
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,470
Okay, I'll trust you one more time

606
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,870
Well, if you want co-operation,
do one thing for me

607
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,031
I want 200 kilos of stuff tomorrow night

608
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,354
This is my A No.

609
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,634
Credit the money into it
You'll get the stuff tomorrow night

610
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,275
The killer can never get away

611
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,199
We can get hold of him for sure

612
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,150
Morning!

613
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,868
What's wrong?
Why are you all wearing a stone face?

614
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,110
A bereavement?

615
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,709
- Ah Yu
- Ah Yu, come in!

616
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,197
Shirley, please go out for a while

617
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,158
Ah Yu, close the door please

618
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,629
I've ascertained Hsiu's drug-trafficking

619
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,111
Is that so? Does Shirley know it?

620
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,590
I'm not too sure

621
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,275
Would she be an accessory?

622
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,479
We must take more care from now on

623
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,793
I don't think Shirley has a hand on it

624
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,636
Here's a cassette of Te's drug-trafficking

625
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,878
It's of serious consequence

626
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,790
Formerly it was Hsiu, now It's Uncle Te

627
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,912
How many more are involved

628
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,796
I don't know

629
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,192
Yu, have you got any other evidence?

630
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,238
I've put a tape at Amy's

631
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,430
Is that so?

632
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,868
Don't worry.

633
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,029
Amy knows nothing about it

634
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,559
We must get it back as soon as possible

635
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,674
For Amy's safety

636
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,395
don't tell anyone about it

637
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,909
I know what to do

638
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,632
Shirley, please come in

639
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,313
Yu, I want to talk to you

640
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,828
Keep cool.

641
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,749
Something happened last night

642
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,790
What is it?

643
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,436
Come in

644
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,110
Mr Huang

645
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,439
Shirley

646
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,148
put this important item in a safe

647
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,832
Aren't you afraid she might be Te's accompany

648
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,830
Impossible

649
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,554
Terry was killed yesterday

650
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,636
What?

651
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,797
He knew about Old Te

652
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,270
I must go out for a while

653
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,030
Old Te, hold it! You creep!

654
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,160
You ruined Terry. I'll kill you!

655
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,116
Ah Yu

656
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,599
Are you crazy? Uncle Te's taking
Terry for his own son.

657
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,430
You're mistaken

658
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,474
Yu, don't get the wrong idea.

659
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,674
He won't do that

660
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,550
What happened?

661
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,915
A policeman trafficking in drugs can do anything

662
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,470
Quiet! We're all friends. Let's talk it over

663
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,436
Let me go!

664
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,712
I've proof of your drug-trafficking

665
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,715
I've already reported to Mr Huang.
I'll testify against you

666
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,517
Yu, don't be impulsive

667
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,154
You did report to me

668
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,599
but I can't accuse Te

669
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,434
Before I see the evidence

670
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,074
I must be him

671
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,792
I've got tapes of your drug-trafficking

672
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:28,756
Nonsense

673
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,835
Shirley, run it for him

674
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:34,836
Run it

675
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,515
How come?

676
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,159
Obviously the cassette has been swapped

677
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,116
What? Where's the evidence?

678
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,830
You yourself are under suspicion

679
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,109
You're exposing your own crime

680
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,316
Last time Hsiu got killed

681
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,550
because you planted a smoke bomb

682
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,831
This time Terry got killed
because you abandoned your duty

683
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,836
What explanation can you give?

684
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,279
I have other evidence

685
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,912
I saw him putting heroin in...

686
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,353
I also saw you put heroin into the locker

687
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,232
Let's search together

688
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,870
I'm not afraid. You're finished. Give me the key

689
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,108
Don't try anything foolish

690
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,390
Keep away!

691
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,556
Uncle Te, the key!

692
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,156
Pheasant

693
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,269
Sorry, Uncle Te

694
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,437
Keep cool

695
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,193
Uncle Te, you really did it

696
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,356
You put aside my book & said it was missing

697
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,028
Will you search more thoroughly?

698
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,354
We've searched everything. There's nothing

699
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,637
- Let's search his home
- Ah Yu,

700
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,794
- your locker
- Open it and see

701
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,676
Okay

702
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,116
Search!

703
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,235
- You really did it
- No

704
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,469
Yu, calm down

705
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,029
Are you going to tell me this is flour?

706
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,155
This bag is not mine

707
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,594
It was frame-up

708
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,673
Believe up me, Shirley, believe me

709
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,113
Now I won't trust anyone

710
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,157
I only believe in truth and evidence

711
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,152
You're arrested for drug possession

712
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,233
Shirley, I know Te is not alone in the

713
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,828
Frame-up. Soon I'll seek them out!

714
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,229
Watch out

715
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,714
Do you mean us?

716
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,279
- Don't frame us
- Don't get us involved

717
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,839
- Because you're evil
- Quiet

718
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,514
This is not a market

719
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,233
You're the Discipline Unit

720
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,634
I'll investigate the accusation
between Yu & Uncle Te

721
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,475
You'll also be subject to internal investigation

722
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,396
I'm drug investigation Special Operation

723
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,116
Insp Ho

724
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,912
You're suspected of drug possession.
What's your name?

725
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:29,950
Fang Shun-yu

726
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,670
Profession

727
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,916
A member of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force

728
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,351
With the Drug Investigation Dept
of the Special Operations

729
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,112
Where do you live?

730
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,035
You know it already

731
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,913
As a policeman, you should know...

732
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,239
I know better in this respect

733
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,595
I've discovered heroin in your locker

734
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,555
how do you explain that?

735
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,917
I was framed. Why should I explain?

736
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,079
Possess no drugs, why should I be question

737
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,390
There's no evidence to support your state

738
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,198
You mean you've proof against me?

739
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,630
Can you think of anything to prove your innocence?

740
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,354
Law requires evidence

741
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,517
All your statement may be used
as evidence in court

742
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,909
Okay, I'll give my statement

743
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,159
I deal in drugs, smuggling and

744
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,714
Resort to killing, arson and robbery

745
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,875

749
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:25,794

752
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,152
I'm Anti-Narcotics Bureau detective

753
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,833
Fang Shun-yu No.3368

754
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,629
I suspect my Sergeant Feng Chien-te
of drug-trafficking

755
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,032
As a result of 3 days probe & trace

756
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,793
I've discovered him

757
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,949
dealing in drugs with...

758
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,951
2 unidentified foreigners on a ferry

759
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,789
deduced that he used his detective identity

760
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,916
to cover up

761
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,553
his trafficking activities

762
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,789
Mr Huang

763
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,710
Mr Huang?

764
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,549
I'm Old Te, I've searched the whole house

765
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,715
There are many cassettes

766
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,592
but not the one you mention

767
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:48,989
I'm back first

768
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:11,636
Any clues?

769
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,793
Go back & retire. I'll take charge here

770
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,630
Mr Huang

771
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,188
Ah Yu, I believe you are innocent

772
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,269
Mr Huang, you must help me on this

773
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,749
Who else knows

774
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,030
the old Te case besides me?

775
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,316
Terry

776
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,597
You know Terry is impulsive

777
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,515
Now you've ruined him & yourself

778
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,639
The first thing is to prove your innocence

779
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,272
Take me to get the copy

780
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,710
of cassette you mentioned

781
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,829
Don't you trust me?

782
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,270
Shun-yu

783
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,835
Have you seen the cassette I taped yesterday?

784
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,636
Yes

785
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,872
Besides Te, there's...

786
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,793
Go on! Speak up!

787
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,316
I don't know, I don't know anything

788
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,674
Do you know or not?

789
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,439
I know nothing

790
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,192
That cassette is very important to Yu

791
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,391
Bring it if you know where it is

792
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,757
There's no such a cassette

793
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,591
There must be.

794
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,079
I ran it on this VTR recorder last night

795
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:08,876
Have you ever taken it away?

796
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,393
No, I didn't even touch it

797
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,794
Just now you said you got it

798
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,915
Without it

799
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,639
I can't clear myself. I'll be in jail

800
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,473
Do you know it or don't you?

801
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,795
I know...

802
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,234
Take out now

803
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,873
You don't want Yu to get into trouble

804
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:35,477
I promise

805
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,151
I'll quit once I'm cleared

806
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:55,990
I'm so scared!

807
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,637
Why?

808
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,959
It's okay if you find the cassette

809
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,270
Well, Yu, we must leave

810
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,756
Amy's going to be alright,
I'll have someone watch her

811
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,190
I'm Michael

812
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,677
now at 5 Conduit Garden 26th floor

813
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,430
Send someone, a woman needs protection

814
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,630
Yu, we're in a hurry

815
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:19,790
Excuse me

816
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,112
Shun Yu, I want no protection

817
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,675
I'm alright, I'll return soon

818
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,195
Bye-bye!

819
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,436
Let's go!

820
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:38,396
Please call Amy, 3368 urgent.

821
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,789
Tell her to call my home

822
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,551
Mr Huang, let's return to Hq

823
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,629
Handcuff me

824
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,593
Okay, this will save us
from unnecessary complaints

825
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,710
Bear with it now & soon you'll clear your's

826
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,033
Mr Huang, sorry for the trouble

827
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,555
Don't mention it

828
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:20,797
Mr Huang

829
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,438
it was these foreigners who deal with Te

830
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,551
Turn around and arrest them!

831
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,755
Amy, what happened?

832
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,395
Shirley, Michael masterminded...

833
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,392
Te's dope-pushing

834
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,755
He won't do that

835
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:57,475
It's true. He just took that cassette away

836
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,829
I'm scared

837
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,712
Keep calm, don't go away.

838
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,838
Tell me in detail

839
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,231
Michael masterminded Te's dope-pushing

840
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,119
Believe me...

841
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,189
Freeze

842
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,556
Come in!

843
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,958
Why are you coming to see me at this hour

844
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:04,030
You're depressed, don't drink so much

845
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,599
After so much has happened

846
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,274
go for a pleasure tour

847
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,352
Amy spoke to me over the phone before her dead

848
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,030
Is that so?

849
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:16,956
What did she say to you?

850
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,712
Yu is innocent of drug possession

851
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,309
A big shot is behind

852
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:21,595
Te's drug-trafficking

853
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:22,596
Who?

854
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,839
You should know better

855
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,833
You suspect me.

856
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,079
Call the police to arrest

857
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,677
I would have done it

858
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,315
But we're good friends

859
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,516
But now you've a chance to give yourself up

860
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,432
Can you testify against me like this?

861
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,075
Yes, with my name & position in the police force

862
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,873
My words will convince everyone

863
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,191
Now listen, I Michael Wong am a drug-trafficking

864
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,389
What have got anything to accuse me of it

865
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,157
I've a copy of Te's drug-trafficking tape

866
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,355
I've a copy too.

867
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,918
His crime is not linked with me

868
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,429
I can testify against you

869
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,833
Testify against me?

870
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,156
That tape

871
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,673
even if released to the world
won't serve any purpose

872
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,997
Because only Te can testify against me

873
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,080
Vincent, yes, I'm Michael

874
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:36,675
Finish off Te right away

875
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,313
I'll hand the stuff over to you in person

876
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,912
We've been getting on well

877
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,834
because you're obedient

878
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,108
But, unfortunately...

879
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,549
Mr Feng, telephone

880
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,590
Yes, speaking

881
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,597
The long distance call to Canada is connect

882
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,237
Thank you

883
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,239
Darling

884
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,076
Daddy

885
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,276
Yes

886
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,196
What is it?

887
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,518
I'll fly to Canada

888
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,033
at 7 tomorrow morning

889
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,117
What?

890
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,358
The Hq has approved my early retirement

891
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,837
for health reasons

892
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,312
Have you received my remittance?

893
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,315
Don't move

894
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,510
Old Te...

895
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,035
Old Te...

896
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,116
No monkey business!

897
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,469
Hell with you!

898
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:02,158
Damn, I'll kill you...

899
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,037
Kill...

900
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,915
Let's go

901
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,435
Have you found out everything?

902
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,956
This resignation letter has explained everything

903
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:37,117
I'm extremely sorry

904
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,190
I didn't discover

905
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,955
My subordinate's misbehavior till now

906
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,758
I ready for disciplinary action & investify

907
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,355
But I've a request

908
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,193
I wish I could arrest these men myself

909
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:49,989
I hope Mr Wei will give me this chance

910
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,239
before I leave

911
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,272
Good, go ahead

912
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,075
Thank you, sir

913
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,957
Ladies and gentleman

914
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,674
we've ample evidence against

915
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,155
Insp Ho. Serg Feng

916
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,229
and detective Fang for drug-trafficking

917
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,595
I personally can't shirk the responsible
for this disgrace

918
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,314
They're now fugitives with arms

919
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,399
We must bring them to book

920
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,836
Please put personal feelings aside

921
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,238
Shoot anyone on sight who tries to resist

922
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:26,916
Bitch

923
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,398
I've already done what you want.

924
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,828
What about the stuff?

925
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,275
Let me finish off that bitch

926
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,869
No. I'll fix her for you

927
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,437
I'll take your life
if I can't get the cargo tonight

928
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,317
3388, yes

929
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,233
Fang & Te have got Michael's drug

930
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,430
trafficking proof in Jackson Road

931
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:11,676
Tell her to come at once

932
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,199
Yes, thank you

933
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:35,989
All the cargo is in the car

934
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,511
Making fun of me? Damn you

935
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,556
Michael Huang

936
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:02,152
Damn killing you with
I shot is too good for you

937
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,230
I want you to be a limply in jail all your life

938
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,152
You're wanted. What have you got to arrest

939
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,270
