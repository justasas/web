00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,640
<i>Episode 13 </i>

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,020
Madam Jiang

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,390
Madam, today I will take care of you.

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,850
I'm Cai Hong. In the future, let me manage your tasks.

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,420
As you are trying to wake up, I will serve you well.

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,650
Madam. The weather is really nice today.

8
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,490
It's every fresh.

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,490
It's a pity that you can't feel it. Thus, I opened the door wider.

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,830
This way, the air from outside will come into the house.

11
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,780
Wu Long.

12
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,530
What are you doing? Why did you leave the door open?

13
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,340
- I wanted to let the air in.
- Shut up.

14
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,520
What kind of intentions do you have?

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,220
You clearly know that Madam is sick and you let the door wide open?

16
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,540
Are you trying to let her catch a cold?

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,230
Bad thing. No wonder, Miss wanted me to keep watch over you.

18
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,580
I am washing Madam's legs.

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,710
Look at how dirty this towel is.

20
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,820
Don't you know how to work?

21
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,010
The water in the tub is dirty.

22
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,880
You are going to wash Madam's legs with this?

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,100
Are you inconsiderate or brainless?

24
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,720
I have never seen anyone so stupid.

25
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,790
Change the water and wash the towel until it's clean.

26
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,250
I just washed this towel.

27
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,740
Rotten wench. You still dare to talk back to me?

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm telling you. If I say it's dirty, it's dirty then.

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,240
People like you are not clean in the first place.

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,330
You are dirtying my eyes.

31
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,950
What you are saying is really too ugly.

32
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,470
You still dare to criticise what I said?

33
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,860
If you are someone of substance, don't take advantage of a place.

34
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,160
Get lost and stop harming others.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,800
Fortunately, Miss told me to watch you. If not, I wonder what harm you would have caused Madam.

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,940
You are such a bad thing.

37
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,190
Dirty thing.

38
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,990
- You dirty thing.
- What are you doing?

39
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,740
Young Master.

40
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,220
Wu Cai Hong doesn't know how to do her work. I'm teaching her.

41
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,780
In the future, if you want to teach your subordinates, do it outside. Don't disturb Madam.

42
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,420
Yes, Young Master.

43
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,850
What are you still doing here?

44
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,270
I didn't let you in here to freeload on us.

45
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,690
If you don't know the rules, study them well.

46
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,860
I will work hard.

47
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,980
Why are you still standing here? Change the water and wash the towel now.

48
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,410
Remember to wash your hands thoroughly.

49
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,370
Don't argue with others. Did you hear me?

50
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,840
If you don't change your personality, let's see how I will handle you.

51
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,550
<i>What is she doing?</i>

52

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

53
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,950
Morning, Madam. How was your sleep last night?

54
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,620
Come. Let me feed you the medicine, okay?

55
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,160
Come.

56
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,030
Wu Cai Hong!

57
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,120
What did you give my mom?

58
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,970
It's a folklore prescription.

59
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,750
Mrs Zhang was right.

60
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,010
Last night, you were secretly making some unclean items.

61
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,690
What did you give my mom?

62
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,540
This is medicine from leeches.

63
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,720
Mom.

64
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,830
Why did you let my mom drink this?

65
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,000
The doctor said that Madam is unconscious because there are blood clots in her brain.

66
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,330
- The leeches can clear blood clots and stasis.
-Nonsense.

67
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,240
You are not a doctor. How could you let my mom take this medicine randomly?

68
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,330
I spent a lot of effort to obtain this folklore medicine.

69
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,220
My mom was in the same condition and confined to a bed.

70
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,380
She had blood clots but after drinking this medicine, it helped her.

71
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,620
In any case, I won't allow my Mom to be placed in any danger.

72
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,060
If there are any mistakes, who's going to be responsible?

73
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,660
I think it's still not enough that I taught you a lesson the last time.

74
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,630
Mrs Zhang.

75
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,690
Take her out and punish her.

76
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,510
Come out now.

77
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,240
I'm going to beat you to death for retorting.

78
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,080
I will beat you to death for disobedience,

79
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,360
for not listening and being argumentative.

80
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,580
I will beat you to death.

81
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,170
Don't talk back. Don't talk back.

82
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,960
Enough.

83
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,480
Brother. She was only given a few beatings.

84
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,330
If you do this, she won't change.

85
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,050
If you beat her until she's injured, I will still need to call for the doctor.

86
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,510
I don't want to waste money this way.

87
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,510
The recipe (for the medine) is useful.

88
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,600
You must trust me.

89
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,730
How should I trust you?

90
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,610
Who was the one who pushed my mom down the stairs?

91
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,420
I'm warning you.

92
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,250
In the future, don't make any decisions on your own.

93
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,730
So be it.

94
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,610
Change your personality in the future.

95
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,550
<i>Brother Shao Tian. Are you doing well?</i>

96

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

97
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,720
- Waiter.
- Mr Zhou.

98
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,670
- Bring another bottle of wine.
- Mr Shao, you have already drank too much. Don't drink anymore.

99
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,080
Why don't I heat up the food for you?

100
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,710
I told you to bring me another bottle of wine.

101
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,110
Go now.

102
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,910
Don't drink anymore. I'm afraid you don't have the money for the wine.

103
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,450
I'm telling you, I have money.

104
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,730
What I have is money.

105
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,660
Being rich is a form of pain.

106
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,400
Bring the wine here.

107
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,680
You already drank enough. You can't drink anymore.

108
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
Take the wine away.

109
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,380
What I have is money.

110
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,640
Mr Zhou, you are drunk.

111
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,820
I have money.

112
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,040
I have money.

113
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,800
Go now.

114
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,740
Cai Hong.

115
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,730
Cai Hong.

116
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,020
Madam. When my mom was sick and laid in bed, I massaged her too.

117
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,880
Madam. Can you feel the massage I'm giving you?

118
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,810
If you can feel it, move your hands. Okay?

119
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,770
Or you can blink your eyes.

120
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,310
Looks like you can't hear what I'm saying.

121
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,530
Young Master and Miss miss you very much.

122
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,060
You are a good mother.

123
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,920
You must wake up soon. You shouldn't let them worry.

124
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,850
Isn't that so?

125
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,240
Okay, Madam. I will massage you.

126
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,820
Don't be fooled by her.

127
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,950
Mom's current condition

128
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,240
was caused by the Wu family.

129
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,950
What's this? He is drunk.

130
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,400
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

131
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,770
Mom.

132
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,040
You must pay for it.

133
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,050
Pay me. Are you crazy?

134
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,010
What are you doing, drunkard?

135
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,140
Cai Hong.

136
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,270
Cai Hong.

137
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,960
Don't leave.

138
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,130
Who are you? What are you doing?

139
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,340
Cai Hong, it's me.

140
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,610
♫<i> So long, I have waited for so long... </i>♫
- You are not Cai Hong.

141
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,430
♫<i> Waited for your love to bloom. </i>♫
- You are not Cai Hong.

142
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,380
♫<i> Desperately, I was desperately struggling to find... </i>♫
- You are not Cai Hong.

143
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:43,150
♫<i> Yet couldn't find the way to your heart. </i>♫

144
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:49,700
♫<i> Gently, I gently tried to inquire </i>♫

145
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:56,020
♫<i> but did not ask you whether I was your fated love. </i>♫

146
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:02,420
♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

147
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:09,180
♫<i> In the end I did not get your heart. </i>♫

148
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,830
What's wrong?

149
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,470
What did you do to my mom?

150
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,890
I was just stimulating her acupuncture points.

151
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,080
She felt pain just now. Perhaps, she has already regained sensitivity.

152
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,980
Perhaps, she may wake up.

153
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,980
What exactly did you do to my mom?

154
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,230
My mom is laying in bed and can't talk now.

155
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,150
She wouldn't know what you have done to her.

156
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,830
Did you take revenge on my mom because we beat you?

157
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,900
I saw this today. What did you do to my mom when we didn't see anything?

158
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,360
I really didn't do anything. I only wanted Madam to wake up soon.

159
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,700
I don't believe you. I only believe what I see.

160
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,130
Mom.

161
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,440
Mom.

162
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,080
I think I had you beaten too lightly. That's why you didn't change your personality, right?

163
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,880
Mrs Zhang.

164
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,810
Drag her out and punish her.

165
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,360
Yes. Come out with me.

166
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,290
Kneel down.

167
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,780
Mrs Zhang. Beat her until she admits her fault.

168
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,380
Yes.

169
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,740
I didn't do anything wrong.

170
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,620
Still dare to argue?

171
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,970
I really have no intentions of harming her.

172
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,990
Nonsense. I don't believe you.

173
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,330
My mom is laying in bed and can't see

174
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,850
but I have eyes. I have been watching you.

175
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,220
I really didn't do anything wrong. I'm doing this for Madam's sake.

176
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,360
You are still not admitting your mistake?

177
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,830
Mr Zhang, continue with the beatings.

178
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,860
Beat her until she admits her mistake.

179
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,200
See if you still dare to argue again.

180
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,880
Open the door.

181
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,890
I want to see Cai Hong.

182
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,400
What are you doing?

183
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,480
- Where is Cai Hong?
- Who are you?

184
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,700
- Cai Hong is not here.
- Who's stopping me?

185
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,800
- You are a drunkard.
- Don't stop me.

186
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,770
- Get lost.
- I want to see Cai Hong.

187
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,210
You can't go in. Stop there.

188
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,340
Dare to argue again?

189
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,520
- Enough.
- Stop there.

190
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,550
- Cai Hong!
- Brother Shao Tian.

191
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,780
Let's beat her together.

192
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,790
Brother Shao Tian.

193
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,210
You dare to come here to create a ruckus?

194
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,450
Since before he was like this.

195
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,810
- Brother Shao Tian.
- Beat him to death.

196
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,530
Beat him.

197
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm begging you, stop beating him.

198
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,240
Let me go. Brother Shao Tian.

199
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,890
It's all my fault.

200
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,980
Tell them to stop. Don't beat him anymore.

201
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,810
Brother Shao Tian.

202
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,140
Continue with the beatings.

203
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,140
I'm begging you.

204
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,320
Stop beating him.

205
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,980
Leave. You even dare to create a ruckus here?

206
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,950
Get out.

207
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,700
You really don't know what's good for you.

208
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:12,560
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

209
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,140


210
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,770
I previously made several requests but you rejected them all.

211
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,330
Why are you so free as to visit me today?

212
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,730
Unless you have already thought over my advice.

213
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,740
Miss Lu.

214
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,350
We are understanding people. Let's get to the point.

215
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,270
I will help to start the dye factory that you wanted to set up in Huzhou.

216
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,000
You've finally thought it through?

217
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,150
That's great! I, Lu Man, am also a frank person. Based on our previous arrangement,

218
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:09,030
if you give me the secret recipe, I will set up the factory. You will be the General Manager and have 30 percent of the shares.

219
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,900
I already told you repeatedly. I don't have the secret recipe.

220
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,010
Make it forty percent then.

221
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,710
Even if you give me the entire factory, I really don't have the secret recipe.

222
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,720
Mr Jiang. My time is very precious.

223
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,350
If you don't have the secret recipe, why are you here to see me?

224
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,090
We can change the methods and set up the factory together.

225
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,230
I will use my management and technical skills to manage the factory.

226
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,880
Mr Zhou. In this community,

227
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,980
there are many people with management and technical skills.

228
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,910
There are many people who want to work with me.

229
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,810
Why should I hire you?

230
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,240
It's because I have been with Wu Cai Hong for many years.

231
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,430
Ling Long is one of Huzhou's best dyeing factories.

232
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,840
This you should know. Ling Long's

233
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,130
capital, technology, and channel are all here.

234
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,040
I think you should know this.

235
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,170
No matter how great Old Wu is,

236
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,680
didn't he lose to the Jiang family too?

237
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,090
Weren't you forced out by the Jiang family too?

238
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,530
If I didn't guess wrongly,

239
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,850
Jiang Yu inflicted the bodily injuries on you, right?

240
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,760
If you have an escape route, you wouldn't be here looking for me.

241
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,800
Miss Lu.

242
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,370
You have dared to try each method.

243
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,320
Do you really think I'm not a match for Jiang Yu?

244
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,960
If you had the solution, you wouldn't be forced into this state now.

245
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,180
By the way, I seem to have forgotten.

246
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,070
I heard that your girlfriend

247
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,300
has already been sold into the Jiang family as a maid.

248
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:07,090
Since this is the case, let's change the methods.

249
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,560
We set up a factory together. I will provide the financial backing,

250
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,360
technical skills and experience too.

251
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,700
I will give you thirty percent of the shares. What do you think?

252
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,720
Mr Zhou, are you kidding?

253
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,550
- How could there be such a good deal on earth?
- The good deal is in front of you.

254
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:31,750
I have the money. I would like to borrow your name to start the factory.

255
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:38,340
Miss Lu. You are a smart person. You can probably catch my drift.

256
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:47,720
I get it now. You are thinking of borrowing my name to clear your reputation.

257
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,210
Isn't thirty percent of the shares too insincere?

258
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,260
I want forty percent.

259
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,600
As the saying goes "going bigger does not get you more."

260
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,020
Don't miss out on the offer of thirty percent shares.

261
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:10,270
If you don't take this opportunity, I'm afraid you won't be able to set up a factory here.

262
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,850
I won't ask where you got the money from

263
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,740
but you using this money to clear your name, there is no one else in Huzhou

264
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,310
who can do this except me.

265
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,860
Mr Zhou. You should know who my backer is.

266
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:32,230
In your condition now, who knows? You may be able to use him.

267
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,910
Fine.

268
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,120
Since you put it this way, make it forty percent then.

269
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,130
I will fund the set up of the factory and provide the technical and management skills. You will be the boss on the front.

270
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:48,120
I will be the General Manager and hold thirty percent of the shares.

271
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,180
How bold. I'm was still satisfied before

272
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,450
when Wu Hong Da shook things up.

273
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,160
How could he easily have lost to Jiang Yu?

274
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,270
The student surpassed the teacher,

275
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:11,630
mastering the tricks and mastering life.

276
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,760
He definitely chose a capable son-in-law.

277
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,000
Fine. Congratulations, Mr Zhou, for your comeback in the dye industry.

278
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,810
We have formed an alliance today. I also hope that

279
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,980
you will be able to get ahold of the secret formula.

280
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,430
If you can obtain the secret formula, Huzhou will be our kingdom.

281
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:45,070
I will remember what you said.

282
00:24:53,710 --> 00:25:01,690
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

283
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,670
Granny Gu. Let me help you.

284
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,730
No need. Madam only likes the fish soup I cook for her.

285
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,140
I heard that you are Madam's nanny.

286
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,860
You are also Madam's trusted person.

287
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,000
Did you come into the Jiang's family with her?

288
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,660
What do you want?

289
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,260
I'm looking for a solution to help Madam to be conscious.

290
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,860
I heard that you pushed Madam down the stairs.

291
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,870
At that time, the situation was very chaotic.

292
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,770
I'm very apologetic about it too. I'm sorry.

293
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,250
You don't need to apologise to me. I can tell that you are feeling a very guilty conscious.

294
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,130
I heard that you used folklore prescriptions and massages too.

295
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,920
It has been hard on you.

296
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,770
I would also like to do my best

297
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,060
to redeem my past.

298
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,900
Granny Gu. Could you tell me

299
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,350
some stories about Madam?

300
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,860
There are many stories about Madam.

301
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,820
I don't know which stories would be of help to you.

302
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,010
Granny Gu. You can tell me any stories.

303
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,460
For example, what is Madam's happiest moment?

304
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,550
Or her favourite song?

305
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,030
You can tell me about these.

306
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:27,480
I think Madam's happiest moment is when she met Old Master.

307
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,990
Both of them loved each other very much and married later.

308
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:39,020
The happiest moment could be when they were together.

309
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,500
Even God was envious.

310
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,780
Old Master passed away at such a young age.

311
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,530
What a pity. Ever since,

312
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:57,330
Madam has never been happy again.

313
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,150
They were so much in love. There must be a special place.

314
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:10,460
For example, what was their lovers' keepsakes?

315
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,890
Lovers' keepsakes? I don't really know about this.

316
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:21,140
There was a song for it though. It's "Ten Glass Boats".

317
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,080
It's because at that time,

318
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,560
when Madam and her husband went on dates,

319
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,380
she would always sing this song.

320
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,880
When she was singing this song and smiling,

321
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,490
do you know how lovely she was?

322
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,460
In my lifetime,

323
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,700
that was the most beautiful that Madam looked.

324
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,170
Wu Cai Hong.

325
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,190
What right do have you to ask about my parents?

326
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,930
Granny Gu.

327
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,440
Did you forget what the prohibitions for the Jiang family are?

328
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,350
Young Master. Miss Cai Hong only wanted to...

329
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,460
What?

330
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,170
Listen carefully.

331
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,080
You gave me your word.

332
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,350
Don't let me find out that you are checking about my parents again.

333
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,440
Do you remember when I was young and joined the Ling Long Dye factory?

334
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,100
Yes.

335
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,500
I heard from them that Ling Long has a secret recipe.

336
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,300
Is there something like this?

337
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,300
The secret recipe was from Jiang Yu's family.

338
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,510
Jiang Yu?

339
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,680
Yes. He...

340
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,290
Shao Tian, what's wrong with you? Did you fight with him?

341
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:02,080
This doesn't concern you. Tell me about Ling Long first.

342
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,970
Tell me.

343
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,750
Tell me now.

344
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,650
Ling Long originally belonged to the Jiang family.

345
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,370
Later, Old Master Jiang,

346
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,340
that is Jiang Yu's father, committed a crime.

347
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,400
Ling Long then changed hands and became the Wu family's company.

348
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,310
I didn't think that it would fall into Jiang Yu's hands again.

349
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,990
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

350
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,750
Are you sure that Ling Long belongs to Old Master Jiang in the past?

351
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,970
Definitely. Jiang family's Young Master is Jiang Yu.

352
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:43,910
I met him when he played at the factory when he was young.

353
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:48,610
Shao Tian, it really does not matter.

354
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:52,770
So to say, Ling Long belonged to Jiang Yu in the first place.

355
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,590
Since it was the Jiang family, why did they change the name to Wu?

356
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,310
What exactly happened then?

357
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,560
Tell me.

358
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,830
It happened a long time in the past. Why are you bringing this up again?

359
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,880
You must tell me. It's extremely important.

360
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,990
Shao Tian.

361
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,780
I know that

362
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:31,300
you've taken to heart the things in the past and can't get over them.

363
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,750
Frankly, I find it hard to accept

364
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,990
but since this happened a long time ago, just let it be.

365
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,470
You are still young. You can move forward.

366
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:52,010
Let's not talk about this now. Stick to my questions. Do you know what the crime was that Old Master Jiang committed?

367
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:57,100
You just said that Ling Long belonged to the Jiang family and later became under the Wu family because of a crime he committed.

368
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:08,600
I remember Old Master Wu was a government officer then.

369
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,990
He was the one who first announced Old Master Jiang's crime.

370
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:18,560
At that time, the officials went to the factory to raid for opium.

371
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,390
I was at the scene.

372
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:26,060
I personally witnessed Old Master Jiang jump to his death.

373
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,940
The government said that he committed suicide.

374
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,590
So to say, Wu Hong Da forced Jiang Yu's father to die.

375
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,120
No wonder, every time when Jiang Yu sees Cai Hong,

376
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,060
there is a kind of hatred.

377
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,230
Old Master Jiang's crime was confirmed?

378
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:00,300
The government said that he was guilty. What would commoners like us know?

379
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,220
But Old Master Jiang treated his workers very well.

380
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,170
Our family received help and kindness from him too.

381
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,210
"The unjust are doomed for destruction."

382
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,390
Looks like God is still fair.

383
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,780
There is retribution.

384
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,720
Who are you talking about?

385
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,440
Let's not talk about this first. Tell me about the secret formula.

386
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:39,090
The secret formula is the Jiang family's inheritance. I heard from the ex-workers of the Jiang family that

387
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,070
for Empress Dowager's birthday,

388
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,760
the Jiang family used the secret formula for the textiles

389
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,490
dedicated to the Empress Dowager.

390
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,400
Where is the secret formula now?

391
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,940
I don't know.

392
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,300
After Old Master's factory went bankrupt, would it still be there?

393
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:19,490
♫<i> The first glass boat made a whistling sound. ♫</i>

394
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:25,310
♫<i>Two oars making a pilgrimage. </i>♫

395
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:30,040
♫<i>Headed to an ultra-long mountain every year. </i>♫

396
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,030
♫<i>The smell of incense burning in the ocean. </i>♫

397
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,990
Madam Jiang. Jiang Yu doesn't allow me to talk

398
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,820
but he didn't say that I couldn't sing.

399
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,780
I believe that they miss you very much and want you to wake up soon.

400
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,010
This song will bring back many beautiful memories of you and your husband.

401
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:54,620
Madam, wake up soon.

402
00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:00,550
♫<i>The second post ship gathers as a pair</i>♫

403
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:05,380
♫<i>Gilded railings installed on both side. </i>♫

404
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:10,480
♫<i>Beautiful upper pavilion</i>♫

405
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,300
♫<i>Under the noisy drums</i>♫

406
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,440
♫<i> The third glass boat arrived very fast. ♫<i></i></i>

407
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,700
♫<i>Two dragons swim in order</i>♫

408
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,970
♫<i>Water engulfs the white silk</i>♫

409
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:35,180
♫<i>The waves bring the immortal White Empress</i>♫

410
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,020
Let's see how Brother will handle you.

411
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,840
Brother.

412
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,010
Brother.

413
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,730
Last night, I heard Wu Cai Hong singing "Ten Glass Boats" in mom's room

414
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,470
but when I walked there, she had already stopped.

415
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,910
Brother. Wu Cai Hong clearly knows that this is a prohibited song for Mom.

416
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:12,420
If she continues to sing, then she is purposely causing you pain.

417
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,470
Brother.

418
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:19,690
♫<i> The third glass boat arrived very fast. ♫</i>

419
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:24,990
♫<i>Two dragons swim in order</i>♫

420
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,440
What are you doing? You definitely know that you're singing a prohibited song.

421
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,580
You are singing in front of her. What are you scheming?

422
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,870
- I wanted to stimulate...
- Did you forget what I told you yesterday? You are doing this on purpose.

423
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,010
I...

424
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,800
- Madam.
- Mom.

425
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,500
- Mom.
- Did Madam hear me talking?

426
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,650
Young Master. Doctor Zhao is here.

427
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,950
Doctor Zhao. Check my mom now.

428
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,050
Doctor Zhao. What is my mom's condition?

429
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,480
Madam Jiang's recovery is not bad.

430
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,840
Her breathing, blood pressure and heartbeat are not bad now.

431
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,640
Furthermore, she has been laying down for a long time.

432
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,200
Her complexion is ruddy. She doesn't have an inflammation and her joints are fine.

433
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,220
It looks like she has been taken care of very well.

434
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,240
Why did my mom cry then?

435
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,540
Under what condition did she cry?

436
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,910
When she heard that song, it seemed like...

437
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,020
This is a great phenomenon for Madam.

438
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,840
It proves that she can sense what's going out. Perhaps, she will regain her consciousness soon.

439
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,490
If conditions allow, you must stimulate her more.

440
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:59,100
If the song helps, do it then.

441
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,250
I understand.

442
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,710
Doctor. I still have a question to consult you with. Let's talk in the living room.

443
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,800
Okay.

444
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,280
This is from Mr Zhou.

445
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,520
Thanks.

446
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,410
Doctor Zhao. I would like to consult you regarding folklore prescriptions.

447
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,110
Using leeches as medicines,

448
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:36,590
will this help my mom's illness?

449
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:41,290
I studied Western medicine but have also done some research on Oriental medicines.

450
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,210
I recall in Shen Nong's Herbal Classic, there was a written account.

451
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,430
It said that leeches can clear blood clots and stasis.

452
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,790
This medicine with regards to your mother's illness,

453
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,450
from a medicinal perspective, it can help your mother.

454
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,730
I understand.

455
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,870
And also, if my mother's acupuncture points were stimulated and she felt pain,

456
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,500
what's going on?

457
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,950
With regards to Madam Jiang's illness, stimulating the acupuncture points and massages

458
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,890
these will help her.

459
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,750
This is to prevent stiff joints, muscle atrophy

460
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,470
and to keep blood flowing.

461
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,550
If Madam Jiang can feel the pain,

462
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:25,080
this is a great phenomenon.

463
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,550
<i>Cai Hong. I know that you are not having a hard time at the Jiang's home.</i>

464
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:42,050
<i>This medicine can help fight infections. I will go to you soon to save you.</i>

465
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:46,020
<i>Your family and I are well.</i>

466
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,980
<i>The seven rainbow bracelet is not worth much money. This is my lover's keepsake.</i>

467
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,710
<i>Now that it's in Jiang Yu's hands,</i>

468
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,500
<i>I will think of a way to get it back.</i>

469
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:19,250
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

470
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,420
I have seen enough stupid people

471
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,500
but I have never seen someone as stupid as you.

472
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,480
Idiot.

473
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:00,550
- Come up.
-You realise now that leeches are beneficial?

474
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,920
- Let me do it.
- No need.

475
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,830
I'm a maid of the Jiang family. This should be done by me.

476
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,240
When I was young, I handled lobsters and prawns. I know how to do this. Let me do it.

477
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,090
This is not the same fish you are used to.

478
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,840
Thus, let me do it instead.

479
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,430
Why do you know so much?
