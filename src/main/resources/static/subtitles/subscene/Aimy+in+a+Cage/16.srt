<i>Episode 16</i>

20
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,040
Zhou Shao Tian could have prospered recently

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,840
after becoming the General Manager of Rong Da.

22
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,860
He returned the money to me in less than two days.

23
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,860
So, you are sure that Zhou Shao Tian lately

24
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,750
didn't come here to borrow any money from you?

25
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,700
Yes. I haven't make a mistake regarding this.

26
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,720
In the past, he forced me to lend him money,

27
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,690
it was for desperate measures.

28
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,100
Didn't you suspect that Zhou Shao Tian stole your money?

29
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,730
Why are you checking on whether he has borrowed any money?

30
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,550
Don't be anxious first.

31
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,830
Record what Boss Qian just said

32
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,540
and let him sign the statement.

33
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,060
- Why are you doing this? <br>- Just follow what I said.

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,800
Boss Qian, I will have to trouble you.

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,770
If Zhou Shao Tian were to look for you to borrow money again,

36
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,280
please notify me and Miss Wu immediately.

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,710
Okay, don't worry. I will.

38
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,300
-Boss Jiang, I bid you farewell. <br>-Alright

39
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,540
Thank you, Boss. Let's go.

40
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,630
I won't be seeing you off.

41
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,770
Have a smooth journey.

42
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,720
We have traveled to all the banks in Huzhou.

43
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,690
Finally, we are at the last stop.

44
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,190
We are here.

45
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,440
Sir, please take care.

46
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,900
Director Chen Suo, much welcome. You took a long drive to visit.

47
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,930
- Please come in. <br>- No need.

48
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,100
We are here today because Mr Jiang would like to ask you some questions. Just answer him.

49
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,230
Okay. Mr Jiang, please ask.

50
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,420
It's very simple. Please check for me if

51
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,610
Zhou Shao Tian came here to borrow money from you?

52
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,790
Zhou Shao Tian?

53
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,080
- Are you referring to Zhou Shao Tian from Rong Da? <br>- Yes.

54
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,310
- He didn't come here. <br>- Are you sure?

55
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,650
Definitely.

56
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,990
Boss Meng.

57
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,890
Please sign the statement here.

58
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,500
And also, if he comes here to borrow money from you,

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,650
- please let us know. <br>-Okay, please wait.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,270
Jiang Yu, we were busy all day long with Director Chen Suo.

61
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,510
Can you tell me what you are doing?

62
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,290
You only need to record the results today that

63
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,490
none of the money lenders gave any loans to Zhou Shao Tian.

64
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,790
You still suspect that Brother Shao Tian stole the money, right?

65
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,420
We need to establish the facts.

66
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:02,970
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

67
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,490
Please.

68
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,660
Young Master. Mr Zhang is here.

69
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,580
Old Zhang. You are here.

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,030
I heard that you are the broker for the Wu house.

71
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,040
I'm interested in it.

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,780
Sell it to me.

73
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,590
The cash is here.

74
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,620
This...

75
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,520
You didn't even look at it and you are giving me the money?

76
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,420
What is there to see? I don't need to see it.

77
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,070
Accept the money.

78
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,730
Mr Jiang. I can't accept this because before your offer,

79
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,540
I already promised this to a Mr Zhou.

80
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,340
He already saw the Wu house.

81
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,250
He's going to sign the contract tomorrow.

82
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,160
Rest assured, I have the names of other places.

83
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,610
I will take you to see them another day.

84
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,200
Didn't you just say that

85
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,450
you only made a verbal agreement with that Zhou guy?

86
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,760
I know the rules of selling a house too.

87
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,270
Whoever pays the cash first gets the house, right?

88
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,590
That's right.

89
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,500
The full cash is here.

90
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,420
I will be able to sign the contract with the owner tomorrow.

91
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,120
Cash in exchange for the contract.

92
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,730
What?

93
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,390
You don't trust my financial status?

94
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,770
I have complete confidence in your financial status.

95
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,340
It's just that regarding Mr Zhou,

96
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,360
I really don't know what to tell him.

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,860
Old Zhang. How could you be the broker?

98
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,580
You don't even know who you should sell the house to.

99
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,680
I already paid in cash. We can only blame that Zhou guy

100
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,470
for not having a destiny with that house.

101
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,290
To add further, regarding your verbal agreement,

102
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,730
who knows if there will be any changes tomorrow. Isn't that so?

103
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,410
Okay. You are both the buyers.

104
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,410
I can't afford to offend the both of you. Okay.

105
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,220
Since you have paid in cash first,

106
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,860
I can only say that you are destined to own that house.

107
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,030
This is the right way.

108
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,120
If that Zhou guy gives you a hard time tomorrow,

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,460
just tell him that I bought it.

110
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,850
Let's see if he dares to say anything.

111
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,260
Okay.

112
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,550
Keep the cash properly.

113
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,820
Thank you very much. Mr Jiang.

114
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,430
I will wait for you news tomorrow.

115
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,720
Hello.

116
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,330
Sorry, Mr Zhou. I'm late.

117
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,870
Where is the owner?

118
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,240
Mr Zhou.

119
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,940
I regret to inform you that the Wu house

120
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,320
has already been bought by Boss Jiang.

121
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,740
Boss Jiang? Which Boss Jiang?

122
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,370
Are you referring to Jiang Yu?

123
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,990
In the entire Huzhou, who can afford to buy the Wu house?

124
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,270
How many Jiangs would there be?

125
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,610
Old Zhang. We already agreed yesterday that

126
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,480
we would sign the contract today.

127
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,940
In a matter of a night,

128
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,510
you accepted someone else's cash

129
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,700
and sold the house.

130
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,900
I couldn't stop it.

131
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,180
You know the rich and powerful Boss Jiang.

132
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,190
He paid in cash yesterday.

133
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,810
According the the rules of the sales of houses,

134
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,030
whoever pays in cash first will get the house.

135
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,100
I can't do anything about this.

136
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,120
You couldn't do anything?

137
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,370
Jiang Yu's face has face.

138
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,880
Doesn't my face have any value either?

139
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,880
I didn't mean that. You are both rich.

140
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,420
I had a chance to do it. (sell)

141
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,320
To tell you the truth, Mr Jiang specifically asked me yesterday.

142
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,770
He wanted me to tell you that the house belongs to him.

143
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,600
Do you think he would give it up?

144
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,210
Return the money to him now.

145
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,300
Pay him back double.

146
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,300
Go and tell the owner of this house again that

147
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,150
I will give him another price.

148
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,270
This house...

149
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,280
I must have it.

150
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,610
Old Zhang.

151
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,300
Your way of doing business is not typical.

152
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,740
You clearly know that I like that house. So how?

153
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,430
- Are you trying to raise the price again? <br>- No.

154
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,780
Mr Jiang. I don't mean that.

155
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,720
I just meant that,

156
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,700
I only get a small commission.

157
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,150
To add further, anyone can buy the house.

158
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,360
The sooner it's done, my business will conclude earlier.

159
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,970
Right?

160
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,770
Tell me.

161
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,540
- What's going on? <br>- Don't you know that

162
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,610
this Mr Zhou is Zhou Shao Tian, the General Manager of Rong Da?

163
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,990
This week was the first time anyone was eyeing this place.

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,430
He is willing to pay double the price and refund your money.

165
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,410
It is forcing a bid for the price to buy the house.

166
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,580
The owner of the house will accept the highest offer.

167
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,300
Hence, I'm here today to discuss this with you.

168
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,260
Could you let Mr Zhou have the house?

169
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,150
This is the only reason? You should have told me earlier.

170
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,290
If it's because of money, I have the money and can offer a higher price too.

171
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,320
I like this house.

172
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,400
Why don't we do this, Old Zhang?

173
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,400
I can offer a higher price.

174
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,370
I recommend we take this out on the balcony.

175
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,810
Since Mr Zhou wants to fight with me over the Wu's house,

176
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,910
I suggest an open auction.

177
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,270
The highest bidder gets the house.

178
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,130
You are telling me this for what reason?

179
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,420
This house has been on sale for a long time.

180
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,440
He didn't want to buy it earlier and insisted on waiting for me to buy it first.

181
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,200
He counted his money after I made my offer.

182
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,790
Mr Zhou. I'm only just the runner.

183
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,920
If Mr Jiang is not willing to withdraw his money,

184
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,150
there is nothing I can do.

185
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,270
Old Zhang. What did I tell you?

186
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,900
This house,

187
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,440
I must buy it.

188
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,300
I can offer any amount of money.

189
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,020
How to buy it,

190
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,370
I will leave it to you.

191
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,040
Since this is the case,

192
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,750
where both of you want to buy it,

193
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,800
as fair competition, I will talk to the owner of the house.

194
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,110
Since you will engage in bidding,

195
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,100
you and Mr Jiang can bid for it at the highest price.

196
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,970
What do you think?

197
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,040
Public auction?

198
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,220
Did Jiang Yu give you this idea?

199
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,750
Mr Zhou is wise.

200
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,400
Fine.

201
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,140
I will play this game with him

202
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,120
till the end.

203
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,510
<i>br</i>

204
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:33,190
Brother. Everyone in the streets of Huzhou are saying that

205
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,750
you are doing this from anger that steams with Zhou Shao Tian.

206
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,800
They are betting that when you buy the Wu mansion,

207
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,500
you are doing it for Wu Cai Hong.

208
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,710
It's quite interesting.

209
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,570
Brother. What's going on?

210
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,150
You are really going to buy the Wu's house?

211
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,940
It can't be because of Wu Cai Hong.

212
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,800
I don't lack a house to live in. Why should I buy a house?

213
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,950
Why are you doing this then?

214
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,310
You can't tolerate unscrupulous businessmen and you don't like publicity.

215
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,660
Yet you are going to do a public auction.

216
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,710
What do you have up your sleeve?

217
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,310
<i>Mom</i>

218
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,590
<i>It's here.</i>

219
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,320
<i>Come and take a look now.</i>

220
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,250
<i>It's here.</i>

221
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,070
<i>Come and take a look now.</i>

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,580
<i>Mom</i>

223
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,180
<i>Be careful.</i>

224
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,810
<i>Man Man. Why are you so careless? Are you okay?</i>

225
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,180
<i>I'm okay. As long as mom is here,</i>

226
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,200
<i>I'm not afraid of anything.</i>

227
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,730
<i>Xiao Man. You are such a good girl.</i>

228
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,720
<i>Mom, can you gift this to me?</i>

229
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,870
<i>Please, mom. Please, mom.</i>

230
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,500
<i>Fine. As long as you like it,</i>

231
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,530
<i>I will leave the best for you.</i>

232
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,600
<i>Thank you, mom. I love you so much, mom.</i>

233
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,820
Who is it?

234
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,290
Miss. It's me.

235
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,250
Come in.

236
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,630
Miss.

237
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,120
What is it?

238
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,620
We already checked into that Ma Li person.

239
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,690
Zhou Shao Tian helped check.

240
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,580
When Jiang Yu's father, Jiang Wen Yuan was convicted, he committed suicide.

241
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,400
Zhou Shao Tian is wondering if Jiang Wen Yuan was wronged.

242
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,150
This didn't concern Wu Hong Da at all.

243
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,190
I get it. Send a few men

244
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:24,030
and follow Zhou Shao Tian and his henchman.

245
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,000
Miss. Are you interested in the grudges

246
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,700
between the Jiang and Wu families too?

247
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,600
I'm not interested in their grudges at all.

248
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,400
What I'm interested in is whether the Jiang family has the secret recipe.

249
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,480
I want to know

250
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,840
after Wu Hong Da died,

251
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,460
who is holding the secret recipe.

252
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,340
I wonder between Jiang Yu and Zhou Shao Tian,

253
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,700
which is richer?

254
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,130
I think it's Jiang Yu.

255
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,030
Zhou Shao Tian is a rising star

256
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,630
with sudden riches. Then he has money.

257
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,640
I don't think Zhou Shao Tian will win in the auction.

258
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,830
I heard he and Old Wu had history.

259
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,470
I heard that Zhou Shao Tian is the boyfriend of the eldest daughter of the Wu family.

260
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,410
He wants to win her love.

261
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,380
That is how he thought of this idea to buy back the Wu's house.

262
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,640
You don't understand this. Jiang Yu and Zhou Shao Tian

263
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,330
are level headed people. Would they fight over a house?

264
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,310
They are in the same industry. They are not just fighting over this house.

265
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,810
It's for business and to vent.

266
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,250
Everyone, we are starting.

267
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,330
Those who are with Zhou Shao Tian, leave your money on my left.

268
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,240
Those who are with Jiang Yu, leave your money on my right.

269
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,800
Grab this chance now. It's a 50-50 chance.

270
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,640
<i>It's a rare opportunity in our village.</i>

271
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,210
<i>You have to spend money to make money.</i>

272
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,280
<i>Everyone. Let's ask Mr Jiang.</i>

273
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,190
<i>What amount are you willing to bid for the Wu mansion?</i>

274
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,270
<i>It's really just like what the rumours say. He's doing this to win Miss Wu's heart.</i>

275
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,880
<i>Mr Jiang. Do you need to win in this auction today?</i>

276
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,820
- Just wait and see. <br>- How long are you going to continue to compete with Mr Zhou?

277
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,200
Come. Please leave seats for them.

278
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,060
Old Zhang, it's not bad.

279
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,770
You got that many people within such a short period of time.

280
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,160
It's a small task.

281
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,380
Thank you Boss Jiang. In the future, if you need anything, let me know and your wish is my command.

282
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,250
Mr Jiang, Miss Wu. Please take a seat.

283
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,750
- Can we start now? <br>- Yes.

284
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,970
Mr Zhou, what about you?

285
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,770
Dear everyone. Today, I am

286
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,550
commissioned by the owner to head up the auction of this location,

287
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,180
the Wu mansion.

288
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,230
As promised, I will introduce two guests to the auction.

289
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,550
One is the boss of Ling Long, Mr Jiang Yu.

290
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,140
Great.

291
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,190
The other is the General Manager of Rong Da, Mr Zhou Shao Tian.

292
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,210
Great, Mr Zhou.

293
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,330
Mr Zhou.

294
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,510
Our rules are very simple.

295
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,550
The two sides will take turns bidding.

296
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,720
We will wait for the highest bid

297
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,130
and he will then become the new owner of the Wu's house.

298
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,810
This auction will be done in cash,

299
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,410
and the agreement will be signed in public in a fair manner.

300
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,780
I will announce the start of the auction now.

301
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,780
The Wu house is starting at

302
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,170
$200,000.

303
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,980
Mr Jiang offered this price.

304
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,910
<i>It was $100,000 two days ago.</i>

305
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,690
$200,000 going once.

306
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,870
<i>How much money is that?</i>

307
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,040
$200,00 going twice.

308
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,520
Mr Zhou bid for $220,000.

309
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,720
<i>$220,000?</i>

310
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,630
$220,000 going once.

311
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,040
$220,000 going twice.

312
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,900
Mr Jiang offered $200,000.

313
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,250
He is going to raise the offer now.

314
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,400
$250,000.

315
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,150
It's now $250,000.

316
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,050
$250,000 going once.

317
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,440
Guess how much your Brother Shao Tian will spend.

318
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,730
Mr Jiang offered a new price just now. It's $250,000.

319
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,600
Where did Brother Shao Tian get that much money?

320
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,460
You can ask him later.

321
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,510
$250,000 going twice.

322
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,260
Mr Jiang offered $250,000.

323
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,920
Let's see whether Mr Zhou will raise the bid.

324
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,850
Mr Zhou raised the price to $260,000.

325
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,410
$260,000.

326
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,620
$300,000.

327
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,450
$260,000 going once.

328
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,430
Mr Jiang raised his price again.

329
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,170
Mr Jiang bid for $300,000.

330
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,950
It's $300,000.

331
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,730
$300,000 going once.

332
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,260
$300,000 going twice.

333
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,140
Great. Mr Zhou has raised a new price.

334
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,600
$310,000.

335
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,360
$350,000.

336
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,880
$310,000 going once. $310,000 going twice.

337
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,830
$350,000.

338
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,480
Mr Jiang latest bid is $350,000.

339
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,390
$350,000 going once.

340
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,370
Why did you raise the bid that high?

341
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,700
Don't worry. The price I bid for

342
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,920
is higher than Zhou Shao Tian absolute price. Just watch.

343
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,200
Is this the last offer?

344
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,630
He won't dare to counter-offer.

345
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,080
$350,000 going once.

346
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,280
What if he doesn't bid for it?

347
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,580
You should be concerned

348
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,030
about where

349
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,340
he got such a big sum of money from.

350
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,810
$350,000 going twice.

351
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,840
I don't think anyone will counter offer the price.

352
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,560
<i>I think this will end soon.</i>

353
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,110
<i>How could they bid further?</i>

354
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,740
Does Mr Zhou wants to raise the bid?

355
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,330
$400,000.

356
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,930
$400,000! Mr Zhou raised the bid to $400,000.

357
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,690
It's already reached an astronomical price.

358
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,760
Let's see if the bid can go above $400,000.

359
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,050
$400,000 going once.

360
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,180
$400, 000 going twice.

361
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,380
$480,000.

362
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,190
$480,000.

363
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,110
Mr Jiang raised the bid to $480,000.

364
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,840
The Wu's family starting price was from $200,000 to $480,000.

365
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,640
That's an astronomical price!

366
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,400
I wonder if this bid will be a new record.

367
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,270
$500,000.

368
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,690
The Wu's house is now worth $500,000.

369
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,780
It seems like Mr. Zhou is determined to win the Wu house

370
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,840
We have the honor of being in his presence.

371
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,360
This is a legendary moment.

372
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,220
I would like to ask Mr Jiang if he would like to raise the bid.

373
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,390
Or are you going this to start a new rumour again?

374
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,620
- Will this be a new record? <br>- Raise the bid, Mr Jiang.

375
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,960
<i>My money is on you. I can't lose.</i>

376
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,340
<i>If not, we will lose.</i>

377
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,110
<i>We will need to pay.</i>

378
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,560
I'm announcing that Mr Jiang has given up on the bid.

379
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,260
He has given up.

380
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,740
Everyone. Please stay and witness the signing of the contract.

381
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,730
Let's congratulate Mr Zhou again.

382
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,900
<i>Congratulations.</i>

383
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,110
<i>Mr Zhou.</i>

384
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,900
<i>Congratulations, Mr Zhou.</i>

385
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,090
Mr Zhou, congratulations.

386
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,770
Let me make the introductions. This is the owner of the house.

387
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,920
Please hand in the money and sign the contract at the same time.

388
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,360
Once it's done, you are the owner of the Wu's house.

389
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,430
<i>I have never seen this before.</i>

390
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,660
Everyone, keep quiet for a moment.

391
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,860
I would like to take this opportunity to announce something.

392
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,400
I'm going to give away the Wu's house to someone sitting here.

393
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,700
<i>Who is he giving it to?</i>

394
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,740
Miss Wu Cai Hong.

395
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,090
It's Miss Wu.

396
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,730
Everyone heard this.

397
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,890
This house belongs to the Wu family in the first place.

398
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,600
And today, it's returned to its rightful owner.

399
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,240
I'm using this opportunity

400
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,340
to also tell her that

401
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,350
I, Zhou Shao Tian,

402
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,760
starting from today, I will do my best to protect her.

403
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,250
Cai Hong.

404
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,600
I have gotten your family's mansion back.

405
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,780
Where did you get such a big sum of money from?

406
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,380
I'm the General Manager of Rong Da.

407
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,300
Does the General Manger of Rong Da command such a high salary?

408
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,380
Don't try to lie to us.

409
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,110
Your contract is still with her.

410
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,800
I hold 30 percent of the shares in Rong Da.

411
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,160
You just started operations and you are already successful?

412
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,870
I borrowed money from the moneylenders. I will return the loan when I'm successful.

413
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,650
- Not from a bank.<br> - Take a seat.

414
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,650
This

415
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,980
proves that you didn't take out any loans.

416
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,090
Why did you lie to me?

417
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,440
Did my father misjudge the wrong person? Did I too?

418
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,850
What's going on?

419
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:29,720
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

420
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,450
Mr Zhou.

421
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,250
Okay, you are still crying?

422
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,410
Isn't it good that you saw his true colours early

423
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,990
before things grew.

424
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,370
Perhaps, that money

425
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,620
was a loan taken out by Brother Zhou from the moneylenders.

426
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,540
Don't lie to yourself anymore.

427
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,860
If he managed to borrow that much money for the house,

428
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,790
would you need to leave Huzhou then?

429
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,350
Young Master. Zhou Shao Tian is here.

430
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,170
He said that it's urgent and he needs to see Miss Wu Cai Hong.

431
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,170
What's so good about seeing her except to listen to his conman stories?

432
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,820
Tell him to leave.

433
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:54,810
Perhaps, I should listen to his explanations.

434
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,990
Take everything into account

435
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,000
and think over it carefully.

436
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,570
In the past, when you went to check the accounts of Ling Long,

437
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,240
they were burnt. Other than yourself,

438
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,680
who else knew about this?

439
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,260
Fine. If you say that I burnt them. If I really wanted to burn them,

440
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,560
would I wait until that day?

441
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,160
Also, when you when to Old Cai's home,

442
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,920
in the end, you lost your way.

443
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,720
When you arrived, he and his wife already left.

444
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,510
Other than yourself, did you tell Zhou Shao Tian about it?

445
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:42,550
Brother Shao Tian and the carriage guy knew each other.

446
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,700
It was Zhou Shao Tian who intentionally let the carriage guy brought you there and lost the way.

447
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,790
This wasn't the case. When Fu Sheng started operations,

448
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,350
I met that carriage guy and found out

449
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,050
that he grew up with Brother Shao Tian.

450
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,890
When Brother Shao Tian started Fu Sheng, he asked him over to help him.

451
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,420
Regarding him taking me and losing the way,

452
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,980
Brother Shao Tian didn't know about it.

453
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,140
You believe such lies?

454
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,050
Think about it again. When I brought you to meet Old Cai's lover,

455
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,880
she also got killed in the end.

456
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,010
Other than you,

457
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,700
did Zhou Shao Tian know about this too?

458
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,950
- <i>Sir, I would like to ask you... <br>- You don't have the money, right? I'm not taking you.</i>

459
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,290
<i>Half of the fare? I will take you there.</i>

460
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,570
<i>I'm certain it is there.</i>

461
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,190
<i>The Cai family's home should be ahead.</i>

462
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,440
<i>Why do I feel that we are going the wrong way?</i>

463
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,140
<i>We have gone too far out of the way. </i>

464
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,950
<i>Cai Hong. Last night,</i>

465
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:47,110
<i>why were you with Jiang Yu?</i>

466
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,460
<i>Miss Wu.</i>

467
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,720
<i>Why is it you?</i>

468
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,420
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

469
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,220
<i>Brother Shao Tian. He...</i>

470
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,950
<i>Do you know each other?</i>

471
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,900
Mr Zhou. It's better that you leave. Miss Wu Cai Hong doesn't want to see you.

472
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,970
Tell me... is it that Cai Hong is not willing to see me

473
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,330
or Jiang Yu doesn't allow her to see me?

474
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,230
Mr Zhou. Please don't make it difficult for us.

475
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,500
I'm only relaying the message. Please go back.

476
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:35,510
♫<i> Once I thought to account for the end.</i>♫

477
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,060

492

<i>When your father passed away, the police took</i>

493
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,740
<i>all the ledgers that were sealed.</i>

494
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,980
<i>A few days ago, when the police delivered the ledgers</i>

495
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,890
<i>they were sealed in secret.</i>

496
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,390
<i>Do you know where he kept in the ledger?</i>

497
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,140
<i>No but I think that</i>

498
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,560
<i>since the police have concluded the investigation,</i>

499
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,870
<i>there shouldn't be any problems with the ledger.</i>

500
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,710
<i>Sure enough, this is not what I expected that</i>

501
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,190
<i>they went to Old Cai's hometown.</i>

502
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,120
<i>Brother Shao Tian, can you go with me when I leave today?</i>

503
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,200
<i>I'm afraid I can't today as I have made an appointment for my mother with the hospital.</i>

504
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,260
<i>She is sick. Why don't we go tomorrow?</i>

505
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,430
<i>It's only just a day's difference.</i>

506
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,790
<i>What Jiang Yu said is logical. Every time,</i>

507
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,760
<i>Brother Shao Tian always had an excuse to delay. Brother Shao Tian,</i>

508
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,590
<i>I don't know how to trust you.</i>

509
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,640
Madam. This is a small gesture.

510
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,840
It's not small at all.

511
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,930
You are rich now. How could your gift be small?

512
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,990
Cai Yun. Brew the best tea for Brother Shao Tian now.

513
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,270
Brother Shao Tian, take a seat first. I'm going to brew tea for you.

514
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,870
Come, Shao Tian. Sit.

515
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,660
Sit down now.

516
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,180
A few days ago, at the auction,

517
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,850
you bought our home. I read it in the newspapers.

518
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,630
You are young and promising! Our Cai Hong

519
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,860
has good tastes for choosing you as her husband.

520
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,510
Madam. Thank you for your compliment.

521
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,220
If you don't mind, I will send someone to take you and Cai Yun there

522
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,830
to let you live at the Wu mansion as soon as possible.

523
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,170
Look at you. Seriously.

524
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,470
Why are you still calling me Madam? Call me Mother.

525
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,920
How distant. <br>Quick, quick, quick.

526
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,900
Come, have your tea.

527
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,230
My husband really had good tastes.

528
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,490
He chose such a good son-in-law.

529
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,790
Cai Yun and I will benefit from your association.

530
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,080
Mom. I remember that in the past,

531
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,630
you didn't say this about Brother Shao Tian.

532
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,380
Child. Why are you butting in when adults are talking.

533
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,500
Go and play over there.

534
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,440
This child.

535
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,350
Madam, don't worry.

536
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,280
As long as I'm alive, I will let you and Cai Yun

537
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,630
live a good life like before.

538
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,800
As for Cai Hong and I, no one can come between us.

539
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,020
Who?

540
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,870
Who dares to stop you? Whoever dares to do that?

541
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,760
As her mother, I will be the first to dissent.

542
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,140
You and Cai Hong are the perfect couple! <br><i>a talented scholar and a beautiful woman</i>

543
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,540
Your relationship is so good.

544
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,240
As her mother, of course, I will use my hands

545
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,880
and also my legs to approve.

546
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,560
Since this is the case,

547
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,220
there is a favour I would like to ask from you.

548
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,230
You are going to be family soon.

549
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,130
Why are you still asking for favours?

550
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,670
Even if you have a hundred requests, I will agree.

551
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,800
I will thank you first then, Mother.

552
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,080
Sorry to disturb you.

553
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,860
I would like to ask if you are a maid for the Jiang family.

554
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,930
Yes.

555
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,990
What is it?

556
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,380
Could you please pass this to Wu Cai Hong?

557
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,690
- This... <br>- Please.

558
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,740
This is from her sister.

559
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,720
Her mother is sick. She would like her to go home for a while.

560
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,160
Okay, I will help you with this.

561
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,040
Please accept this as a small gesture.

562
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,550
Tell her that her sister sent this.

563
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,370
Don't worry, I will remember this.

564
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:24,940
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

565
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,690
- This is from your sister. <br>- Thanks.

566
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,060
Please watch the fire for me. When the soup is ready, deliver this.

567
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,420
Where are you going?

568
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,250
I have some urgent matters. I'm going to ask Young Master for time off.

569
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,300
What's so urgent?

570
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,710
Someone delivered a note to say that my mother is sick.

571
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,770
I would like to take the day off to visit her.

572
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,030
Is it serious?

573
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,190
I'm not very clear about it either.

574
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,160
In any case, I don't have anything to do today. I will go back with you.

575
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,290
No need. I can go home alone.

576
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:23,770
What if you need to send her to the hospital or need medicine, do you have the money?

577
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,190
Cai Hong.

578
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,110
Why is it you? Where is my Mom and Cai Yun?

579
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,480
I sent men to take your mother and Cai Yun to the Wu's home.

580
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,420
But Cai Yun wrote to say that my mom is sick. What's wrong with her?

581
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,900
She is fine. I miss you. That's why I asked her for a favour.

582
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,010
You lied to me?

583
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:00,910
- I'm going to tell them. <br>- Cai Hong.

584
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,980
- I don't want this money from an unknown source. <br>- Don't leave. Listen to my explanation.

585
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,430
Let me go. I don't want to listen to your explanations.

586
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,360
I would like to listen to your explanations on where you got the money from.

587
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,710
Why are you everywhere?

588
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,960
Who are you to Wu Cai Hong?

589
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,130
Why should I explain it to you?

590
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:21,600
Brother Shao Tian, I'm asking you. The money you used to buy my family home,

591
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,170
did it belong to Ling Long?

592
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,840
Think carefully before you explain.

593
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,820
Once you start a lie, it will be the beginning of a thousand more lies.

594
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,950
I borrowed that money from Miss Lu Man.

595
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:42,000
Miss Lu Man lent you $500,000?

596
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,050
Why would she lend that to you?

597
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,350
The loan was part of my condition.

598
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,130
What condition?

599
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,040
Lu Man requested a very difficult thing.

600
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,440
It will be very risky to complete the task.

601
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,150
It may be at the expense of my life

602
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,800
but I already promised her.

603
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,310
What task is that which will require risking your life?

604
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:07,150
It's not very clear now. It seems to have something to do with General Lu Du.

605
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,530
It is a military secret.

606
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,980
Cai Hong.

607
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,590
Other than this life,

608
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,960
I don't have anything else.

609
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,840
If I lose you again,

610
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,500
will there be any more meaning in my life?

611
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,710
Being able to use my life to repay for the kindness of your family,

612
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,370
I think it's worth it.

613
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,690
Are you crazy?

614
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,970
What could be more important than life?

615
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,310
Wake up.

616
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,620
- You could even believe this? <br>- I already signed a life and death contract with Lu Man.

617
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,660
Is your life and death contract similar to your contract as the General Manager?

618
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,020
A shake of a hand and you could get $1 million.

619
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,520
I have only one life.

620
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,350
But for Cai Hong,

621
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,860
I can do anything.

622
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,710
I don't want the house.

623
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:07,110
I want you to sell it and return the money to Lu Man.

624
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,470
It's already too late.

625
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,720
Don't listen to his nonsense. Let's go.

626
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,350
Cai Hong.

627
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,690
Trust me.

628
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,390
Brother Shao Tian.

629
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:52,200
I hope that your family and mine will be safe and live in peace.

630
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,560
Also, don't lie to me again.

631
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,510
I'm not lying.

632
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,180
Whether you want to accept the house or not, it's not important.

633
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,410
It's from my sincere heart.

634
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:12,490
Moreover, the Wu's house belongs to you in the first place.

635
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,270
<i>Zhou Shao Tian.</i>

636
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,130
<i>Let's see how long you can last.</i>

637
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,910
Do you believe what he just said?

638
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,650
I don't know but I really didn't need him to spend so much money

639
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,090
to buy back my family home.

640
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:10,360
I only hope that he has been sincere towards me

641
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,620
with his sincere feelings.

642
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,460
What Zhou Shao Tian just said,

643
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,440
I don't believe a single word of it.

644
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,460
But the truth is not that far away. I really want to see

645
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,790
how long he can last.

646
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,600
Boss. Do you remember this fountain pen?

647
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,860
Mr Jiang. How could I not remember? This is from my shop.

648
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,630
What's wrong? Is there any problems?

649
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,750
No. I would like to ask you.

650
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:56,580
Other than me, did you sell this fountain pen to anyone else?

651
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,850
No because this fountain pen is rare.

652
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,250
Do you remember when you first bought this fountain pen,

653
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,680
there was an extremely beautiful woman who wanted to buy it too. She was wiling to pay a higher price.

654
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,450
If I had the product, I would have sold it to her earlier.

655
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,100
Okay, I know.

656
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,480
Sorry, Mr Jiang. We don't sell this fountain pen in my shop.

657
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,200
Only rich and people with status could buy such a fountain pen.

658
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,340
They would have to order this from overseas

659
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,070
and use the local agent to deliver it here.

660
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,770
I would like to trouble you to check

661
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:28,390
the overseas address of this fountain pen.
