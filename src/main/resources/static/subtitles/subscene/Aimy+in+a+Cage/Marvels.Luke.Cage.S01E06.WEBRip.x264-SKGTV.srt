00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,087
[Trish] <i>If you're just joining us,</i>
<i>this is</i> Trish Talk

4
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,797
<i>and we are discussing the recent events</i>

5
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:30,216
<i>that have the residents</i>
<i>of Harlem confused,</i>

6
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,010
<i>and some even frightened.</i>

7
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:34,345
<i>Line one. Sophia, you're on the air.</i>

8
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,973
[Sophia] <i>Luke Cage is turning</i>
<i>the neighborhood upside down</i>

9
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,266
<i>and giving it a good shake.</i>

10
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:40,101
<i>Trust me, no one wants to see</i>
<i>what falls out.</i>

11
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:43,146
[Trish] <i>Are you suggesting we turn</i>
<i>a blind eye to the problems in our city?</i>

12
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,480
[Sophia] <i>No, but I seen the news.</i>

13
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,025
<i>The man is so strong,</i>
<i>he doesn't have to answer to anybody.</i>

14
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,818
<i>Can you trust a person like that?</i>

15
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:51,320
<i>Let the police do their jobs.</i>
<i>That's what I say.</i>

16
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:52,656
[Trish] <i>Some would argue the boys in blue</i>

17
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,324
<i>don't exactly have</i>
<i>a sterling reputation these days.</i>

18
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:56,534
[Sophia] <i>Oh, yeah, missy?</i>

19
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:58,912
<i>Well, the next time trouble comes</i>
<i>banging at your door,</i>

20
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:01,414
<i>maybe you should call Luke Cage</i>
<i>instead of 911.</i>

21
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,541
[Trish chuckles] <i>You know what, Sophia?</i>
<i>I just might.</i>

22
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,459
<i>Uh, let's take another caller.</i>

23
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:06,920
<i>Line two. Hi, Amir.</i>

24
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,421
[Amir] <i>Hey, Trish,</i>
<i>I want to respond to that lady</i>

25
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:09,756
<i>'cause she's got it all wrong.</i>

26
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,716
<i>I know Luke. He comes into the fish fry.</i>

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,802
<i>Always treats my wife and me with respect.</i>

28
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:15,679
<i>Last week, two kids started a fight,</i>

29
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:17,471
<i>Luke took care of it</i>
<i>and nobody got hurt.</i>

30
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:21,434
[Trish] <i>I think it's noteworthy that the</i>
<i>only people I've spoken to that criticize</i>

31
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,477
<i>are the ones</i>
<i>who don't know him personally.</i>

32
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,313
<i>So many others</i>
<i>have merely read about him</i>

33
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:27,774
<i>or saw him on the news</i>
<i>and jumped to conclusions.</i>

34
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,944
[Amir] <i>Trish, Luke is good people</i>
<i>and he belongs right here in Harlem.</i>

35
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:33,446
<i>And I think it's important for all of us</i>
<i>to realize something.</i>

36
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:37,200
<i>We are witnessing a massive shift</i>
<i>in the boundaries of possibility.</i>

37
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:40,619
<i>But what is scary to some</i>
<i>inspires hope in others.</i>

38
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:44,833
<i>I, for one, would like to thank Luke Cage</i>
<i>for all the work he's doing in Harlem.</i>

39
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,961
<i>Those of us below 110th</i>
<i>see the good work he's doing</i>

40
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,628
<i>and we hope he's doing well.</i>

41
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:10,399
I never thought I'd be happy
to see your ugly face.

42
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,028
Well, we all can't be as pretty as you.

43
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:16,322
[laughs] Ain't that the truth.

44
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,782
You got the goods?

45
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:20,284
You know me. I always come correct.

46
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,286
It's all piled up in there,
just waiting for you.

47
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,833
- So we're squared up?
- Mmm, nah. We ain't square.

48
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,335
We a few zeroes off.

49
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:32,797
About $100,000 worth.

50
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,466
[clicks tongue]

51
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:38,511
I'm not givin' you another dime.

52
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,472
Good. I don't need another dime.
I need $100,000.

53
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:45,769
No cash, no guns. No guns, no Domingo.

54
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,187
The ghetto CNN is workin' overtime.

55
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,064
If you don't make it straight
with Domingo, you're done.

56
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:54,360
Plus... I got all your cash in lockup.
Oops.

57
00:03:57,238 --> 00:04:00,909
Think about how you want to spend
the rest of your life, Detective.

58
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,536
[snorts and laughs] Shit!

59
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:12,670
Man, your juice is water since Luke Cage
punked your peacock ass.

60
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,383
[grunts]

61
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:23,389
[both straining]

62
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,855
[groaning]

63
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:37,779
[laughing]

64
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,322
[grunts]

65
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:40,824
[Stokes laughing]

66
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:43,827
[breathing heavily] You shot a cop!

67
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,204
[man] Hey, what's goin' on over there?

68
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:49,123
Hey, man, you all right?

69
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:52,043
[Stokes] When I catch you,
I'm gonna use my hands, bitch.

70
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:54,170
[engine starting]

71
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:58,507
[breathing heavily]

72
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,594
[man] Hey! Hey!

73
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:03,805
[grunts]

74
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,224
[Mariah] <i>I believe in Harlem.</i>

75
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:12,063
You know, my Harlem is saturated
with jazz, and good food,

76
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,774
and the pure genius
that permeates the streets.

77
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:21,197
Harlem is risin'
like a phoenix out of the ashes.

78
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,534
I mean, that's what
all of my various complexes is about,

79
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:27,786
is restoring that luster.

80
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:29,205
Fantastic.

81
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,290
Uh, you mind if we go in now,
Madam Councilwoman?

82
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:32,583
The crew needs to set up for later.

83
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,543
Yeah, of course, of course. Go on.

84
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:38,047
- [sighs]
- Your new VH1 show?

85
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,757
<i>Criminal Spinsters?</i>

86
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:42,843
Who you callin' a spinster?

87
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:45,138
I'd wear your narrow ass out.

88
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,307
What's this about?

89
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:51,477
Your cousin. I'm shutting him down.

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,312
You, too.

91
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:56,524
Are you threatening me?

92
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,984
Never that.

93
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,370
Ah! Come on. Let's go inside.

94
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:15,543
- I ain't no barber, Bobby.
- [Fish] Neither am I, Luke.

95
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,464
But we both agree that Harlem
is a better place with the shop open.

96
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:25,094
As soon as I put Cottonmouth in handcuffs,
I'm ghost.

97
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,264
You could make a career
out of robbing bad guys.

98
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,974
- [chuckles]
- Huh!

99
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:32,435
That would be the perfect grind,
wouldn't it?

100
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,312
You ever think about
playing for the Giants?

101
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,314
[scoffs] You could make that squad easy.

102
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:39,358
[chuckles] Being hood famous
is bad enough.

103
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,569
I couldn't be in the public eye
on that kind of level.

104
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,946
Nah, man.

105
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:46,157
Wear a mask.

106
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,576
What for?

107
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,914
I ain't no hero.

108
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,666
That's a great slogan.

109
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,669
"I ain't no hero. Pay me."

110
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,713
[scoffs] You could market that shit.

111
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:02,966
[chuckling]

112
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,556
[Mariah] What do you mean
you shot him, Cornell?

113
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,892
Cornell! How could you be so stupid?

114
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,437
You didn't have to shoot him.

115
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:20,691
And just let him stick me
for a hundred large?

116
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:23,069
Hell no.

117
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,904
It wasn't like
I went to the meeting strapped.

118
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:27,656
It was his gun that busted off.

119
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,327
But you went there alone
because you knew you were wrong.

120
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,872
[scoffs] This is insane.

121
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,540
If he lives,

122
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:40,419
everything that you have built
will come crashing down.

123
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,965
And you are not dragging me down with you.
You hearin' me?

124
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,384
My guys are pickin' up the guns right now.

125
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,512
We'll hand them over to Domingo tonight.

126
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,848
I don't want the details.
I just want results.

127
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,059
You want results?

128
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:56,602
I don't work for you.

129
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:00,939
Okay, forget the cops.
The cops are bad enough.

130
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,860
- What about Luke Cage?
- Isn't your interview today?

131
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,738
That's where your focus should be.

132
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,117
Givin' off that Geoffrey Canada vibe,
for real.

133
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,368
That's where the money is.

134
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,038
Oh, forget the money, Cornell.

135
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:17,331
Forget the club. Sell it!

136
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,584
Walk away from all this shit.

137
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:26,257
People are still talking about
how tall you stood at Pop's memorial.

138
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,264
I'm proud of you, cousin.

139
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,017
- [sighs]
- I really am.

140
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,563
But I can take care of myself.

141
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:48,946
You need to take his ass out.

142
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,366
It ain't that easy.

143
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:57,080
Cage is bulletproof.
I've seen it myself. It's real.

144
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,624
Does the nigga have gills?

145
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,960
Excuse me?

146
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,003
Drown him.

147
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,966
Can he burn?

148
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,221
Can you poison him?

149
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,686
What about a woman?

150
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,690
You know he got one with his fine ass.

151
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,694
You find his weakness and you squeeze.

152
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,200
You soundin' a lot like Mama Mabel.

153
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:39,205
Don't worry about Cage.

154
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,665
His days are numbered.
I got something for him.

155
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,834
That's my word.

156
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,550
[cell phone ringing]

157
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:55,846
<i>¿Qué pasó?</i>

158
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,641
People, uh, are scrambling around here.

159
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:02,436
My niggas loaded up the stash
right before the cops arrived.

160
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,105
[Perez] <i>What the hell happened?</i>

161
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,356
[exhales]

162
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:11,112
Detective Scarfe
tried to squeeze me for 100 grand.

163
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,072
You put him up to that shit?

164
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,367
Hell no. Of course not.

165
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,411
Let me, uh, let me speak to him.
Where's he at?

166
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:21,747
Bleedin'... and in the wind.

167
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,541
<i>You know what you just did, right?</i>

168
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,460
<i>There's no easy way out of this, man.</i>

169
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,422
Why do you think we're talking?

170
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,848
This is why you need to learn how to text.

171
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,892
You always think the worst.

172
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,189
- What do you need, <i>Mami?</i>
- Not me, you.

173
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,374
Luke?

174
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,794
Yes?

175
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,340
Oh. You probably
don't remember me, do you?

176
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:16,885
Your girlfriend had me take care of you
when you were brought into the hospital?

177
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,472
In Hell's Kitchen?

178
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:22,933
Hey.

179
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:24,977
[chuckles]

180
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,688
Hey. [chuckles]

181
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,774
Bobby. Bobby Fish.

182
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,736
I'm sorry. Claire.
Very nice to meet you.

183
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,946
[Fish] Well, Claire, you...

184
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:40,784
you are far too beautiful
to ever apologize for anything.

185
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,036
You remember that.

186
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,918
- May I?
- Please. [clears throat]

187
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,091
[both sigh]

188
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,852
You didn't have to do
what you did for me.

189
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:10,439
Have you ever saved anyone's life before?

190
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,943
More than once I'm betting.

191
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:17,863
So?

192
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,659
So, the only thing you can think about
afterwards is if they're okay.

193
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,243
That's all I wanted to know.

194
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:27,790
[inhales deeply]

195
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,709
Well...

196
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,671
I'm still here.

197
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,047
How?

198
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:40,260
That shotgun blast alone
should've turned your brain into mush.

199
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,308
So I'm a freak.

200
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,562
No. You're amazing.

201
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,947
I don't wanna be different
than anybody else.

202
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,449
Why hide it?

203
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,493
I mean, what are you gonna do with it?

204
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,456
[sighs]

205
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,710
[exhales]

206
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:17,715
I gotta go.

207
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,982
- Text me later.
- Okay.

208
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,614
[indistinct chatter]

209
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:44,950
Listen up!

210
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,120
I'm hearin' a lot of whispers and rumors

211
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,914
concerning Detective Scarfe
and what he might've been into.

212
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,542
Kill that noise.

213
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:55,753
We need him back alive.

214
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,256
There was a trail of his blood
at the scene.

215
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,510
His car riddled with bullets.
We don't know what the hell happened.

216
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:03,969
Focus on that.

217
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,139
I'm putting out an APB.

218
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,767
We're closing streets, tunnels,
puttin' up road blocks.

219
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,770
Whatever it takes.
But remember something.

220
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:16,482
This belongs in our shop. No one else's.

221
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:22,029
Now, there's already too many
new faces here, far as I'm concerned.

222
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,322
And there're only gonna be more.

223
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:26,992
We need to be the ones to bring him home.

224
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,995
Let's do it.

225
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,419
How, uh... how you holdin' up?

226
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:40,381
I'd be doin' a lot better if people would
stop starin' at me like I'm dirty.

227
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:43,133
What do you know, Detective?
Scarfe must have told you something.

228
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,552
There's evidence that guns

229
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,679
from the junkyard shoot-out
were in that warehouse.

230
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,806
Stolen from our evidence locker?

231
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,141
Your partner is my top suspect.

232
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,310
It doesn't mean Scarfe did it.

233
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:56,063
He probably got a lead,
and went to go and check it out.

234
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:59,316
Alone.
Without pulling you in on a single detail.

235
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,944
Are you sure you don't know
where to find him?

236
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,946
If I knew, I would tell you.

237
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,240
So is that how we're
playing this, Captain?

238
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,242
Like Scarfe is a suspect
and not a victim?

239
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,328
He could be both or either.

240
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,288
We won't know
until you guys bring him in.

241
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,457
Us?

242
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,668
I need my best on this, Detective.
That was you and Scarfe.

243
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:21,338
Now I need you and Perez
to find our boy.

244
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,217
Yes, ma'am.

245
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,306
[sighs]

246
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,058
[Luke] <i>You can disappear.</i>

247
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:37,104
The whole point of livin' in New York,
no one cares about anybody.

248
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:41,567
A building fell on you.
People are shooting at you.

249
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,488
And you walk around without a scratch.
Who's gonna ignore all that?

250
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,619
What's wrong?

251
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,161
It's supposed to be locked.

252
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,749
Bobby? Are you in here, man?

253
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,419
[door closes]

254
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,009
[breathing heavily]

255
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,762
- Scarfe?
- No cops.

256
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,140
- Not even Misty.
- Why me?

257
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,267
'Cause you don't trust us.

258
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,353
We need to get him to a hospital.

259
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,939
No, I can't go to the hospital.
They'll kill me.

260
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,817
[breathing heavily]
Just like they did Chico.

261
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:27,070
They found him, they'll find me.

262
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:29,823
[Claire] He's lost a lot of blood.

263
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,660
Help me get him into the chair. Now.

264
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:38,916
[Scarfe grunts]

265
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,337
Just right here, thank you.

266
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,382
Bobby just bought these chairs.
He's gonna be pissed.

267
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,136
[Perez] You are a weirdo.

268
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:38,308
People at the precinct talk about you
like you are <i>curandera</i> or some shit.

269
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,143
Like you see things. [chuckles]

270
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,189
You remember <i>Where's Waldo?</i>

271
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,734
That was me as a kid.

272
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,819
And I could find Waldo
faster than anybody.

273
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,153
[camera shutter clicking]

274
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,114
That's what a photograph does for me.

275
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,242
A photograph freezes time.

276
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,954
It allows you to look at things,
slow down,

277
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,915
think about what's out of place,
and then fill in the blanks.

278
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,668
That's how you find Waldo.

279
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:09,923
Maybe you should work for Kodak.
That was deep. [chuckles]

280
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,424
[Misty] Whatever.

281
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:16,388
- His clothes are still here, right?
- Yeah.

282
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,808
So, if he wasn't taken,
there's a chance he might come back.

283
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,227
We should stake it out for a while.

284
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,480
Never would have thought
Scarfe would be cute as a kid.

285
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,233
That's not Scarfe. That's his son, Earl.

286
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,861
Never knew he had a kid.

287
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,154
Earl's dead.

288
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,118
Scarfe forgot to lock up
his gun one night.

289
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,704
Earl found it
and accidentally shot himself.

290
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,293
Scarfe cracks a lot of jokes,
but he rarely smiles.

291
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,961
There's a difference.

292
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:51,965
[clears throat]

293
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,553
[gasps]

294
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,138
- [picture frame clatters]
- Oh!

295
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,685
Shut it!

296
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,313
Dusty old bitch.

297
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,110
[sighs]

298
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,990
[Claire] Okay.

299
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,452
I can remove the bullet from his thigh...

300
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,871
but the shot in his side is worse.

301
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,999
If the bullet pierced his liver,
he's gonna have internal bleeding,

302
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,211
- and I can't do anything about that here.
- [sighs]

303
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,378
[groaning]

304
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,131
Give me one good reason
I shouldn't dump you at the 29th.

305
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,926
[breathing heavily] I told you, man.

306
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,554
They're trying to kill me.

307
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,181
[sighs]

308
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,184
- No, no, no. Don't... move.
- [grunting]

309
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,144
Don't get up. Stay right here. Hold.

310
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,562
[groaning]

311
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,735
Who the hell is this?

312
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,987
I'm the woman trying to save your life.

313
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,864
Thank you. Whatever.

314
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,198
[groans]

315
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,118
[sighs]

316
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,205
Well, this is gonna sting a lot.

317
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,249
[breathing heavily]

318
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:16,174
Ah! God!

319
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,467
[whimpering]

320
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,720
[groaning]

321
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,142
I think I'm gonna have to stay,
lay low here for a little while.

322
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,559
No.

323
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,521
- Not until you tell me what's goin' on.
- I can't tell you anything right now.

324
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:30,939
[groaning]

325
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,324
[panting]

326
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:46,997
Okay.

327
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,373
It was Cottonmouth.

328
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,877
He was behind everything.

329
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,879
So you've been working for him
the whole time?

330
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,297
Yeah.

331
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,506
[breathing heavily]

332
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,968
I got his guns out of lockup for him,

333
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,263
and then he turns around
and tries to kill me.

334
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,015
Go figure.

335
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,434
What makes you think I can protect you?

336
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,311
[breathing heavily]

337
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:14,191
You survived a drive-by
and a building fallin' on your head.

338
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,402
[grunting] I'd say you're overqualified.

339
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,905
You mentioned Chico before you passed out.

340
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,366
What happened to Chico?

341
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,493
I told you.

342
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,538
They killed him.

343
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,207
Don't lie to me.

344
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,500
Not now.

345
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:34,837
[Scarfe grunts]

346
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,924
[softly] Okay.

347
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,806
[sighs]

348
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,307
I killed him.

349
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,118
[straining]

350
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,956
[Claire] Luke.

351
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,208
[Scarfe gasps]

352
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,293
Don't. Please.

353
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,506
[Scarfe choking]

354
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,508
[Claire] You're not a killer.

355
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,051
Are you?

356
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,846
[Scarfe gagging]

357
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,770
[coughing]

358
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,402
We're done.

359
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,030
- Let's go.
- [panting]

360
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,908
Hey, Cage!

361
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:48,201
[gasps]

362
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,996
Cage!

363
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:53,331
Wait!

364
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,834
I'm an asshole!
There's no disputing that.

365
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,213
I am a despicable human being.

366
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:07,429
But Cottonmouth is a hell of a lot worse!

367
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:13,143
And I have got what it takes
to put him behind bars

368
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,270
for the rest of his life!

369
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,068
- [Luke] What did you say?
- [sighs]

370
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,238
I can take him down.

371
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:41,088
What do you have?

372
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,048
[breathing heavily]

373
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,299
Notes.

374
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,803
Detailed notes...

375
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:52,515
of murder investigations I covered up
to save his ass.

376
00:23:54,226 --> 00:24:00,648
How he uses Spurlock's Mortuary...
to dispose of the bodies.

377
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,902
Why do you think you never found Tone?

378
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,155
Or Chico?

379
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,119
Plus...

380
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:16,789
I've got the name of every cop
on Cottonmouth's payroll.

381
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,334
[sighs]

382
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:23,838
That ought to be plenty to send him
on a nice permanent trip.

383
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,215
[exhales]

384
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,884
- Where are these notes?
- [sighs]

385
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,262
Tell me.

386
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,264
Now.

387
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,391
[sighs]

388
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,935
My apartment.

389
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:59,999
- Alex, no one goes in the back.
- Mmm-hmm.

390
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,044
And make sure these people
don't scuff up my floors.

391
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:04,421
They will stay immaculate,
Madam Councilwoman.

392
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:08,841
So, since this will be a live interview,
we'll try to keep things spontaneous.

393
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,136
But are there any topics
you want to focus on?

394
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:14,514
Well, Harlem.
How to shape it, how to elevate it, and...

395
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,391
- how my complexes will help...
- [sighing] Boring.

396
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:20,270
We've heard that speech from you
a million times and a half.

397
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,480
I told you I do not want a fluff piece.

398
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:25,608
Not fluff, fun. There's a difference.

399
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,985
Remember when Obama sang Al Green?

400
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,198
You wanna watch me
whip and nae nae, Thembi?

401
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,509
You're a popular man.

402
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:55,138
Oh, uh... the ex-wife.

403
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:58,391
Took all my money
and she still needs the dick.

404
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,354
Glad to see chivalry isn't dead.

405
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:03,855
[Perez sighs]

406
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,608
Look, look, look, Scarfe's not comin'.

407
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:08,776
He's not gonna show up
just to get arrested.

408
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,153
- [brakes screeching]
- [cars crashing]

409
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:14,407
- [chuckles] Look at these two.
- [man and woman arguing indistinctly]

410
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:17,369
- I think she's about to...
- [laughs] She's gonna knock him out.

411
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,037
Maybe you should go arrest them.

412
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:21,414
[laughs]

413
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,167
[arguing continues]

414
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,251
[lock breaking]

415
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:15,009
I don't know if you remember me
ten years ago,

416
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,595
when I first got bumped up off patrol?

417
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,181
Yeah.

418
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,891
It didn't seem like you belonged.
No offense.

419
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,186
Mmm. None taken.

420
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,899
A lot of people wrote me off back then.
But not Scarfe.

421
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,987
He took me under his wing.
He taught me how to police for real.

422
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,326
I have no idea
what he saw in me back then,

423
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:42,829
but he has had my front and my back.

424
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,252
[floorboards creaking]

425
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:09,939
If he's clean or not...

426
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,360
I wanna be the one to bring him in,
ask him his side of the story.

427
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,153
I owe him that much.

428
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,410
[sighs]

429
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:34,171
We're wasting our time.

430
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:36,924
Let's go.

431
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,225
Somebody's in there.

432
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:49,020
- No... no way Scarfe got past us.
- Well, somebody did.

433
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,038
[dog barking]

434
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,794
[dog barking]

435
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:31,729
[Misty] Hey!

436
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,107
Hey!

437
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,163
[exhales]

438
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,333
Hey, hey, hey, don't fall asleep, okay?

439
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,584
[grunts]

440
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,544
You need to stay conscious.
We're gonna move soon.

441
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,128
- [footsteps approaching]
- [door opens]

442
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:03,177
- [Claire sighs]
- The cops just saw me at Scarfe's place.

443
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,680
- They'll be headed here any minute.
- Misty?

444
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,933
Yeah... it was her.

445
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,352
He can't really walk.

446
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,980
- I'll carry him.
- Where?

447
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,483
The only place this evidence
makes a difference.

448
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:19,193
I just need to get a car.
I'll try and grab a cab.

449
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:20,778
No, no, no, I have a better idea.

450
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,491
- Claire...
<i>- Mami, ¿cómo estás?</i>

451
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,118
I texted you. Did you get it?

452
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,745
Our ride's here.

453
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:32,123
Yeah. No, no, no,
just come around the back.

454
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,459
[groans]

455
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,087
- [car honking]
- No. Around the back.

456
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,547
Okay.

457
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:40,882
[groans]

458
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,258
[panting]

459
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:44,552
[groaning]

460
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,472
[Claire] Here's our ride.

461
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:50,433
- [Luke] You gotta be kidding me.
- [Scarfe continues groaning]

462
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,978
Oh! Careful, man.

463
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,481
The van is one thing.

464
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:59,817
If my daughter gets scratched,
I'll kill you.

465
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:02,487
I don't care how bulletproof you are.

466
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,989
She's safe with me. I promise.

467
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,368
- Can we drop you at home?
- No, I'm fine.

468
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:09,994
<i>- Muchas gracias, Mami.</i>
<i>- De nada.</i>

469
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,954
- [Luke] You good?
- [Claire] Yeah.

470
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,624
- I'll drive.
- Obviously.

471
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,306
[groaning]

472
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,810
He really needs surgery.
How far are we going?

473
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:36,729
- Downtown to One Police Plaza.
- Police headquarters?

474
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:39,691
Yeah, I'm gonna hand him
and the evidence over.

475
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:41,568
The DA can take it from there.

476
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:44,612
Get him round-the-clock protection
until he can testify against Cottonmouth.

477
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:47,281
I'm dying back here.
You're still thinking about Cottonmouth?

478
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,033
Yeah, you should be, too.

479
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,285
If he's got as many cops
working for him as you say,

480
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,287
he'll have them in the streets
looking for us.

481
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:55,998
Call an EMT you can trust
to meet us there.

482
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:02,213
I want to remind the viewers
that we're live.

483
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:05,341
Call us using the number
at the bottom of your screen.

484
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:09,303
I know the councilwoman
would love to answer your questions.

485
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:12,640
Madam Councilwoman,
your home is stunning.

486
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,476
Oh, thank you, Thembi.

487
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,686
That's why people
are paying millions of dollars

488
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:20,272
for brownstones like this one
on Convent Avenue.

489
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:23,818
I mean, these buildings
must be preserved and protected.

490
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:27,154
Let's talk politics.
Let's talk Damon Boone.

491
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:28,531
Yes.

492
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:33,786
That Stanford-educated carpetbagger
has been saying things about

493
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:39,041
my voting record, about campaign finance,
that simply are not true.

494
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:42,086
My complexes will do
for black-owned real estate

495
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,172
what Geoffrey Canada has done
for education uptown.

496
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:47,592
[scoffs]
I'm just setting the record straight.

497
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:52,054
[Perez] Someone saw a green van
parked around the back.

498
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,015
We got partial plates.

499
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,808
- Well, let's hope we get a hit on it.
- [cell phone ringing]

500
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:58,478
Otherwise, I'm not sure
where else to look.

501
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:01,731
And what in the hell is taking
those damn unis so long to get here?

502
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,066
[cell phone continues ringing]

503
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,653
Yeah.

504
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:10,657
I get that.
I get it, but we ran into a problem.

505
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:15,119
And what the hell was Luke Cage
doing with Detective Scarfe?

506
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:21,543
Do I need to remind you?

507
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,504
If Scarfe talks,

508
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,465
I ain't the only one going down,
Lieutenant Perez.

509
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:34,055
Half the department's coming with me.

510
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,517
Find him!

511
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:40,269
[cell phone clatters]

512
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,902
[Zip] Where's Shades?

513
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,361
[exhales]

514
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:52,406
I don't know.

515
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:57,704
Let me step up.

516
00:33:58,621 --> 00:33:59,747
What you need?

517
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,626
And how'd that work out last time?

518
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,006
You got a choice?

519
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:12,969
[clicks tongue]

520
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,349
Put the word out on the street.

521
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,438
A hundred large for Detective Scarfe.

522
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,942
I want him dead.

523
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:30,069
Dead.

524
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:32,363
Dead.

525
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:35,157
Look for a green van.

526
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,910
Plate's 69-somethin'.

527
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:41,831
[door closes]

528
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:50,757
[Diontey] We're near the barber shop.
We'll head that way.

529
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,759
Bring him to you or Mr. Stokes?

530
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,097
Traffic sucks.

531
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,143
There's a police checkpoint up ahead.

532
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:04,270
Next couple of blocks, actually.

533
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:05,938
Scarfe's people are looking for us.

534
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:07,815
They're probably closing
the whole island down.

535
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,651
Bridges, tunnels...

536
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,694
That's the way I would've done it.

537
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:13,738
[coughs]

538
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,072
Don't take 128.

539
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:17,491
- Which way?
- [Claire] Make a sharp right.

540
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,786
- [tires screeching]
- Hang on.

541
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,578
[horn honking]

542
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:24,040
Hold on. You seen that?
Hold on. I think that was it.

543
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,541
[tires screeching]

544
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:27,919
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

545
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,173
Zip... I think I just saw the van.

546
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:33,716
And the name was right.

547
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,927
What color did Cottonmouth
say that van was, though?

548
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,096
- Blue.
- Green, nigga.

549
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,015
Yo, I'm on them right now.

550
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:47,604
Looks like we got company.

551
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:50,066
[groaning] Is it a squad car?

552
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,608
[Luke] Black SUV.

553
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:53,277
I'll slow down and see if he passes.

554
00:35:58,282 --> 00:35:59,784
[laughs]

555
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,869
- [gunshot]
- [glass shattering]

556
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:02,954
[tires screeching]

557
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,372
[Diontey] Back up! Move!

558
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,378
- [Luke] Hold on back there!
- [Scarfe groaning]

559
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,340
[horn honking]

560
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,677
- [Claire grunting]
- [Scarfe groaning]

561
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,226
[Diontey] There he is! Stay on him!

562
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:44,495
[Luke] Kill the lights.

563
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:49,291
There he is!

564
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:01,178
[C-Money] Yeah. Come on, yo.

565
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:03,014
[indistinct chatter]

566
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:13,107
[indistinct chatter continues]

567
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:18,695
[Diontey] Light his ass up!

568
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:26,954
[tire deflating]

569
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,589
Shit!

570
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,428
I'm gonna circle around.
You three, through the hole.

571
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:44,263
Go, go, go!

572
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,018
[man] Yo, man.
[C-Money] Yo, through here!

573
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:01,030
[man] Yo, here. Here.

574
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,408
[C-Money] Come on, let's go!

575
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,163
[sighs] What are we doing?

576
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:12,499
- We should just head back to the precinct.
- No.

577
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,460
If we hear something,
I wanna be ready to go,

578
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:17,129
not stuck behind some damn desk.

579
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:20,757
Can we at least go to Wendy's?
I dig them Frostys, man. [chuckles]

580
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:22,176
Your stomach can wait.

581
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:25,721
[dispatcher on radio] <i>10-13 near Bowery.</i>
<i>Repeat, shots fired near Bowery.</i>

582
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:27,223
That's right near One Police Plaza.

583
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,600
If they're running,
why would they go down there?

584
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,352
Maybe they're not running.

585
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:32,728
- [siren blaring]
- [siren stops]

586
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,231
What the hell are you doing?

587
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:37,066
Why do you wanna rush down there?

588
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,401
He might need my help.

589
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,988
Shots fired means he resisted arrest.

590
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:43,447
They probably lit his ass up.

591
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,117
If he's dirty or not,
you don't want to see that.

592
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,534
He's still your partner.

593
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,259
Detective Knight.

594
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,552
[Perez] What's going on?

595
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:07,096
Yeah, I'm trying
to head down there right now,

596
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,555
but Perez is stopping me.

597
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,517
- Who's that?
- Okay. Why?

598
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,809
Who is that?

599
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,606
Okay. I'll do that.

600
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,485
Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.

601
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,782
That was Scarfe, wasn't it? [snickers]

602
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:28,075
What'd he say?

603
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,786
Not to trust you.

604
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,788
That you're in on all of this.

605
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:36,042
What? Hell no!
You can't believe that rat! He's lying.

606
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:39,336
He's in Cottonmouth's pocket
much deeper than I am.

607
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,839
Bet... bet you didn't know that, hmm?

608
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:48,387
No one was on the phone.

609
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:50,514
Microphone check, five-o.

610
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,019
You're too smart for your own good.
You know that?

611
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:56,979
Yeah, I'd rather be a smart-ass
than a dumb-ass.

612
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:58,439
Now give me your gun.

613
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,400
[grunting]

614
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:03,945
- [Misty screaming]
- [gunshot]

615
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:05,571
[Perez grunting]

616
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:07,364
- [Misty panting]
- [groaning]

617
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:09,325
[grunting]

618
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,493
[panting] Uh-huh.

619
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,662
Okay, okay.

620
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,499
Okay, okay.

621
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,836
Now cuff yourself, you piece of shit!

622
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:23,839
Roll the video.

623
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:29,971
[Mariah through monitor] <i>You know,</i>
<i>my Harlem is saturated with jazz,</i>

624
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:34,766
<i>and good food, and the pure genius</i>
<i>that permeates the streets.</i>

625
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:40,314
<i>Harlem is risin'</i>
<i>like a phoenix out of the ashes.</i>

626
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:43,943
<i>I mean, that's what</i>
<i>all of my various complexes is about,</i>

627
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,695
<i>is restoring that luster.</i>

628
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,698
- This is great.
<i>- I believe in Harlem.</i>

629
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,200
This is great.

630
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:52,952
Thanks for taping that earlier.

631
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,123
You said you wanted something different.
This is it.

632
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:59,583
I mean, you can...
you can see it all right there.

633
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,503
And I don't just represent Harlem.

634
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:05,047
- I am Harlem.
- And we're live.

635
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:06,923
Which Harlem is you?

636
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:13,930
- Pardon me?
- There are actually two Harlems.

637
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:16,183
The one shown to us in that video.

638
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:20,521
Historic, hardworking and hopeful.

639
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:24,900
But in this next video,
we see an entirely different Harlem.

640
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:26,860
A historically corrupt Harlem.

641
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:32,241
Your grandmother,
the notorious Mabel Stokes,

642
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:35,744
and her brother-in-law,
Pistol Pete Stokes, shown here,

643
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,163
were major players in it.

644
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:41,625
The boy in that photo would grow up to be
Cornell Stokes, aka Cottonmouth,

645
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:46,672
a man whose name rings out
in both legitimate and criminal circles.

646
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:50,926
Oh, that's a...
that's a personal photograph.

647
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,346
You... you really, uh,
have no right to show that one.

648
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,639
Well, how about this one?

649
00:41:56,807 --> 00:42:01,437
A somehow brutal assault that took place
at the Crispus Attucks Houses

650
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,189
didn't make the news.

651
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:07,734
Even stranger was the millions of dollars
in cash found on the premises

652
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:09,695
in your office.

653
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:12,156
There's some people on the scene
even describe a man

654
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,658
who, under a barrage of gunfire,

655
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,828
managed to beat down
a number of criminals,

656
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:21,790
some of whom
may have worked for your family.

657
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:25,711
So you can see
how it might be difficult to decipher

658
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,879
which Harlem you stand for.

659
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,977
Despite these unwarranted
attacks on my character,

660
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:46,648
I have always tried
to make clear what I want...

661
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:50,569
which I can't say for you, Thembi.

662
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:54,030
It's very clear what you
and the rest of your media friends want.

663
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:55,616
You want a story.

664
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,743
Not the news. Not the truth.

665
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:03,207
Just... a story
that you will do anything to sell.

666
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,375
Shut it down!

667
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,752
Stop. Alex!

668
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:07,961
Thank you for your time.

669
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,381
You get your ass out of my house.

670
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:21,475
[panting]

671
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:23,269
How long before we get
to police headquarters?

672
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:24,936
I think we're near city hall.

673
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:26,855
Ah, it's cold.

674
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:29,275
Is it cold, or is it just me?

675
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:32,944
We're close.
They'll warm him when we get there.

676
00:43:36,532 --> 00:43:37,824
[Claire grunts]

677
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,252
[gunfire continues]

678
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:56,385
[man 1] Yo, you should've died!

679
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:57,844
[man 2] Come on, man. My shit's dead.

680
00:43:57,928 --> 00:43:59,596
[C-Money] Come on! Get it together, man!

681
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,097
[man 1] Come on, get him!
[C-Money] Light him up!

682
00:44:01,182 --> 00:44:03,475
Now you're just pissin' me off.

683
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:04,810
My turn.

684
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,270
[men grunting]

685
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,990
[Claire] We're gonna go up, okay?

686
00:44:20,326 --> 00:44:21,577
Come on.

687
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,495
[Scarfe grunts]

688
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:24,830
[panting]

689
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:27,208
[Claire grunts] One more step.

690
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:30,544
- I'm so tired.
- How far is it to One Police Plaza?

691
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:33,214
I gotta... I gotta stop now.

692
00:44:33,297 --> 00:44:35,507
Yeah, we can stop as soon as we get there
and we're safe.

693
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:37,218
I gotta see my son.

694
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:39,595
You can see your son and anyone else
you want to when we get there.

695
00:44:42,348 --> 00:44:43,682
[crashing]

696
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:45,684
[police sirens wailing]

697
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,669
[panting] You okay?

698
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:13,754
Yeah.

699
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,507
At least I kept one promise.

700
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,134
No scratches... on you.

701
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,052
[groaning weakly]

702
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,395
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold his head.

703
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:31,313
Hold my hand. Look at me.

704
00:45:31,397 --> 00:45:33,315
Look at me. Breathe.

705
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:34,775
- [breathing heavily]
- Breathe.

706
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,026
- Breathe.
- [Misty] Hey!

707
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:39,446
[panting] Hey. Listen, Scarfe.

708
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,781
Okay, you've... [chuckles nervously]

709
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:43,409
You've got a lot of explaining
to do, okay?

710
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:45,201
And you're not getting out of it.

711
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:47,037
[coughs]

712
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:51,500
You better...

713
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:54,169
You better let me do
the interrogation, partner.

714
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,630
- I'm better... I'm better at it.
- [laughs]

715
00:45:56,713 --> 00:46:00,175
[chuckling] Oh, you're better at it?
No, you're not.

716
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:03,804
- Huh?
- I got rapport.

717
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:09,351
[crying] Yeah, you got rapport.

718
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:13,730
[softly] I'm sorry.

719
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:16,608
Rafe, no.

720
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,361
Rafe, no.

721
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:25,951
[crying] No. No, Rafe. No.

722
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:28,244
No, Rafe, no.

723
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:32,499
No, Rafe, please!

724
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:33,875
[sobbing]

725
00:46:40,674 --> 00:46:43,176
[police sirens wailing]

726
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:47,973
[R&B song playing]

727
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,036
Get the rest of your shit and bugger off.

728
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:54,831
Councilwoman Dillard,

729
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:57,668
can you comment on the arrest
of your cousin, Cornell Stokes,

730
00:47:57,751 --> 00:47:59,044
at Harlem's Paradise tonight,

731
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:02,088
on charges of police corruption,
extortion and murder?

732
00:48:02,172 --> 00:48:03,549
Alex!

733
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:05,050
Is it true that he's responsible

734
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:08,845
for the murder of decorated
Harlem police detective Rafael Scarfe?

735
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:11,432
- Thank you for your time!
- Councilwoman, can we get a comment?

736
00:48:11,515 --> 00:48:13,434
Councilwoman, can we get just one comment?

737
00:48:13,517 --> 00:48:16,603
- Councilwoman! Councilwoman!
- [door closes]

738
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,606
Shit!

739
00:48:20,566 --> 00:48:21,733
Shit!

740
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:25,446
[Claire] You need to get some new clothes.

741
00:48:26,697 --> 00:48:28,740
[Luke] I have some stuff back at the crib.

742
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,785
This is beginning to become a habit.

743
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:34,955
[sighs] Swiss cheese shirt.

744
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,248
Car bounces off of you.

745
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:40,293
Punching through steel and concrete.

746
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:43,589
Just another day, right?

747
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,884
You're safe and your mom's van is insured.

748
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:50,554
That's all that matters to me.

749
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,933
After all that,
you can't say you're not special.

750
00:48:57,603 --> 00:48:59,813
I'm still not sure what I am.

751
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:01,397
You know exactly who you are.

752
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,984
And what you need to do.

753
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:05,569
[chuckles]

754
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:08,071
Pop used to say the same thing
you're saying to me.

755
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,199
I did right by him.

756
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:15,286
Cottonmouth's in jail... and I'm done.

757
00:49:16,872 --> 00:49:18,289
You're moving on?

758
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,960
I think so.

759
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,169
It's time.

760
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:26,715
There's things with your powers
you haven't even tested.

761
00:49:27,633 --> 00:49:30,093
There's so many good things
that you could still do.

762
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:32,929
Maybe I could help.

763
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:39,645
- You have ideas?
- Yeah.

764
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:43,982
Why don't we start
by getting some coffee first?

765
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:54,951
- I'm not sleeping with you.
- Whoa! Did I say anything about that?

766
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:58,789
Why can't coffee just be coffee, huh?

767
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:01,833
Okay. You didn't even
touch your coffee this morning.

768
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:04,711
You drank the orange juice. Okay?
You don't drink coffee.

769
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:11,217
[telephone rings]

770
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:24,397
[sighs]

771
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:28,234
[scoffs] Cowards.

772
00:50:30,696 --> 00:50:32,238
What's going on?

773
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:36,159
They're afraid of the headlines.
Police corruption.

774
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:39,580
A crime boss who's related
to a prominent city councilwoman.

775
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:43,458
And the only person
to tie it all together is a corrupt cop.

776
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,043
A dead one at that.

777
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:47,378
Then I'll be the one to tie it together.

778
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:49,464
[scoffs]

779
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,133
You're on the wrong side
of the glass for that, baby girl.

780
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:55,428
First Fisk, then Cottonmouth.

781
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:56,972
This is huge.

782
00:50:57,055 --> 00:51:00,642
But they're over there...
and we're right here.
