00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:15,750
- [Claire] Luke, stay with me.
- [groaning]

3
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:18,837
Breathe. Breathe. Just breathe.

4
00:00:21,965 --> 00:00:24,593
Don't move. Okay? I've got you.

5
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,097
[groaning loudly]

6
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:42,569
[engine starting]

7
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:53,830
[breathing heavily]

8
00:01:09,596 --> 00:01:11,139
Hey there, you.

9
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:16,060
- [straining]
- Okay.

10
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:17,646
Come on.

11
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,397
Relax.

12
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:21,024
[breathing heavily]

13
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,191
Relax. You're okay.

14
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:25,820
- Where am I?
- Uh, you're in an ambulance.

15
00:01:25,904 --> 00:01:27,822
You went into shock.

16
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:29,824
I called my friend Manny.

17
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:31,743
He used to run with my uncle
back in the day.

18
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,161
He's driving. He's discreet.

19
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:35,038
[groans] What the hell
did you do that for?

20
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,498
- What do you mean?
- No hospitals.

21
00:01:37,582 --> 00:01:40,544
- I can't be in the system.
- He borrowed it.

22
00:01:41,294 --> 00:01:42,671
Like I said, he's discreet.

23
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:45,173
But you bleeding out
in the back of a gypsy cab?

24
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:47,133
That would get even more attention.

25
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,637
We need to keep you safe. Drink this.

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,889
You can't dehydrate.

27
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:59,979
I saw you looking for the shooter
before you passed out.

28
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:02,106
Did you see who it was?

29
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:03,817
No.

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,484
- [groans]
- On a scale from one to ten,

31
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:06,986
how much pain are you in right now?

32
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:09,989
[breathing heavily] Three.

33
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:12,033
Liar.

34
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:13,827
I'm okay.

35
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:16,204
You're not okay.

36
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:20,083
The bullet penetrated through your skin.
I didn't even think that could happen.

37
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,045
That makes two of us.

38
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:27,966
[breath trembling]

39
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:30,426
- I looked for an exit wound, but...
- I know.

40
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:32,721
It's still in there.

41
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:38,059
The sound that it made,
like it was drilling into you...

42
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:41,020
I wanna get a closer look.

43
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:44,691
See what's going on inside of you.
I know a place.

44
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:49,696
[Luke] Whatever we gotta do.

45
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:53,825
[gunshot]

46
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,765
[theme music playing]

47
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,461
- [Luke] You okay?
- [Claire] Yeah.

48
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:31,464
- [both groan]
- Manny?

49
00:04:31,547 --> 00:04:32,799
[Manny] Who was that son of a bitch?

50
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:35,719
- [groans] Are you okay?
- I'll be fine.

51
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:37,345
But somebody took a shot at us.

52
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:39,931
You guys got to get out of here. Go!

53
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:42,600
[groans]

54
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:55,905
[Claire] Watch out.

55
00:04:56,614 --> 00:04:58,032
[both grunting]

56
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:06,249
Can you dig it?

57
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,502
[Claire] What the hell?

58
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,506
Every Friday night at the drive-in.

59
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:16,342
<i>The Warriors.</i>

60
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,056
[sing-song] Carl, come out and play.

61
00:05:24,017 --> 00:05:26,895
- You know him, don't you?
- [sirens wailing in distance]

62
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,276
[man] I'm enjoying this shit, Carl.

63
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,903
Keep running.

64
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,157
[grunts]

65
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,617
[Claire whispering] Luke, hey.

66
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,494
You can't fight him yet, Luke.

67
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,454
[panting]

68
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:47,040
You're too weak right now.

69
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:49,000
Come on.

70
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:03,973
I didn't want it!

71
00:06:06,392 --> 00:06:08,519
[yells and breathes heavily]

72
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:12,065
[Shades] You having second thoughts?

73
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:21,657
[Shades sighs]

74
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:25,203
What's on your mind?

75
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:29,582
I'm not having any thoughts.

76
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,750
Is that normal?

77
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:34,921
As long as you stay on the clock,
it doesn't matter.

78
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:41,635
<i>The secret to every great lie</i>
<i>is it has to run parallel to the truth.</i>

79
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:45,598
Every moment wasted
brings you one step closer to jail.

80
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:47,808
So what do we do?

81
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:52,396
[Shades] <i>DNA is our friend...</i>
<i>and our enemy.</i>

82
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,190
<i>We must treat her carefully.</i>

83
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:57,068
Head straight to the bathroom
and clean up.

84
00:06:57,944 --> 00:06:59,070
I don't have any clothes.

85
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:02,115
I had Alex take care of it.
They're in there.

86
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:06,535
<i>- To make this stick, we'll need a patsy.</i>
- [camera shutter clicking]

87
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,836
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

88
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:16,420
Karma is a cruel mistress.

89
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:20,008
She does not like being a side chick.
She eventually gets hers.

90
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:22,135
- Brace yourself.
- It's that bad?

91
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:23,261
Yeah.

92
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,349
Did you forget anything?

93
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:30,184
The bottle.

94
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:31,560
[Mariah screams] No!

95
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:35,481
I hit him on the head with a bottle.

96
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,775
Did it break?

97
00:07:38,985 --> 00:07:41,404
- No.
- That's good.

98
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,490
[Misty] Make sure we photograph the stage.

99
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:47,285
Compare the photos
with the last performance filmed here.

100
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:49,537
See if there's anything missing.

101
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,498
Microphone stand, a monitor, anything.

102
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:56,085
What do you think? You're the visualist.

103
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:04,052
[Misty] <i>You see all that trauma</i>
<i>to the head and the face?</i>

104
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:06,679
<i>The fall couldn't have done that.</i>
<i>It's not enough height.</i>

105
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:09,848
[groans]

106
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:14,853
[groaning]

107
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,691
[Stokes breathing heavily]

108
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:20,859
[Misty] <i>But he's not dead yet.</i>

109
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,908
So let's say our perp did hit him
over and over again

110
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:29,368
with a blunt instrument until he's dead.

111
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:32,163
The trash bag is for the clothes
you're wearing.

112
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:35,291
Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too.

113
00:08:35,374 --> 00:08:37,501
Spurlock will incinerate them.

114
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:42,340
The towels you use, the rugs...
They all go in that trash bag.

115
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:46,635
Get dressed from the clothes
in the garment bag.

116
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,097
I look like I'm in shock.

117
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:53,517
Is that why you're speaking to me
as if I'm a child?

118
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:56,812
I need you to hear me.

119
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:59,023
I want you to win.

120
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:01,817
Do what I say...

121
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:04,320
and when you get away with this...

122
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:08,282
you can go back to being the sexy...

123
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:12,703
domineering bitch...
that we all hate to love.

124
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:15,248
Now go.

125
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,128
[sighs and sniffles]

126
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:31,680
That's the last time
you will ever call me a bitch.

127
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:40,939
Look at what you did.

128
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,861
Destroying the face...

129
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:48,031
[grunting]

130
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:50,366
...that's rage.

131
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:53,995
But walking away
without leaving a trail of blood?

132
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:55,454
Who's ever done that?

133
00:09:55,538 --> 00:09:57,665
Temper, temper, Carl.

134
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:08,092
[Misty] Councilwoman Dillard,
my condolences.

135
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:10,803
Oh, please.

136
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:14,807
My cousin's still laid out on the floor
and you're talking about condolences.

137
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,517
What's the condolence? The sheet?

138
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,812
I think you're taking this personally.

139
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,105
Why aren't you?

140
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:27,236
We are working as fast as we can.

141
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,197
They said you called this in.

142
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:36,620
Around noon, I called Cornell
and told him that we needed to talk.

143
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:40,166
He said he was busy
and that he would get back to me.

144
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:43,419
So I went in to work.
I mean, what could I do?

145
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:47,756
Thanks to him,
I had a million fires to put out.

146
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:52,261
Around 10:00,
I realized that I hadn't heard back so...

147
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:54,055
[inhales]

148
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:55,764
I decided to come here.

149
00:10:55,848 --> 00:10:59,227
"Thanks to him." So you were mad.

150
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:04,273
Frustrated, yes. Mad? Never.

151
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:10,613
He was my first cousin,
but I practically raised that boy.

152
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,451
I loved him.

153
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:19,372
So when you got here
was the door locked?

154
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:26,044
There is a code on the VIP entrance.
It keeps the paparazzi away.

155
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:27,463
It changes every week.

156
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,007
Yes, I had access.

157
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,468
So you let yourself in. Then what?

158
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:38,599
Then I found him,
sprawled out like a goddamn rag doll.

159
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:41,560
So he was already dead
when you got here.

160
00:11:44,147 --> 00:11:45,273
Yeah.

161
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:49,943
But then I heard someone else crying.

162
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:51,904
Who?

163
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,991
Candace. [sobbing]

164
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:58,661
[sniffles] Candace Miller.

165
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:01,372
Candace is Cornell's VIP hostess.

166
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:06,126
Candy's worked here at Harlem's Paradise
since we re-opened.

167
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:16,804
Ms. Miller...
I'm Detective Misty Knight.

168
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,139
What did you see?

169
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:22,685
Take your time to collect your thoughts.

170
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:25,938
I don't need time. I saw who did it.

171
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,606
It was Luke Cage.

172
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,077
[reporters clamoring]

173
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:45,040
[reporter 1] Councilwoman!
[reporter 2] Right here! Over here!

174
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:48,836
[reporter 3] Can you confirm that
it was Luke Cage who killed your cousin?

175
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,463
Is Harlem's hero a cold-blooded murderer?

176
00:12:50,546 --> 00:12:51,839
Or did he just take out the trash?

177
00:12:51,922 --> 00:12:53,507
- [Mariah] Who said that?
- I did. Frank...

178
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:58,053
My cousin Cornell Stokes
was a complex man.

179
00:12:58,136 --> 00:13:02,558
Conflicted, but underneath all the bluster
was the soul of a musician.

180
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:06,061
<i>He was a true Harlem original.</i>

181
00:13:06,144 --> 00:13:09,106
[stammers] But what about this stranger?
That's the garbage.

182
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,693
But in your media rush
to anoint a savior after the explosion

183
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:17,114
at Genghis Connie's,
no one asked the crucial question.

184
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:20,158
Who the hell is Luke Cage?

185
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:23,621
You label Cornell Stokes
a gangster, a thug.

186
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:27,583
<i>But as many people</i>
<i>recently witnessed at Mount Olivet,</i>

187
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:31,420
<i>Cornell was a repentant man</i>
<i>dealing with his violent past.</i>

188
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:33,339
<i>Making amends for his wrongs.</i>

189
00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:37,050
<i>He had every intention of...</i>
<i>of cooperating with the police.</i>

190
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:39,928
Goddamn vigilantes
who call themselves heroes,

191
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:43,599
like Luke Cage, they are dangerous.

192
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:46,226
<i>They are a menace</i>
<i>to the safety, the security,</i>

193
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,897
<i>and the sanctity of our community.</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

194
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,107
People have used a lot of words
to describe my cousin,

195
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,068
but one word they have
never used is "coward."

196
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:57,530
<i>And only a coward</i>
<i>would hide in the shadows</i>

197
00:13:57,613 --> 00:13:59,657
and kill an innocent man.
[stutters] That's it.

198
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,741
[reporters clamoring]

199
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:03,952
[reporter] One more question.
Councilwoman, was he innocent?

200
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:05,538
[clamoring continues]

201
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:08,707
[Luke breathing heavily]

202
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:12,002
[Claire] That guy's putting
innocent people in danger to get at you.

203
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:17,550
I'm gonna put a stop to it,
but I need your help.

204
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:22,596
[groaning]

205
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,433
[breathing heavily]

206
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:31,397
Hold on to this. I can't lose it.

207
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,731
[Claire] Okay.

208
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:37,611
[groans]

209
00:14:42,408 --> 00:14:43,909
[Claire] I'm going to sterilize the area.

210
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,666
[wincing]

211
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:53,377
- You feel that?
- [groans] A bit.

212
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:56,088
Keep going.

213
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:58,424
No. I'm gonna see what kind
of anesthetic they have here first.

214
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:00,468
- No drugs.
- Luke...

215
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,511
I can't be compromised.

216
00:15:02,595 --> 00:15:05,473
Innocent people could die.
I can't risk it.

217
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:08,892
All right, macho man.

218
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:11,520
Actually, it's Power Man.

219
00:15:11,604 --> 00:15:14,231
That's what Pop used to call me.
[chuckles]

220
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:17,025
- That's even cornier.
- [chuckling]

221
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:18,151
[groans]

222
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:20,446
Okay.

223
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:23,699
- I'm going in.
- [groaning]

224
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,788
All right,
I'm gonna press even harder, okay?

225
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:34,001
[Luke groaning]

226
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:37,338
[scalpel scraping]

227
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,297
[Luke groans]

228
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,676
Wild.

229
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:44,762
This is supposed to be soft tissue,

230
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:47,765
but it's almost
as impenetrable as your skin.

231
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,307
Give it to me.

232
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,355
[breathes deeply]

233
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:01,069
[scraping]

234
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:02,279
[Luke groaning]

235
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,491
[exhales]

236
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:07,200
[scraping]

237
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:08,869
- [breathing heavily]
- [scalpel clanging]

238
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,497
[grunts]

239
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,873
I gotta get it out.

240
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,626
It's getting hard to breathe.

241
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,837
Okay, let's look inside.

242
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:29,890
[door closes]

243
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:32,726
[Misty] Anybody waiting for you at home?

244
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,102
My parents.

245
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:36,647
I'm moving out
as soon as I finish night school.

246
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,731
Nice.

247
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:42,194
The quicker you answer my questions,
the quicker you can go. Okay?

248
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:43,404
Okay.

249
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:46,699
State your name and address
for the record.

250
00:16:46,782 --> 00:16:49,242
Candace Miller. 555 Edgecombe Avenue.

251
00:16:49,326 --> 00:16:51,620
- How do you know Mr. Stokes?
- He was my boss.

252
00:16:51,704 --> 00:16:54,832
- I noticed your hair was wet.
- I took a shower.

253
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:58,711
Crime scene officers combed
every inch of Harlem's Paradise.

254
00:16:58,794 --> 00:17:00,128
We also noticed that the shower

255
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:02,548
in Mr. Stokes' private bathroom
had been used.

256
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:04,508
- I used it.
- When?

257
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:07,177
After I was saw Mr. Stokes.

258
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:11,264
So, you're one of his... friends?

259
00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:13,892
Yes.

260
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:16,520
He has several?

261
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:20,733
So I assume you have his code
for his private entrance.

262
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:22,943
What private entrance?

263
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:24,570
[door opens]

264
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:27,990
Don't say another word, Ms. Miller.
I'm representing you now.

265
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:29,825
Is this snake your lawyer?

266
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:34,412
Candace, if you're not guilty,
you'll answer my questions.

267
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:36,874
Nice try. My client isn't under arrest.

268
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,416
- Ms. Miller...
- I'm not guilty.

269
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:39,752
What else do you want to know?

270
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:41,336
Ms. Miller, don't say another word.

271
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:44,965
We used luminol and found traces of blood
in Mr. Stokes' shower,

272
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:47,510
even though it had been heavily bleached.

273
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:48,594
Stand up and walk out.

274
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:50,804
It's a good thing
you got this high-powered flunky.

275
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:53,181
I'm about to nail your ass to the wall.

276
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:54,850
It was Luke Cage!

277
00:17:57,352 --> 00:17:58,353
[sighs]

278
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,277
After I showered,
I came out to see Cornell.

279
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,571
I still needed my paycheck.

280
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:11,492
I heard loud voices and a struggle.

281
00:18:11,575 --> 00:18:13,035
That's when I walked out

282
00:18:13,118 --> 00:18:15,913
and I saw Mr. Stokes
down below on the floor.

283
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:17,372
[sighs]

284
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:22,044
Luke Cage saw me and ran away.

285
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:25,589
He was wearing bright yellow gloves,

286
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:28,884
like the kind he used to use
when he washed dishes.

287
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:32,304
And you're positive it was Luke Cage?

288
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,306
You would know.

289
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:36,975
I saw you two at the bar together
the other night.

290
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:39,019
I saw you talking outside, too.

291
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:40,938
May I go now?

292
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:43,982
Candace, look me in the eye.

293
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:49,947
You were too scared to go upstairs
and serve Cottonmouth without Luke.

294
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,158
Table number seven, right?

295
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:55,452
And then you started sleeping with him?

296
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:58,706
But you still call him Mr. Stokes.

297
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,874
And you can't even tell me
about his private entrance.

298
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:05,295
What do they have on you, huh?
Is it money?

299
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,672
How much are they paying you?

300
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:09,341
This is over. We're done.

301
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:13,345
Your delivery arrived right on time.

302
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:16,056
Yes, thank you.

303
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,392
Okay, gotta go.

304
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,520
- [sighs]
- You killed it out there.

305
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:25,858
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

306
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:28,777
Just get that clip up
on the website within the hour.

307
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:31,905
Send the link to all my supporters,
the donors.

308
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:35,283
- If we play this right...
- [slow clapping]

309
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:38,621
And the Oscar goes to...

310
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:40,914
Alex, would you wait in the car with Tony?

311
00:19:46,294 --> 00:19:47,880
Detective, do you have a problem?

312
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:49,798
Just call 'em like I see 'em.

313
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:52,384
So you have your suspect, Luke Cage.

314
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:55,262
Who says I only have one suspect?

315
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:57,931
You ready for our interview?

316
00:19:58,015 --> 00:20:01,559
Your cousin was attacked
by somebody he was close to.

317
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:03,729
That's what those wounds tell me.

318
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:06,607
It was passion. And hatred.

319
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,861
And Luke Cage didn't hate my cousin...
and me,

320
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:14,531
when he showed up at my brownstone
trying to intimidate me?

321
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,574
What do you have on Candace?

322
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:19,369
What do you have on me?

323
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:24,708
Other than the fact
that your edges are a little damp?

324
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,798
That's what I thought.
You ain't got shit.

325
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:32,633
You know what?

326
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:36,386
I'm not under arrest,
and I changed my mind.

327
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,264
You want to talk to me,
you call my lawyer.

328
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:41,850
[sighs]

329
00:20:43,393 --> 00:20:45,062
Where's your partner?

330
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:46,855
Oh, I forgot.

331
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:48,523
- Sorry.
- Who the hell

332
00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:50,818
- do you think you're talking to?
- [Ridley] Detective.

333
00:20:51,777 --> 00:20:54,822
Priscilla, you need to teach
your people some manners.

334
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:57,658
Mariah, I'm so sorry for your loss.

335
00:20:57,741 --> 00:20:59,910
- Thank you for being there for me.
- Of course.

336
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,788
Oh. It has been a very hard day.

337
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:05,332
- I'm sure.
- Hey.

338
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:07,542
Are you gonna make it
to the Founders' Day Lunch at Cecil's?

339
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,795
- You know I'll be there.
- Oh, great.

340
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:11,629
[Mariah chuckles]

341
00:21:13,966 --> 00:21:15,342
[whispers] Bye-bye.

342
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:20,723
You hugged her.

343
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:24,101
She's my soror. I had to.

344
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:25,853
You like Mariah for this?

345
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:28,605
- I do.
- You have an eyewitness, Detective.

346
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:32,109
- Who I can't trust.
- Who puts Luke Cage in the box.

347
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:33,902
The evidence points to two suspects.

348
00:21:33,986 --> 00:21:36,154
One of them was someone
Cottonmouth was close to.

349
00:21:36,238 --> 00:21:37,781
Because the door was locked?

350
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:40,408
Because they got to gangster number one
without catching a bullet.

351
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:41,659
Come on!

352
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:45,998
- Mariah called us.
- Then she called the press.

353
00:21:46,081 --> 00:21:48,625
And she put Luke Cage on blast.

354
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:51,253
Look, I was just about to compel her
to make a statement

355
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:54,339
before you let your little soror
skee-wee on out of here.

356
00:21:54,422 --> 00:21:55,841
Where is Cage?

357
00:21:56,424 --> 00:21:59,344
Because Mariah's not going anywhere,
guilty or not.

358
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:02,222
But your real number-one suspect is ghost.

359
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:05,350
What are you gonna do about it?

360
00:22:16,153 --> 00:22:17,863
- [Luke gasping]
- [Claire] Okay.

361
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:21,699
[breathing heavily]

362
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,954
[heart beating]

363
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,166
[Luke] Is it a boy or a girl?

364
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:30,667
[Claire chuckles]

365
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,878
It's either twins or you need
to start doing some sit-ups.

366
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:34,171
[chuckles]

367
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:35,923
[groaning]

368
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:43,555
What is it?

369
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:46,892
There's no bullet. It's just shrapnel.

370
00:22:46,975 --> 00:22:49,019
Yeah, the bullet drilled into your skin
and exploded.

371
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:51,729
All the pieces that are left
are just trapped.

372
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:54,066
How much?

373
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,902
A lot. And they're moving.

374
00:22:56,985 --> 00:22:58,778
We couldn't get the scalpel in.

375
00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:00,697
How you gonna take the bullet out?

376
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:03,658
Remember when Jessica shot you?

377
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,703
I've been trying to forget that. [sighs]

378
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:09,747
[sighs] Well, I drained the fluid
in your skull

379
00:23:09,832 --> 00:23:11,416
by going behind your eye socket.

380
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:15,087
I'll figure this out.

381
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,214
- [cell phone vibrating]
- [sighs]

382
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:20,425
Blocked ID.

383
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:23,846
Whoever it is has called three times.

384
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:25,305
- See who it is.
- [cell phone beeps]

385
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:28,141
- Hello?
- Hello?

386
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:30,602
This is Detective Misty Knight.
Who is this?

387
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,397
Uh, Claire Temple. Um...

388
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:37,484
We met the other night.
I'm the nurse with the van...

389
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:39,862
and, uh... Scarfe.

390
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:42,280
[Luke] <i>Misty.</i>

391
00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:43,740
I need you to come down to the station.

392
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:46,284
We've already been through this.

393
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:47,369
No.

394
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:49,746
<i>Cottonmouth's dead.</i>

395
00:23:52,624 --> 00:23:54,251
He was killed earlier tonight.

396
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:57,170
<i>I need you to come down</i>
<i>to answer some questions.</i>

397
00:23:57,254 --> 00:23:58,630
You think I did it?

398
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:00,465
A witness puts you at the scene.

399
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:03,301
- Oh, this has got to be a joke.
<i>- Claire, stay out of this.</i>

400
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:05,345
He's been with me all night.

401
00:24:05,428 --> 00:24:06,721
<i>He hasn't killed anyone.</i>

402
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:10,225
[Misty] Luke, listen,
I've got crime scene guys

403
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:12,810
combing through the barber shop
and the apartment upstairs.

404
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:15,105
<i>Just make it easier on yourself, okay?</i>

405
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:18,275
Claire, hang up.
They're trying to trace the call.

406
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:19,651
[phone beeps]

407
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:22,112
Luke. Luke!

408
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:25,365
They're close. I've got a target area.

409
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:27,075
He's near the park.
Do you want to send a unit?

410
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,701
No. What's in the area?

411
00:24:28,785 --> 00:24:30,954
Uh, a few shops, a women's clinic.

412
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:36,418
- I know that look. You're about to...
- I'm bringing him in myself.

413
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,753
I didn't finish my sentence, Misty.

414
00:24:38,836 --> 00:24:41,173
You're about to do something stupid.
Don't.

415
00:24:41,256 --> 00:24:43,758
Listen, don't tell the inspector.

416
00:24:43,841 --> 00:24:45,052
Don't tell anybody.

417
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:21,754
[Shades] I thought you went back
down south, Sugar.

418
00:25:21,838 --> 00:25:24,757
Ain't nothing down there for me.
I'm back.

419
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:26,801
What do you guys want?

420
00:25:26,884 --> 00:25:29,721
[Zip] Well, Cottonmouth's gone, so...

421
00:25:29,804 --> 00:25:31,264
Yeah.

422
00:25:31,348 --> 00:25:33,516
You guys did a real bang up job
protecting him.

423
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,353
What are you talking about?
He sent us away.

424
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:38,896
Anyhow, shit done changed.

425
00:25:38,981 --> 00:25:41,733
So we gonna need to
work out some type of...

426
00:25:41,816 --> 00:25:42,817
What?

427
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:45,237
Severance?

428
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:53,203
Y'all work for me now.

429
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:55,955
- [Amos] What about the club?
- It belongs to Mariah.

430
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:58,750
But I'm in charge.

431
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,461
Do you understand?

432
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:06,508
Good.

433
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:08,843
And do me a favor.

434
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:12,472
Buy some new clothes.

435
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:14,766
Please.

436
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:16,851
We're first class all the way.

437
00:26:19,562 --> 00:26:22,024
You ain't worried about Luke Cage?

438
00:26:22,107 --> 00:26:23,316
[sighs]

439
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:27,737
Leave.

440
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:39,249
[takes deep breath]

441
00:27:05,608 --> 00:27:06,818
[camera shutter clicks]

442
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:10,113
[Luke breathing heavily]

443
00:27:17,454 --> 00:27:19,038
We gotta hurry.

444
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:21,249
I just want to examine
your soft tissue cells,

445
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,710
see if there's another way in
I haven't thought of yet.

446
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:25,002
[Luke] Just make it quick.

447
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:27,547
Holy shit.

448
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:32,885
Your epithelial cells are simultaneously
super elastic and energy absorbent.

449
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:38,433
The cells that line your organs

450
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:40,143
are stuck together like Legos,
which is normal.

451
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:43,480
But when I try to pull them apart,
they snap back together.

452
00:27:43,563 --> 00:27:45,315
What does it mean, for real?

453
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:48,901
[sighs] Don't quote me on this
because I'm not 100% sure,

454
00:27:48,985 --> 00:27:51,654
but it looks like the thing that makes
you super strong is the same thing

455
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:54,199
that's trapping the shrapnel
and forcing it in deeper.

456
00:27:54,282 --> 00:27:55,867
[Misty] Did I miss the party?

457
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,746
Is that a gunshot wound?

458
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:02,290
I thought bullets couldn't hurt you.

459
00:28:02,374 --> 00:28:03,791
Join the club.

460
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,878
Luke, who shot you?

461
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:08,963
I never saw him.

462
00:28:09,046 --> 00:28:12,259
We were walking in Mount Morris Park.
The shot came out of nowhere.

463
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:15,428
Sniper. Medium range.

464
00:28:15,512 --> 00:28:17,680
I went with him in the ambulance,
but then the shooter attacked.

465
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:20,850
- We barely got out.
- The ambulance that got flipped over?

466
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:23,728
Well, then that's your alibi.

467
00:28:24,854 --> 00:28:27,274
- Alibi?
- [cell phone vibrates]

468
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,108
Hello?

469
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:32,779
Yeah.

470
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:36,866
Okay.

471
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,036
Okay.

472
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,372
Thanks, Bailey.

473
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:48,628
Luke Cage...

474
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:53,425
you're under arrest
for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

475
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:55,843
You're kidding me.

476
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:03,100
Get down!

477
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:08,022
[whirring]

478
00:29:09,357 --> 00:29:13,278
10-13. Harlem Women's Clinic.
10-13. Shots fired.

479
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:16,739
- [dispatcher] <i>10-13 Harlem Women's Clinic.</i>
- [whirring continues]

00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:17,990

[breathing heavily]

482
00:29:23,913 --> 00:29:26,249
[Claire] What the hell kind of bullet
does that?

483
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:31,003
I got him!

484
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:42,056
I'm gonna go check it out.

485
00:29:42,139 --> 00:29:43,516
Your backup isn't here yet.

486
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,103
When we get through this,
I'm still arresting your ass.

487
00:29:51,608 --> 00:29:53,401
[groaning]

488
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:55,487
You okay?

489
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,656
Maybe she got him.

490
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,287
[screaming]

491
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:05,830
[man grunting]

00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:49,791
- [Luke] Misty!

00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:59,759
- [gasps]
- Let's spend some time together.

503
00:31:01,135 --> 00:31:02,178
[groans]

504
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:06,140
I see Carl's taste in women
hasn't changed.

505
00:31:06,223 --> 00:31:08,893
He likes frizzy hair and a tight frame.

506
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:12,146
Carl? Who's Carl? You mean Luke?

507
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:15,733
No, I mean Carl, Misty.

508
00:31:15,817 --> 00:31:18,570
"Your adversary, the devil...

509
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:22,490
walks around like a roaring lion...

510
00:31:23,408 --> 00:31:26,202
seeking whom he may devour."

511
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:27,579
First Peter...

512
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:31,666
chapter five... verse eight.

513
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,338
See... my daddy was a preacher.

514
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:39,966
Oh, come on. Aren't you gonna beg?

515
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:43,470
Not even a little bit?

516
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:48,391
If you're going to shoot me, then do it.

517
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,102
Hmm.

518
00:31:51,185 --> 00:31:54,230
[groaning] I have to go after him.

519
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:56,232
Help me up. [grunting]

520
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:03,072
This is my cross to bear.

521
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,325
[breathing heavily]
No one else can do this.

522
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:06,409

[Luke in distance] Misty!

00:32:30,307 --> 00:32:32,852
[man] You're slowing me down, baby girl.

525
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:35,772
Besides, Luke likes you.

526
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:38,358
I'll hurt you later.

527
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:40,985
- He'll suffer more that way.

00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:47,992
[Luke] Stryker!

530
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:15,352
[Claire] Oh, my God.

531
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:21,609
Go.

532
00:33:21,693 --> 00:33:22,944
End this.

533
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:21,878
[Luke] Stryker?

534
00:34:25,548 --> 00:34:27,174
Stryker!

535
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,641
[Stryker] You left me to rot, Carl.

536
00:34:39,228 --> 00:34:41,063
We can work this out.

537
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:43,941
[Stryker] Work what out? My life?

538
00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:46,903
My mother destroying herself?

539
00:34:48,613 --> 00:34:50,532
Being away for so long?

540
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:52,992
Nah.

541
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:56,788
There's nothing left to work out.

542
00:34:56,871 --> 00:35:00,124
"I did not come to bring peace...

543
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,459
but a sword."

544
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:08,758
Ain't that what the great
Reverend James Lucas used to scream at us?

545
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:12,053
Preached peace and prosperity...

546
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:15,347
every Sunday on the pulpit,

547
00:35:15,431 --> 00:35:18,267
but come Friday night on the sideline?

548
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,688
Nothing but fire and brimstone.

549
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:26,275
Guess he saved the sin
for Saturday night like everybody else.

550
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,737
And everybody else caught hell but you.

551
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:33,866
All the world's a stage
for the preacher's son...

552
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,993
and I was a quarterback.

553
00:35:37,244 --> 00:35:39,664
And no matter how many passes I threw...

554
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,626
he was all about running the ball.

555
00:35:44,293 --> 00:35:47,463
Because he wanted the game in your hands.

556
00:36:02,604 --> 00:36:04,146
Hello, Carl.

557
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:08,484
Willis.

558
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:10,695
I prefer Diamondback.

559
00:36:10,778 --> 00:36:12,196
Because you're a snake...

560
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,074
just like Cottonmouth.

561
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,328
I am a snake.

562
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:23,625
I've shed my skin for something better.
Stronger.

563
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:27,128
You left me to rot, Carl...

564
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:29,672
in a gutter.

565
00:36:29,756 --> 00:36:34,093
But I changed that sewer into a garden.

566
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,762
I wasn't a good friend.

567
00:36:36,888 --> 00:36:38,723
I should've stood tall...

568
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:43,227
but I didn't.

569
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:45,605
And you paid the price.

570
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,242
I've been watching you.

571
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,997
Harlem doesn't realize
they're worshiping a false idol.

572
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,166
- False idol?
- You, Carl. You.

573
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:07,168
You're the golden calf.

574
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:09,879
But I got commandments for your ass.

575
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:12,256
I'm gonna bring the pain.

576
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:13,800
Reva's death?

577
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:15,301
Keep her name out of your mouth!

578
00:37:15,384 --> 00:37:17,053
The crimes you went to jail for?

579
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:19,513
The torture you endured
once you were inside?

580
00:37:19,596 --> 00:37:21,724
All me, I'm afraid.

581
00:37:21,808 --> 00:37:23,643
Well, not Reva's death.

582
00:37:23,726 --> 00:37:26,854
I just like saying her name
just to watch you squirm.

583
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,900
- You ruined my life.
- I gave you wings.

584
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,194
[voice breaking] I sent you to hell...

585
00:37:34,153 --> 00:37:36,989
and you come back with superpowers.

586
00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:41,577
[inhales deeply] Ain't that a bitch?

587
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:43,370
- [yelling]
- [gunshots]

588
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,043
[Stryker yelling]

589
00:38:03,182 --> 00:38:04,225
[groans]

590
00:38:04,308 --> 00:38:05,768
[grunts]

591
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:15,444
[both grunting]

592
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,084
[exhales]

593
00:38:32,294 --> 00:38:33,420
[Stryker yelling]

594
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,263
[both panting]

595
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:51,188
[both grunting]

596
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:13,961
- [coughing]
- [straining]

597
00:39:16,297 --> 00:39:17,298
[spits]

598
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:19,341
You're bleeding, Carl.

599
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:22,136
[grunts]

600
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:27,934
[clattering]

601
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:33,272
[Stryker yelling]

602
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:37,193
[grunting]

603
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:40,071
[gags]

604
00:39:56,337 --> 00:39:59,173
- Cooper went at her for about an hour.
- What did she say?

605
00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:01,217
[Ridley] Not much of anything.
Nothing we need

606
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,177
in terms of finding Cage
or your attacker.

607
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,636
I got it from here.

608
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,807
- You're in no shape to talk to her.
- I'm fine!

609
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,016
Are you?

610
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:12,728
She'll talk to me, I promise.

611
00:40:12,812 --> 00:40:14,355
We have rapport.

612
00:40:23,614 --> 00:40:24,907
[sighs]

613
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:29,703
The attacker. Who was he?

614
00:40:29,786 --> 00:40:32,206
[sighs] I already told the other guy
I don't know.

615
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:36,878
You know, I helped you.
I helped your partner. Luke helped you.

616
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:39,463
- Why are you...
- Mmm-mmm. No, no, no.

617
00:40:39,546 --> 00:40:42,299
The shooter, when he attacked,
what did he say?

618
00:40:42,383 --> 00:40:44,551
What's his connection to Luke?
Did Luke say?

619
00:40:44,635 --> 00:40:47,804
[sighs] You know, it's a blur.

620
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:49,473
Who's Carl?

621
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:53,269
Look, it is critical that I find Luke.

622
00:40:53,352 --> 00:40:55,312
So why aren't you outside
looking for him?

623
00:40:55,396 --> 00:40:57,106
Why won't you help me find him?

624
00:40:57,189 --> 00:40:59,066
- I want a lawyer.
- Why?

625
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,776
You're not under arrest.

626
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,736
But I can do that. I can arrest you.

627
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:04,488
For what?

628
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:06,282
Cottonmouth's dead
and you gave Luke an alibi.

629
00:41:06,365 --> 00:41:08,492
That's accessory to murder.
That's hard time.

630
00:41:08,575 --> 00:41:12,288
I'm not scared of you.
I did nothing wrong.

631
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:16,125
That son of a bitch
is out there hurting people.

632
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:20,379
But you won't do anything
to bring Luke Cage in and end this.

633
00:41:20,462 --> 00:41:22,089
I'm out of here.

634
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:23,715
Sit your ass down!

635
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:28,220
Now, people have been
walking out on me all day.

636
00:41:28,304 --> 00:41:31,432
No more lies and no more deception.

637
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:34,810
You are going to tell me what happened
and where I can find Luke.

638
00:41:35,394 --> 00:41:36,979
Back off.

639
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:38,480
What, you think just because
you got jumped

640
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:39,815
by a psycho and lost your gun,

641
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:41,192
you get to talk to me like that?

642
00:41:41,275 --> 00:41:43,444
- Do your job.
- What do you know about the job?

643
00:41:43,527 --> 00:41:45,404
You're either too weak
to stand up to pressure,

644
00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:47,364
or too stupid to see
that Luke is innocent.

645
00:41:47,448 --> 00:41:50,076
You probably couldn't find
your own ass with both hands.

646
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:55,831
Who's weak now, huh? Huh?

647
00:41:55,915 --> 00:41:57,374
[door opens]

648
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:58,459
[Claire grunts]

649
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:01,878
Detective Knight.

650
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,758
I apologize for how
you've been treated, Ms. Temple.

651
00:42:06,842 --> 00:42:09,011
Would you like to press charges
against Detective Knight?

652
00:42:09,095 --> 00:42:11,763
[Claire scoffs] Please.

653
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:15,142
Luke Cage is innocent, Misty.

654
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:18,020
You're after the wrong man.

655
00:42:18,104 --> 00:42:21,357
That's my statement. Write it down.

656
00:42:22,441 --> 00:42:24,401
Look, Inspector, I, um...

657
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,077
[breathing heavily]

658
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,411
Willis!

659
00:43:00,354 --> 00:43:02,856
You done good, baby girl.

660
00:43:02,939 --> 00:43:04,984
I know you were uncomfortable.

661
00:43:06,443 --> 00:43:08,362
I didn't like your cousin,

662
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:10,156
and I would never sleep with him.

663
00:43:13,117 --> 00:43:15,244
But now I'm on record with that.

664
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:18,247
I'm not a whore.

665
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,748
No, you're not a whore.

666
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,834
You're a businesswoman.

667
00:43:23,585 --> 00:43:27,923
And that, in your lap,
represents a chance to change your life...

668
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,011
and that of your whole family.

669
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:34,638
That's power.

670
00:43:39,018 --> 00:43:41,062
Did Luke really do all of that?

671
00:43:43,772 --> 00:43:46,900
You never really know
what anyone is capable of.

672
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:52,531
[sighs] Go on, get some rest.

673
00:43:52,614 --> 00:43:56,035
You'll come back to the club
in a few days when it opens.

674
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:11,383
[Shades] You think it worked?

675
00:44:12,593 --> 00:44:15,721
She's a good girl. She won't fold.

676
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,182
What if she does?

677
00:44:20,434 --> 00:44:21,810
We'll have to kill her.

678
00:44:22,853 --> 00:44:25,021
And everybody else in that apartment.

679
00:44:25,106 --> 00:44:26,940
Make it look like a home invasion...

680
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:29,693
which would be a damn shame.

681
00:44:30,777 --> 00:44:33,114
You know, Duke Ellington
used to live in that building.

682
00:44:33,197 --> 00:44:34,990
And Count Basie, too.

683
00:44:36,032 --> 00:44:39,161
I'd hate to bring down the market value.

684
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:42,664
[Shades] That's my girl.

685
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,677
[sighs]

686
00:45:04,728 --> 00:45:06,605
I'm not like you.

687
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:24,706
[Stryker] Carl!

688
00:45:36,593 --> 00:45:39,471
They call this bullet the Judas.

689
00:45:41,598 --> 00:45:44,310
You barely survived the first blast.

690
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:48,021
You won't survive the second.

691
00:45:52,193 --> 00:45:54,110
Any last words?

692
00:45:54,861 --> 00:45:56,154
Willis...

693
00:45:57,323 --> 00:45:59,157
I'm sorry.

694
00:46:01,285 --> 00:46:03,119
You don't have to do this.

695
00:46:04,455 --> 00:46:06,207
I loved you like a brother.

696
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:09,125
Nigga...

697
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,920
I am your brother.
