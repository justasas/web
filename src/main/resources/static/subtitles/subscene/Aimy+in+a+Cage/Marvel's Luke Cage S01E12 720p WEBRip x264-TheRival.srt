1
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:14,184
[Green] All right, here's the plan.
Triple-cuff him.

2
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:17,020
Alpha team,
you take point positions in the convoy.

3
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:19,314
Bravo team will bring up the rear.

4
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:20,773
Remember, we're clear to engage,

5
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:23,984
so if he so much as looks at you funny,
light him up.

6
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:25,403
[officer 1] Copy that.

7
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:28,323
You hear that, freak?
I got something special for you.

8
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:33,286
This isn't necessary.

9
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:35,830
Yeah, it is.

10
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,959
[indistinct chatter]

11
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:44,464
[groans]

12
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:47,842
No. You need to let us finish.
Ms. Knight. Ms. Knight!

13
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:50,928
It's Detective Knight, and I'm fine.

14
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:55,516
I need a moment with Cage.

15
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:57,977
[Green] Misty, we have special orders.

16
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:00,396
Mario, come on.

17
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:02,815
I was just held hostage.

18
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,360
I just need a minute with him.

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,367
All right. We'll be right here.
We got your back.

20
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:14,702
[officer 2] Clear!

21
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,912
You going down.

22
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:19,749
It's about damn time.

23
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,879
Cottonmouth, Officer Albini,
what just popped off in there...

24
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:29,259
Look, your friend is in the wind.

25
00:01:32,262 --> 00:01:36,557
They've got public enemy number one
in handcuffs for the whole world to see...

26
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,602
so they're not looking for anybody else.

27
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:45,941
Every officer in your detail
has those modified Judas bullets.

28
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:48,819
I wouldn't try anything if I were you...

29
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:52,198
before I got to the precinct.

30
00:01:54,742 --> 00:01:57,036
You're not that crazy, are you?

31
00:01:58,829 --> 00:01:59,955
Always.

32
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:06,504
Take his ass to jail.

33
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:09,632
Come on.

34
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,597
[officer 2] All right, let's go.
We're rolling.

35
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:21,602
[sirens wailing]

36
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:29,777
Three sets of cuffs?
Isn't that overkill?

37
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,655
The camera's on.
We need to look like we're in control.

38
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:35,783
[officer 1] It's a shit detail.

39
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:38,869
You'd think ESU would be in the back
with those guns pointed at him.

40
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:40,788
We've got the same guns
and bullets they do.

41
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:43,166
You know, my wife
says it's the end of days,

42
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:45,084
people like him popping up.

43
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:49,004
They've been saying that
since Eve bit the apple.

44
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:50,673
Cage? He's evolution.

45
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:53,634
[stammers]
Whatever he is, it's just scary.

46
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:56,221
Makes me feel small.
Insignificant.

47
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:58,138
Insecure?

48
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:01,392
You know what they say.
Once you go black, you never go back.

49
00:03:01,476 --> 00:03:03,394
At least that's what your wife
keeps telling me.

50
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:08,524
I was fast asleep when she came home.
Your daughter already wore me out.

51
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:10,067
[officer 2] Just sit tight.

52
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,741
God damn it.

53
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:19,327
Homeless lady.
Can't they move her out of the way?

54
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,662
[Green on loudspeaker]
You are in the path of a police convoy.

55
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:23,414
Clear the road immediately.

56
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,459
[tires screeching]

57
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:28,461
[officer 3] Come on!

58
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:31,256
[Green on loudspeaker]
Cage must not escape. Fire at will!

59
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:33,966
[officer 3] Go, go, go, go, go!

60
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:36,511
He went down the south side.

61
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,805
[guns firing]

62
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,808
[officers shouting indistinctly]

63
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:44,977
[officer 4 on radio]
<i>Somebody give me a sitrep right now!</i>

64
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,355
[officer 5] Team two...
Let's go, let's go!

65
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:50,608
[officers shouting indistinctly]

66
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,544
[sirens wailing]

67
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:13,631
[shotgun cocks]

68
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:21,138
Young cops always wanna chase somebody.

69
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:23,641
Me, I'd rather be
where they're already going.

70
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:28,271
They told us these Judas bullets
can kill someone like you.

71
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:31,148
You don't want to die?
Don't run.

72
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:33,233
I'd rather die than go back to prison.

73
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:35,320
[scoffs] Live free or die?

74
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:37,154
You wanna get all New Hampshire
about this shit?

75
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:38,573
Fine with me.

76
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:42,076
-Cop killers don't survive these streets.
-I didn't kill a cop.

77
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:45,788
My problem isn't with you or yours.

78
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:47,498
It's much bigger than that.

79
00:04:47,582 --> 00:04:50,084
Some people are calling you
a hero for what you did.

80
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:52,211
Connie's, Pop's...

81
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:54,589
I'm no hero.

82
00:04:54,672 --> 00:04:57,633
But I do need to take out
the person responsible for all this.

83
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:01,762
-You don't recognize me, do you?
-[sirens continue wailing]

84
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:07,518
I've seen you at Pop's before.

85
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:11,021
Pop cut my hair for 12 years.

86
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:12,857
He didn't think he was a hero, either.

87
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,610
He was just trying to do some right
after years of wrong.

88
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:22,700
I hope I'm right about you.

89
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:26,579
More people rooting for you
than you think.

90
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:30,333
-What are you gonna tell your people?
-The truth.

91
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,335
I had you in my sights, but you outran me.

92
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:33,836
I'm getting old.

93
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:37,465
Luke?

94
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:40,760
You better catch
that slippery son of a bitch.

95
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:54,148
[theme music playing]

96
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:07,304
Moments after the tumultuous events
at Harlem's Paradise,

97
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:12,977
<i>fugitive and alleged cop killer Luke Cage</i>
<i>was brought out in handcuffs.</i>

98
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,562
<i>And now the city's most...</i>

99
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:16,689
[Turk] Hey, I'm glad you called me,
Willis.

100
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:19,942
Luke Cage is on the run.
They got Shades in bracelets,

101
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:22,194
but they're gonna be onto you
before long, brother.

102
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:24,071
Best believe that.

103
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:27,157
Getting ghost and liquidizing your cash,
that was the right move.

104
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:31,328
<i>-Luke Cage must be approached with...</i>
-[Stryker] I wouldn't touch any of that.

105
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:32,412
[door opens]

106
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:35,082
[door closes]

107
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:37,710
People don't test me more than once.

108
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:41,130
-I overstand.
-Hmm.

109
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,175
What you need me for?

110
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:49,054
I understand you're a man
of discretion and taste

111
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:53,601
with numerous connections
willing to pay full price for my wares.

112
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,936
I can still collect from the shadows.

113
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,355
-Bad news, Diamondback.
-Take those off!

114
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:04,361
I went to your crib.
The files you had are gone.

115
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:13,037
[choking]

116
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:15,122
[coughs]

117
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:17,124
[continues choking]

118
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,756
[laughs]

119
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:26,926
-I had you, didn't I?
-[coughing]

120
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,928
[Stryker continues laughing]

121
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:33,683
I couldn't resist.

122
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,437
I like you, Zip.

123
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:41,566
You've got ambition.
It'll take you far...

124
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:43,818
as long as you stay in your place.

125
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:46,779
The first of the 48 laws of power.

126
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:50,115
Never outshine the master.

127
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:52,910
That was the mistake Shades made.

128
00:08:52,993 --> 00:08:56,205
He questioned me. He doubted me.
He tried to reach too far.

129
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:59,083
He was on some Icarus shit.

130
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:02,962
Do you know who that is?

131
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:06,048
Yeah, he had a verse with Kendrick.

132
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:08,551
-Right?
-No...

133
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:12,638
Icarus was the boy who flew
too close to the sun with fake wings.

134
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:16,516
Shades is no problem.
He's still in custody.

135
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:18,060
Not for long.

136
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:22,898
-You gonna blow the joint up?
-No, he's going to be bailed out.

137
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:26,986
The hell for?
That don't make no sense!

138
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:29,321
See? The questioning.

139
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:31,281
That's how it starts.

140
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:32,825
[sighs]

141
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,459
I'm gonna have an opening.

142
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:45,462
You gonna step up?

143
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:47,757
I'm down to do whatever you need.

144
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:50,885
-No problem.
-[Stryker] Good boy.

145
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:53,512
So are you down?

146
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,306
I'm down.

147
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,559
As long as the business is business,
I'm good with it.

148
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:01,812
Till then, I'm out of here, man.

149
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:04,398
Show Turk out, Zip.

150
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:13,407
Romeo would roll over in his grave,

151
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,326
the way you hop-skipping
with these cats nowadays.

152
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,746
He was a man on these streets.
You's a boy.

153
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:20,665
What the hell are you talking about?

154
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:23,375
You're down here in his pocket,
same as me.

155
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,294
I'm doing business with him, yes.

156
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:30,132
But I ain't his boy.
And I definitely ain't his bitch.

157
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:42,102
-[door slams]
-[Zip scoffs]

158
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:45,439
These old-ass niggas talkin' about shit
they don't even know about.

159
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:48,067
So... what's in the box?

160
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:51,987
One of the seven deadly sins, my boy...

161
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:55,032
which I plan to unleash on dear old Carl.

162
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:56,283
Which one?

163
00:10:58,035 --> 00:10:59,411
Wrath.

164
00:11:01,914 --> 00:11:05,542
[in Spanish]
This Diamondback needs to be dealt with.

165
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:12,758
Ernesto is right, Domingo.
This is the perfect time to do it.

166
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:15,135
We've got the muscle.

167
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:21,641
Plus, with the Cuban, Jamaican,
Dominican and Haitian leaders dead,

168
00:11:21,726 --> 00:11:26,605
we can control the drugs,
guns, all of it...

169
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:29,775
and walk out like kings.

170
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,738
[in English] I was there
when he took them all out.

171
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,115
Right next door.

172
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,994
We got the drugs.

173
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:41,954
We got that money.

174
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:45,540
But with the guns,
we can control everything.

175
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,753
Here, the islands, further south...

176
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:53,758
We'd be unstoppable. Hmm?

177
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:56,676
[Ernesto in Spanish]
So what are you saying?

178
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:00,639
[in English] We take him out.

179
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:03,768
We go after what's ours.

180
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:06,020
[Ernesto scoffs and chuckles]

181
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:09,689
Let's go find Diamondback.

182
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,610
[sighs]

183
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:17,489
{\an8}-[camera shutter clicking]
-[officer 1] Turn and face the camera.

184
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:25,372
[officer 2] All right, let's go.
Move it.

185
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:43,891
You're supposed to be in the hospital.

186
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:48,520
Push yourself too hard too soon
and you could make it worse, you know.

187
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,065
-I appreciate your concern.
-No, you don't.

188
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:55,110
I need you at 100%.

189
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:57,988
I need to prove Luke Cage is innocent.

190
00:12:59,114 --> 00:13:00,908
Well, the hostages
have all been consistent

191
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:02,659
that Luke Cage
never held them at gunpoint.

192
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:05,204
[Misty] He was set up.
You know it, Priscilla.

193
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:07,039
Half this damn department knows it.

194
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,042
We need to be going after Willis Stryker.

195
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,169
Well, then why is Luke Cage running?

196
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:17,424
He's a black man
being chased by the cops...

197
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:19,009
oh, with special bullets.

198
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:22,137
Accused of killing a cop,

199
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:24,514
and you're asking why he's running?
Come on.

200
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:33,482
Look at how relaxed
Hernan "Shades" Alvarez is.

201
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:36,026
He knows he's not going anywhere
anytime soon,

202
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,611
so he's resting up.

203
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:40,447
He knows he's guilty.

204
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:50,332
See this perp?

205
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:55,462
Look how his foot is bouncing.
Nervous.

206
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:58,924
-No wonder his street name is Sugar.
-[chuckles]

207
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:01,010
I don't even have to say a word,
and here come the waterworks.

208
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:03,012
He's probably innocent...

209
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:06,265
or less guilty
than whoever he's about to give up.

210
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:07,766
That's a detectives' wives' tale.

211
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:09,894
You can't prove
guilt or innocence by that.

212
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:12,312
Oh, but you can...

213
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:14,189
-because Luke gave you his word.
-Luke--

214
00:14:14,273 --> 00:14:17,026
Right now, his actions
are speaking louder than his words.

215
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,485
Luke Cage...

216
00:14:19,403 --> 00:14:21,238
saved my life.

217
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:25,659
I don't dispute that we should be
bringing in Diamondback,

218
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:28,828
but to get to the truth,
we need to bring them both in.

219
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:31,957
[indistinct chatter]

220
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:37,963
Okay, well, let me lead the charge.
Make sure Luke is brought in safely.

221
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:40,549
He threw away his chance
when he jumped out that damn van.

222
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:43,635
Now they will shoot him on sight
with the mayor's blessing.

223
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:51,685
You know what?
At least let me take a crack at Shades.

224
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:54,063
He's in deep with all the players.

225
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:56,899
He doesn't scare me.

226
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:58,400
-Detective--
-I can handle him.

227
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,152
You just got shot.

228
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:02,862
-I need you to go home, get some rest.
-[sighs]

229
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,034
I'll interview Shades.

230
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:21,715
[Mariah] My grandmother
loved Harlem's Paradise.

231
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:28,931
She took care of all the small details.

232
00:15:29,014 --> 00:15:30,474
She loved it.

233
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:36,146
From the murals...

234
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,358
the glasswork,
all the way down to the table linens.

235
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:42,819
No fine point was overlooked.

236
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:47,532
-[glass shattering]
-This was her legacy.

237
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:53,247
My family's in tatters,
and it's all because of Diamondback. Shit!

238
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:55,457
[stammers]

239
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,417
Uh, I know, I know...

240
00:15:58,418 --> 00:16:00,337
[sighs] I need to get out
in front of this.

241
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,800
Release a statement about Damon Boone
and how much I respected him.

242
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:07,677
That is not what I was gonna say.

243
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:10,639
Well, yeah, just--
Please, no lectures.

244
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,645
This is just a thing.

245
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:21,691
Things can be rebuilt, and when you do,
you rebuild it as your legacy.

246
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:23,277
Not just the clubs.

247
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:30,325
I want to be a part of that.

248
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:37,957
Here's what I think.

249
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:41,003
Controlling the narrative is everything.
We can't have any loose threads.

250
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:42,462
So anyone who might have overheard

251
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:45,799
anything you said to Diamondback
or Shades in here...

252
00:16:45,882 --> 00:16:47,301
is a threat.

253
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:50,095
You're absolutely correct.

254
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:52,847
[chuckles]

255
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,891
How may I be of service?

256
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:02,149
I wouldn't want you
to do anything untoward.

257
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,234
Never.

258
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:07,362
Okay.

259
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:10,282
[indistinct chatter]

260
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:36,350
I don't have time for this.

261
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:39,394
-[cash rustling]
-[man 1] Don't move.

262
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:41,438
He'll blow your head off.
He's crazy like that.

263
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:43,107
Don't try no shit.

264
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:50,322
My bad, Meth.
I grew up on that Wu-Tang shit.

265
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:52,866
-But you know how it is.
-[Method Man] Are you serious?

266
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:55,660
Are you really trying
to have a conversation right now?

267
00:17:55,744 --> 00:17:57,871
I'm just tryin'... I'm just sayin'...
You're the man, yo.

268
00:17:57,954 --> 00:18:00,290
Pull your mask down! You supposed to be
watchin' the damn door, Bryce!

269
00:18:00,374 --> 00:18:02,501
What I say about using
my government name, Michael?

270
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:03,835
[door chimes]

271
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:06,921
Damn, homie. You look like
you went through a cheese grater.

272
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:08,465
Oh, snap, you Luke--

273
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:10,217
-[gun firing]
-[bullet ricocheting]

274
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,719
-[glass shattering]
-[gasping]

275
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:17,516
I ain't mean that.

276
00:18:21,353 --> 00:18:23,272
Give me your phone.

277
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:24,523
The phone, fool.

278
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:27,484
Yo, my bad, man. You know,
I just got a little nervous and shit

279
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,195
-when you threw my mans across the--
-[grunts]

280
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:34,158
It's you.

281
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:38,245
-Yeah, it's you.
-[chuckles]

282
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:39,829
No, man, it's you.

283
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:43,708
Yo, man, "P.L.O. Style"
was my joint back in the day.

284
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,295
Sweet Christmas. [chuckles]

285
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,422
Yeah, man, one second.

286
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:54,594
Hey. It's me.

287
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,639
Yeah, they'll be looking for me.

288
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:01,601
I'll lay in the cut.
I'll see you in a few.

289
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:08,150
You a double XL?

290
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,776
[scoffs] Way ahead of you, homie,

291
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,042
Call the cops.

292
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,420
I know a lot of people who would pay you
for this kind of protection.

293
00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:30,380
They can keep their money.

294
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:33,258
Salute.

295
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:38,930
[laughs]

296
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:41,766
You ever see anything like that before?

297
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,477
Harlem, baby.

298
00:19:44,353 --> 00:19:45,687
Harlem.

299
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,231
[cell phone ringing]

300
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,525
-Hello?
-[Candace] <i>Detective Knight?</i>

301
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:53,152
-Candace?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

302
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:55,239
<i>What number are you calling me from?</i>

303
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:58,074
A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS.

304
00:19:58,157 --> 00:19:59,576
I need to see you.

305
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:02,746
-Come into the precinct.
<i>-No. No.</i>

306
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:06,416
You saw how quickly Mariah
sent that lawyer and got me out of there.

307
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:10,795
You didn't wanna talk to me before.
What makes you trust me now?

308
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,714
<i>Because Luke Cage does.</i>

309
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:16,843
He saved my life.
And you saw right through me.

310
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:22,224
<i>-You want the truth, right?</i>
-Where are you?

311
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:24,351
<i>-Look, if you can't help--</i>
-Candace.

312
00:20:24,434 --> 00:20:26,936
<i>Tell me a place, and I will be there.</i>

313
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,986
[Ridley] You should be at Rikers
right now, but I held you...

314
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:38,740
because I think you have something to say.

315
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:41,285
Lawyer.

316
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:45,330
[chuckles]
I know your record, Mr. Alvarez.

317
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:49,459
Came up in Harlem, rolled around
with Cottonmouth in the late '90s,

318
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:51,545
spent some time at Spofford, Sing Sing,

319
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:54,339
then you made it to the big time,
went to Seagate.

320
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,550
[sighs]

321
00:20:58,718 --> 00:21:00,136
Lawyer.

322
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:03,598
Cornell Stokes is dead,
but you're still alive.

323
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,226
And I've never seen
an arraignment happen so quickly.

324
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:09,271
Two million dollar bail...

325
00:21:09,354 --> 00:21:11,773
and someone paid it in cash.

326
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:15,109
Who's your new sponsor?
Is it Willis Stryker?

327
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:17,279
Law...

328
00:21:18,196 --> 00:21:19,323
...yer.

329
00:21:20,824 --> 00:21:24,077
You were part
of a hostage situation, Hernan.

330
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,039
Even if your lawyer does get you out...

331
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,543
you won't be walking away from that.

332
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:35,088
That's multiple kidnapping
and weapons charges.

333
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:38,800
How does 25 years to life sound to you?
Minimum.

334
00:21:39,718 --> 00:21:40,885
Are you serious?

335
00:21:42,387 --> 00:21:43,597
Yep.

336
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:48,852
Okay.

337
00:21:50,103 --> 00:21:51,355
[scoffs]

338
00:21:52,647 --> 00:21:53,773
Okay.

339
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:55,984
[scoffs]

340
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:58,945
I... I was in the club.

341
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:00,196
[clears throat]

342
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:02,866
I saw what happened.

343
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:06,160
I know who did it.

344
00:22:07,454 --> 00:22:10,039
-Okay.
-[inhales deeply]

345
00:22:10,123 --> 00:22:13,960
We can protect you,
but I need a name to verify.

346
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:16,087
Who was it?

347
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:21,259
Was it Stryker?

348
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:27,474
He goes by...

349
00:22:30,226 --> 00:22:31,436
lawyer.

350
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:35,982
You need me to spell it?

351
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:38,359
[laughing]

352
00:22:40,862 --> 00:22:41,988
[door slams]

353
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:58,296
-You call this safe?
-We're hiding in plain sight.

354
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:01,550
I've got you.
For now.

355
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:04,969
Lie to me again, Candace, I walk away
from here, and you are on your own.

356
00:23:05,053 --> 00:23:07,305
-It's not bullshit.
-We'll see.

357
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:11,768
How did you even get out of
Harlem's Paradise without being stopped?

358
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:15,522
They were so busy trying to arrest Luke,
I just walked away.

359
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:20,234
So what is it?

360
00:23:20,318 --> 00:23:22,153
What do you need to tell me
that's so important?

361
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:23,447
[sighs]

362
00:23:25,865 --> 00:23:28,409
I was at the club
the night Cottonmouth died.

363
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:31,287
I already know that.

364
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:34,082
I mean right after.

365
00:23:41,756 --> 00:23:43,299
[sighs]

366
00:23:53,643 --> 00:23:54,686
[beeps]

367
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:00,149
Mariah killed him.

368
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:03,903
[Shades] The trash bag is for the clothes
you're wearing now.

369
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:07,115
Every stitch goes in.
Jewelry, too.

370
00:24:07,198 --> 00:24:09,493
Someone from Spurlock's
will incinerate them.

371
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:14,789
The secret to any good lie
is it has to run parallel to the truth.

372
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:17,792
[Misty] <i>How do you know this?</i>

373
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:19,919
[Candace] <i>I heard them talking about it.</i>

374
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:21,170
[Shades] Do what I say.

375
00:24:21,254 --> 00:24:24,257
[Candace] <i>The guy who always</i>
<i>wears sunglasses, he was there.</i>

376
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:30,179
<i>It was his idea to say</i>
<i>Luke Cage killed Cottonmouth.</i>

377
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:36,645
[grunts]

378
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:41,399
I was so scared.

379
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:43,860
I snuck out of there, back to the lockers.

380
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:46,780
And, um, I was trying to calm myself down.

381
00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:50,366
When I went upstairs,
the guy with the glasses

382
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:53,077
offered me $50,000 to tell a story.

383
00:24:55,246 --> 00:24:56,455
So I told one.

384
00:24:57,957 --> 00:25:01,252
-Why are you coming clean now?
-'Cause I can't live with this.

385
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:04,589
Especially after Luke saving my life.

386
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,552
If you can guarantee my safety,

387
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:11,721
I will testify about
everything I just told you.

388
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:15,975
[phone beeps]

389
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:23,482
Mariah scares me more than Cottonmouth.

390
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:30,031
I asked her if she thought Luke did it,
mostly to see if I could trust her.

391
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:32,533
To see if she would tell me the truth.

392
00:25:37,455 --> 00:25:40,291
She looked me right in my eye and said...

393
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:44,921
"You never know
what anyone is capable of."

394
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:48,925
[breath trembling]
It was the way she said it.

395
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:53,096
She... she would kill me
if she knew I was speaking to you.

396
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:54,889
I truly believe that.

397
00:25:56,975 --> 00:25:58,559
Thank you for helping me.

398
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:04,608
I'm gonna nail
Mariah Dillard's ass to the wall.

399
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:11,698
-Who else knows that you're here?
-Just my friend Leslie.

400
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:15,326
Don't call anyone else,
not even Leslie.

401
00:26:16,661 --> 00:26:18,121
As a matter of fact, give me your phone.

402
00:26:19,623 --> 00:26:20,874
Come on.

403
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:28,840
Okay. Now, I picked this up...
on the way, just in case.

404
00:26:30,383 --> 00:26:32,343
It's already got my number
programed in there,

405
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:35,054
so if I call or text, you know it's me.

406
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:40,351
Is your arm okay?

407
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:43,187
[sighs] My trigger finger is just fine.

408
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:47,191
Come on, let's go.

409
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:49,360
-Where?
-Soledad's.

410
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,779
Her daughter Claire

411
00:26:50,862 --> 00:26:53,239
is the one who treated your ankle
at Harlem's Paradise.

412
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,490
She'll be there, too.

413
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:57,326
I'm gonna take you there myself.

414
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,886
[Method Man] No lie.
Bullets was flying everywhere and shit.

415
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:19,766
You trying to tell me
that those are bullet holes?

416
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:22,435
Man, Meth, I love you,
but get out of here.

417
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:23,770
I... I don't believe that.

418
00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:26,522
HB, I thought the same thing...

419
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:30,902
until shorty pulled the biscuit
and let two off on Cage

420
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:32,528
and they bounced off.

421
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:34,197
Bullets ricochetin' and shit.

422
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,990
[stammers] Look,
I'm telling y'all the truth.

423
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:37,784
I see y'all over there,
y'all don't believe it.

424
00:27:37,867 --> 00:27:38,910
Trust me, it's the truth.

425
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:41,830
[stutters] And after he smacked fire
out these dudes,

426
00:27:41,913 --> 00:27:45,416
he left the hoodie,
told me and Gomez to call the police.

427
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,794
You know I ain't calling no po-po.
Then he bounced.

428
00:27:47,877 --> 00:27:50,254
-Say word.
-Word, Sway. I'm telling you.

429
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:52,841
He even balled the dude's gun up
like some old homework.

430
00:27:53,883 --> 00:27:57,428
But my thing is, though, if he innocent,
so what he running for?

431
00:27:58,346 --> 00:28:00,681
Bulletproof always gonna come
second to being black.

432
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:03,517
HB, you should know that.
You from Jers. Jers!

433
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:05,812
Wow! Sound like
he stunted on you right there.

434
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:07,521
He did stunt.
It was a stunt. It was a stunt.

435
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:09,273
-Why you gotta stunt on me?
-[laughs]

436
00:28:09,357 --> 00:28:10,399
No, I mean, seriously.

437
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:13,903
Seriously, though, what I'm just saying,
like, if that was me...

438
00:28:13,987 --> 00:28:15,905
-[Heather B] Right.
-...and I was on the run.

439
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:18,616
-Why even get involved?
-[Sway] Hmm.

440
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:19,743
But he did.

441
00:28:20,493 --> 00:28:24,288
And those dudes was nervous,
so anything could've happened.

442
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:27,250
As far as I'm concerned,
Luke Cage saved my life, man.

443
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,002
That's what's up, man.

444
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:32,005
You know what,
that don't sound like no cop killer to me.

445
00:28:32,088 --> 00:28:33,631
For real, for real.

446
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:38,803
You know, there's somethin' powerful
about seeing a black man

447
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:41,597
that's bulletproof and unafraid.

448
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,641
-Come on, y'all. You know?
-Yeah, yeah.

449
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:45,226
[Method Man]
Streets got mad love for Cage.

450
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:48,562
I got mad love for Cage, man, and...
and he one of ours.

451
00:28:48,646 --> 00:28:50,398
Yeah, yeah.
But you know what?

452
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:52,191
We got mad love for you, too.

453
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:53,902
-No doubt.
-You one of ours, man.

454
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:56,320
You know, the show's almost over, man.
You gonna spit for us?

455
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:59,073
-Of course.
-Oh, man! He 'bout to spit!

456
00:28:59,157 --> 00:29:01,159
-Citizens, you are in for a treat.

wearing hoodies with holes

<i>Sway in the Morning.</i>
What's on your mind, citizen?

509
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:22,133
[man] <i>Yo, I remember when Larry Davis</i>
<i>was on the run back in the day.</i>

510
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,552
<i>Cops came at him</i>
<i>'cause they were just as corrupt,</i>

511
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:26,554
<i>dangerous and jacked up as he was.</i>

512
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:30,808
{\an8}<i>I don't think we're getting the full story</i>
<i>on Luke Cage yet, for real.</i>

513
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:32,894
[Sway] <i>I wouldn't put it</i>
<i>past the government, man.</i>

514
00:31:32,977 --> 00:31:36,105
<i>Um, you know, we're gonna be searching</i>
<i>for the answers for you,</i>

515
00:31:36,189 --> 00:31:37,481
<i>and once we get the facts,</i>

516
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:40,151
<i>we're gonna put it right here</i>
<i>on</i> Sway's Universe, <i>all right?</i>

517
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:42,820
<i>Thanks for your call, citizen.</i>
<i>We got another person on the line.</i>

518

-[beeps]
-[smooth jazz playing]

519
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,077
[man] Now. Come on!
[woman] All right.

520
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,079
[indistinct shouting]

521
00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:54,248
Oh, come on, man.
You know he's not here.

522
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:06,760
I understand playing against the computer,
but, um, how do you beat yourself?

523
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:08,679
Chess is a game of anticipation.

524
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,642
If you know every single possible move,

525
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:17,521
you can anticipate your adversary's
next move before he does.

526
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:18,647
Oh.

527
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:20,608
That's deep.

528
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:24,195
If we find out you've been hiding him,
there'll be hell to pay.

529
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:26,780
Yeah, well, just don't break the hinges
on that door on your way out.

530
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:29,408
I just got it fixed.

531
00:32:57,061 --> 00:32:59,605
[smooth jazz continues on radio]

532
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,364
That was a close shave.

533
00:33:09,282 --> 00:33:10,408
Bad pun.

534
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:14,662
What the hell did you
even come back for, man?

535
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,457
[sighs] I had to.

536
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,293
For Harlem.

537
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:22,878
Take care of Diamondback
before he made it bad for everybody.

538
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,714
Well, forget Harlem.
Forget your brother!

539
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:29,510
You're on the road in a brand new car
and a woman that fine?

540
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:31,679
And you're bulletproof.

541
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:34,098
[scoffs] You'd have never seen
my black ass again.

542
00:33:34,182 --> 00:33:36,767
I'd rob the occasional bank
and never look back.

543
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,144
[chuckles]

544
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:43,899
You got every cop in the city
looking for you, brother.

545
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:48,029
Negroes writing
Luke Cage ballads and shit.

546
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:52,450
So... what's the plan?

547
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,330
To box in all the players.

548
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,126
Well...

549
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:06,214
Shades is in jail.

550
00:34:06,297 --> 00:34:09,592
Mariah's out,
but she ain't exactly on your side.

551
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:11,177
Now you could tail both of 'em,

552
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,597
but no telling how long that'll take
for them to lead you to your prey.

553
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,269
What about Misty?

554
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,980
No, she's got her hands full already.

555
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:24,773
She's trying to clear my name
inside the precinct

556
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:26,900
and bring me in at the same time.

557
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,112
-We gotta be careful with her.
-[sighs]

558
00:34:30,488 --> 00:34:31,905
That leaves you one other option.

559
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:35,451
Someone else to find Diamondback.

560
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:39,163
[softly] Here.

561
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:41,290
Turk.

562
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,918
Turk may be a pawn, but he's not dumb.

563
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:47,088
If he thinks he's being set up,
he'll disappear.

564
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:48,422
[dialing]

565
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,716
You let me worry about that.

566
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,303
Hey, Turk, it's Bobby.

567
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:57,515
Listen, I might be able to get my hands
on about 30 pairs of Jordans.

568
00:34:58,516 --> 00:35:00,726
They're the vintage Air Jordan 5s.

569
00:35:01,644 --> 00:35:03,979
Let's just say
they fell off the back of a truck.

570
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:06,565
Okay, when?

571
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:17,326
Who's this?

572
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,496
First name Law, last name Yer.

573
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:25,501
Must be pretty damn connected to get
a lawyer and not even know who she is.

574
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:27,461
Membership has its privileges.

575
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:30,923
[indistinct chatter]

576
00:35:35,261 --> 00:35:36,970
He sprung you?

577
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:41,475
You think this is funny, don't you?

578
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:44,728
You got this all figured out, huh?

579
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,731
No...

580
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:50,401
actually, I don't.

581
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,724
When did Diamondback bring in new hires?

582
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:24,435
Well, after the club,
he had to change things up.

583
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,437
Recruit some new faces.

584
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:40,117
I bet while you were inside,

585
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:42,745
cops tried to do
some recruiting of their own.

586
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:46,707
Don't ever question my loyalty.

587
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,479
-The man upstairs?
-[scoffs]

588
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:11,023
You are just full of questions.

589
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:13,609
Matter of fact...

590
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:15,319
[groans]

591
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:19,907

598
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,831
Let's go to the penthouse.

-[breath trembling]

602
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:27,766
I was just following orders!

603
00:38:35,316 --> 00:38:37,275
You're a goddamn puppet.

604
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:39,653
Who gave you the order?

605
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:42,030
[grunts]

606
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:47,244
-Who?
-[grunts]

607
00:38:49,372 --> 00:38:50,998
Diamondback!

608
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:55,794
You stopped playing your position.
Asked too many questions.

609
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:58,381
Diamondback said
you needed to be dealt with.

610
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:03,969
Romeo would be ashamed of you.

611
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:05,388
[Zip laughing]

612
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:08,056
You're such a disappointment.

613
00:39:08,766 --> 00:39:10,976
You're the second person
who told me that today.

614
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:14,647
I'm my own man, Shades.

615
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:19,317
Tell him yourself.

616
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:37,545
[chuckles]

617
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:48,514
Nice.

618
00:39:53,394 --> 00:39:56,980
[sighs] Sorry, Romeo...
He had to go.

619
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,817
[sirens wailing in the distance]

620
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:05,280
It's a good thing her friend Leslie
knew where she was.

621
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:07,491
-I'm glad you found the park.
-Mmm-hmm.

622
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:08,826
So where is she now?

623
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:12,413
She left with Detective Knight.
Traffic got thick and I lost them.

624
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:14,582
I'm sorry. I'm not used to doing
anything like this.

625
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:15,916
We'll find her again.

626
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:18,836
Just knowing
that she can't be trusted is helpful.

627
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,797
You did a good job, Alex.

628
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,591
Hey, you're my rock!

629
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:27,678
Later.

630
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:29,555
[cell phone ringing]

631
00:40:41,734 --> 00:40:43,360
What do you want?

632
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:46,279
[Stryker] <i>That's no way</i>
<i>to speak to a business partner.</i>

633
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:48,907
After what you did to my club,

634
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:51,118
do you really think I'm gonna
shuck and jive with you?

635
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:53,829
<i>You might wanna check your attitude.</i>

636
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:57,791
<i>If you're not of any use to me,</i>
<i>then you're not useful to anyone.</i>

637
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:01,629
<i>Shades would tell you,</i>
<i>if he was still alive.</i>

638
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:05,257
What the hell are you talking about?

639
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,300
<i>I had to let him go.</i>

640
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:12,139
<i>So now, I'm giving you the chance</i>
<i>to tell me where you stand.</i>

641
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:16,309
<i>I've taken Shades and Damon Boone</i>
<i>off the table so you can grow.</i>

642
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:18,562
<i>I'd hate for us to part, too.</i>

643
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:22,816
I wasn't particularly fond of Shades...

644
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:28,572
and the death of Damon Boone,
although unnecessary,

645
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:30,448
was appreciated.

646
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:36,789
But you need to know this.
I'm out of the political game.

647
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:41,376
I'm focusing on Harlem's Paradise.
Using it for a...

648
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:46,131
a power base for community relations.

649
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:48,884
That's a smart move.

650
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,761
But you've made some dumb ones also.

651
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:54,515
You should never talk about murder
on an open line.

652
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,355
Open it.

653
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:21,249
Seed money...
for your New Harlem Renaissance project

654
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,210
and refurbishing the club.

655
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:25,671
My apologies.

656
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:32,553
It's a very generous donation...
but nothing in this world is free.

657
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:34,012
You're right.

658
00:42:35,598 --> 00:42:39,560
My only condition is loyalty.

659
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:44,522
Stick with me and Harlem will be remade
in your own image.

660
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,818
We'll be doing this for years to come.

661
00:42:49,612 --> 00:42:51,739
Harlem is already in my image.

662
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:56,827
You staying?

663
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:00,247
Once I'm finished with Carl,
I'll evaporate.

664
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:02,958
But don't worry.

665
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,629
You'll still feel
the occasional cool breeze.

666
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:11,216
Sweet dreams, Mariah.

667

672
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,543
You got Pop killed.

673
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,671
Man, the writing was on the wall.

674
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:52,090
Somebody would have seen him.
Might as well be me.

675
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:54,968
How was I supposed to know
Tone was gonna shoot up the shop?

676
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:58,806
Whole damn world know
Pop's was Switzerland. Forever.

677
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:00,098
I should crush you.

678
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:03,351
[chuckles] You won't, though.
You need me.

679
00:44:03,435 --> 00:44:04,978
[inhales sharply]
Where's Diamondback?

680
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:08,106
I don't know--
[screaming]

00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:11,276
What the-- [yelps]

682
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:15,613
-Hey!
-You still stalling?

683
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:19,576
[Turk whimpering]

684
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:22,204
All right! All right!

685
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:24,707
He's at a warehouse by the Harlem River.

686
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,624
Near 145th, all right?

687
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,255
I gave you what you wanted!
Now let me out!

688
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,466
Sit tight, Mr. Barrett.

689
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:36,468
Trash pickup is tomorrow.

690
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:39,972
You can breathe just fine.
There's food in there, too.

691
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:43,391
[banging]

692
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,811
You can't leave me in here!

693
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:48,605
There's baby diapers in here, man!

694
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:50,565
Hey!

695
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,651
Come on!

696
00:44:53,736 --> 00:44:55,112
[door opening]

697
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:02,870
[door slams]

698
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:22,806
[Domingo]
Looks like you downgraded.

699
00:45:23,766 --> 00:45:25,558
I liked the club better.

700
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,146
I'm a man who needs his space.

701
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:32,690
Space is a good thing.

702
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:35,903
-Especially when you come to kill a man.
-[guns cocking]

703
00:45:35,986 --> 00:45:37,154
Whoa, whoa.

704
00:45:41,158 --> 00:45:42,575
[guns cocking]

705
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:50,583
Someone did your boy Zip
and his two homies.

706
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:53,170
That's not Cage's style...

707
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:56,589
so I'm guessing Shades
didn't appreciate you bailing him out.

708
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:08,018
You know when a rattlesnake
is at its most dangerous, Domingo?

709
00:46:10,728 --> 00:46:11,897
When it's cornered.

710
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:40,926
I'm gonna rip your head off!

711
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:46,681
[groans]

712
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:04,324
[gunshots continue]

713
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:11,539
-[whirring]
-[chuckles]

714
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:17,045
"And behold a pale horse...

715
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:21,967
and he that sat upon him,
his name was Death."

716
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:32,602
[exhales]

717
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:33,811
[sniffs]

718
00:48:10,515 --> 00:48:12,559
You really need a security system.

719
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:17,564
-You waiting for me?
-No.

720
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:21,401
I bet he told you I was dead.

721
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:25,697
Diamondback got to you, didn't he?

722
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,907
No, he didn't.

723
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,952
[scoffs]

724
00:48:32,955 --> 00:48:35,707
What are you doing with a gun?
It's not you.

725
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,042
Shut up.

726
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:40,378
[sighs]

727
00:48:41,546 --> 00:48:43,298
I have something for you.

728
00:48:48,553 --> 00:48:49,887
Figured...

729
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:54,767
you'd want this.

730
00:48:58,938 --> 00:49:02,192
Your prints... Cornell's blood.

731
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:12,369
Then you'll have nothing
to blackmail me with.

732
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:14,704
I don't need it.

733
00:49:15,663 --> 00:49:17,374
We're in this together now.

734
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,544
[bottle thuds]

735
00:49:23,546 --> 00:49:25,632
You and I have come a long way.

736
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:31,846
You know, sometimes you have to reach
across the aisle to get things done.

737
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:35,892
You're talking about Luke Cage?

738
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:40,813
It's incredible...
how much you and I think alike.

739
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:44,317
We're at war.

740
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:49,322
And right now,
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

741
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:54,077
Maybe.
But it might not take.

742
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:57,664
You did beat his ass
and give him his powers.

743
00:49:57,747 --> 00:49:59,374
-Mmm-hmm.
-And...

744
00:49:59,457 --> 00:50:03,670
Cornell's flunky killed Pop.
You think he really is gonna jump?

745
00:50:03,753 --> 00:50:05,255
Just jump on our bandwagon?

746
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:07,299
Absolutely.

747
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:10,802
'Cause we have something
that he wants more than anything.

748
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:15,473
His old life.

749
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:19,477
A chance to clear his name.
Right here.

750
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:27,402
If we send Luke after Diamondback
and they kill each other...

751
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:30,238
all of our problems are swept away.

752
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:32,031
-[exhales]
-No matter who wins.

753
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:34,909
[chuckles] Even better.

754
00:51:32,675 --> 00:51:34,219
[Domingo groaning]

755
00:51:39,974 --> 00:51:42,269
I should've known you'd turn up.
[breathing heavily]

756
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:45,147
What the hell happened here?

757
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:48,566
Diamondback.

758
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:49,942
[groaning]

759
00:51:50,026 --> 00:51:52,362
[faint beeping in distance]

760
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:06,709
[beeping continues]

761
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:22,392
Sweet sister.

762
00:52:22,475 --> 00:52:24,186
[beeping continues]

763
00:52:41,035 --> 00:52:43,413
[Luke panting] Slow.

764
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:46,208
Take it easy.

765
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:50,378
What did he use?

766
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:52,547
How did Diamondback do that?

767
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,384
[breathing heavily]
Something I've never seen before.

768
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:58,470
[siren wailing in the distance]

769
00:52:58,553 --> 00:53:00,638
Even you can't stop him.

770
00:53:03,015 --> 00:53:04,851
[exhales softly]

771
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:18,740
These just came in.

772
00:53:19,782 --> 00:53:22,994
-[sighs] Elephant punches all over again.
-Mmm-hmm.

773
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:24,203
That's gotta be Cage, right?

774
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:26,038
[cell phone ringing]

775
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:33,838
-Hello?
-[Luke] <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

776
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:36,508
<i>You guys find Domingo?</i>

777
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:38,426
-Yeah.
<i>-Meet me.</i>

778
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,719
Where?

779
00:54:04,118 --> 00:54:05,995
Should I thank you for this?

780
00:54:06,996 --> 00:54:09,123
All credit goes to Diamondback.

781
00:54:09,206 --> 00:54:11,876
I don't suppose we'll find his body.

782
00:54:11,959 --> 00:54:15,171
We found Zip's, though,
and two other thugs in an old building.

783
00:54:15,254 --> 00:54:18,007
Shot up. Right after
they picked up your other boy.

784
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,259
Shades.

785
00:54:21,969 --> 00:54:24,180
Don't you ever get tired
of people getting out?

786
00:54:25,097 --> 00:54:26,182
Yes.

787
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:32,146
Look, it's not safe for you to be here.
If you don't find Diamondback--

788
00:54:32,229 --> 00:54:35,107
Then he wins,
and my life is forever a living hell.

789
00:54:37,777 --> 00:54:39,362
Is there anything I can do?

790
00:54:40,279 --> 00:54:41,948
See what else Turk knows.

791
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:44,492
He's in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd.

792
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:46,786
Near Mount Olivet and the shop.

793
00:54:48,287 --> 00:54:49,664
A Dumpster?

794
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:56,838
[sighs]

795
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:07,014
Even if we handle Diamondback...

796
00:55:07,098 --> 00:55:10,602
he's not gonna forgive us
for framing him for Cornell's death.

797
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:13,229
We could hurdle that easy.

798
00:55:14,313 --> 00:55:16,691
The only people who know
what really happened in the club

799
00:55:16,774 --> 00:55:18,568
are you and me.

800
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:24,407
I'll regret that night
for the rest of my life.

801
00:55:25,533 --> 00:55:26,993
You did what you had to do.

802
00:55:27,076 --> 00:55:29,120
You shouldn't regret that.

803
00:55:31,706 --> 00:55:34,751
What were you even doing
at the club that night?

804
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:41,716
I was going there to kill him.

805
00:55:43,593 --> 00:55:45,177
You beat me to it.

806
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:52,852
Cornell never needed my political money.

807
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,105
And he was never going to pay it back.

808
00:55:58,024 --> 00:56:02,111
He just wanted me in all the way.

809
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:04,572
So what are you saying?

810
00:56:09,368 --> 00:56:13,665
He saw things in me...
that I avoided my whole life.

811
00:56:16,959 --> 00:56:21,673
Now I am becoming
that person he always saw...

812
00:56:24,717 --> 00:56:26,343
and I always denied.

813
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:32,559
You ready?

814
00:56:34,351 --> 00:56:36,062
I stay ready, baby.

815
00:57:01,378 --> 00:57:04,173
I should've kept my coat on.
Hell just froze over.

816
00:57:04,256 --> 00:57:05,299
[door closes]

817
00:57:05,382 --> 00:57:08,470
-Where's Luke Cage?
-I'm right here.

818
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:12,098
-We have a problem.
-So do I.

819
00:57:12,181 --> 00:57:15,435
I can't decide which one of you
I'm gonna knock out first.

820
00:57:15,518 --> 00:57:18,312
-Where's Diamondback?
-I don't know.

821
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:21,524
The parley between the three of us
is more important.

822
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,610
You have the nerve to use that term?

823
00:57:23,693 --> 00:57:25,820
Right here?
Where Pop died?

824
00:57:26,738 --> 00:57:28,448
Cough up Diamondback's location,

825
00:57:28,531 --> 00:57:30,658
or I'll stomp you
like we were back at Seagate.

826
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:32,368
Luke, be cool, brother.

827
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:35,705
Whoa, whoa.
No one needs to stomp anyone.

828
00:57:35,788 --> 00:57:38,583
Pops made this place Switzerland
for a reason.

829
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:41,002
Cage, we have a mutual enemy,

830
00:57:41,085 --> 00:57:44,130
and the only way to bring him down
is for us all to come together.

831
00:57:44,213 --> 00:57:46,340
There's no way I'm helping you.

832
00:57:46,423 --> 00:57:49,010
We came to offer you a truce.

833
00:57:49,093 --> 00:57:52,263
In exchange for helping you
find Diamondback,

834
00:57:52,346 --> 00:57:53,848
you drop your beef with us.

835
00:57:53,931 --> 00:57:56,058
You both framed me for murder.

836
00:57:56,142 --> 00:57:58,895
There's nothing you can offer me
that's going to make me let that go.

837
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:02,023
Uh... how about your freedom?

838
00:58:03,232 --> 00:58:06,360
Right here is everything you need

839
00:58:06,443 --> 00:58:09,405
to prove that Diamondback
framed Carl Lucas.

840
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:22,544
Even if Carl Lucas is exonerated...

841
00:58:22,627 --> 00:58:25,547
Luke Cage is now wanted
for the murder of Cottonmouth.

842
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,464
I'll tell them the truth.

843
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:30,927
Diamondback killed Cornell
and Damon Boone.

844
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,554
You'll go free.

845
00:58:34,931 --> 00:58:36,432
What the hell is this?

846
00:58:36,516 --> 00:58:40,144
Mariah Dillard, you're under arrest
for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

847
00:58:40,227 --> 00:58:41,854
I thought you said
you were going after Turk?

848
00:58:41,938 --> 00:58:43,565
[Misty] I've been tracking you
since you called.

849
00:58:43,648 --> 00:58:45,942
I wasn't going to let you
just ghost me again.

850
00:58:46,025 --> 00:58:49,654
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Shades, back off!

851
00:58:49,737 --> 00:58:52,532
Misty, stand down.
We're working this out.

852
00:58:52,615 --> 00:58:54,283
Oh, so you workin' with them now?

853
00:58:54,366 --> 00:58:57,078
-He knows where Diamondback is.
-I didn't say that.

854
00:58:57,161 --> 00:59:00,623
Well, whatever you know, Hernan,
you should share it with the whole class.

855
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:02,584
I ain't telling you shit.

856
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:06,671
Grenade!

857

[Mariah coughs]

860
00:59:21,769 --> 00:59:22,895
What the hell?

861
00:59:22,979 --> 00:59:24,897
What type of
Jean Paul Gaultier shit is this?

862
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:26,566
What are you, a pimp stormtrooper?

863
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:28,776
No, I'm the angel of death.

864
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,778
-You told him to meet us here?
-No.

865
00:59:30,862 --> 00:59:33,823
Damn!
Look at Hernan the cockroach.

866
00:59:33,906 --> 00:59:35,783
Your mama should have named you Pedro.

867

[Bobby] God damn it!

870
00:59:47,003 --> 00:59:50,214
I just fixed this place up
all perfect and shit!

871
00:59:50,297 --> 00:59:51,674
Y'all can't take this outside?

872
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:53,593
-No.
-No!

873
00:59:53,676 --> 00:59:55,511
All right, just... just sayin'.

874
00:59:56,303 --> 00:59:59,098
-Don't let Mariah get away.
-I won't.

875
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:01,017
Kick his ass, Luke.

876
01:00:04,186 --> 01:00:06,606
You know
I'm gonna kill 'em all later, right?

877
01:00:06,689 --> 01:00:09,108
You have to get past me first.

878
01:00:09,191 --> 01:00:11,527
Oh, I don't go past.

879
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:12,987
