Get him!

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,700
Quick! Let's leave now.

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Catch them.

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,500
Quick!

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,700
Don't move!

25
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
- Mom. <br>- Don't move.

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,600
Don't move!

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,000
Go over there.

28
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Catch him.

29
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,600
Don't chase after him anymore. Let him go.

30
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,400
Everything's fine.

31
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Kid, are you okay?

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,600
Are you okay?

33
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Fall back.

34
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,000
Be good. Don't be afraid.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
Let's go.

36
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
Brother!

37
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,800
Something bad has happened. Old Cai's wife and son have been captured by the police.

38
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,200
We have been targeted. Brother, leave now.

39
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,400
Leave Huzhou and hide for a while.

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,400
Ah Li.

41
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,500
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Nurse, did you see my brother?

43
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,800
Mr Jiang?

44
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,000
I just saw him leaving with two policemen.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
He was apprehended by the police?

46
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,600
It didn't seem so.

47
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,000
<i>Wu Mansion.</i>

48
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,600
Brother Shao Tian. Why didn't you go in since you are here?

49
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Cai Hong.

50
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,900
I would like to take you to a place.

51
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,400
It's so late. Where are you taking me?

52
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,400
There is something I need to tell you.

53
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,900
I'm afraid that if I don't tell you now, I won't find the opportunity again.

54
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,400
Are you leaving? Will you be in danger?

55
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,600
Brother Shao Tian. It's already very late and you brought me here...

56
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Do you have something to tell me?

57
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,590
Didn't you say that

58
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,700
when you encountered an unhappy event, you would come here?

59
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,100
Cai Hong.

60
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,000
Do you remember what I told you?

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,900
This

62
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,400
has magical powers.

63
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
If anything bad happens,

64
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,200
as long as I walk around this,

65
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,400
everything will go back to the way it was.

66
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,000
I would like everything to go back to the way it was.

67
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This way, we can start anew.

68
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,900
But I don't understand, Brother Shao Tian.

69
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,200
If you want to go back to the way it was,

70
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,400
which part should we go back to?

71
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,000
That's right. Where should we go back to?

72
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,200
For so many years, I have taken so many paths

73
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,400
and experienced so many matters.

74
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,000
If I hadn't missed that chance...

75
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,300
If everything could really restart,

76
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,800
I would go back to its original state.

77
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,400
Or back to the time when my father passed away.

78
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,200
Or also back to the first time when I joined Ling Long.

79
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,000
Or the first time my father took me to your home

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and the first time that I met you.

81
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,200
If my father didn't pass away that early,

82
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,100
I would never had gone to Ling Long. If I didn't go,

83
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,800
I would have never met you.

84
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,500
If I haven't met you...

85
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,200
Cai Hong,

86
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,400
Frankly, I know that

87
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,500
everything can't go back to the way it was.

88
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,400
But I don't have any regrets.

89
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,400
It's because I met you

90
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,200
when I took this path.

91
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,500
Knowing you was not a painful period for me.

92
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,400
It was a most beautiful thing.

93
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,000
Brother Shao Tian.

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,200
Can you tell me what has happened?

95
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,400
- I'm really worried about you. <br>- Cai Hong.

96
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,600
Remember what I said.

97
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Perhaps, I may not get the chance to say this to you again.

98
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,400
Do you know that being with you

99
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,200
was the most beautiful moments in my life. <br> I did not regret

Brother Shao Tian. You must be hiding something from me.

113
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,800
Don't tell me that compared to when you went to the battle ground,

114
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,400
it can't be worse than that, right?

115
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,800
I beg you,

116
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,430
can you not leave?

Even if I want to be with you forever,

131
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,780
it's time for me to take you home.

132
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,600
Cai Hong, I will take you home.

133
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,800
You haven't told me yet what happened.

134
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,600
Tomorrow.

135
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,600
I will tell you tomorrow.

136
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,400
Go back and have a good night's sleep now. When you get up tomorrow, you will know the answer.

137
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
Okay?

138
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,000
Tomorrow then?

139
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Tomorrow.

140
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
Brother Shao Tian, your hands are very cold.

141
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,200
I remember that your hands were very warm in the past.

142
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,500
You were always warming my hands.

143
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,100
I didn't think that today, it would be me doing this instead.

144
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,900
Cai Hong, thank you.

145
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:20,000
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

146
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,100
Don't move.

147
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,700
Zhou Shao Tian, come back with us to the police station.

148
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,600
Old Cai. You already admitted that you stole Ling Long's money.

149
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
I'm giving you one last chance now.

150
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
Do you have an accomplice or not?

151
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,600
I already told you that I did it alone. I didn't have any accomplice.

152
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,400
Fine.

153
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,200
Bring them in.

154
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Why are you here?

155
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,400
- Dear. <br>- Dad.

156
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,000
Son. Director Chen.

157
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
This doesn't concern my wife and son. Why did you bring them here?

158
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,800
Dear, we almost didn't see you again.

159
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,400
Do you know that a lot of scary events happened last night?

160
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Take them away first.

161
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,800
Dear! Son!

162
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,200
- I'm scared, Dad. <br>-Sit down.

163
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,600
Old Cai.

164
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,400
Your wife and son were in the hands of the bad guys.

165
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,000
We rescued them.

166
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,200
I can guarantee their safety now.

167
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,400
Old Cai.

168
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,800
You stole Ling Long's money. This is not a small crime.

169
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Do you want to spend your entire life in jail?

170
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,000
Why don't you think for yourself and your wife and son too?

171
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,400
I really want to help you.

172
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,200
If you are willing to cooperate, I will personally ask the court to help you.

173
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,300
But first,

174
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,000
you must tell the truth.

175
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,600
It was Zhou Shao Tian.

176
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,200
<i>Zhou Shao Tian forced me to do everything.</i>

177
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,000
<i>If you are sure, lay your bets now.</i>

178
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
<i>It was </i>

179
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,200
<i>Zhao Shao Tian that set the trap for me.</i>

180
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,600
<i>He lured me to gamble and I subsequently went into debts.</i>

181
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,600
<i>I couldn't pay my debts and he forced me to work with him</i>

182
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,000
<i>to establish a fake company.</i>

183
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,200
<i>We then used a fake document and forged Old Master Wu's signature.</i>

184
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,400
<i>All of Ling Long's money was transferred to the fake company.</i>

185
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,200
<i>Zhou Shao Tian forced me to do all this. </i>

186
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,000
<i>He slowly planned all this and forced me to take action.</i>

187
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,400
He later controlled my family

188
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,200
and pushed everything on me to take the fall alone.

189
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,000
Director Chen. You must believe me, please.

190
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,300
Let him sign the statement.

191
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,000
Mr Zhou.

192
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,800
Sit.

193
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,200
Mr Zhou.

194
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,200
I asked you here in the hopes that you will cooperate.

195
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,000
We would like to ask you some questions.

196
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,200
I hope you can reply truthfully.

197
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,700
Old Cai has been caught by us.

198
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,000
Furthermore, he has implicated you.

199
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,600
Do you have anything to say before we start?

200
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Jiang Yu. You are really a schemer.

201
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,000
You already can't wait to give me the final verdict.

202
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Zhou Shao Tian. I know that you took Ling Long's money.

203
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,600
Did you kill Wu Hong Da too?

204
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,000
Why did you give me the name of a murderer so quickly?

205
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,200
Whose idea is this?

206
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,400
You only need to answer me by saying yes or no.

207
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,000
It's not that simple as saying yes or no.

208
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yes or no.

209
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,800
In your eyes,

210
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,000
you already believed Jiang Yu and find me guilty.

211
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,100
Cai Hong, answer me.

212
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
Don't waste your time. Old Cai has already confessed.

213
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,000
Do you still have anything to defend yourself?

214
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,600
The police charged those who are guilty based on evidence.

215
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,500
Since you are sure that I killed him, show me your proof then.

216
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,600
Fine. Take him away.

217
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,800
Since he knows that we are here,

218
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,600
by answering him,

219
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,360
is that really that hard to do?

220
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,700
Get in the rickshaw. I will take you home.

221
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,600
No need. I would like to walk alone.

222
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,970
Go back first.

223
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,700
Miss. Old Cai has already confessed and implicated Zhou Shao Tian.

224
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,600
Zhou Shao Tian has now been taken away by the police for investigation.

225
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,200
Did Zhou Shao Tian confess?

226
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,800
No. I heard that he was overbearing, refusing to say anything.

227
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,600
Should we go and save Zhou Shao Tian?

228
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,800
Not yet. Go with me to the cell to see him first.

229
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,110
Miss. What you mean is that...

230
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,000
When Wu Hong Da died that day, he met with three people..

231
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,800
Zhou Shao Tian, Jiang Yu and Old Cai.

232
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,800
I forced Jiang Yu before. He definitely doesn't have the secret formula.

233
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,500
I want to use this opportunity to ask Zhou Shao Tian.

234
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,790
If he does not have the secret formula,

235
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,640
he is abandoned.

236
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,800
I will concentrate on going against him then.

237
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,100
You are really wise. I will go and make the preparations.

238
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,800
<i>Frankly, I know that everything can't go back to the way it was.</i>

239
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,400
<i>But I don't have any regrets.</i>

240
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,600
<i>It's because I met you when I took this path.</i>

241
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,200
<i>Knowing you was not a painful period for me.</i>

242
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,800
<i>It was a most beautiful thing.</i>

243
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,400
<i>Cai Hong, I love you.</i>

244
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,400
<i>I really love you very much. Don't be afraid.</i>

245
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,800
<i>Everything will be in the past.</i>

246
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,600
<i>Everything else will disappear.</i>

247
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,000
<i>Even though I want to be with your forever,</i>

248
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
<i>it's time for me to take you home.</i>

249
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,200
<i>What Brother Shao Tian told me is definitely not false.</i>

250
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,000
<i>I don't believe that he killed my father.</i>

251
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,700
<i>I'm going to ask him again.</i>

252
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,000
I really don't have anything to say to you.

253
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,600
Go home.

254
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,400
You are not telling me anything.

255
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,000
Is it because you have nothing to say

256
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,300
and no evidence?

257
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,900
Brother Shao Tian.

258
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,900
Are you really not going to explain

259
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,600
or apologise?

260
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,440
You don't even want to say this to me?

261
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,200
Last night,

262
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,600
I remember that you told me

263
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,700
that you love me.

264
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,600
You would protect me.

265
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,800
Why did you take Ling Long's money then?

266
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,200
Why did you harm my father?

267
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,300
My knowing you is just like a dream.

268
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,000
I have woken up from my dream.

269
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,100
It's time to face reality.

270
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,600
I won't believe it.

271
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,200
It wasn't a dream.

272
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,700
I want to hear you say it.

273
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Did you cause my father to die?

274
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,700
Is it that difficult to tell me the truth?

275
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,400
Please show Miss Wu out.

276
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,800
Miss Wu. Let's go.

277
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,000
Leave this to the police.

278
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,500
Shao Tian.

279
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,400
You did so much for Cai Hong

280
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,100
and what did you get?

281
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,200
You did so much for her and she doesn't even see you.

282
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,800
She only hates you

283
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
for stealing Ling Long's money and killing her father.

284
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,500
Miss Lu, in the end, I will find out what you are doing.

285
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,600
We are considered friends.

286
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,800
You are already in this state.

287
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,000
I wanted to come here and see if there is anything I could help you with.

288
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,600
I can also do my part as a friend.

289
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,700
When did you become someone that would miss a friend?

290
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,800
Even more so when we are not friends at all.

291
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,900
Just come and get what you want.

292
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,600
You have never trusted me.

293
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,100
You are really a direct person.

294
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,600
Fine, I like direct people too.

295
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,200
We won't waste any efforts this way.

296
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,600
I will get to the point.

297
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,200
- Do you have the secret formula or not? <br>- I already told you many times

298
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,800
that I don't have it.

299
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,400
It looks like you will never trust me.

300
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,800
Don't you get it?

301
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,800
The reason they forced you to confess is to make you die.

302
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,600
I'm asking you because I want to save you.

303
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,200
If you have the secret formula, you can tell me.

304
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
I can plead to the Military Governor

305
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,600
and tell him to put in a few good words for you and get you out of jail.

306
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,800
Wu Cai Hong will never believe you.

307
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,100
I'm the only one in this world who can help you.

308
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,800
If you give me the secret formula,

309
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
I can get you out.

310
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,800
I can let you get far away from here.

311
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,000
What I already told you,

312
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,640
I won't repeat it again.

313
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
Fine.

314
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,200
This is your last chance.

315
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,600
Since you have such an attitude, I can't help you then.

316
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,200
Have you really thought it through?

317
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,000
I never thought of

318
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,500
letting you help me.

319
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,300
Fine. Since you don't need my help,

320
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,500
don't blame me for not being righteous.

321
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,600
We already have a witness now.

322
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,200
Why doesn't he defend himself?

323
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Did he really take Ling Long's money?

324
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,900
Sister. I can understand how you feel.

325
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,800
Shao Tian is just like an older brother in our family.

326
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,100
Frankly speaking, I find it hard to accept it too.

327
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,200
Old Cai, Zhou Shao Tian.

328
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,600
The reason I asked both of you here is because this is our first confrontation.

329
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,400
I have already recorded what you said.

330
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,200
It will be used in the court in future.

331
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,800
Director Chen, I understand. I will answer all your questions truthfully.

332
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,200
Okay, Old Cai.

333
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,400
You said that you collaborated with Zhou Shao Tian to steal Ling Long's money.

334
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,600
It was RMB$1 million.

335
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,000
Zhou Shao Tian. Do you have anything to say?

336
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,000
Not answering, right?

337
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,400
I am telling you,

338
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,800
this sum of money is the same as what Ling Long's account showed.

339
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,300
Old Cai. How did you split the money?

340
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,800
Thirty and seventy percent.

341
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,200
I took thirty percent and Zhou Shao Tian took seventy.

342
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,000
Is Old Cai telling the truth?

343
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Both of you took such a big sum of money. What did you do with it?

344
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,400
I used it to settle my debts. I owed a lot of it.

345
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,500
I know that you are telling the truth.

346
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,900
We went to investigate your debtors. They admitted to it.

347
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,600
Zhou Shao Tian. What about you?

348
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,900
What did you do with such a big sum of money?

349
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
If you don't talk, we have no choice then.

350
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,100
Invite Miss Lu Man here. You must be polite.

351
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,700
Miss. These are Rong Da's new products.

352
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,800
Compared to the textiles used with the Jiang family's secret formula,

353
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,800
these don't deserve to be looked at.

354
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Uncle Lai.

355
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,100
Looks like the secret formula is with Old Cai.

356
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,800
Regardless of which methods you use,

357
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,000
you must bring Old Cai here.

358
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,200
Miss. I have an informant in the police station.

359
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,570
This is not a difficult task.

360
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,400
It only depends on when there is a suitable time to do it.

361
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,400
Wait for Director Chen to get the evidence first

362
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,100
and find Zhou Shao Tian guilty,

363
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,600
we will do it then.

364
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,200
Miss Lu. There are two policemen outside.

365
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,600
They would like you to go to the police station for a while.

366
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,800
It seems to be connected to Zhou Shao Tian.

367
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:02,030
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

368
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,500
Director Chen. Shouldn't we do this in the interrogation room?

369
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,200
Miss Lu's identity is different. It's more comfortable to do it here in my office.

370
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,600
We would also like to thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to cooperate with us.

371
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,080
It's fine.

372
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Director Chen, didn't you say that Zhao Shao Tian could have to pay with his life?

373
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
I only just established a factory with him.

374
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,200
I won't be involved right?

375
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,800
Miss Lu, don't be afraid.

376
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,400
We, police won't accuse the good people.

377
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,400
We are only worried about whether he asked you to do things which you shouldn't have been doing.

378
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,200
How could this be possible? But talking about this,

379
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,400
I don't know what I should do or not do.

380
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,600
There wasn't anything suspicious?

381
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,700
Frankly, ever since Zhou Shao Tiao showed up,

382
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,000
I have been hesitating about something.

383
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I wonder whether I should tell the police.

384
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,100
Please speak.

385
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,000
Frankly, Zhou Shao Tian is the real owner of Rong Da.

386
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,400
He funded the company. He only used my name for the company.

387
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,800
I didn't imagine that Zhou Shao Tian was the real owner of Rong Da.

388
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,600
Yes. At that time, he told me that I didn't have to come up with any money or efforts.

389
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,800
He just borrowed my name to start the factory.

390
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,200
He also shared 40% of the profit with me.

391
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,100
I am thinking, it was such a good offer. <br>In a moment of foolishness, I did not think too much that

392
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,300
about something bad happening to him.

393
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,200
The more I thought about it, it didn't sound right. Could there be such a good thing on earth?

394
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,600
Did he tell you where he got the money from?

395
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,300
He really didn't tell me anything about this.

396
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,100
It's just that...

397
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,000
I did ask him.

398
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,200
I told him that since he has such a big sum of money, why didn't he take the post of the boss

399
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
instead of being the subordinate?

400
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,200
He told me that this money can't be made known.

401
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,900
He's was using me to launder it.

402
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:06,000
Miss Lu. Other than this, do you have anything else to tell me?

403
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,600
Let me think.

404
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,600
There is something else which seemed very strange.

405
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,900
Not long ago, he asked me for help.

406
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,800
He wanted me to help him order a Parker pen.

407
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,400
At that time, I didn't think it was a big deal and helped him with the favour.

408
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,800
I looked for General Lu's people and helped him make a pen.

409
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
<i>Cai Hong. In the past, you told me that</i>

410
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,000
<i>you wanted to buy this fountain pen as your father's birthday present.</i>

411
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,600
<i>But because you fought over this with someone, you didn't manage to buy it.</i>

412
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,700
<i>I wanted you to be happy. I ordered the exact same fountain pen for you.</i>

413
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,600
<i>If this fountain pen has harmed anyone,</i>

414
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,500
<i>its tip wouldn't be like this.</i>

415
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,000
You were to the one who got the fountain pen for Zhou Shao Tian?

416
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,100
Yes. This was not so long ago.

417
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,060
It was just a month ago.

418
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,200
At that time, he needed it very urgently.

419
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,000
Why do you find it strange then?

420
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,100
At that time, I didn't think much about it. Could something had happened to him then?

421
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,800
I later asked him why he needed that fountain pen.

422
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Furthermore, he wanted it that urgently. He said that he wanted to use it as gratitude.

423
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,200
As gratitude to help him avoid a murder case.

424
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,600
I thought he was joking with me then.

425
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,900
Who knew that he would be caught?

426
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,800
Record all this.

427
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,000
Miss Lu.

428
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
We are almost done with the questions.Thank you.

429
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,600
Don't mention it. I only just told you what I know

430
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,100
in order not to get involved.

431
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,000
Let me get someone to take you back.

432
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,600
No need. My subordinate is waiting for me outside

433
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Okay then.

434
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,400
- Please. <br>- Bye.

435
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,400
Miss. Did everything go smoothly?

436
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,400
Yes. It went too smoothly.

437
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,400
It actually made me feel nostalgic.

438
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,000
Zhou Shao Tian. What a pity.

439
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,800
Miss. What you meant is...

440
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,600
Uncle Lai.

441
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,000
Bring that contract for Rong Da that I signed with Zhou Shao Tian

442
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,600
and hand it to Director Chen.

443
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,400
Also, go visit General Huang and tell him about the fountain pen.

444
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,100
Let him use it as an evidence.

445
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,800
Yes. This way, not only will we close Wu Hong Da's case,

446
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,300
we will also push Zhou Shao Tian into a dead end.

447
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,400
Don't blame me for being cruel.

448
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,100
If he must blame anyone, he should blame himself for choosing the wrong woman.

449
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,200
He choose the wrong path.

450
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,800
Regarding Old Cai, make the arrangements quickly.

451
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,700
Okay.

452
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,000
This is Old Cai's statement.

453
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,600
This is Lu Man's statement.

454
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,000
Warlord Lu's counselor Huang's statement.

455
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,800
The telegram sent by the overseas manufacturer of the Parker fountain pen.

456
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,900
And also, the Rong Da's contract that you signed with Miss Lu Man.

457
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,400
We will follow the law and hand over this evidence to the court.

458
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,700
If there is anything else you want to say, you can do it now.

459
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,600
But you can choose not to talk and hire a lawyer.

460
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,100
- You can talk again in court. <br>- I will give up the rights to a lawyer.

461
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,700
Zhou Shao Tian. I have known you for a short while.

462
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,200
You are a smart person. All the evidence is here.

463
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,100
I think you should know what your end result is.

464
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
I know.

465
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,400
Headline! Headline! <br> Soon they will get to the bottom of Wu Hong Da's murder.

466
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,700
Tomorrow's the trial for the suspected murderer.

467
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,800
Since there was still a ledger that wasn't burnt,

468
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,800
before finishing with this exquisite book,

469
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,200
they were not able to drain the warehouse.

470
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,800
Thus, it was not burnt by Zhou Shao Tian.

471
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,600
It was only discovered yesterday.

472
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,220
There should be proof in here that showed Zhou Shao Tian made use of Ling Long's money.

473
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,000
See if it's of any help to you.

474
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,400
It will definitely be useful.

475
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Thanks.

476
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,400
It's getting late. I still need to prepare for court.

477
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,600
See you in court.

478
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,400
I won't be going today. If you have any other matters, you can look for me again.

479
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,800
You are not going? I thought you would definitely go.

480
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,600
That's regarding the Wu family. It doesn't concern us. Why would I go there?

481
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
But you have been very helpful.

482
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,800
That's because Zhou Shao Tian made everyone a suspect.

483
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,400
I was aggressive because I was only protecting myself.

484
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,800
Protecting yourself?

485
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Yes.

486
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,100
Okay, it's self protection then.

487
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,200
Wu Cai Hong needs someone by her side now.

488
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,850
I'm afraid that she won't be able to handle the end result.

489
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,400
It's okay. She has her family with her.

490
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,400
Furthermore, she needs to learn how to be independent.

491
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,790
Let her get used to it.

492
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,900
Mr Jiang. On your exterior, you seem very cold

493
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,900
but actually, you are a warm hearted person.

494
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,100
You could even see that I'm warm hearted?

495
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Perhaps so.

496
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,400
Okay, I will be here today.

497
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,200
If there is any other matters, you can always look for me.

498
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,000
I'm leaving first then.

499
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,800
According to witness testimony provided by the police, today

500
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,000
is the court case of Zhao Shao Tian. The public trial.

501
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,100
It begins now.

502
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,800
According to the testimony of the former Finance Manager at Ling Long and Old Cai,

503
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,600
as Wu Hong Da's secretary, you schemed with Old Cai

504
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,200
to use his position to take illegal funds

505
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,800
and embezzle RMB$10 million.

506
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,300
About this allegation, do you have what it takes to refute it?

507
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,600
According to the testimony of Rong Da's Boss Lu Man,

508
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,800
you transferred the money from Ling Long to her to found Rong Da.

509
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,400
Actually, you are the real owner of Rong Da.

510
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,000
Do you have any objections to these allegations?

511
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,700
Zhou Shao Tian. Based on the overseas telegram from the manufacturer of the Parker pen,

512
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,400
you bought a fountain pen.

513
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,400
After the confirmed death of Wu Hong Da, his wound was examined.

514
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,080
According to Lu Man and Jiang Yu's testimony,

515
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:23,600
you got the very same pen handed over by Huang Junsheng.

516
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,200
Those two statements seal our presumptions.

517
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,600
You bought the fountain pen first to cause the death of Wu Hong Da.

518
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,000
Afterwards you were helped by Huang Junsheng.

519
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,800
The motive was to cover up the evidence of the Parker pen being used as an accessory for murder.

520
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,300
It was to cover up the truth for killing Wu Hong Da.

521
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,200
Do you need to defend your against this?

522
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,000
<i>Why isn't he saying anything?</i>

523
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,700
<i>He's been asked several times. Why doesn't he speak? </i>

524
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,240
Shao Tian. Say something, quick.

525
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,400
Based on the evidence, the court confirmed that

526
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,400
he joined forces with Zhou Shao, Lin Long's former chief financial officer,

527
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,600
and embezzled Ling Long of RMB$10 million.

528
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,800
After being unmasked, Zhou Shao Tian went to Wu Hong Da and had a bitter dispute.

529
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,000
During the dispute, Zhou Shao Tian stabbed Wu Hong Da with a pen.

530
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
He committed murder to silence him.

531
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
What do you say about this presumption,

532
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Zhou Shao Tian.

533
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,300
Do you have anything to say to defend yourself?
