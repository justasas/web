00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,550
<i>Episode 25</i>

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,080
Why must you keep harming us?

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,610
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,460
- Sorry.
- What's the use of apologising?

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,990
How is my brother?

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,930
The injuries are only superficial wounds.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,490
Those people were set on harming him but not critically.

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,220
So to say, even though he has many wounds his life is not in danger.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,310
He is already conscious. You can go in to see him but there shouldn't be too many visitors.

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,250
Doctor. I would like to know more about the injuries.

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,990
Fine. Come with me to my office.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,010
What are you doing? Do you still have the face to see my brother?

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,770
- Fei Fei.
- How is your injury?

15
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,010
I'm fine.

16
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,070
Does it hurt very much?

17
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,530
I'm fine.

18
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,610
How could they beat you into such a state?

19
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,920
Didn't they do this because of the secret formula?

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,980
It's because of the secret formula again.

21
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,320
Sorry, Brother. It's all my fault.

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,880
If I didn't take away the secret formula,

23
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,450
I wouldn't have caused you to be jailed.

24
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,510
This wouldn't have happened.

25
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,070
Sorry.

26
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,850
Fei Fei.

27
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,820
Don't blame yourself.

28
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,420
This is not your fault.

29
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,490
Listen to me. Everything was

30
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,910
planned by me.

31
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,970
What did you just say?

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,450
It started from the first day when they approached me for the silk contest.

33
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,000
I already knew what their motive was.

34
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,970
I made use of you to hand over the secret formula to them.

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,870
Sorry.

36
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,570
I used and tricked you.

37
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,940
That secret formula is fake.

38
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,970
Fei Fei. All these years, I know that you have been good to me.

39
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,540
Everything that you have done for my family,

40
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,800
I can see very clearly.

41
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,950
I remember it all.

42
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,460
I'm very thankful that during our most difficult times,

43
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,010
you have always been with us.

44
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,220
You will always be my sister.

45
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,020
I will always be your brother.

46
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,630
We will forever

47
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,160
be a family.

48
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,420
Fei Fei.

49
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,090
Do something for me.

50
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,980
Tell Wu Cai Hong to come in here.

51
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,090
Why do you still want to see her?

52
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,590
Be good.

53
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,510
Go now.

54
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,000
How is Jiang Yu? Is he okay?

55
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,010
Go in. He wants to see you.

56
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:13,900
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

57
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,510
Sorry.

58
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,940
It's my fault.

59
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,990
You didn't kill my father.

60
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,070
What I can do for my father now

61
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,360
is to apologise.

62
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,130
And also for what I did in the past,

63
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,990
I would like to apologise to you.

64
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,610
You don't need to apologise to me.

65
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,960
I don't care about what you did. Also regarding your father,

66
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,330
I went to see him on the day he died.

67
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:12,700
When he found out about my identity, he kneeled down in front of me

68
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,010
to seek my forgiveness.

69
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,340
My father

70
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,020
really did that?

71
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,480
Did you forgive him then?

72
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,070
I'm not that magnanimous.

73
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,990
Even if your father knelt down in front of me forever, I wouldn't have been able to bring back my father.

74
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,820
But...

75
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,700
I didn't kill your father.

76
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:58,390
Today I have set myself as bait in this game.

77
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,930
The motive was to find our father's killer.

78
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:08,210
Regarding your father's death, I owe you an explanation.

79
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,710
I don't understand.

80
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,380
What is the meaning behind setting yourself as bait?

81
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,870
The truth about your father's death will be revealed soon.

82
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,930
When that day comes,

83
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,980
we will clear our debts and will be even.

84
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,710
Enough.

85
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,450
I have already said what I needed to say.

86
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,140
You can leave now.

87
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,870
Brother. What did you tell her?

88
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,710
Brother. Isn't this bitter for you?

89
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,030
Ever since Wu Hong Da harmed your father,

90
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,930
the fate was already decided between the both of you.

91
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,660
You and Wu Cai Hong

92
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,330
are like a bird in the sky and a fish in the water.

93
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,860
You will never be together.

94
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,990
Mr Jiang. I would like to talk to you.

95
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,300
Why is Mr Zhou so anxious to find me? What's the matter?

96
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,060
I don't know either. See for yourself and you will know.

97
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,990
I'm leaving.

98
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,260
Old Cai. I waited for you for a long time.

99
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,130
Come with me.

100
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,320
This is not a kind request. Lao Cai, you are the prime suspect in Wu Hong Da's case.

101
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,630
This is a warrant.

102
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,320
I would advise you not to rebel. Junior Superintendent.

103
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,970
Take him away.

104
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,160
Uncle Lai. Miss wanted us to follow Ma Li.

105
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,170
Ma Li may have stolen it. <i>secret recipe</i>

106
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,010
But now, the police are one step ahead of us.

107
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,880
How are we going to explain this to her when we get back?

108
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,390
How to explain it to her?

109
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:47,060
We can only tell her the truth. If not, why don't we snatch him from the police?

110
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:56,620
Based on my plan, I finally forced Old Cai to come out from hiding.

111
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,470
I say, Jiang Yu. Don't blame me for being angry with you.

112
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,820
Why didn't you tell me about this first before you took actions?

113
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,890
You're actions are desperate.

114
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,280
If anything should happen to you under the hands of my staff,

115
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,830
how could I make amends to you and what should I tell your family?

116
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,610
If I told you about my plan in advance, how would I be able to play the game?

117
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,960
If I didn't allow them to beat me half to death,

118
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,310
how would they have believed that the secret formula is not with me but with Old Cai instead?

119
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,370
Enough, buddy.

120
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,170
In any case, you risked your life for this.

121
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,520
No matter what, in the future, you must discuss it with me in advance.

122
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,830
Fine. Have some tea to cool down our temper.

123
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,430
Don't be like this.

124
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,460
If everything is going well and Old Cai has been captured,

125
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,740
we should be able to close the Wu Hong Da's case soon.

126
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,290
Don't worry. This afternoon, Director Chen will personally apprehend Old Cai.

127
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,720
I believe that this case can be closed soon.

128
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,010
Didn't you instruct these people to torment Jiang Yu? Did you do it?

129
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,750
Yes, I did it.

130
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,310
You answered very cleanly.

131
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,940
Do you know that by doing this, it's a crime?

132
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,600
When did you become so ruthless?

133
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,750
Cai Hong.

134
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,460
I don't believe that Jiang Yu is not the killer of your father.

135
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,040
I also don't believe that he didn't take the secret formula from your father.

136
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,540
I did this to force him to show his true colours so that you would know sooner.

137
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,770
You are talking too lightly about this.

138
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,140
You let those men beat Jiang Yu into that state.

139
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,770
Did you force the truth from him?

140
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,650
Cai Hong. I know that, in your heart,

141
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,530
you chose to believe Jiang Yu.

142
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,060
Thus, no matter what I do, you won't believe me.

143
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,300
I'm only stating facts.

144
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,100
Even if he really is a suspect,

145
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,650
he should be questioned by the police again first.

146
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,760
I would never use such a ruthless method.

147
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,480
Cai Hong, you are not stating facts.

148
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,060
You like him.

149
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,090
Do still remember that day

150
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,830
I heard you say those words

151
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,800
that you wanted to go back to the ways things were with your heart before.

152
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,100
You only had eyes for me. Trust me.

153
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:24,770
Don't forget that your father forced Jiang Yu's family to become bankrupt?

154
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:31,060
The feud between your both families gave him the motive to kill your father.

155
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,630
You are as far away from each other as heaven and earth.

156
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,980
Cai Hong, the more you tend to his heart, the more hurt you will be.

157
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,380
I don't want you to get hurt.

158
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,970
I want to protect you.

159
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,980
By doing this now,

160
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,990
you are only distancing yourself from me.

161
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,100
Second... Second Miss.

162
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,700
You are here.

163
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,520
I...

164
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,060
Are you here to see Brother Shao Tian?

165
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,200
Mom.

166
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,050
What's wrong with Xiao Bao? Is he asleep?

167
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,220
Hello, Madam Wu.

168
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,880
What are you doing here?

169
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,980
I heard that Brother Shao Tian came here to look for Miss Wu. I need to find him regarding some urgent matters.

170
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,070
Cai Hong, go and call Shao Tian.

171
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,050
Wait.

172
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,930
I will go and call him.

173
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,050
Go back to your room.

174
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,060
Look after Xiao Bai for me.

175
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,020
Are you cooking porridge for Jiang Yu?

176
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,850
Yes. Look at what you have done to him. I want to apologise on your behalf.

177
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,010
I don't want you to go.

178
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,970
Did you forget about the grudge between the two companies?

179
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,400
I remember Jiang Yu telling me this.

180
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,080
Hate does not necessarily end in hate.

181
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,090
Even in a dirty pond, a clean and pure flower could grow in it.

182
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,150
You are too naive.

183
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,200
Even though, from mud flowers can grow, there are still thorns.

184
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,090
The years of sowing the seeds of hatred is many.

185
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:12,020
Flowers with thorns won't only just hurt you.

186
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,960
I can't change what happened previously

187
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:21,180
but now if I don't work hard to try, how could I know?

188
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,880
You can't change the consequences.

189
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,400
Shao Tian, Cai Hong. Whats' wrong?

190
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,820
Aunt, it's nothing. We are only having different views.

191
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,000
By the way, Ma Li is looking for you. He said it's important. He's waiting for you at the front door.

192
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,910
I'm going to see him first.

193
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,990
Thanks, Aunt.

194
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:01,080
Listen to my advice. Our Wu family is not that glorious life before.

195
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,960
You should change your temper. Frankly, Shao Tian is not bad.

196
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,900
He is good at business.

197
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,550
Catch hold of this opportunity and your happiness. Understand?

198
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,670
I feel that we are not compatible.

199
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:19,500
Sometimes, I feel that he treats me too well.

200
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,710
The more he does this, I have more of a guilty conscious.

201
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,680
There are certain things that I can't express.

202
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,370
You only see yourself. Always such a stubborn temper.

203
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,540
Frankly, between men and women, it's that complicated.

204
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,030
It's simple. Take advantage of his youth and good looks.

205
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,290
Get married, have children and live a good life.

206
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,510
Isn't it that simple?

207
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,070
Frankly, men who have good qualifications

208
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,340
are slightly bad tempered.

209
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,360
But I can tell that Zhou Shao Tian is not really bad. He treats you well.

210
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,490
Don't spoil this opportunity and think about it first.

211
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,370
- Ma Li.
- Brother.

212
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,160
What happened? Why did you come all the way here to find me?

213
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,920
Old Cai has been caught by the police.

214
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,980
Those little bastards are not capable of anything!

215
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,070
Come in.

216
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,030
- Are you being discharged?
- What are you doing here?

217
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,480
I personally cooked this porridge.

218
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,870
I don't know if it suits your taste. Would you like to try it?

219
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,110
You are no longer our servant.

220
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,890
You don't need to do this.

221
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,370
I would like to this

222
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,100
to make amends for our past.

223
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,130
Didn't I already tell you very clearly?

224
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,120
You don't need to apologise again.

225
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,200
You don't even need to apologise to me because of your father.

226
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,770
But it's good that you are here.

227
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:19,430
I promised myself that I owe you an explanation regarding your father's death.

228
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,490
Come with me.

229
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,620
Where are we going?

230
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,960
To a show.

231
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,460
You can say that it's show because you'll regret if you don't watch it.

232
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,990
Old Cai. It really wasn't easy to find you.

233
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,280
We have been watching you for a long time.

234
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,990
Do you know why?

235
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,940
Director Chen. The police were looking for me?

236
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,390
Old Cai. You are a smart man.

237
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,460
I won't beat around the bush.

238
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,520
When you first stole Ling Long's money, you were discovered by Wu Hong Da.

239
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,740
You then killed him. Isn't that so?

240
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,800
Director Chen, this is arbitrary and

241
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,950
I didn't kill Old Master Wu or steal his money. How could there be such a misunderstanding?

242
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,120
Misunderstanding?

243
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,730
When Wu Hong Da died, you went missing.

244
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,970
Is this a misunderstanding?

245
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:28,720
Director Chen. The police should have evidence.

246
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,500
You can't say that just because I went missing,

247
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,530
I killed Old Master Wu and even stole his money. This is a major crime.

248
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,720
Don't talk about killing someone. I wouldn't even dare kill a chicken.

249
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,710
Old Cai, cut the crap.

250
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:50,410
After Wu Hong Da died, where did you go? Speak.

251
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,130
It's like this.

252
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,460
Before Old Master Wu's incident,

253
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,710
he had to borrow money to a company named Dachang Trading Company.

254
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,470
Subsequently, there was a problem with the company and he couldn't get back the money.

255
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,400
I was making good earnings at Ling Long just at this same time.

256
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,950
I was afraid that I couldn't explain. Thus, I left.

257
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,050
Based on what you said, you cleared all your responsibilities legally, right?

258
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,990
Yes. Wu Hong Da died.

259
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,070
Undoubtedly he deserved to die, right?

260
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,130
Chen Suo Chang, this matter affects me personally.

261
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,340
If there was anything wrong, as the main supervisor at Lin Ling,

262
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,960
I would have not risked my lord's health but called the police .

263
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,240
Do you think we will fall for your tricks?

264
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,260
- I...
- As police, what we say is based on evidence.

265
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,030
Did you think that we would arrest you without any evidence?

266
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,380
This is what we investigated.

267
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,940
These are the transcripts.

268
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,280
Dah Chong Hong is a very small company

269
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,510
What a coincidence.

270
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:21,760
It is registered under the name of one of your relatives.

271
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,320
You have been with Wu Hong Da for many years.

272
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,360
You should be familiar with his signature.

273
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,530
Can you tell me

274
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,580
whether this is Wu Hong Da's signature?

275
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,850
Or did you find someone to forge it?

276
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,680
This already happened a long time ago.

277
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,920
Someone must be intentionally trying to frame me.

278
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,650
Yes, Lin Long borrowed a lot of money from Da Chang trading company.

279
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,490
It lost a big amount.

280
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,100
And for me, as the treasurer, I had been only monitoring it.

281
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:59,680
Also, when Old Master Wu passed away, I didn't stay back to clarify matters.

282
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,810
As it was my fault, I could have not done it.

283
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,720
I knew you would say this.

284
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,410
The evidence that you stole Ling Long's money is all here.

285
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,300
Don't even try to deny it.

286
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,900
If you cooprate with us and give out your accomplices,

287
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,040
perhaps, we may give you a lighter sentence.

288
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,050
I already said what I should say. I didn't commit any crime. I didn't have an accomplice.

289
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,560
Fine then.

290
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,610
I will give you some time to think about this carefully.

291
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,910
Take him away.

292
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,040
Cai Hong.

293
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,050
You heard everything.

294
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,740
His confession was very smooth.

295
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,310
Does that prove he's telling the truth?

296
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,590
He had to think about things from long ago. Everything came back to him.

297
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,470
Then what will we do if he strenghtens his defense?

298
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,790
It's okay. I will get the witness here next time

299
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,290
I will do it directly

300
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,830
and see how he denies it.

301
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
My father wronged your father

302
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,170
and the Jiang family.

303
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:13,250
It was also disastrous from my father's end.

304
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,890
Old Cai has been with us for several years.

305
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:21,810
My father regarded his as his right hand man. I never thought he would embezzle so much money.

306
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,710
Old Cai has been arrested.

307
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,870
We will soon get to the bottom of things.

308
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,170
Everything will then return to its original state.

309
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,310
<i>Could everything return to its original state?</i>

310
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,970
<i>Can everything that has happened be forgotten?</i>

311
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,010
<i>Would you take it as it didn't happen?</i>

312
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,090
Shao Tian. You must save me.

313
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,260
I'm here to tell you that

314
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,330
now that we are at this stage, you should know what you can say and shouldn't say.

315
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,970
Shao Tian, don't worry. I won't say anything.

316
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,590
I have already cleaned up my tracks.

317
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,240
Cleaned up your tracks?

318
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,540
You are too naive.

319
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,440
Now that it has come to this stage, do you think you can still clean up your tracks?

320
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,340
I...

321
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,560
Why?

322
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,510
Think about it. Ling Long lost such a big sum of money.

323
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,110
Wu Hong Da is also dead.

324
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:02,830
There is only one theory regarding this.

325
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,600
At this point you should disappear

326
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,790
since all the evidence points to you.

327
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:14,950
If you don't get caught, it will be considered very lucky for you.

328
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,810
But you don't have a good fate.

329
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:22,210
You are the only one who can bear the consequences.

330
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:26,070
You... You are adding insult to injury.

331
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,070
Old Cai. Take this fall.

332
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,990
I guarantee your wife and child's safety and will take care of them for the rest of their lives.

333
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
If you drag me down along with you, you should know the consequences.

334
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,980
Why don't you think about your wife and child?

335
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,130
After the testimony,

336
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,090
take care of yourself.

337
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,620
Brother, you should have your lunch.

338
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,820
What is this?

339
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,980
Porridge. Pour it away for me.

340
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,330
Pour it away?

341
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,530
Don't you love to eat porridge?

342
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,960
It's already cold. Pour it away.

343
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,820
Did Wu Cai Hong bring this?

344
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,020
Just pour it away when I tell you to.

345
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,980
I think I will throw it away as it is.

346
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:09,570
♫<i> So long, I have waited for so long... </i>♫

347
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:15,960
♫<i> Waited for your love to bloom. </i>♫

348
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,290
♫<i> Desperately, I was desperately struggling to find... </i>♫

349
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:28,690
♫<i> Yet couldn't find the way to your heart. </i>♫

♫<i> In the end I did not get your heart. </i>♫

354
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,970
Go in.

355
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,190
Sit down.

356
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:12,360
Old Cai. We invited a few witnesses here today.

357
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,080
Director Chen. You didn't need to invite the witnesses here.

358
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:21,550
I was clueless in the past. I denied it. Now, I'm admitting my crime.

359
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,430
I stole Ling Long's money.

360
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,190
I used a relative's name to set up a fake company.

361
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:30,070
I then forged Old Master Wu's signature and transferred the money over.

362
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,670
Yesterday, if we were to beat you to death, you wouldn't admit it but you are suddenly confessing now?

363
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,780
Old Cai. What game are you playing?

364
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,880
I came to my senses after going through last night.

365
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,140
Since there are witnesses, I can't deny it anymore.

366
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,450
Why don't I confess instead?

367
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,490
Perhaps, based on my attitude,

368
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,370
you could give me a lighter sentence.

369
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,900
I get it.

370
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:59,130
You are taking the fall for your accomplice. That's why you are reversing your words.

371
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:03,460
I don't have an accomplice. I'm telling the truth.

372
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,330
Director Chen. I took Ling Long's money. Accept my confession.

373
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,130
Fine. Let's say that when you stole the money, Wu Hong Da discovered it

374
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,620
and you killed him to shut him up. Right?

375
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,690
I didn't.

376
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,390
- Director Chen, I swear that I didn't kill Old Master Wu.
- Cut the crap.

377
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,710
I will ask you again. Was there an accomplice?

378
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,640
I already made a mistake by taking Ling Long's money.

379
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,050
I wouldn't dare to kill anyone, even more so, Old Master Wu.

380
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,890
I will give you one last chance. Did you have an accomplice?

381
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,020
You must know that covering up a crime is a very serious offence.

382
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,920
I really didn't have any accomplice. It's already hard enough to protect myself now.

383
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,200
If I really had an accomplice, I would cooperate with you and lighten my sentence.

384
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,930
Fine. Get him to sign the statement.

385
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,710
Take him out.

386
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,320
Do you think that Old Cai was speaking the truth?

387
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,970
Part of it was.

388
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,220
At the least, he hid the most important fact.

389
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,010
That is another accomplice.

390
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,950
Why do you think so?

391
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,340
His attitude was a complete turn around from yesterday.

392
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,740
It's too suspicious.

393
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,140
I think this matter is not that simple.

394
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,070
We will continue to investigate this.

395
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,000
I think, perhaps, you are thinking too much.

396
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,070
We already know that Old Cai took the money on the day of my father's incident.

397
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,980
It's just that we couldn't catch him.

398
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,440
Perhaps, he has thought it over carefully now

399
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,970
and thinks that he can't deny it any further. That's why he confessed.

400
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,990
- Did anyone visit Old Cai yesterday?
- Zhou Shao Tian visited him yesterday

401
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,820
I heard that Zhou Shao Tian visited you yesterday.

402
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,740
Him?

403
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,530
He did come to visit me yesterday.

404
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:18,710
He visited you yesterday and you confessed today. Why?

405
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,080
No.

406
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:27,940
He is the Wu family's future son-in-law. He came here to seek justice for Ling Long.

407
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:34,430
Seek justice for Ling Long? Did he want you to take the fall alone?

408
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,140
This is what you said, not me.

409
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,880
What did he use to threaten you?

410
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:44,590
Have you heard the term "murder for money?"

411
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,830
Do you think it's that simple for you to take the fall for this?

412
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,630
The police can use this to decide that you killed Wu Hong Da.

413
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,170
Killing a person is a life sentence.

414
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,100
Think carefully about this.

415
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,210
I admit that I was involved in it

416
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,980
but I really didn't kill him.

417
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:09,760
Mr Jiang. You must believe me. Tell the police that I really didn't kill anyone.

418
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,580
You were only an accessory?

419
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,490
That's right.

420
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,540
Who is your accomplice then?

421
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,920
Was it Zhou Shao Tian?

422
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,270
Don't pressure me.

423
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:25,350
Mr Jiang. I admit that I stole Ling Long's money but I'm not guilty of murder.

424
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,470
But if I say something that I shouldn't say, my wife and child will die.

425
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,140
I'm doomed.

426
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,940
I'm doomed.

427
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:52,980
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

428
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,770
Mr Jiang.

429
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,020
Why are you looking for me?

430
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,350
I think Old Cai suddenly confessing is very strange.

431
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,700
Thus, I went to the detention centre to have a chat with him.

432
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,420
Did you find anything new?

433
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,900
I found out the truth.

434
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,650
He is not the main culprit of stealing Ling Long's money.

435
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,030
He was only an accessory.

436
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,730
Okay then. Give me time and I will interrogate Old Cai immediately.

437
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:25,840
There is no use interrogating him now. He won't say anything.

438
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,110
Because the main culprit already has his family under control.

439
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:32,520
He is being threatened.

440
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,960
If this is the case, let's save Old Cai's family first.

441
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,000
If not, he won't dare to tell the truth.

442
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,830
I was tortured in the detention centre.

443
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:49,080
This proves that there are informants in the police station.

444
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,850
This was indeed negligence on my part

445
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,700
to let you suffer.

446
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,690
Sorry.

447
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,360
These informants are great for us.

448
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,030
They can help us.

449
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,160
Let's do this.

450
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,970
I will leak out the news tonight that Old Cai is willing to cooperate.

451
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,720
The condition is that we will save his family.

452
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:25,220
I will make preparations for my men to go to Old Cai's home to save his family.

453
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:30,490
As soon as the mastermind behind this gets wind of it, he will try to get to Old Chai's family first. As long as we track those people,

454
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:34,580
we will then find the location of Old Cai's home.

455
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,870
But Huzhou is so big. Who should we tail?

456
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,010
Zhou Shao Tian.

457
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,290
- Miss.
- Why are you so flustered?

458
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,760
I received news that the police have gotten wind of where Old Cai's home is located.

459
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,060
They are going to save his family tonight.

460
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,010
Let's go.

461
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,210
The sky is going to fall soon. Mr Zhou, you still don't know?

462
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,150
What has happened?

463
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:18,750
My informant at the police station told me that...

464
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,560
What did he say?

465
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,100
Mr Zhou. Do you want to owe me another favour?

466
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,930
What I want,

467
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,090
- you already know, right?
- Yes.

468
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,400
The secret formula. Moreover, I already promised you that

469
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,910
as long as I obtained the secret formula, I would deliver to to you immediately.

470
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:41,510
Miss Lu. You can speak now.

471
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,690
Old Cai voluntarily told the police his address.

472
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,570
He promised the police that as long as they save his family,

473
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,470
he would cooperate.

474
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:57,560
They are going to save Old Cai's family tonight.

475
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,360
This Old Cai...

476
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,020
is crap.

477
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,230
Miss Lu. Tell me what we should do.

478
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,780
If the police were to save them,

479
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,320
what should we do?

480
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,380
Of course, they won't be able to. You are so smart.

481
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,190
Even more so,

482
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,500
I already told you the news.

483
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,020
Remember this favour that you owe me.

484
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,470
Follow Zhou Shao Tian's henchman and bring Old Cai's family here.

485
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,990
Miss. Why are you doing this?

486
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,170
Of course, it's because of the secret formula that Old Cai is holding.

487
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,110
Once we get his family,

488
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,510
we will have more pieces to bargain with, right?

489
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,970
But Zhou Shao Tian already promised that

490
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,670
he would deliver the secret formula to you once he has gotten it.

491
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:06,760
Whether it falls into his hands or your hands, isn't it the same?

492
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,480
Of course, it's not.

493
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,870
Save yourself first before others.

494
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,580
Go now.

495
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,660
It's here.

496
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:57,340
Keep watch over here.

497
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,520
You... Get the child and come with me.

498
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,930
Get the child and come with me!

499
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,000
Quick.

500
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,560
There is someone there. Stop them now.

501
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,030
Go after them. Quick.
