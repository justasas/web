The Cage of Love

19
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,910
<i>Episode 32</i>

20
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,720
Little Friend, why are you here crying alone?

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,980
- What's wrong? <br>- My favourite fish has left.

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,160
If you liked it why didn't you keep it with you?

23
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,680
Why did you release it?

24
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,410
Sister. I actually reared two fish.

25
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,720
But one died today.

26
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,960
I let the other fish go. I won't be able to see it again. I'm very sad.

27
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,100
But if that fish died, I would be even sadder.

28
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,340
Mom said that I must release that fish into the pond

29
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,030
and let it go free. The fish will be happy and it won't die.

30
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,090
Yes.

31
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,940
When you love someone, you should let that person go and be happy.

32
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,110
It's fine as long as he's happy.

33
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,090
Sister. You are sad too. Isn't that so?

34
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,350
Just like when I released that fish, I'm very sad too.

35
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,120
I will never see that fish again

36
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,980
but this is for the good of the fish. That's why I did this.

37
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,010
Thank you, baby. You are very smart.

38
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,940
I understand now.

39
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,320
<i>If Wu Cai Hong is brother's happiness,</i>

40
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,480
<i>then, as long as brother is happy,</i>

41
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,350
<i>I'm willing to pray that she will wake soon.</i>

42
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,340
<i>I'm willing to let go of my hatred and envy.</i>

43
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,010
<i>I'm willing to accept her.</i>

44
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,010
<i>Cai Hong!</i>

45
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,020
<i>Cai Hong!</i>

46
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,720
<i>Cai Hong!</i>

47
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,620
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

48
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,150
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

49
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,700
<i>I finally found you.</i>

50
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:12,030
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

51
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,070
Cai Hong. You must wake up.

52
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,470
Cai Yun, your stepmom and I

53
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,330
and also Jiang Yu,

54
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,310
we are all waiting for you.

55
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,280
Brother Shao Tian.

56
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,470
It has been hard for you to take care of my sister the whole night.

57
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,150
Let me take care of my sister during the day.

58
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,280
Go back and take a rest now.

59
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,030
Fine. I will leave your sister to you.

60
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,340
What are you still doing here?

61
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,470
- I want to see Cai Hong. <br>- Is there a need for you to?

62
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,030
- Let me see her. <br>- Haven't you harm her enough?

63
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,120
Jiang Yu. When Cai Hong followed you,

64
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,340
she suffered a lot and received many punishments.

65
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,560
Because of your father's tablet, she sacrificed her life for it.

66
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,280
I know about the grudge between both your families

67
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,040
but it was Wu Hong Da's fault. It has nothing to do with Cai Hong.

68
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,940
I know I was wrong.

69
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,990
I know that Cai Hong's stepmom and sister will listen to you.

70
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,090
I'm begging you.

71
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,110
Please tell them and let me see her.

72
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,970
Cai Yun. Come out first.

73
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,130
I'm letting you in

74
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,540
not because you want to see her.

75
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,620
It's because I know that

76
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,420
Cai Hong wants to see you.

77
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:20,500
♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

78
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:27,520
♫<i> In the end I did not get your heart. </i>♫

79
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,480
<i>He has a strikingly beautiful face, a Grecian nose, strong brows, and bright eyed </i>

80

<i>with an uncommon demeanor.</i>

81
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,450
<i>No matter how you look at him, he is smothering to look at, a handsome man.</i>

82

♫<i> I fight a bitter battle between advancing and retreating. </i>♫ <br>- Let me go. <br>- I won't.

83
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,080
♫<i> I didn't see through to </i>♫ <br>I'm not letting you go. What will you do?

91
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:33,300
♫<i> but I've already fallen in love with your tenderness. </i>♫

92
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,150
I'm here to see you.

93
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,070
Why are you so foolish?

94
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,070
I never even had the courage to face my feelings. I don't deserve you being so good to me.

95
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,240
Cai Hong. Do you know that I have many things to tell you?

96
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,730
You can listen carefully to me today.

97
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,420
Frankly, the first time I met you at the hospital,

98
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,320
I knew that I fell in love with you

99
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,050
but

100
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,080
you were the daughter of my enemy.

101
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,150
I later worked hard to tell myself that

102
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,010
I would forget that I like you.

103
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,010
I did many things to forget you.

104
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,940
To remind myself that I couldn't fall in love with you.

105
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,950
But when love happens, it happens.

106
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,770
No matter how I tried to escape,

107
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,910
no matter how I lied to myself,

108
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,100
love is just like wild grass.

109
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,890
Cai Hong, I told myself that

110
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,160
starting from now.

111
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,910
I won't escape again.

112
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,990
I want to be like you

113
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,030
and face it bravely.

114
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,030
Cai Hong.

115
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,040
You must give me the chance to pay you back.

116
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,940
You must give me the chance to dote on you.

117
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,010
You must wake up.

118
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:35,110
<i>Cai Hong. Jiang Yu sent you these flowers to wake you up.</i>

119
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,530
<i>Roses are the flower given to describe love. </i>

120
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,890
<i>That is really true.</i>

121
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,520
<i>The beautiful flower and its thorns</i>

122
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,640
<i>Love with injury.</i>

123
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,400
<i>I know you want to escape the despair,</i>

124
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,430
<i>that is why you escape into your dream</i>

125
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,540
<i>and don't want to wake up.</i>

126
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,540
<br>But Cai Hong,

127
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,520
<i>looking at how much pain you are in,</i>

128
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,930
<i>what should I do?</i>

129
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,010
Brother Shao Tian.

130
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,950
Cai Hong, you are awake.

131
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,020
The flowers are very beautiful.

132
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,370
I seem to have slept for a very long time.

133
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,990
I even dreamt that someone was calling me.

134
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,950
Was it you?

135
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,980
You really slept for a long time

136
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,600
but you finally woke up.

137
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,370
This is great.

138
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,330
Are these roses

139
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,550
from you?

140
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,890
Jiang Yu sent them.

141
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,710
Was he hurt?

142
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,700
How is he?

143
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,410
Jiang Yu is fine.

144
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,510
What about Madam Jiang?

145
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,010
Madam Jiang is fine too.

146
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,690
What about Old Master Jiang's tablet?

147
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,710
Old Master's tablet is fine.

148
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,030
The whole Jiang family is fine except you.

149
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,830
Why are you so foolish?

150
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,020
Now you are in this situation.

151
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,250
Brother Shao Tian. Can you tell Madam Jiang

152
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,600
and also Jiang Yu that I have woken up?

153
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,990
Tell them not to worry about me.

154
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,310
I will have to visit them at the Jiang house then.

155
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,570
What did you say?

156
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,500
Nothing.

157
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,020
Cai Hong. It's definitely good news that you are awake.

158
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,030
I'm going to call the doctor to check on you now.

159
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,560
I'm here to tell you that

160
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,470
Cai Hong has regained her consciousness.

161
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,060
Jiang Yu.

162
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,240
I hope that you have thought it over carefully

163
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,700
and thought about your family's problems again before you see her.

164
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,630
I don't want to see her hurt again

165
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,770
because of you.

166
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,070
What Cai Hong did,

167
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,680
Mom was very touched.

168
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,210
It's just that the past has hurt her a lot.

169
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,930
Thus, she still can't accept her.

170
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,950
I understand.

171
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,680
Brother, after all this, do you still intend to contin to suppress your feelings?

172
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,460
Each of you are both in pain.

173
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,760
Don't misunderstand.

174
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,710
I'm not persuading you to give up this time.

175
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:02,080
I only wanted to tell you that if you think Cai Hong is your happiness,

176
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,530
you should go after your happiness.

177
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,910
I'm willing to accept her as my sister-in-law.

178
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,390
Fei Fei.

179
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,060
Thank you for being able to accept Cai Hong.

180
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,010
Is my acceptance that important to you?

181
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,900
Of course, it's important.

182
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,290
You are my sister.

183
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,960
Your acceptance is not only important to me,

184
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,100
it is very important to Cai Hong also.

185
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,150
Thank you for regarding me as your sister.

186
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,910
Starting today, I will work hard to be your younger sister.

187
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,470
Okay.

188
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,280
Actually, before this incident happened to Cai Hong,

189
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,540
I already decided that

190
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,240
I must confront my love with Cai Hong.

191
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,160
I already told Dad that

192
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,950
Cai Hong and I will be filial to Mom.

193
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,830
I used the emotional aspects as an excuse. It was cowardly,

194
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,940
but I have already thought it through.

195
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,980
I will tell Cai Hong about my sincerity.

196
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,010
Don't worry and go. I will take care of Mom.

197
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,750
Okay.

198
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,590
Stop there.

199
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,720
Yu Er. Kneel down.

200
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,560
Since Wu Hong Da's daughter has regained her consciousness,

201
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,430
your relationship should end now.

202
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:32,130
Today, I want you to swear in front of your father's tablet

203
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:37,150
that starting from today, you and Wu Cai Hong will sever ties.

204
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,890
Mom, sorry. I can't promise you this.

205
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,980
You!

206
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,700
- Mom. <br>- Mom.

207
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,120
- Are you okay? <br>- Go away.

208
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,980
Mom, are you okay?

209
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,710
Mom.

210
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,390
When the incident happened to Cai Hong,

211
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,030
I swore that

212
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,980
whether she regained her consciousness or not,

213
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,400
I would protect her.

214
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,010
I won't let her get hurt again.

215
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,850
You.

216
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,920
You stood in front of your father's tablet

217
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,230
and said that you wouldn't hurt Wu Hong Da's daughter?

218
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,660
Aren't you afraid of hurting me?

219
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,450
You are not afraid that you have wronged you father in heaven?

220
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,350
Mom. Do you think that I'm not in pain?

221
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,340
Did you think that I didn't think about you and father's feelings?

222
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,980
It was my inner struggle and me repressing and resisting my own feelings

223
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,740
that led to so many unfortunate things happening to Cai Hong.

224
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,930
What mistakes did Cai Hong commit?

225
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,070
Her only mistake was that she was Wu Hong Da's daughter.

226
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,100
She can't choose her parents.

227
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,900
Furthermore, she is already willing to.

228
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,310
Her father committed wrong

229
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:10,760
and she used her life to redeem it. Isn't this enough?

230
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,970
If Cai Hong died in the fire,

231
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,900
would we really be at peace?

232
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,730
Yu Er, do you really think that your mother has such a cold heart?

233
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,370
But you must think about it.

234
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,790
If you want to be together with Wu Hong Da's daughter,

235
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,470
how can her last name, her background

236
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,950
be ever included into our family register?

237
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,350
If you both are together,

238
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,090
every time the rites ritual is held,

239
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,740
as a daughter-in-law, the food offerings that she prepares, what right would she have

240
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,990
to offer it to the front of your father's tablet?

241
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,980
If you both were to have children,

242
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,960
do you think that your father in heaven

243
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,600
would be willing to be called Grandfather?

244
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,050
Mom. What you said, I have already thought about it many times.

245
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,030
In the past, I used to think that this was impossible too.

246
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,580
But Cai Hong's courage and perservance

247
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,020
made me think of a reason.

248
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,170
Why can't we change our mindset?

249
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,050
Just like what you said,

250
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:29,290
in the future, if Cai Hong and I get married,

251
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:32,430
and we have a child,

252
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,720
we will be happy that it was born.

253
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,890
Unfortunately, we cannot resolve the issues of dead people.

254
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,080
Even the power of love

255
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,020
will not allow us to get rid of all the hatred.

256
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,130
Looks like your

257
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,450
love has surpassed your life.

258
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,450
It made your forget the deep grudge and revenge of your father.

259
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:03,070
Let me tell you. If, Cai Hong, by saving my life,

260
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,380
could cancel the grudge between the Wu and Jiang families,

261
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,110
I would also tell you that I can't do it.

262
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,130
If this is the case,

263
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,320
I should join your father in the other world so you can share a blissful life with Cai Hong.

264
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,010
Mom.

265
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,890
Yu Er. You don't want your mother to die, right?

266
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,990
Sever the ties today then.

267
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
You are awake.

268
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,040
Don't move. You need to rest.

269
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,580
I'm fine.

270
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,130
Cai Hong. Why are you so foolish?

271
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,510
The Jiang family has so many employees. Why did you run into the fire to save them?

272
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,940
Even if you had to do everything in you to save them,

273
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,560
what if something happened to you and you caused me to...

274
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,160
What are you going to do about Cai Yun and Aunt?

275
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,270
Sorry for making you worry about me.

276
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,240
But look, God is taking care of me.

277
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,830
Didn't I wake up?

278
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,120
Let's not talk about this anymore. Take your porridge.

279
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,160
Here.

280
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,990
Once I woke up, I could't use my hands.

281
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,070
Don't force yourself to be strong. My mom cooked this porridge for you.

282
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,950
It tastes really good. Please thank Aunt on my behalf.

283
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,000
What is there to thank? It's more important for you to recover first.

284
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,150
Come.

285
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,990
One more sip. Here.

286
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,930
You are here.

287
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,310
How is Cai Hong's injuries?

288
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,140
If you are concerned about her, go in and see her.

289
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,090
If the Jiang family still can't accept her,

290
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,740
don't look for her anymore.

291
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:02,940
She gets hurt everytime you treat her good.

292
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,560
Do you know that I thought of giving her up

293
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,950
and letting you take care of her?

294
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,900
In the end, she turned out like this.

295
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,560
Since your Jiang family is unwilling to accept her,

296
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,090
I won't give up again.

297
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:31,980
Starting today, I will take good care of her.

298
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,960
I won't let her be hurt again.

299
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,980
I will never let this happen.

300
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,860
And what if Cai Hong has to enter the Jiang House at the cost of your mother's life?

301
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,980
Will you be able to accept this?

302
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:59,010
If you can't give your beloved a future, don't give her any hope.

303
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,110
You want Cai Hong to be happy too.

304
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,020
Are you okay?

305
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:56,410
Is there a report for the fire?

306
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:01,520
According to the preliminary investigation report, we believe it was a deliberate arson, done by the missing servant.

307
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,930
But I guess he was instructed to do so.

308
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:10,720
Can you help me and think who could have a motive to do this?

309
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,880
I can only think of one person.

310
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,390
Lu Man.

311
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,730
I had the same thought as you

312
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,020
but we don't have any evidence now.

313
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,840
No matter what, I still need to report to Police Chief Li.

314
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,070
Warlord Lu is a decent man, he would never cover up a murderer.

315
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,550
I will find the evidence and sentence her according to the law.

316
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,710
<i>It's so beautiful</i>

317
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,320
<i>but it's a pity this is not what I wanted.</i>

318
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,210
Military Governor.

319
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,270
Military Governor, what brings you here?

320
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,160
What did I do wrong that you are beating me?

321
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,450
You bandit. I already told you not to give me any problems.

322
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:21,140
You should quit pretending to listen to my orders.

323
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,010
Jiang Yu of Huzhou

324
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:31,170
is not an insignificant person. Many people are watching his movements.

325
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,610
Even if I wanted to touch him,

326
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,080
I would think carefully about the consequences.

327
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,890
As for you,

328
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:49,140
you even had the courage to set fire on his home and kill them?

329
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,350
Do you know how many people in Huzhou are eyeing my position?

330
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,060
And you still give me problems?

331
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:03,130
I should have shot you then.

332
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,050
It would have saved me from your scheming.

333
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,980
You said that I set fire and killed people?

334
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,190
Where is the evidence?

335
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,020
Where is the evidence?!

336
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:21,280
You listen to what others say and you simply believed them?

337
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,860
Fine.

338
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,050
Since you believe that I did it,

339
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,760
just shoot me then.

340
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,190
When you were chasing after me in Shanghai,

341
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,920
I was just a child.

342
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,970
I was very good then.

343
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,840
Now,

344
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,180
you got tired of me so you are using everything against me, isn't that so?

345
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,000
Fine.

346
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,280
If you think I'm that kind of person,

347
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,770
and you are willing to believe them,

348
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,560
I'm going to pack and leave.

349
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,580
I will stay far away from you.

350
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,940
This place has wronged me all the time.

351
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:07,020
This is my territory. Do you think you can and go as you wish?

352
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,140
Miss Wu, dont move around. Your injuries haven't healed yet.

353
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,690
- I would like to visit Madam Jiang. <br>- No, you must lie down.

354
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,300
If the wounds tear, it won't be good.

355
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,210
- I will be back. <br>- You can't.

356
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,290
When your wounds have healed, I will definitely take you there.

357
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:28,650
Cai Hong. You must listen to the nurse.

358
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,680
Madam Jiang is really doing well.

359
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,690
Heal your wounds first.

360
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,620
When that time comes, I will go with you to visit her.

361
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,950
What about Jiang Yu? How is he?

362
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,790
He is doing well.

363
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,890
He didn't even come to see me.

364
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,860
Eat something.

365
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,750
Mom.

366
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,880
Mom.

367
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,790
I miss you.

368
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,320
I know that

369
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,850
I know that no matter how many people have abandoned me,

370
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,370
in your heart,

371
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:32,080
I'm your most beloved.

372
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,820
The most obedient daughter.

373
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,890
I will rise up again.

374
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,710
I will really rise again.

375
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,390
Mom.

376
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,730
Don't be sad and worried.

377
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,770
When others treat me badly,

378
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,050
I will love myself even more.

379
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,700
I will take care of myself.

380
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,670
Mom.

381
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,640
What are you thinking about?

382
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,970
I have been cooking food for Miss Wu for the past few days.

383
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,640
Is she used to them?

384
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:15,570
Did she say what she wanted to eat? I will cook it for her.

385
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,530
Is she much better?

386
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:25,890
Sometimes, I think that I should let her go.

387
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,680
This would be really good for her.

388
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:36,010
Shao Tian. When Miss Wu is awake, everything will be fine.

389
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,600
As for the rest of the matters, take it slow.

390
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,630
But I also felt that

391
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,130
I was the only one who could do so much for her

392
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,300
and protect her.

393
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,000
I don't know

394
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,610
what to say.

395
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,130
In any case,

396
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,730
when two people like each other, even when they are not together,

397
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,550
their hearts are thinking about each other.

398
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:23,410
But if one party doesn't like the other,

399
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:26,410
even if they are together every day,

400
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,460
that person's heart will still be out there.

401
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,400
She is just like the stars in the sky.

402
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,930
She seems very close

403
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,460
but actually, she's very far away from me.

404
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,900
Cai Hong.

405
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,550
Brother Shao Tian.

406
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,430
Did you had a good rest?

407
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,400
It's okay.

408
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,890
Here, have some bananas.

409
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,430
Thanks.

410
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,100
Cai Hong. I'm going out for a while.

411
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,640
Call the nurse if there are anything.

412
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,770
Go and do what you need to first.

413
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:52,310
Cai Yun will come here to keep me company later.

414
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,230
Mom. Cai Hong is here.

415
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,320
Don't let her in.

416
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:06,100
Madam. I only just wanted to visit you.
