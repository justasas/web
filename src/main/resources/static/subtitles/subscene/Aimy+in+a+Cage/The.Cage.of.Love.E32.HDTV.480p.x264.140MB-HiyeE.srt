The Cage of Love

00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:10,110
<i>Episode 32</i>

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,720
Little Friend, why are you here crying alone?

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,980
- What's wrong?
- My favourite fish has left.

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,160
If you liked it why didn't you keep it with you?

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,680
Why did you release it?

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,410
Sister. I actually reared two fish.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,720
But one died today.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,960
I let the other fish go. I won't be able to see it again. I'm very sad.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,100
But if that fish died, I would be even sadder.

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,340
Mom said that I must release that fish into the pond

12
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:00,030
and let it go free. The fish will be happy and it won't die.

13
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,090
Yes.

14
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,940
When you love someone, you should let that person go and be happy.

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,110
It's fine as long as he's happy.

16
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,090
Sister. You are sad too. Isn't that so?

17
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,350
Just like when I released that fish, I'm very sad too.

18
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,120
I will never see that fish again

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,980
but this is for the good of the fish. That's why I did this.

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,010
Thank you, baby. You are very smart.

21
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,940
I understand now.

22
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,320
<i>If Wu Cai Hong is brother's happiness,</i>

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,480
<i>then, as long as brother is happy,</i>

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,350
<i>I'm willing to pray that she will wake soon.</i>

25
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,340
<i>I'm willing to let go of my hatred and envy.</i>

26
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,010
<i>I'm willing to accept her.</i>

27
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,010
<i>Cai Hong!</i>

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,020
<i>Cai Hong!</i>

29
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,720
<i>Cai Hong!</i>

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,620
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

31
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,150
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

32
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,700
<i>I finally found you.</i>

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:13,030
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

34
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,070
Cai Hong. You must wake up.

35
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,470
Cai Yun, your stepmom and I

36
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,330
and also Jiang Yu,

37
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,310
we are all waiting for you.

38
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,280
Brother Shao Tian.

39
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,470
It has been hard for you to take care of my sister the whole night.

40
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,150
Let me take care of my sister during the day.

41
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,280
Go back and take a rest now.

42
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,030
Fine. I will leave your sister to you.

43
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,340
What are you still doing here?

44
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,470
- I want to see Cai Hong.
- Is there a need for you to?

45
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,030
- Let me see her.
- Haven't you harm her enough?

46
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,120
Jiang Yu. When Cai Hong followed you,

47
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,340
she suffered a lot and received many punishments.

48
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,560
Because of your father's tablet, she sacrificed her life for it.

49
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,280
I know about the grudge between both your families

50
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,040
but it was Wu Hong Da's fault. It has nothing to do with Cai Hong.

51
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,940
I know I was wrong.

52
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,990
I know that Cai Hong's stepmom and sister will listen to you.

53
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,090
I'm begging you.

54
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,110
Please tell them and let me see her.

55
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,970
Cai Yun. Come out first.

56
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,130
I'm letting you in

57
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,540
not because you want to see her.

58
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,620
It's because I know that

59
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,420
Cai Hong wants to see you.

60
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:21,500
♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

61
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:28,520
♫<i> In the end I did not get your heart. </i>♫

62
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,480
<i>He has a strikingly beautiful face, a Grecian nose, strong brows, and bright eyed </i>

63
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,300
<i>with an uncommon demeanor.</i>

64
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,450
<i>No matter how you look at him, he is smothering to look at, a handsome man.</i>

65
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,680
♫<i> I fight a bitter battle between advancing and retreating. </i>♫
- Let me go.
- I won't.

66
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,080
♫<i> I didn't see through to </i>♫
I'm not letting you go. What will you do?

67
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,940
♫<i> your eyes or heart </i>♫
Jiang Yu!

68
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,290
♫<i> but I've already fallen in love </i>♫

69
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,060
♫<i> with your tenderness. </i>♫

70
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:05,480
♫<i> I'm not willing to give up (the love), but I can't have it either. </i>♫

71
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,880
♫<i> I fight a bitter battle between advancing and retreating. </i>♫

72
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:18,330
♫<i> I didn't see through to your eyes or heart</i>♫

73
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:24,720
♫<i> but I've already fallen in love with your tenderness. </i>♫

74
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:34,300
♫<i> but I've already fallen in love with your tenderness. </i>♫

75
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,150
I'm here to see you.

76
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,070
Why are you so foolish?

77
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,070
I never even had the courage to face my feelings. I don't deserve you being so good to me.

78
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,240
Cai Hong. Do you know that I have many things to tell you?

79
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,730
You can listen carefully to me today.

80
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,420
Frankly, the first time I met you at the hospital,

81
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,320
I knew that I fell in love with you

82
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,050
but

83
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,080
you were the daughter of my enemy.

84
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,150
I later worked hard to tell myself that

85
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,010
I would forget that I like you.

86
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,010
I did many things to forget you.

87
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,940
To remind myself that I couldn't fall in love with you.

88
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,950
But when love happens, it happens.

89
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,770
No matter how I tried to escape,

90
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,910
no matter how I lied to myself,

91
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,100
love is just like wild grass.

92
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,890
Cai Hong, I told myself that

93
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,160
starting from now.

94
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,910
I won't escape again.

95
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,990
I want to be like you

96
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,030
and face it bravely.

97
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,030
Cai Hong.

98
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,040
You must give me the chance to pay you back.

99
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,940
You must give me the chance to dote on you.

100
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,010
You must wake up.

101
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,110
<i>Cai Hong. Jiang Yu sent you these flowers to wake you up.</i>

102
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,530
<i>Roses are the flower given to describe love. </i>

103
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,890
<i>That is really true.</i>

104
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,520
<i>The beautiful flower and its thorns</i>

105
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,640
<i>Love with injury.</i>

106
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,400
<i>I know you want to escape the despair,</i>

107
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,430
<i>that is why you escape into your dream</i>

108
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,540
<i>and don't want to wake up.</i>

109
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,540
But Cai Hong,

110
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,520
<i>looking at how much pain you are in,</i>

111
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,930
<i>what should I do?</i>

112
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,010
Brother Shao Tian.

113
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,950
Cai Hong, you are awake.

114
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,020
The flowers are very beautiful.

115
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,370
I seem to have slept for a very long time.

116
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,990
I even dreamt that someone was calling me.

117
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,950
Was it you?

118
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,980
You really slept for a long time

119
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,600
but you finally woke up.

120
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,370
This is great.

121
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,330
Are these roses

122
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,550
from you?

123
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,890
Jiang Yu sent them.

124
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,710
Was he hurt?

125
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,700
How is he?

126
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,410
Jiang Yu is fine.

127
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,510
What about Madam Jiang?

128
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,010
Madam Jiang is fine too.

129
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,690
What about Old Master Jiang's tablet?

130
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,710
Old Master's tablet is fine.

131
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,030
The whole Jiang family is fine except you.

132
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,830
Why are you so foolish?

133
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,020
Now you are in this situation.

134
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,250
Brother Shao Tian. Can you tell Madam Jiang

135
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,600
and also Jiang Yu that I have woken up?

136
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,990
Tell them not to worry about me.

137
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,310
I will have to visit them at the Jiang house then.

138
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,570
What did you say?

139
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,500
Nothing.

140
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,020
Cai Hong. It's definitely good news that you are awake.

141
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,030
I'm going to call the doctor to check on you now.

142
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,560
I'm here to tell you that

143
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,470
Cai Hong has regained her consciousness.

144
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,060
Jiang Yu.

145
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,240
I hope that you have thought it over carefully

146
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,700
and thought about your family's problems again before you see her.

147
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,630
I don't want to see her hurt again

148
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,770
because of you.

149
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,070
What Cai Hong did,

150
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,680
Mom was very touched.

151
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,210
It's just that the past has hurt her a lot.

152
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,930
Thus, she still can't accept her.

153
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,950
I understand.

154
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,680
Brother, after all this, do you still intend to contin to suppress your feelings?

155
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,460
Each of you are both in pain.

156
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,760
Don't misunderstand.

157
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,710
I'm not persuading you to give up this time.

158
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:03,080
I only wanted to tell you that if you think Cai Hong is your happiness,

159
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,530
you should go after your happiness.

160
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,910
I'm willing to accept her as my sister-in-law.

161
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,390
Fei Fei.

162
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,060
Thank you for being able to accept Cai Hong.

163
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,010
Is my acceptance that important to you?

164
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,900
Of course, it's important.

165
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,290
You are my sister.

166
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,960
Your acceptance is not only important to me,

167
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,100
it is very important to Cai Hong also.

168
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,150
Thank you for regarding me as your sister.

169
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,910
Starting today, I will work hard to be your younger sister.

170
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,470
Okay.

171
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,280
Actually, before this incident happened to Cai Hong,

172
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,540
I already decided that

173
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,240
I must confront my love with Cai Hong.

174
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,160
I already told Dad that

175
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,950
Cai Hong and I will be filial to Mom.

176
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,830
I used the emotional aspects as an excuse. It was cowardly,

177
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,940
but I have already thought it through.

178
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,980
I will tell Cai Hong about my sincerity.

179
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,010
Don't worry and go. I will take care of Mom.

180
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,750
Okay.

181
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,590
Stop there.

182
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,720
Yu Er. Kneel down.

183
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,560
Since Wu Hong Da's daughter has regained her consciousness,

184
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,430
your relationship should end now.

185
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:33,130
Today, I want you to swear in front of your father's tablet

186
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:38,150
that starting from today, you and Wu Cai Hong will sever ties.

187
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,890
Mom, sorry. I can't promise you this.

188
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,980
You!

189
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,700
- Mom.
- Mom.

190
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,120
- Are you okay?
- Go away.

191
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,980
Mom, are you okay?

192
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,710
Mom.

193
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,390
When the incident happened to Cai Hong,

194
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,030
I swore that

195
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,980
whether she regained her consciousness or not,

196
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,400
I would protect her.

197
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,010
I won't let her get hurt again.

198
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,850
You.

199
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,920
You stood in front of your father's tablet

200
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,230
and said that you wouldn't hurt Wu Hong Da's daughter?

201
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,660
Aren't you afraid of hurting me?

202
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,450
You are not afraid that you have wronged you father in heaven?

203
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,350
Mom. Do you think that I'm not in pain?

204
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,340
Did you think that I didn't think about you and father's feelings?

205
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,980
It was my inner struggle and me repressing and resisting my own feelings

206
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,740
that led to so many unfortunate things happening to Cai Hong.

207
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,930
What mistakes did Cai Hong commit?

208
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,070
Her only mistake was that she was Wu Hong Da's daughter.

209
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,100
She can't choose her parents.

210
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,900
Furthermore, she is already willing to.

211
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,310
Her father committed wrong

212
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:11,760
and she used her life to redeem it. Isn't this enough?

213
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,970
If Cai Hong died in the fire,

214
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,900
would we really be at peace?

215
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:25,730
Yu Er, do you really think that your mother has such a cold heart?

216
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,370
But you must think about it.

217
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,790
If you want to be together with Wu Hong Da's daughter,

218
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,470
how can her last name, her background

219
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,950
be ever included into our family register?

220
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,350
If you both are together,

221
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,090
every time the rites ritual is held,

222
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,740
as a daughter-in-law, the food offerings that she prepares, what right would she have

223
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,990
to offer it to the front of your father's tablet?

224
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,980
If you both were to have children,

225
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,960
do you think that your father in heaven

226
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,600
would be willing to be called Grandfather?

227
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,050
Mom. What you said, I have already thought about it many times.

228
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,030
In the past, I used to think that this was impossible too.

229
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,580
But Cai Hong's courage and perservance

230
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,020
made me think of a reason.

231
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,170
Why can't we change our mindset?

232
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,050
Just like what you said,

233
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,290
in the future, if Cai Hong and I get married,

234
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,430
and we have a child,

235
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,720
we will be happy that it was born.

236
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,890
Unfortunately, we cannot resolve the issues of dead people.

237
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,080
Even the power of love

238
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,020
will not allow us to get rid of all the hatred.

239
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,130
Looks like your

240
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,450
love has surpassed your life.

241
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,450
It made your forget the deep grudge and revenge of your father.

242
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:04,070
Let me tell you. If, Cai Hong, by saving my life,

243
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,380
could cancel the grudge between the Wu and Jiang families,

244
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,110
I would also tell you that I can't do it.

245
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,130
If this is the case,

246
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:19,320
I should join your father in the other world so you can share a blissful life with Cai Hong.

247
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,010
Mom.

248
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,890
Yu Er. You don't want your mother to die, right?

249
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,990
Sever the ties today then.

250
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,960
You are awake.

251
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,040
Don't move. You need to rest.

252
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,580
I'm fine.

253
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,130
Cai Hong. Why are you so foolish?

254
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,510
The Jiang family has so many employees. Why did you run into the fire to save them?

255
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,940
Even if you had to do everything in you to save them,

256
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,560
what if something happened to you and you caused me to...

257
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,160
What are you going to do about Cai Yun and Aunt?

258
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,270
Sorry for making you worry about me.

259
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,240
But look, God is taking care of me.

260
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,830
Didn't I wake up?

261
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,120
Let's not talk about this anymore. Take your porridge.

262
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,160
Here.

263
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,990
Once I woke up, I could't use my hands.

264
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,070
Don't force yourself to be strong. My mom cooked this porridge for you.

265
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,950
It tastes really good. Please thank Aunt on my behalf.

266
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,000
What is there to thank? It's more important for you to recover first.

267
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,150
Come.

268
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,990
One more sip. Here.

269
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,930
You are here.

270
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,310
How is Cai Hong's injuries?

271
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,140
If you are concerned about her, go in and see her.

272
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,090
If the Jiang family still can't accept her,

273
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,740
don't look for her anymore.

274
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,940
She gets hurt everytime you treat her good.

275
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:11,560
Do you know that I thought of giving her up

276
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,950
and letting you take care of her?

277
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,900
In the end, she turned out like this.

278
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,560
Since your Jiang family is unwilling to accept her,

279
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,090
I won't give up again.

280
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:32,980
Starting today, I will take good care of her.

281
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,960
I won't let her be hurt again.

282
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,980
I will never let this happen.

283
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,860
And what if Cai Hong has to enter the Jiang House at the cost of your mother's life?

284
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,980
Will you be able to accept this?

285
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,010
If you can't give your beloved a future, don't give her any hope.

286
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,110
You want Cai Hong to be happy too.

287
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,020
Are you okay?

288
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,410
Is there a report for the fire?

289
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:02,520
According to the preliminary investigation report, we believe it was a deliberate arson, done by the missing servant.

290
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,930
But I guess he was instructed to do so.

291
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:11,720
Can you help me and think who could have a motive to do this?

292
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,880
I can only think of one person.

293
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,390
Lu Man.

294
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,730
I had the same thought as you

295
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,020
but we don't have any evidence now.

296
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,840
No matter what, I still need to report to Police Chief Li.

297
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,070
Warlord Lu is a decent man, he would never cover up a murderer.

298
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,550
I will find the evidence and sentence her according to the law.

299
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,710
<i>It's so beautiful</i>

300
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,320
<i>but it's a pity this is not what I wanted.</i>

301
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,210
Military Governor.

302
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,270
Military Governor, what brings you here?

303
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,160
What did I do wrong that you are beating me?

304
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,450
You bandit. I already told you not to give me any problems.

305
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:22,140
You should quit pretending to listen to my orders.

306
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,010
Jiang Yu of Huzhou

307
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:32,170
is not an insignificant person. Many people are watching his movements.

308
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,610
Even if I wanted to touch him,

309
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,080
I would think carefully about the consequences.

310
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,890
As for you,

311
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:50,140
you even had the courage to set fire on his home and kill them?

312
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,350
Do you know how many people in Huzhou are eyeing my position?

313
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,060
And you still give me problems?

314
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:04,130
I should have shot you then.

315
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,050
It would have saved me from your scheming.

316
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,980
You said that I set fire and killed people?

317
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,190
Where is the evidence?

318
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,020
Where is the evidence?!

319
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,280
You listen to what others say and you simply believed them?

320
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,860
Fine.

321
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,050
Since you believe that I did it,

322
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,760
just shoot me then.

323
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,190
When you were chasing after me in Shanghai,

324
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,920
I was just a child.

325
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,970
I was very good then.

326
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,840
Now,

327
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,180
you got tired of me so you are using everything against me, isn't that so?

328
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,000
Fine.

329
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,280
If you think I'm that kind of person,

330
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,770
and you are willing to believe them,

331
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,560
I'm going to pack and leave.

332
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,580
I will stay far away from you.

333
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,940
This place has wronged me all the time.

334
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:08,020
This is my territory. Do you think you can and go as you wish?

335
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,140
Miss Wu, dont move around. Your injuries haven't healed yet.

336
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,690
- I would like to visit Madam Jiang.
- No, you must lie down.

337
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,300
If the wounds tear, it won't be good.

338
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,210
- I will be back.
- You can't.

339
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,290
When your wounds have healed, I will definitely take you there.

340
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:29,650
Cai Hong. You must listen to the nurse.

341
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,680
Madam Jiang is really doing well.

342
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,690
Heal your wounds first.

343
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,620
When that time comes, I will go with you to visit her.

344
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,950
What about Jiang Yu? How is he?

345
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,790
He is doing well.

346
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,890
He didn't even come to see me.

347
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,860
Eat something.

348
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,750
Mom.

349
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,880
Mom.

350
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,790
I miss you.

351
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,320
I know that

352
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,850
I know that no matter how many people have abandoned me,

353
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,370
in your heart,

354
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:33,080
I'm your most beloved.

355
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,820
The most obedient daughter.

356
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,890
I will rise up again.

357
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,710
I will really rise again.

358
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,390
Mom.

359
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,730
Don't be sad and worried.

360
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,770
When others treat me badly,

361
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,050
I will love myself even more.

362
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,700
I will take care of myself.

363
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,670
Mom.

364
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,640
What are you thinking about?

365
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,970
I have been cooking food for Miss Wu for the past few days.

366
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,640
Is she used to them?

367
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,570
Did she say what she wanted to eat? I will cook it for her.

368
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,530
Is she much better?

369
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:26,890
Sometimes, I think that I should let her go.

370
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,680
This would be really good for her.

371
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:37,010
Shao Tian. When Miss Wu is awake, everything will be fine.

372
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,600
As for the rest of the matters, take it slow.

373
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,630
But I also felt that

374
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,130
I was the only one who could do so much for her

375
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,300
and protect her.

376
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,000
I don't know

377
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,610
what to say.

378
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,130
In any case,

379
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:14,730
when two people like each other, even when they are not together,

380
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,550
their hearts are thinking about each other.

381
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:24,410
But if one party doesn't like the other,

382
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,410
even if they are together every day,

383
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,460
that person's heart will still be out there.

384
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,400
She is just like the stars in the sky.

385
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,930
She seems very close

386
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,460
but actually, she's very far away from me.

387
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,900
Cai Hong.

388
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,550
Brother Shao Tian.

389
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,430
Did you had a good rest?

390
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,400
It's okay.

391
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,890
Here, have some bananas.

392
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,430
Thanks.

393
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,100
Cai Hong. I'm going out for a while.

394
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,640
Call the nurse if there are anything.

395
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,770
Go and do what you need to first.

396
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,310
Cai Yun will come here to keep me company later.

397
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,230
Mom. Cai Hong is here.

398
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,320
Don't let her in.

399
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:07,100
Madam. I only just wanted to visit you.
