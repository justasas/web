00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,087
[Trish] <i>If you're just joining us,</i>
<i>this is</i> Trish Talk

3
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,797
<i>and we are discussing the recent events</i>

4
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:29,216
<i>that have the residents</i>
<i>of Harlem confused,</i>

5
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,010
<i>and some even frightened.</i>

6
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:33,345
<i>Line one.</i>
<i>Sophia, you're on the air.</i>

7
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:35,973
[Sophia] <i>Luke Cage is turning</i>
<i>the neighborhood upside down</i>

8
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:37,266
<i>and giving it a good shake.</i>

9
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:39,101
<i>Trust me, no one wants to see</i>
<i>what falls out.</i>

10
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:42,146
[Trish] <i>Are you suggesting we turn</i>
<i>a blind eye to the problems in our city?</i>

11
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,480
[Sophia] <i>No, but I seen the news.</i>

12
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:46,025
<i>The man is so strong,</i>
<i>he doesn't have to answer to anybody.</i>

13
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:47,818
<i>Can you trust a person like that?</i>

14
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:50,320
<i>Let the police do their jobs.</i>
<i>That's what I say.</i>

15
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:51,656
[Trish] <i>Some would argue the boys in blue</i>

16
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:54,324
<i>don't exactly have</i>
<i>a sterling reputation these days.</i>

17
00:01:54,408 --> 00:01:55,534
[Sophia] <i>Oh, yeah, missy?</i>

18
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:57,912
<i>Well, the next time trouble comes</i>
<i>banging at your door,</i>

19
00:01:57,995 --> 00:02:00,414
<i>maybe you should call Luke Cage</i>
<i>instead of 911.</i>

20
00:02:00,497 --> 00:02:02,541
[Trish chuckles] <i>You know what, Sophia?</i>
<i>I just might.</i>

21
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,459
<i>Uh, let's take another caller.</i>

22
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:05,920
<i>Line two.</i>
<i>Hi, Amir.</i>

23
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:07,421
[Amir] <i>Hey, Trish,</i>
<i>I want to respond to that lady</i>

24
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:08,756
<i>'cause she's got it all wrong.</i>

25
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,716
<i>I know Luke.</i>
<i>He comes into the fish fry.</i>

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,802
<i>Always treats my wife and me with respect.</i>

27
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:14,679
<i>Last week, two kids started a fight,</i>

28
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:16,471
<i>Luke took care of it</i>
<i>and nobody got hurt.</i>

29
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:20,434
[Trish] <i>I think it's noteworthy that the</i>
<i>only people I've spoken to that criticize</i>

30
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:22,477
<i>are the ones</i>
<i>who don't know him personally.</i>

31
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:24,313
<i>So many others</i>
<i>have merely read about him</i>

32
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:26,774
<i>or saw him on the news</i>
<i>and jumped to conclusions.</i>

33
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:29,944
[Amir] <i>Trish, Luke is good people</i>
<i>and he belongs right here in Harlem.</i>

34
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:32,446
<i>And I think it's important for all of us</i>
<i>to realize something.</i>

35
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:36,200
<i>We are witnessing a massive shift</i>
<i>in the boundaries of possibility.</i>

36
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:39,619
<i>But what is scary to some</i>
<i>inspires hope in others.</i>

37
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:43,833
<i>I, for one, would like to thank Luke Cage</i>
<i>for all the work he's doing in Harlem.</i>

38
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,961
<i>Those of us below 110th</i>
<i>see the good work he's doing</i>

39
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:48,628
<i>and we hope he's doing well.</i>

40
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:09,399
I never thought I'd be happy
to see your ugly face.

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,028
Well, we all can't be as pretty as you.

42
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:15,322
[laughs] Ain't that the truth.

43
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:16,782
You got the goods?

44
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:19,284
You know me.
I always come correct.

45
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:21,286
It's all piled up in there,
just waiting for you.

46
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,833
-So we're squared up?
-Mmm, nah. We ain't square.

47
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,335
We a few zeroes off.

48
00:03:29,503 --> 00:03:31,797
About $100,000 worth.

49
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:34,466
[clicks tongue]

50
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:37,511
I'm not givin' you another dime.

51
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:40,472
Good. I don't need another dime.
I need $100,000.

52
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:44,769
No cash, no guns.
No guns, no Domingo.

53
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:47,187
The ghetto CNN is workin' overtime.

54
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:49,064
If you don't make it straight
with Domingo, you're done.

55
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:53,360
Plus... I got all your cash in lockup.
Oops.

56
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:59,909
Think about how you want to spend
the rest of your life, Detective.

57
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:02,536
[snorts and laughs] Shit!

58
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:11,670
Man, your juice is water since Luke Cage
punked your peacock ass.

59
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:16,383
[grunts]

60
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:22,389

64
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:39,824
[Stokes laughing]

65
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:42,827
[breathing heavily] You shot a cop!

66
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,204
[man] Hey, what's goin' on over there?

67
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:48,123
Hey, man, you all right?

68
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:51,043
[Stokes] When I catch you,
I'm gonna use my hands, bitch.

69
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:53,170
[engine starting]

70
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,507
[breathing heavily]

71
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:00,594
[man] Hey! Hey!

72
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:02,805
[grunts]

73
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:05,224
[Mariah] <i>I believe in Harlem.</i>

74
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:11,063
You know, my Harlem is saturated
with jazz, and good food,

75
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:14,774
and the pure genius
that permeates the streets.

76
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:20,197
Harlem is risin'
like a phoenix out of the ashes.

77
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,534
I mean, that's what
all of my various complexes is about,

78
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:26,786
is restoring that luster.

79
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:28,205
Fantastic.

80
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:30,290
Uh, you mind if we go in now,
Madam Councilwoman?

81
00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:31,583
The crew needs to set up for later.

82
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,543
Yeah, of course, of course.
Go on.

83
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:37,047
-[sighs]
-Your new VH1 show?

84
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:38,757
<i>Criminal Spinsters?</i>

85
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:41,843
Who you callin' a spinster?

86
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:44,138
I'd wear your narrow ass out.

87
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,307
What's this about?

88
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,477
Your cousin.
I'm shutting him down.

89
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,312
You, too.

90
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:55,524
Are you threatening me?

91
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:56,984
Never that.

92
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,370
Ah! Come on.
Let's go inside.

93
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:14,543
-I ain't no barber, Bobby.
-[Fish] Neither am I, Luke.

94
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,464
But we both agree that Harlem
is a better place with the shop open.

95
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:24,094
As soon as I put Cottonmouth in handcuffs,
I'm ghost.

96
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:27,264
You could make a career
out of robbing bad guys.

97
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:28,974
-[chuckles]
-Huh!

98
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:31,435
That would be the perfect grind,
wouldn't it?

99
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:33,312
You ever think about
playing for the Giants?

100
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:35,314
[scoffs] You could make that squad easy.

101
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:38,358
[chuckles] Being hood famous
is bad enough.

102
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:40,569
I couldn't be in the public eye
on that kind of level.

103
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:41,946
Nah, man.

104
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:45,157
Wear a mask.

105
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,576
What for?

106
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:52,914
I ain't no hero.

107
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:54,666
That's a great slogan.

108
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:57,669
"I ain't no hero.
Pay me."

109
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:59,713
[scoffs] You could market that shit.

110
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:01,966
[chuckling]

111
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,556
[Mariah] What do you mean
you shot him, Cornell?

112
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,892
Cornell!
How could you be so stupid?

113
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:15,437
You didn't have to shoot him.

114
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:19,691
And just let him stick me
for a hundred large?

115
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:22,069
Hell no.

116
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:24,904
It wasn't like
I went to the meeting strapped.

117
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:26,656
It was his gun that busted off.

118
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,327
But you went there alone
because you knew you were wrong.

119
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,872
[scoffs] This is insane.

120
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:35,540
If he lives,

121
00:07:35,624 --> 00:07:39,419
everything that you have built
will come crashing down.

122
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:42,965
And you are not dragging me down with you.
You hearin' me?

123
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:45,384
My guys are pickin' up the guns right now.

124
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,512
We'll hand them over to Domingo tonight.

125
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:51,848
I don't want the details.
I just want results.

126
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:54,059
You want results?

127
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:55,602
I don't work for you.

128
00:07:57,271 --> 00:07:59,939
Okay, forget the cops.
The cops are bad enough.

129
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:03,860
-What about Luke Cage?
-Isn't your interview today?

130
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,738
That's where your focus should be.

131
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:10,117
Givin' off that Geoffrey Canada vibe,
for real.

132
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,368
That's where the money is.

133
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:14,038
Oh, forget the money, Cornell.

134
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,331
Forget the club.
Sell it!

135
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:19,584
Walk away from all this shit.

136
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:25,257
People are still talking about
how tall you stood at Pop's memorial.

137
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,264
I'm proud of you, cousin.

138
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,017
-[sighs]
-I really am.

139
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,563
But I can take care of myself.

140
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:47,946
You need to take his ass out.

141
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,366
It ain't that easy.

142
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:56,080
Cage is bulletproof.
I've seen it myself. It's real.

143
00:08:57,831 --> 00:08:59,624
Does the nigga have gills?

144
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:01,960
Excuse me?

145
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:04,003
Drown him.

146
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:07,966
Can he burn?

147
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,221
Can you poison him?

148
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:19,686
What about a woman?

149
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,690
You know he got one with his fine ass.

150
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:27,694
You find his weakness and you squeeze.

151
00:09:30,864 --> 00:09:33,200
You soundin' a lot like Mama Mabel.

152
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:38,205
Don't worry about Cage.

153
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:40,665
His days are numbered.
I got something for him.

154
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,834
That's my word.

155
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:50,550
[cell phone ringing]

156
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:54,846
<i>¿Qué pasó?</i>

157
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:57,641
People, uh, are scrambling around here.

158
00:09:57,724 --> 00:10:01,436
My niggas loaded up the stash
right before the cops arrived.

159
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,105
[Perez] <i>What the hell happened?</i>

160
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:04,356
[exhales]

161
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:10,112
Detective Scarfe
tried to squeeze me for 100 grand.

162
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:13,072
You put him up to that shit?

163
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:15,367
Hell no.
Of course not.

164
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,411
Let me, uh, let me speak to him.
Where's he at?

165
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:20,747
Bleedin'...
and in the wind.

166
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,541
<i>You know what you just did, right?</i>

167
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,460
<i>There's no easy way out of this, man.</i>

168
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,422
Why do you think we're talking?

169
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:38,848
This is why you need to learn how to text.

170
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:40,892
You always think the worst.

171
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:45,189
-What do you need, <i>Mami?</i>
-Not me, you.

172
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,374
Luke?

173
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,794
Yes?

174
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:11,340
Oh. You probably
don't remember me, do you?

175
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:15,885
Your girlfriend had me take care of you
when you were brought into the hospital?

176
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,472
In Hell's Kitchen?

177
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:21,933
Hey.

178
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:23,977
[chuckles]

179
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:26,688
Hey. [chuckles]

180
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:29,774
Bobby.
Bobby Fish.

181
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:32,736
I'm sorry. Claire.
Very nice to meet you.

182
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:34,946
[Fish] Well, Claire, you...

183
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:39,784
you are far too beautiful
to ever apologize for anything.

184
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:42,036
You remember that.

185
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,918
-May I?
-Please. [clears throat]

186
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:55,091
[both sigh]

187
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:05,852
You didn't have to do
what you did for me.

188
00:12:07,646 --> 00:12:09,439
Have you ever saved anyone's life before?

189
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:13,943
More than once I'm betting.

190
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:16,863
So?

191
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:20,659
So, the only thing you can think about
afterwards is if they're okay.

192
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:22,243
That's all I wanted to know.

193
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:26,790
[inhales deeply]

194
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,709
Well...

195
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:32,671
I'm still here.

196
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,047
How?

197
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:39,260
That shotgun blast alone
should've turned your brain into mush.

198
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,308
So I'm a freak.

199
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,562
No. You're amazing.

200
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:58,947
I don't wanna be different
than anybody else.

201
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,449
Why hide it?

202
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:03,493
I mean, what are you gonna do with it?

203
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:07,456
[sighs]

204
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,710
[exhales]

205
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:16,715
I gotta go.

206
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:33,982
-Text me later.
-Okay.

207
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,614
[indistinct chatter]

208
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:43,950
Listen up!

209
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:47,120
I'm hearin' a lot of whispers and rumors

210
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:49,914
concerning Detective Scarfe
and what he might've been into.

211
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:52,542
Kill that noise.

212
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:54,753
We need him back alive.

213
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:58,256
There was a trail of his blood
at the scene.

214
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,510
His car riddled with bullets.
We don't know what the hell happened.

215
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:02,969
Focus on that.

216
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:06,139
I'm putting out an APB.

217
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:08,767
We're closing streets, tunnels,
puttin' up road blocks.

218
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,770
Whatever it takes.
But remember something.

219
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:15,482
This belongs in our shop.
No one else's.

220
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:21,029
Now, there's already too many
new faces here, far as I'm concerned.

221
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:23,322
And there're only gonna be more.

222
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:25,992
We need to be the ones to bring him home.

223
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:28,995
Let's do it.

224
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,419
How, uh... how you holdin' up?

225
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:39,381
I'd be doin' a lot better if people would
stop starin' at me like I'm dirty.

226
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:42,133
What do you know, Detective?
Scarfe must have told you something.

227
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,552
There's evidence that guns

228
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:45,679
from the junkyard shoot-out
were in that warehouse.

229
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:47,806
Stolen from our evidence locker?

230
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:50,141
Your partner is my top suspect.

231
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,310
It doesn't mean Scarfe did it.

232
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:55,063
He probably got a lead,
and went to go and check it out.

233
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:58,316
Alone.
Without pulling you in on a single detail.

234
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:00,944
Are you sure you don't know
where to find him?

235
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:02,946
If I knew, I would tell you.

236
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:06,240
So is that how we're
playing this, Captain?

237
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:08,242
Like Scarfe is a suspect
and not a victim?

238
00:15:08,326 --> 00:15:10,328
He could be both or either.

239
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,288
We won't know
until you guys bring him in.

240
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,457
Us?

241
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,668
I need my best on this, Detective.
That was you and Scarfe.

242
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:20,338
Now I need you and Perez
to find our boy.

243
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:24,217
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:30,306
[sighs]

245
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,058
[Luke] <i>You can disappear.</i>

246
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:36,104
The whole point of livin' in New York,
no one cares about anybody.

247
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:40,567
A building fell on you.
People are shooting at you.

248
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,488
And you walk around without a scratch.
Who's gonna ignore all that?

249
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,619
What's wrong?

250
00:15:50,702 --> 00:15:52,161
It's supposed to be locked.

251
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,749
Bobby?
Are you in here, man?

252
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,419
[door closes]

253
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:06,009
[breathing heavily]

254
00:16:06,092 --> 00:16:08,762
-Scarfe?
-No cops.

255
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,140
-Not even Misty.
-Why me?

256
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:14,267
'Cause you don't trust us.

257
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,353
We need to get him to a hospital.

258
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,939
No, I can't go to the hospital.
They'll kill me.

259
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:22,817
[breathing heavily]
Just like they did Chico.

260
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:26,070
They found him, they'll find me.

261
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:28,823
[Claire] He's lost a lot of blood.

262
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:31,660
Help me get him into the chair.
Now.

263
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:37,916
[Scarfe grunts]

264
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:43,337
Just right here, thank you.

265
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:46,382
Bobby just bought these chairs.
He's gonna be pissed.

266
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:32,136
[Perez] You are a weirdo.

267
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:37,308
People at the precinct talk about you
like you are <i>curandera</i> or some shit.

268
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,143
Like you see things. [chuckles]

269
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:43,189
You remember <i>Where's Waldo?</i>

270
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:45,734
That was me as a kid.

271
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:47,819
And I could find Waldo
faster than anybody.

272
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,153
[camera shutter clicking]

273
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:51,114
That's what a photograph does for me.

274
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:54,242
A photograph freezes time.

275
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:57,954
It allows you to look at things,
slow down,

276
00:17:58,037 --> 00:18:00,915
think about what's out of place,
and then fill in the blanks.

277
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,668
That's how you find Waldo.

278
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:08,923
Maybe you should work for Kodak.
That was deep. [chuckles]

279
00:18:09,007 --> 00:18:10,424
[Misty] Whatever.

280
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:15,388
-His clothes are still here, right?
-Yeah.

281
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:18,808
So, if he wasn't taken,
there's a chance he might come back.

282
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:21,227
We should stake it out for a while.

283
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,480
Never would have thought
Scarfe would be cute as a kid.

284
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,233
That's not Scarfe.
That's his son, Earl.

285
00:18:28,151 --> 00:18:29,861
Never knew he had a kid.

286
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:31,154
Earl's dead.

287
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,118
Scarfe forgot to lock up
his gun one night.

288
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,704
Earl found it
and accidentally shot himself.

289
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:45,293
Scarfe cracks a lot of jokes,
but he rarely smiles.

290
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:46,961
There's a difference.

291
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:50,965
[clears throat]

292
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:55,553
[gasps]

293
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:57,138
-[picture frame clatters]
-Oh!

294
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:01,685
Shut it!

295
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:05,313
Dusty old bitch.

296
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:11,110
[sighs]

297
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,990
[Claire] Okay.

298
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:19,452
I can remove the bullet from his thigh...

299
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:21,871
but the shot in his side is worse.

300
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:24,999
If the bullet pierced his liver,
he's gonna have internal bleeding,

301
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,211
-and I can't do anything about that here.
-[sighs]

302
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:29,378
[groaning]

303
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:32,131
Give me one good reason
I shouldn't dump you at the 29th.

304
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:34,926
[breathing heavily] I told you, man.

305
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:38,554
They're trying to kill me.

306
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,181
[sighs]

307
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:43,184
-No, no, no. Don't... move.
-[grunting]

308
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,144
Don't get up.
Stay right here. Hold.

309
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:46,562
[groaning]

310
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:51,735
Who the hell is this?

311
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:53,987
I'm the woman trying to save your life.

312
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,864
Thank you. Whatever.

313
00:19:55,947 --> 00:19:57,198
[groans]

314
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,118
[sighs]

315
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:04,205
Well, this is gonna sting a lot.

316
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,249
[breathing heavily]

317
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:15,174
Ah! God!

318
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:16,467
[whimpering]

319
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:18,720
[groaning]

320
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:24,142
I think I'm gonna have to stay,
lay low here for a little while.

321
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:25,559
No.

322
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:28,521
-Not until you tell me what's goin' on.
-I can't tell you anything right now.

323
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:29,939
[groaning]

324
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:40,324
[panting]

325
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:45,997
Okay.

326
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,373
It was Cottonmouth.

327
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,877
He was behind everything.

328
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,879
So you've been working for him
the whole time?

329
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:54,297
Yeah.

330
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,506
[breathing heavily]

331
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,968
I got his guns out of lockup for him,

332
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:02,263
and then he turns around
and tries to kill me.

333
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,015
Go figure.

334
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:06,434
What makes you think I can protect you?

335
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,311
[breathing heavily]

336
00:21:08,394 --> 00:21:13,191
You survived a drive-by
and a building fallin' on your head.

337
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:16,402
[grunting] I'd say you're overqualified.

338
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,905
You mentioned Chico before you passed out.

339
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,366
What happened to Chico?

340
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,493
I told you.

341
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,538
They killed him.

342
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,207
Don't lie to me.

343
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,500
Not now.

344
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:33,837
[Scarfe grunts]

345
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,924
[softly] Okay.

346
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:44,806
[sighs]

347
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:46,307
I killed him.

348
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,118
[straining]

349
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:09,956
[Claire] Luke.

350
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,208
[Scarfe gasps]

351
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,293
Don't. Please.

352
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:18,506
[Scarfe choking]

353
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,508
[Claire] You're not a killer.

354
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:22,051
Are you?

355
00:22:24,262 --> 00:22:25,846
[Scarfe gagging]

356
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:32,770
[coughing]

357
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:39,402
We're done.

358
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,030
-Let's go.
-[panting]

359
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,908
Hey, Cage!

360
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:47,201
[gasps]

361
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:49,996
Cage!

362
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:52,331
Wait!

363
00:22:53,124 --> 00:22:55,834
I'm an asshole!
There's no disputing that.

364
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,213
I am a despicable human being.

365
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:06,429
But Cottonmouth is a hell of a lot worse!

366
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:12,143
And I have got what it takes
to put him behind bars

367
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:14,270
for the rest of his life!

368
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:20,068
-[Luke] What did you say?
-[sighs]

369
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,238
I can take him down.

370
00:23:38,962 --> 00:23:40,088
What do you have?

371
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:42,048
[breathing heavily]

372
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:43,299
Notes.

373
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:47,803
Detailed notes...

374
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:51,515
of murder investigations I covered up
to save his ass.

375
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:59,648
How he uses Spurlock's Mortuary...
to dispose of the bodies.

376
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:03,902
Why do you think you never found Tone?

377
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:06,155
Or Chico?

378
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:11,119
Plus...

379
00:24:11,202 --> 00:24:15,789
I've got the name of every cop
on Cottonmouth's payroll.

380
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,334
[sighs]

381
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:22,838
That ought to be plenty to send him
on a nice permanent trip.

382
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:24,215
[exhales]

383
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:26,884
-Where are these notes?
-[sighs]

384
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,262
Tell me.

385
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:31,264
Now.

386
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,391
[sighs]

387
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:36,935
My apartment.

388
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,999
-Alex, no one goes in the back.
-Mmm-hmm.

389
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,044
And make sure these people
don't scuff up my floors.

390
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:03,421
They will stay immaculate,
Madam Councilwoman.

391
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:07,841
So, since this will be a live interview,
we'll try to keep things spontaneous.

392
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,136
But are there any topics
you want to focus on?

393
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:13,514
Well, Harlem.
How to shape it, how to elevate it, and...

394
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:15,391
-how my complexes will help--
-[sighing] Boring.

395
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:19,270
We've heard that speech from you
a million times and a half.

396
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:21,480
I told you I do not want a fluff piece.

397
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:24,608
Not fluff, fun.
There's a difference.

398
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:26,985
Remember when Obama sang Al Green?

399
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,198
You wanna watch me
whip and nae nae, Thembi?

400
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,509
You're a popular man.

401
00:25:51,427 --> 00:25:54,138
Oh, uh... the ex-wife.

402
00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:57,391
Took all my money
and she still needs the dick.

403
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,354
Glad to see chivalry isn't dead.

404
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:02,855
[Perez sighs]

405
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,608
Look, look, look, Scarfe's not comin'.

406
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:07,776
He's not gonna show up
just to get arrested.

407
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,153
-[brakes screeching]
-[cars crashing]

408
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:13,407
-[chuckles] Look at these two.
-[man and woman arguing indistinctly]

409
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:16,369
-I think she's about to--
-[laughs] She's gonna knock him out.

410
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:19,037
Maybe you should go arrest them.

411
00:26:19,122 --> 00:26:20,414
[laughs]

412
00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:23,167
[arguing continues]

413
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,251
[lock breaking]

414
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:14,009
I don't know if you remember me
ten years ago,

415
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:16,595
when I first got bumped up off patrol?

416
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,181
Yeah.

417
00:27:18,264 --> 00:27:20,891
It didn't seem like you belonged.
No offense.

418
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,186
Mmm. None taken.

419
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,899
A lot of people wrote me off back then.
But not Scarfe.

420
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:33,987
He took me under his wing.
He taught me how to police for real.

421
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:38,326
I have no idea
what he saw in me back then,

422
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:41,829
but he has had my front and my back.

423
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,252
[floorboards creaking]

424
00:28:06,229 --> 00:28:08,939
If he's clean or not...

425
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:12,360
I wanna be the one to bring him in,
ask him his side of the story.

426
00:28:13,611 --> 00:28:15,153
I owe him that much.

427
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,410
[sighs]

428
00:28:31,254 --> 00:28:33,171
We're wasting our time.

429
00:28:34,632 --> 00:28:35,924
Let's go.

430
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,225
Somebody's in there.

431
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:48,020
-No... no way Scarfe got past us.
-Well, somebody did.

432
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,038
[dog barking]

433
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,794
[dog barking]

434
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:30,729
[Misty] Hey!

435
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:34,107
Hey!

436
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,163
[exhales]

437
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:50,333
Hey, hey, hey, don't fall asleep, okay?

438
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:51,584
[grunts]

439
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,544
You need to stay conscious.
We're gonna move soon.

-[footsteps approaching]
-[door opens]

441

-[Claire sighs]
-The cops just saw me at Scarfe's place.

442
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,680
-They'll be headed here any minute.
-Misty?

443
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:07,933
Yeah... it was her.

444
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,352
He can't really walk.

445
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:12,980
-I'll carry him.
-Where?

446
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,483
The only place this evidence
makes a difference.

447
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:18,193
I just need to get a car.
I'll try and grab a cab.

448
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:19,778
No, no, no, I have a better idea.

449
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:23,491
-Claire--
<i>-Mami, ¿cómo estás?</i>

450
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,118
I texted you.
Did you get it?

451
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,745
Our ride's here.

452
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:31,123
Yeah. No, no, no,
just come around the back.

453
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,459
[groans]

454
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,087
-[car honking]
-No. Around the back.

455
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,547
Okay.

456
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:39,882
[groans]

457
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,258

[groaning]

459
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,472
[Claire] Here's our ride.

460
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:49,433
-[Luke] You gotta be kidding me.
-[Scarfe continues groaning]

461
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,978
Oh! Careful, man.

462
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:55,481
The van is one thing.

463
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:58,817
If my daughter gets scratched,
I'll kill you.

464
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:01,487
I don't care how bulletproof you are.

465
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,989
She's safe with me.
I promise.

466
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,368
-Can we drop you at home?
-No, I'm fine.

467
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:08,994
<i>-Muchas gracias, Mami.</i>
<i>-De nada.</i>

468
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,954
[Luke] You good?
[Claire] Yeah.

469
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,624
-I'll drive.
-Obviously.

470
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,306
[groaning]

471
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,810
He really needs surgery.
How far are we going?

472
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:35,729
-Downtown to One Police Plaza.
-Police headquarters?

473
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:38,691
Yeah, I'm gonna hand him
and the evidence over.

474
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:40,568
The DA can take it from there.

475
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:43,612
Get him round-the-clock protection
until he can testify against Cottonmouth.

476
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:46,281
I'm dying back here.
You're still thinking about Cottonmouth?

477
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,033
Yeah, you should be, too.

478
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,285
If he's got as many cops
working for him as you say,

479
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:52,287
he'll have them in the streets
looking for us.

480
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:54,998
Call an EMT you can trust
to meet us there.

481
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:01,213
{\an8}I want to remind the viewers
that we're live.

482
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:04,341
{\an8}Call us using the number
at the bottom of your screen.

483
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:08,303
{\an8}I know the councilwoman
would love to answer your questions.

484
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:11,640
{\an8}Madam Councilwoman,
your home is stunning.

485
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:13,476
Oh, thank you, Thembi.

486
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,686
That's why people
are paying millions of dollars

487
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:19,272
for brownstones like this one
on Convent Avenue.

488
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:22,818
I mean, these buildings
must be preserved and protected.

489
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:26,154
Let's talk politics.
Let's talk Damon Boone.

490
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:27,531
Yes.

491
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:32,786
That Stanford-educated carpetbagger
has been saying things about

492
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:38,041
my voting record, about campaign finance,
that simply are not true.

493
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:41,086
My complexes will do
for black-owned real estate

494
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:44,172
what Geoffrey Canada has done
for education uptown.

495
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,592
[scoffs]
I'm just setting the record straight.

496
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:51,054
[Perez] Someone saw a green van
parked around the back.

497
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:53,015
We got partial plates.

498
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:54,808
-Well, let's hope we get a hit on it.
-[cell phone ringing]

499
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:57,478
Otherwise, I'm not sure
where else to look.

500
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,731
And what in the hell is taking
those damn unis so long to get here?

501
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:03,066
[cell phone continues ringing]

502
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,653
Yeah.

503
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:09,657
I get that.
I get it, but we ran into a problem.

504
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:14,119
And what the hell was Luke Cage
doing with Detective Scarfe?

505
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,543
Do I need to remind you?

506
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:23,504
If Scarfe talks,

507
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:27,465
I ain't the only one going down,
Lieutenant Perez.

508
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:33,055
Half the department's coming with me.

509
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:36,517
Find him!

510
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,269
[cell phone clatters]

511
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,902
[Zip] Where's Shades?

512
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,361
[exhales]

513
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:51,406
I don't know.

514
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:56,704
Let me step up.

515
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:58,747
What you need?

516
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:02,626
And how'd that work out last time?

517
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:08,006
You got a choice?

518
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:11,969
[clicks tongue]

519
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,349
Put the word out on the street.

520
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,438
A hundred large for Detective Scarfe.

521
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:26,942
I want him dead.

522
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:29,069
Dead.

523
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:31,363
Dead.

524
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,157
Look for a green van.

525
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:36,910
Plate's 69-somethin'.

526
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:40,831
[door closes]

527
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:49,757
[Diontey] We're near the barber shop.
We'll head that way.

528
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,759
Bring him to you or Mr. Stokes?

529
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,097
Traffic sucks.

530
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:01,143
There's a police checkpoint up ahead.

531
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:03,270
Next couple of blocks, actually.

532
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:04,938
Scarfe's people are looking for us.

533
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:06,815
They're probably closing
the whole island down.

534
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:08,651
Bridges, tunnels...

535
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:10,694
That's the way I would've done it.

536
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:12,738
[coughs]

537
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:14,072
Don't take 128.

538
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:16,491
-Which way?
-[Claire] Make a sharp right.

539
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,786
-[tires screeching]
-Hang on.

540
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:20,578
[horn honking]

541
00:35:20,663 --> 00:35:23,040
Hold on. You seen that?
Hold on. I think that was it.

542
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:24,541
[tires screeching]

543
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:26,919
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

544
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,173
Zip... I think I just saw the van.

545
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:32,716
And the name was right.

546
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,927
What color did Cottonmouth
say that van was, though?

547
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,096
-Blue.
-Green, nigga.

548
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,015
Yo, I'm on them right now.

549
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:46,604
Looks like we got company.

550
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:49,066
[groaning] Is it a squad car?

551
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:50,608
[Luke] Black SUV.

552
00:35:50,693 --> 00:35:52,277
I'll slow down and see if he passes.

553
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:58,784
[laughs]

555

[tires screeching]

556
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:04,372
[Diontey] Back up! Move!

557
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,378
-[Luke] Hold on back there!
-[Scarfe groaning]

558
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,340
[horn honking]

559
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,677
-[Claire grunting]
-[Scarfe groaning]

560
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:24,226
[Diontey] There he is!
Stay on him!

561
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:43,495
[Luke] Kill the lights.

562
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:48,291
There he is!

563
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:00,178
[C-Money] Yeah. Come on, yo.

564
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:02,014
[indistinct chatter]

565
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:12,107
[indistinct chatter continues]

566
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:17,695
[Diontey] Light his ass up!

567
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:25,954
[tire deflating]

568
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,589
Shit!

569
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,428
I'm gonna circle around.
You three, through the hole.

570
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:43,263
Go, go, go!

571
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:48,018
[man] Yo, man.
[C-Money] Yo, through here!

572
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:00,030
[man] Yo, here. Here.

573
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,408
[C-Money] Come on, let's go!

574
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:08,163
[sighs] What are we doing?

575
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:11,499
-We should just head back to the precinct.
-No.

576
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,460
If we hear something,
I wanna be ready to go,

577
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:16,129
not stuck behind some damn desk.

578
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:19,757
Can we at least go to Wendy's?
I dig them Frostys, man. [chuckles]

579
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,176
Your stomach can wait.

580
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:24,721
[dispatcher on radio] <i>10-13 near Bowery.</i>
<i>Repeat, shots fired near Bowery.</i>

581
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,223
That's right near One Police Plaza.

582
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:28,600
If they're running,
why would they go down there?

583
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:30,352
Maybe they're not running.

584
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:31,728
-[siren blaring]
-[siren stops]

585
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:34,231
What the hell are you doing?

586
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:36,066
Why do you wanna rush down there?

587
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,401
He might need my help.

588
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,988
Shots fired means he resisted arrest.

589
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:42,447
They probably lit his ass up.

590
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,117
If he's dirty or not,
you don't want to see that.

591
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,534
He's still your partner.

592
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,259
Detective Knight.

593
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:04,552
[Perez] What's going on?

594
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,096
Yeah, I'm trying
to head down there right now,

595
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,555
but Perez is stopping me.

596
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:10,517
-Who's that?
-Okay. Why?

597
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,809
Who is that?

598
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,606
Okay. I'll do that.

599
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,485
Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.

600
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:25,782
That was Scarfe, wasn't it? [snickers]

601
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:27,075
What'd he say?

602
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:29,786
Not to trust you.

603
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,788
That you're in on all of this.

604
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:35,042
What? Hell no!
You can't believe that rat! He's lying.

605
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,336
He's in Cottonmouth's pocket
much deeper than I am.

606
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,839
Bet... bet you didn't know that, hmm?

607
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:47,387
No one was on the phone.

608
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,514
Microphone check, five-o.

609
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,019
You're too smart for your own good.
You know that?

610
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:55,979
Yeah, I'd rather be a smart-ass
than a dumb-ass.

611
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,439
Now give me your gun.

612
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:00,400

[grunting]

617
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,493
[panting] Uh-huh.

618
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:12,662
Okay, okay.

619
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:16,499
Okay, okay.

620
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:19,836
Now cuff yourself, you piece of shit!

621
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:22,839
Roll the video.

622
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:28,971
[Mariah through monitor] <i>You know,</i>
<i>my Harlem is saturated with jazz,</i>

623
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:33,766
<i>and good food, and the pure genius</i>
<i>that permeates the streets.</i>

624
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:39,314
<i>Harlem is risin'</i>
<i>like a phoenix out of the ashes.</i>

625
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:42,943
<i>I mean, that's what</i>
<i>all of my various complexes is about,</i>

626
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:45,695
<i>is restoring that luster.</i>

627
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:48,698
-This is great.
<i>-I believe in Harlem.</i>

628
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:50,200
This is great.

629
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:51,952
Thanks for taping that earlier.

630
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:56,123
You said you wanted something different.
This is it.

631
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:58,583
I mean, you can...
you can see it all right there.

632
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:01,503
And I don't just represent Harlem.

633
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:04,047
-I am Harlem.
-And we're live.

634
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:05,923
Which Harlem is you?

635
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:12,930
-Pardon me?
-There are actually two Harlems.

636
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:15,183
The one shown to us in that video.

637
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:19,521
Historic, hardworking and hopeful.

638
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:23,900
But in this next video,
we see an entirely different Harlem.

639
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:25,860
A historically corrupt Harlem.

640
00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:31,241
Your grandmother,
the notorious Mabel Stokes,

641
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:34,744
and her brother-in-law,
Pistol Pete Stokes, shown here,

642
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:36,163
were major players in it.

643
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:40,625
The boy in that photo would grow up to be
Cornell Stokes, aka Cottonmouth,

644
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:45,672
a man whose name rings out
in both legitimate and criminal circles.

645
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:49,926
Oh, that's a...
that's a personal photograph.

646
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:53,346
You... you really, uh,
have no right to show that one.

647
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,639
Well, how about this one?

648
00:41:55,807 --> 00:42:00,437
A somehow brutal assault that took place
at the Crispus Attucks Houses

649
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,189
didn't make the news.

650
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:06,734
Even stranger was the millions of dollars
in cash found on the premises

651
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:08,695
in your office.

652
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:11,156
There's some people on the scene
even describe a man

653
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,658
who, under a barrage of gunfire,

654
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:16,828
managed to beat down
a number of criminals,

655
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:20,790
some of whom
may have worked for your family.

656
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:24,711
So you can see
how it might be difficult to decipher

657
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:26,879
which Harlem you stand for.

658
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,977
Despite these unwarranted
attacks on my character,

659
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:45,648
I have always tried
to make clear what I want...

660
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:49,569
which I can't say for you, Thembi.

661
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:53,030
It's very clear what you
and the rest of your media friends want.

662
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:54,616
You want a story.

663
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:56,743
Not the news.
Not the truth.

664
00:42:56,826 --> 00:43:02,207
Just... a story
that you will do anything to sell.

665
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,375
Shut it down!

666
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,752
Stop. Alex!

667
00:43:05,835 --> 00:43:06,961
Thank you for your time.

668
00:43:07,044 --> 00:43:09,381
You get your ass out of my house.

669
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:20,475
[panting]

670
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:22,269
How long before we get
to police headquarters?

671
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:23,936
I think we're near city hall.

672
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:25,855
Ah, it's cold.

673
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:28,275
Is it cold, or is it just me?

674
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:31,944
We're close.
They'll warm him when we get there.

675
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:36,824
[Claire grunts]

676
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,252
[gunfire continues]

677
00:43:53,925 --> 00:43:55,385
[man 1] Yo, you should've died!

678
00:43:55,468 --> 00:43:56,844
[man 2] Come on, man.
My shit's dead.

679
00:43:56,928 --> 00:43:58,596
[C-Money] Come on!
Get it together, man!

680
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,097
[man 1] Come on, get him!
[C-Money] Light him up!

681
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:02,475
Now you're just pissin' me off.

682
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:03,810
My turn.

683
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:05,270
[men grunting]

684
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:17,990
[Claire] We're gonna go up, okay?

685
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:20,577
Come on.

686
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,495
[Scarfe grunts]

687
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:23,830
[panting]

688
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:26,208
[Claire grunts] One more step.

689
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:29,544
-I'm so tired.
-How far is it to One Police Plaza?

690
00:44:29,627 --> 00:44:32,214
I gotta... I gotta stop now.

691
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:34,507
Yeah, we can stop as soon as we get there
and we're safe.

692
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:36,218
I gotta see my son.

693
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:38,595
You can see your son and anyone else
you want to when we get there.

694
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:42,682
[crashing]

695
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:44,684
[police sirens wailing]

696
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:11,669
[panting] You okay?

697
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:12,754
Yeah.

698
00:45:13,671 --> 00:45:15,507
At least I kept one promise.

699
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:18,134
No scratches...
on you.

700
00:45:18,217 --> 00:45:20,052
[groaning weakly]

701
00:45:26,183 --> 00:45:28,395
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold his head.

702
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:30,313
Hold my hand.
Look at me.

703
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:32,315
Look at me.
Breathe.

704
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:33,775
-[breathing heavily]
-Breathe.

705
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:35,026
-Breathe.
-[Misty] Hey!

706
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:38,446
[panting] Hey. Listen, Scarfe.

707
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,781
Okay, you've--
[chuckles nervously]

708
00:45:39,864 --> 00:45:42,409
You've got a lot of explaining
to do, okay?

709
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:44,201
And you're not getting out of it.

710
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:46,037
[coughs]

711
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:50,500
You better...

712
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:53,169
You better let me do
the interrogation, partner.

713
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:55,630
-I'm better... I'm better at it.
-[laughs]

714
00:45:55,713 --> 00:45:59,175
[chuckling] Oh, you're better at it?
No, you're not.

715
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:02,804
-Huh?
-I got rapport.

716
00:46:05,264 --> 00:46:08,351
[crying] Yeah, you got rapport.

717
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:12,730
[softly] I'm sorry.

718
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:15,608
Rafe, no.

719
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:18,361
Rafe, no.

720
00:46:21,197 --> 00:46:24,951
[crying] No. No, Rafe. No.

721
00:46:25,034 --> 00:46:27,244
No, Rafe, no.

722
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:31,499
No, Rafe, please!

723
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:32,875
[sobbing]

724
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:42,176
[police sirens wailing]

725
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:46,973
[R&B song playing]

726
00:47:48,117 --> 00:47:50,036
Get the rest of your shit and bugger off.

727
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:53,831
Councilwoman Dillard,

728
00:47:53,915 --> 00:47:56,668
can you comment on the arrest
of your cousin, Cornell Stokes,

729
00:47:56,751 --> 00:47:58,044
at Harlem's Paradise tonight,

730
00:47:58,127 --> 00:48:01,088
on charges of police corruption,
extortion and murder?

731
00:48:01,172 --> 00:48:02,549
Alex!

732
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:04,050
Is it true that he's responsible

733
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:07,845
for the murder of decorated
Harlem police detective Rafael Scarfe?

734
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:10,432
-Thank you for your time!
-Councilwoman, can we get a comment?

735
00:48:10,515 --> 00:48:12,434
Councilwoman, can we get just one comment?

736
00:48:12,517 --> 00:48:15,603
-Councilwoman! Councilwoman!
-[door closes]

737
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,606
Shit!

738
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:20,733
Shit!

739
00:48:22,026 --> 00:48:24,446
[Claire] You need to get some new clothes.

740
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:27,740
[Luke] I have some stuff back at the crib.

741
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,785
This is beginning to become a habit.

742
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:33,955
[sighs] Swiss cheese shirt.

743
00:48:34,038 --> 00:48:36,248
Car bounces off of you.

744
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:39,293
Punching through steel and concrete.

745
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:42,589
Just another day, right?

746
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,884
You're safe and your mom's van is insured.

747
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:49,554
That's all that matters to me.

748
00:48:51,305 --> 00:48:53,933
After all that,
you can't say you're not special.

749
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:58,813
I'm still not sure what I am.

750
00:48:58,896 --> 00:49:00,397
You know exactly who you are.

751
00:49:01,315 --> 00:49:02,984
And what you need to do.

752
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:04,569
[chuckles]

753
00:49:04,652 --> 00:49:07,071
Pop used to say the same thing
you're saying to me.

754
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:10,199
I did right by him.

755
00:49:11,158 --> 00:49:14,286
Cottonmouth's in jail... and I'm done.

756
00:49:15,872 --> 00:49:17,289
You're moving on?

757
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:20,960
I think so.

758
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:22,169
It's time.

759
00:49:23,212 --> 00:49:25,715
There's things with your powers
you haven't even tested.

760
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:29,093
There's so many good things
that you could still do.

761
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:31,929
Maybe I could help.

762
00:49:36,684 --> 00:49:38,645
-You have ideas?
-Yeah.

763
00:49:40,104 --> 00:49:42,982
Why don't we start
by getting some coffee first?

764
00:49:50,364 --> 00:49:53,951
-I'm not sleeping with you.
-Whoa! Did I say anything about that?

765
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:57,789
Why can't coffee just be coffee, huh?

766
00:49:57,872 --> 00:50:00,833
Okay. You didn't even
touch your coffee this morning.

767
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:03,711
You drank the orange juice. Okay?
You don't drink coffee.

768
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:10,217
[telephone rings]

769
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:23,397
[sighs]

770
00:50:25,149 --> 00:50:27,234
[scoffs] Cowards.

771
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:31,238
What's going on?

772
00:50:31,322 --> 00:50:35,159
They're afraid of the headlines.
Police corruption.

773
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:38,580
A crime boss who's related
to a prominent city councilwoman.

774
00:50:38,663 --> 00:50:42,458
And the only person
to tie it all together is a corrupt cop.

775
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:44,043
A dead one at that.

776
00:50:44,126 --> 00:50:46,378
Then I'll be the one to tie it together.

777
00:50:46,462 --> 00:50:48,464
[scoffs]

778
00:50:48,547 --> 00:50:51,133
You're on the wrong side
of the glass for that, baby girl.

779
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:54,428
First Fisk, then Cottonmouth.

780
00:50:54,511 --> 00:50:55,972
This is huge.

781
00:50:56,055 --> 00:50:59,642
But they're over there...
and we're right here.
