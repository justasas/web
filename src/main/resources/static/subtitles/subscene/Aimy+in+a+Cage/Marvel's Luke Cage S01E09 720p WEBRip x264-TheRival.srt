1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,559
I should be out there doing my job.

2
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,938
[Krasner] Your job is out there
waiting for you, Detective.

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,273
The question is,
how badly do you want it?

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,779
You work for the department?
You a shrink?

5
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,864
[Krasner] I was on the job for 15 years.

6
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,825
I left to become a psychologist.

7
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,201
[scoffs]

8
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,995
I'm with the peer assistance program.
I'm a volunteer.

9
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,665
Well, how about I volunteer
my way out of this chair,

10
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:43,418
tell you to kiss my ass,
and talk to my union rep?

11
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:46,088
Well, you could do that, sure.

12
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:51,009
But your inspector would guarantee
that you'll be at your desk,

13
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:54,221
and the only time you'll see the street
is in the parking lot,

14
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,683
or if you go to get coffee, or...
look out the window.

15
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,357
-This is voluntary, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,568
-And off the record?
-Absolutely.

17
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,363
So why are we doing this
in an interrogation room?

18
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:15,618
You'd be more candid at a Starbucks?
Really?

19
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,581
Mmm...
Maybe at M&G's, after a shift.

20
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,667
Still can't believe
that place went out of business.

21
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,418
I miss Copeland's.

22
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,838
[chuckling] Who doesn't?

23
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,303
Whatever.
[inhales sharply] Let's do this.

24
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:42,477
Detective Mercedes Kelly Knight,
badge 3-0-9-3-5.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,271
You know, you're not being recorded.

26
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,649
Of course I am.

27
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,820
You know this is bullshit, right?

28
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,906
Things got rough with a hostile witness.

29
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,659
You think that's the first time
this has ever happened?

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,496
You lost control.

31
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,458
[inhales] And it's all about control
with you, isn't it?

32
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,045
I mean, that's why you were a point guard.

33
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,547
You wanted to be the one
to distribute the ball, right?

34
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,465
It's 'cause I was short,

35
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,260
and it was the only way
I could get on the court, so...

36
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,013
-'Cause you had to play the game.
-It's not a game for me.

37
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,472
Then why get benched

38
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,810
for something as stupid
as getting physical with Claire Temple?

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,833
[Stryker echoing] Do you love?
Do you love?

40
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,167
Hmm?

41
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,003
[Stryker] Oh, come on.
You're not gonna beg?

42
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,339
Oh, come on.
Not even a little bit?

43
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,590
[crying]

44
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,135
If you gonna kill me, then just do it.

45
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,988
What shook you?

46
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,907
Was it losing your gun to one suspect

47
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,618
while trying to arrest another
without backup?

48
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,536
Was it the extra eyes because of Scarfe?

49
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,663
Was it this Luke Cage guy?

50
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,001
What pushed you towards career suicide?

51
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,088
[chuckles]

52
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,259
You know how many times
I've been in this same goddamn box

53
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,094
on the other side of the table?

54
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,474
You think you are gonna break me?

55
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,685
Bring it.

56
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,815
Like I said,
this is not an interrogation.

57
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,401
I'm not here to break you.

58
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,113
You've already done that yourself.

59
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,867
The question is, how broken are you?

60
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,327
And can you be fixed?

61
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,499

Hold up, hold up.
Somebody ain't playing that thing right.

71
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,418
Tighten up over here.
Tighten up over here, all right?

72
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,337
Let's do this, man. We rehearsed it.
Let's get this done.

[Shades] Nothing yet.
Nothing yet.

80
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,357
[Stryker] Y'all can't find Luke Cage?

81
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,944
What, he just dissipated?

82
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,405

Follow the smoke.

90
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,563
Or the damn garbage truck.

91
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,114
[chuckles] Well...

92
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,075
you ain't Houdini.

93
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,290
And you ain't Rick
from <i>Casablanca,</i> neither.

What?

95
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,547

whisper in Mariah's ear...

97
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,636

You killed my friend, Shades.

102
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,235
He was my number one seller.

103
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,530
Who do you think gave him
that Barron Claiborne there?

104
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,992
You don't have any friends.

105
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,580
"A man of too many friends
comes to ruin,

106

Proverbs 18:24.

00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,178
Cornell Stokes was that friend for me.

109
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:18,933
And I could trust him
like I could my own brother.

110
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,312
Cornell was losing it.

111
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,523
You trusted me to take care of him.

112
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,444
I trusted you to take care of it,
not him.

113
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,616
What? Did you think I was just gonna
give it all to you?

[cocks gun]

115
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,084
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't splatter

116
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,753
this pristine desk
with your brain matter.

117
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,966
[Zip] Because it won't help you find
Luke Cage any faster?

[laughing]

119
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,978
You're smarter
than your name implies, Zip.

120
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,358
Two rule books
got me through the darkness.

121
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,237
The Bible...

122
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,784
and <i>The 48 Laws of Power.</i>

123
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,038
Do you want to know what the 49th is?

124

I-- [sighs]

143
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,596
I used to talk to Scarfe.

-No.
-Yeah.

147
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,776
I did a background check,

148
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,570
and he was wanted for robbery
in three different states.

149
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,532
They gave the dude a nickname
at my precinct.

150

He wasn't wearing a ring.

162
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:13,710
And the first time he spoke to me,
even in a low cut dress,

163
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,252
he looked at my eyes...

164
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,380
not my breasts.

165
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,593

-So, we talked.

and he told me so.

-But he wasn't who I thought he was.
-Just like Scarfe?

How does that make you feel?

00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,846
She was fly.
So damn fast.

177
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,809
She used to drive Mama Mabel crazy
with all her boyfriends.

178
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,022
Malik was special, though.

179
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,775
He was talented.

180
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:24,781
Played drums on a lot of those
Sugar Hill Records. The old ones.

181
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,620
I really liked him.

182
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,082
I thought they were good together.

183
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,712
Mama Mabel couldn't stand him.

184
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,966
She knew he was dabbling.

185
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,844
Coke, smack.

186
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,856
Malik wanted you, Cornell.
He did. But he OD'd.

187
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,485
And then Jazzy ran off.

188
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,448
She told me, "I'm not ready
to be nobody's mama."

189
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,116
And she just left.

190
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,787
She left you, and there you were,

191
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,415
[stammering] wrapped in a blanket
in a basket.

192
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,378
Mama Mabel put you
in my hands that very day.

193
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,010
You always thought
I called you Mo for Cottonmouth.

194
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,847
Mo was for Moses.

195
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,817
I wasn't ready
to be nobody's mama, neither.

196
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:50,950
I did try to protect you from
[stutters] all the shit.

197
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:56,413
I tried... I tried to protect you
from yourself...

198
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,918
but I didn't.

199
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,756
[sniffles]

200
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,008
[stammering] I'm...

201
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,646
You did what you had to do.

202
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,274
I don't know how this happened.

203
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,654
You made a choice... [sighs]

204
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,157
and now we have to pay the price.

205
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,452
Diamondback is here to collect.

206
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,455
Diamond-what?

207
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,626
He's not happy
that Cornell is dead, and...

208
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,587
Luke Cage is still alive.

209
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:50,677
Cage is in the wind right now,
and I need your help to find him.

210
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,261
Our frame doesn't work...

211
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,182
if he's not there to take the blame.

212
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,893
[stammers] What, you want me
to call the police?

213
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,020
If it comes to that, sure.

214
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,772
But right now...

215
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,150
we have more pressing concerns.

216
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,777
You keep saying "we."

217
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,199
[chuckling] Well, you.

218
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,328
Like it or not...

219
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,748
the business is yours now.

220
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,001
I have nothing to do with all of that.

221
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,378
You are the face now.

222
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:30,299
And nature abhors a vacuum.

223
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:37,098
You have to ensure a smooth transition
for all of Cornell's clients,

224
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,434
or it is going to be
straight up chaos for you.

225
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,107
-[radio static]
-[officer] Dispatch, car 77-0-5.

226
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,525
Sighting possible drunk.
Should we engage?

227
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,944
[dispatcher] <i>Is it our suspect?</i>

228
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,196
[officer] We've a black male,
but need verification.

229
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,781
[siren wailing]

230
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,662
[breathing heavily]

231
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,005
Good morning.
Is there a problem?

232
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,966
No. You tell me.
What's your name, son?

233
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,054
[panting] I'm just taking a walk.
Minding my business.

234
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,390
I need to see some ID.

235
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,808
To walk?

236
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,603
Turn around, take down your hoodie.

237
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,940
-May I ask why?
-Because I said so.

238
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,324
[sighs]

239
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,705
[phone beeps]

240
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,335
-Oh, shit. It is him!
-On the ground, now!

241
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,131
Hands behind your back.
Get on the ground, now!

242
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,348
I'm really sorry, guys.

243
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:03,976
{\an8}[officer] You're under arrest!

244
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,405
[groans]

245
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,700
{\an8}[dispatcher] <i>Car 7-7-0-5, come in.</i>

246
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,209
<i>Car 7-7-0-5, come in.</i>

247
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,590
{\an8}[screaming]

248
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,302
[panting]

249
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,114
Lemonade?

250
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,077
-Popular drink.
-And it still is.

251
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,039
That story in my file, too?

252
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,001
What story?

253
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,882
You know,
I don't believe everything I read?

254
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,804
I wanna hear you tell it.

255
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,482
[Misty] Summer of '95,

256
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:39,613
and every other car was playing either
"Shook Ones" or "Ice Cream."

257
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,993
I was hanging out
with my cousin, Cassandra.

258
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:51,125
My mother told us never to walk around
the neighborhood by ourselves...

259
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,254
but it was hot, and I was thirsty.

260
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:01,385
And she was taking way too long
talking to some cute boy.

261
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,429
So...

262
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:10,352
I went to Ruiz Bodega by myself
and got a lemonade.

263
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,397
When I got back, she was gone.

264
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:18,778
It took the cops two weeks
to find her body.

265
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,614
Disfigured, beaten.

266
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:30,039
The boy, Mike Jones,
ran a train on her with his crew.

267
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,086
Nobody snitched.

268
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,464
Cops didn't push.
They didn't really give a shit.

269
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:45,930
She was just another poor, worthless bitch
from the Polo Grounds.

270
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,640
[breathing heavily]

271
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,768
So that's why you became a cop?

272
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,896
I apply foot to ass,

273
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,149
and match lead for lead.

274
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,401
I put murderers in handcuffs.

275
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:04,198
I don't just seek justice,
I stalk it.

276
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,451
And that much should go in my record.

277
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,124
With your resume,
you could've been downtown years ago.

278
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:17,169
Hell, you could've been a fed,
but you chose to stay in Harlem.

279
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:20,840
I know this place,
I know the players...

280
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,843
and I can make a difference here.

281
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,345
Or use some
of those old school connections

282
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,973
to make a little money on the side,
like your partner.

283
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,100
I didn't know anything about Scarfe.

284
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,936
Or anything he was doing.

285
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,063
He didn't buy new clothes,

286
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:40,817
no new watch, no new girlfriend,
no loose talk, nothing.

287
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,195
But he'd been working
for Cottonmouth for years.

288
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,406
And I trusted him...

289
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,034
so I didn't see it.

290
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:51,245
And neither did anybody else
in this damn department.

291
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,539
So why do I get singled out for it?

292
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,041
Because you were the closest to him.

293
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,836
It's written all over your face.
Not seeing it bothered you, didn't it?

294
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,174
'Cause seeing is my thing, right?

295
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,510
That's what made me
such a good point guard.

296
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,180
'Cause I could see everything in my head.

297
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,808
I knew exactly where people were gonna be,

298
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,269
so I put the ball
right where it needed to go.

299
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,479
But you couldn't see Scarfe
for what he was.

300
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,024
Or were you blinded by your emotions?

301
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,401
[scoffs] You wouldn't say that
if I was a man.

302
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,653
-Oh, that is not true.
-Bullshit!

303
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,199
Male cops can screw cop groupies

304
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,992
in the back of their unmarked
or their RMP,

305
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,369
and you guys cheer.

306
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,123
They get drunk
and fight each other in the parking lot,

307
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,334
and it's called blowing off steam.

308
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,378
There's always a double standard.

309
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,922
[inhales] And you never screwed anyone

310
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,883
that you shouldn't have
while you were on the job?

311
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,178
No.

312
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,888
But you choked out a witness.

313
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,100
Own your shit.

314
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:59,771
You went renegade
when you went after Luke Cage alone.

315
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,815
And it got...
[scoffs]

316
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,692
way deeper than it should have.

317
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:09,281
And this guy took the control
away from you when he took your gun.

318
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,825
[gasps]

319
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,619
Then you're in a room
alone with Miss Temple,

320
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,954
and she insults you,
and you lost control...

321
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,165
and you know it.

322
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,048
I need a break.

323
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,560
[exhales deeply]

324
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,407
[indistinct chatter]

325
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,039
[saw whirring]

326
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,374
[Mariah] What happened in here?

327
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,087
You know what happened here.
Same as you.

328
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,677
Sorry to hear about Cornell.

329
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,471
Hope they get that bastard.

330
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,014
He's bad for business.

331
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:19,476
Well, yeah, I'm not here
to talk about Luke Cage.

332
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,772
Well, it took a lot for you to walk
through those doors without your people.

333
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,942
<i>Chico,</i> please.

334
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,529
I was from around here
long before you even knew what that was.

335
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:37,953
Besides, we all contribute to this city,
one way or another.

336
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,206
Contribute?

337
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,920
I never trusted your cousin...
and I trust you even less.

338
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,382
Pretending to rise
to the right side of the law.

339
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,344
Girl, I know where you're from.

340
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,762
That stank don't come off too easy.

341
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,811
The thing my cousin built
needs to continue.

342
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,063
And you're gonna be the one to run it?

343
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:08,234
No. I need help.

344
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:11,612
Me?

345
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,364
Not just you.

346
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,451
Cornell had steady customers.

347
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,578
[Domingo chuckles]

348
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,955
Not everybody liked your cousin.

349
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,457
I mean, God respect the dead.

350
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,253
Yeah, he got it done
without a lot of needless violence.

351
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,924
I want everybody to come to the table
so I can discuss a transition.

352
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,386
Maybe even a buyout.

353
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,850
There was something dangerous
behind your eyes...

354
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,687
and this is it, huh?

355
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,815
Cornell was who he was.

356
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,442
I want something different.

357
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,781
I don't want to have
to look over my shoulder, Domingo.

358
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,284
Gather all the bosses.

359
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,412
I have a proposition
that will benefit us all.

360
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,167
[inhales sharply]
So who gets an invitation?

361
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,170
[breathing deeply]

362
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,256
Jacques Alef with the Macoute...

363
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,052
Neville Barnwell with the Yardies.

364
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,346
Juan Carlos Castro with the Cubanos...

365
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:24,059
And the Chinese, they got their own thing
going on downtown,

366
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,728
but Peter Hong with the Koreans...

367
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,731
he might wanna holla.

368
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,066
When?

369
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,860
Oh, that's gonna take me a few days.

370
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,862
Tonight.

371
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,474
[softly] Abalone shells.

372
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,286
[sighs]

373
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,555
[Luke whispering] Claire.
Claire.

374
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,974
[groaning]

375
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,645
[softly] Everybody's looking for you.
How did you not get caught?

376
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,439
-He shot you again?
-[groans]

377
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,443
Ugh!

378
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:59,946
Why in the hell is this guy
trying to kill you so bad?

379
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:04,075
He's even going through the trouble of
using bullets that could actually do it.

380
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,329
Willis was my, uh...

381
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,664
my best friend.

382
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,251
He's, uh...
He's delusional.

383
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,211
Delusional and pissed.
Let me see.

384
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,383
[groaning]

385
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,051
[police sirens wailing in distance]

386
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,055
[Claire] Ugh, your wound
is getting infected.

387
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,473
-[grunts]
-This looks bad.

388
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,896
-Who are you?
-What do you mean?

389
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,399
[sighs] I should say,
"What are you?"

390
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:41,322
I'm looking at your cells
and I've never seen anything like it.

391
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:45,409
I've been looking up sea shells to better
understand the structure of your skin.

392
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,994
Like I said...

393
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,497
you're amazing.

394
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,874
Only one man knows the science.

395
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,962
And I am not going back to prison.

396
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,215
And is his name
Dr. Noah Burstein?

397
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:05,554
[sighs] You gave me Reva's hard drive,
remember?

398
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,765
-Do you talk to him?
-No.

399
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,767
Reva kept tabs...

400
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,812
just in case someone got cute.

401
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,485
But I am not ready to reopen that door.

402
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,323
I don't think that you have
very much choice.

403
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,575
We need to get you out of here.

404
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,286
My mom has a car.

405
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:31,788
And we haven't totaled that one yet.

406
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,875
[chuckles and groans]

407
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,629
[Alex] Excuse me.

408
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,008
Excuse me?
Madam Councilwoman?

409
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,926
Not anymore.

410
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,222
Have you seen the emails?
The interview requests?

411
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,099
Even Thembi Wallace
wants another sit-down.

412
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,226
Never.

413
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,271
Can I show you something?

414
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,860
Hit the news about 20 minutes ago.

415
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,988
He attacked two cops and stole their cars.

416
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,741
-Cage?
-The cops are alive.

417
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:11,953
They GPS'd the car,
but someone leaked the footage.

418
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,039
It was too hot to hold back.

419
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,750
-[man screaming]
-[thuds]

420
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,379
Huh. [chuckles]

421
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,507
It's amazing.

422
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,177
I know it's tough seeing the man
that killed your cousin.

423
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,056
[Mariah sighs]

424
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:36,186
They'll get him, Alex.
Justice will prevail.

425
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:43,359
You know, Cornell taught me to be strong,
so I will be strong.

426
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,279
People understand the threat...

427
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,116
the kind of person you're up against.

428
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,495
They're not talking about the money,
or where it came from.

429
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,790
I think if you play this right,

430
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,418
you could have supporters
with even deeper pockets behind you,

431
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,712
who see this as a political issue,

432
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:05,841
and see your cousin as a brave man
who stood up to a freak.

433
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:11,304
You would use my personal tragedy
for strategic political advantage?

434
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,852
-Madam Councilwoman, I--
-I taught you well.

435
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,525
Go home, Alex.
I'm letting you off early.

436
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,654
[Alex] Thank you.

437
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:49,801
What happened out there...
that bothers you the most?

438
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,471
I lost my gun.

439
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,430
Other than that,
I wouldn't say it bothered me.

440
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,852
I saw your hand shake the first time
you looked at this photo. Why?

441
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:13,992
Because I remembered
seeing myself see myself...

442
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,663
wondering what I would look like
in a casket.

443
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,168
I mean, how the hell did I get there?

444
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:27,213
He got the drop on me.
How in the hell did he do that?

445
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,758
I could have disarmed him,
like, ten different ways.

446
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,886
Why didn't I do any of that?

447
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,181
I couldn't help anybody,
not even my damn self.

448
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:41,394
He shoved my gun in my face...

449
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,979
and I froze.

450
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,775
And you know what I thought about?

451
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:51,697
I thought about Pop's funeral.
I thought about my own funeral.

452
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,199
I thought about my father,

453
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,743
and what people would think about me.

454
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,788
And this guy...

455
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,545
this guy was smiling...

456
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,507
[voice breaking]
while he was toying with my life.

457
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:13,384
It was fun for him.

458
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:20,141
I didn't have control,

459
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,604
and maybe I never did.

460
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:27,273
And when Claire
was talking sideways about me,

461
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:30,694
all I wanted to do
was take my control back.

462
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,251
Oh, my God.

463
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,169
[exhales] What have I done?

464
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,462
[inhales sharply]

465
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:51,882
[sniffles]

466
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,468
It's like anything else
you've learned on the job.

467
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,804
It's ugly...

468
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,556
but you can't move your gaze.

469
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:04,227
You have to look...
and learn.

470
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,648
That's how you get answers.

471
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,319
That's how you win.

472
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,327
[sighs heavily]

473
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,837
[groaning]

474
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,632
[Luke breathing heavily]

475
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,846
-[Luke] It's getting harder to breathe.
-[exhales]

476
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,639
-[groans] These wounds are kicking my ass.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

477
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:26,392
You know, it passed before,
it's gonna pass again, okay?

478
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,853
I promise.

479
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,105
Can I get that
with the money-back guarantee?

480
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,273
-[both chuckle]
-[grunts]

481
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,692
Breathe.

482
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,443
[breathing deeply]

483
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,114
See? You got this.

484
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,705
What if this is a one-way trip?

485
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,290
Hey, hey, you are gonna make it.

486
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,377
You hear me?
You're gonna make it just fine.

487
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,713
We're gonna fix this.

488
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,131
Don't even.

489
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,674
-You're not dying in my mom's car.
-[chuckles]

490
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,135
Okay?

491
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,054
[sighs]

492
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,855
It's the part you can't fix
that's bothering me.

493
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,607
What do you mean?

494
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,651
Willis.

495
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,238
Willis Stryker.
He thinks he's my brother.

496
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,616
Diamondback.

497
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:30,081
He's... he's gotta be lying
about my father. He's...

498
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,877
He's... He can't be my brother.

499
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,200
[knocking on door]

500
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,419
[Claire] Hi.
Sorry to ring so late.

501
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,839
My name is Sandra Lopez.

502
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:23,134
I'm currently majoring in prison studies
at Boston University, and, uh,

503
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,677
I was just wondering
if I could ask you

504
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,013
a few questions
about your time at Seagate.

505
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,099
My friend said that you worked there?

506
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,766
Your friend was mistaken.

507
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,520
-What friend?
-Carl Lucas.

508
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,398
I don't know anybody by that name.

509
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,444
He's alive, Doc.

510
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,072
-That's impossible.
-Your experiment worked.

511
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,157
It changed him.

512
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,202
Changed how?

513
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,122
You should see for yourself.

514
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,916
-He's here?
-Yes.

515
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,879
Where is he?

516
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,187
What's up, Doc?

517
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,107
I've always wanted to say that.

518
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,692
Let's get him out of here.

519
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,279
-[groaning]
-Put him on the couch.

520
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,031
[Claire] Come on.
Just a few more steps.

521
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,033
-[Luke groaning]
-[Claire] Easy, easy.

522
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,576
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

523
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,787
Breathe.

524
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,207
Breathe. Okay.

525
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,293
[Luke sighs]

526
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,713
You've got no scars.
Nothing.

527
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,383
That lab was totally destroyed.

528
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,843
You mean it worked?

529
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,847
Yes... and no.

530
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,977
Until last night...
[breathing heavily]

531
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,814
I was bulletproof.

532
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,568
Jesus Christ, kid.
What did this to you?

533
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,738
They shot me with some crazy bullets.

534
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,740
They exploded inside of him.

535
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,742
[Burstein] He should be dead.

536
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,163
My skin is now tough...
like armor.

537
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,123
I think maybe what makes him stronger

538
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,834
is also pushing the shrapnel
deeper into his organs.

539
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,755
Trust me, it is impossible
to cut into his skin.

540
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,510
Look, I don't know what it is
that you think I can do for you.

541
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,888
My lab is not my lab anymore.
I wouldn't know where to begin.

542
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:34,682
What if we can help you with that?

543
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,726
Reva took this.

544
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,104
[Burstein gasps]

545
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,524
She shouldn't have done that. [sighs]

546
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,696
Can you unlock it?

547
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:56,746
[sighs]

548
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,753
[Burstein] Oh, my God.

549
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,173
It's all here. Everything.

550
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:08,758
Everything you need?

551
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,553
Everything I lost.
So much more....

552
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,097
[Claire sighs]

553
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,058
Reva died for this, didn't she?

554
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,936
Luke refuses to talk about it.

555
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,398
[coughing]

556
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,068
[Claire] You okay?

557
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,365
[gasps]

558
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,201
[Luke groans] They're killing me.

559
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,247
Doc, you figure this shit out.

560
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,391
[Luke groaning]

561
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,975
[Burstein] Watch your step.

562
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,773
-All right. Can you stand a second?
-[Claire] I got him.

563
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,571
[Claire] Okay.
[Luke] All right.

564
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,659
[breathing heavily]
What is all this stuff?

565
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,745
[Burstein] During the cover-up,
I stole whatever I could.

566
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,082
[Luke] What cover-up?

567
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,167
They couldn't advertise Rackham's death,

568
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,001
or the explosion
that supposedly killed you,

569
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:28,629
or Reva's data dump,
so they... they killed the whole thing.

570
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,051
-Here, let's set him down.
-[breathing heavily]

571
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,219
I was so close to a breakthrough.

572
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,221
That all ended when they thought
you were dead.

573
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,640
-[all groaning]
-[Burstein] I started again from scratch,

574
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:43,103
but never came close
to replicating the Seagate incident.

575
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,813
[stammers] I'm a nurse.
I know the drill. I can help.

576
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,608
[Luke groans]

577
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,735
Why me?

578
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,238
Why did you pick me?

579
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,532
Because you were strong.
Stronger than most.

580
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,951
[Luke] That's not what Reva said.

581
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,037
She said she begged you to do it.

582
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,167
There's more to it than that,
and you know it.

583
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:09,504
She begged me, but you were
already tabbed for the program.

584
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,842
-Didn't Reva tell you about this?
-No.

585
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,512
That's not gonna do anything.

586
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,557
-[Burstein grunts]
-[scalpel snaps]

587
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,269
Oh, my God.

588
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,814
Look, I gotta get a blood sample
to cross check with Reva's data.

589
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:32,026
Your DNA may be the X factor
that made this whole thing work.

590
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,363
-You mean, it could only work for Luke?
-[Burstein] Yeah, maybe.

591
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,824
This wound is too septic
to get a decent sample.

592
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,951
Are you saying
you can't recreate what you did?

593
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,789
It's not as straightforward as that.
You know, penicillin, the X-ray machine...

594
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,374
[groans]

595
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,419
[Burstein] ...the smallpox vaccine,
pacemaker, even... even...

596
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,545
even Viagra.

597
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,839
Those were accidents.
It's the same with Carl.

598
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,309
This could work.

599
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,270
If you go down his throat...

600
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,607
We can puncture his mucus membrane.

601
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,401
-Exactly.
-I like the way you think.

602
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,071
I don't.

603
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:19,574
Sorry.

604
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,744
All right. Put your head back.
Just open your mouth.

605
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,997
I'll try to make this quick.

606
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:30,793
Breathe through your nose.

607
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,592
[groaning]

608
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,928
[Burstein] Easy, easy.
Oh, here we go.

609
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,389
[Burstein] It's working.

610
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,863
[Ridley] You see that?

611
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,619
-That's my shield.
-No, no, no.

612
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,580
That's not your shield.

613
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,583
That shield belongs
to the city of New York and its people.

614
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:13,836
And when you lose control,

615
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,756
go upside somebody's head
because you had a bad day...

616
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,550
or you feel powerless...

617
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,888
-or you screw the wrong person--
-I didn't screw anybody.

618
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,306
Come on, now.

619
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:35,525
You don't deserve to represent
the people of New York,

620
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,192
let alone protect them.

621
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:39,737
That's not true and you know it.

622
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,863
I do.

623
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,327
Look, we're wired differently.

624
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,372
We run towards gunfire.

625
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,082
We drink when we're sad.
We screw when we're mad.

626
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:56,754
And people hate us until they need us.

627
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,257
And I hate that.

628
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,846
But I love it, too.

629
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,729
[Ridley] We walk a higher path.

630
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,776
It's not simple.
It's very hard.

631
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,363
And that is why
people will always need us.

632
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,918
Hero of Harlem, my ass.

633
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:39,839
[sighs]

634
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:46,220
Look, if we're talking about a right path,
it's not just about Luke Cage.

635
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:52,142
You haven't even acknowledged the guy
that held a gun to my head last night.

636
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,811
We will find out who that is.

637
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,646
And we still need
to talk about Mariah Dillard.

638
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,732
She is not innocent in all this.

639
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,568
Look, Mariah's not on the run for murder,
assaulting two police officers.

640
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:06,156
I need you to focus
on bringing in Luke Cage.

641
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,038
Bullets bounce right off of him.

642
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,709
Reason is the only thing
that's gonna work.

643
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:21,088
And it has to come
from somebody he trusts.

644
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,840
[Ridley chuckles]

645
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,385
[laughs]

646
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,267
Go get him.

647
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,996
You ready for this?

648
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,207
Like I said, ready as ever.

649
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,293
You need to understand where you are here.

650
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,298
If they sense any weakness,
any hesitation...

651
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,801
you're not just done politically...

652
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,511
you're done permanently.

653
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,527
You're late.

654
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:28,739
I'm not.
Looks like I'm right on time.

655
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,450
Wagwan?

656
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:37,540
Now that my cousin is gone,
I'm making a few changes.

657
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:41,418
I loved my cousin,
but I didn't like what he did.

658
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,003
Until he stopped serving you.

659
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:47,049
Cut the crap, lady.
What do you want to tell us?

660
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,385
I'm out.

661
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:57,434
My family is no longer to be associated
with what you all do.

662
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,855
I need to move
in a more legitimate direction.

663
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:01,939
[Jacques] Need?

664
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,774
That's a weak hand you're playing.

665
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:07,277
My cousin has valuable assets
and connections.

666
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,406
I'll give them to you...
for a price.

667
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,287
-And you walk away?
-I walk away.

668
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,582
Why do I find that hard to believe?

669
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:23,544
Because you're smart and stupid
at the same time.

670
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,131
Diamondback, what are you doing here?

671
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,716
You invited me...

672
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,635
by not inviting me.

673
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,893
-Excuse me?
-Now, Peter...

674
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,187
when you don't buy my wares,
or Jacques...

675
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,817
when you get them at a cheaper price
from my competitors,

676
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,778
you're messing with my money.

677
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,738
And that pisses me off.

678
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,823
-[gunshot]
-[Jacques] Hey, man!

679
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,660
[grunting]

680
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:03,834
[Stryker] Anybody else not made it
to confessional this week?

681
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:07,254
-[men breathing heavily]
-Your men outside are dead.

682
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,049
Your greed superseded your common sense.

683
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:14,303
So now, I have the pulpit.

684
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,643
Rich men, camel and needles.

685
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:22,895
What do you want?

686
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,230
Hey, Neville...

687
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,025
[in mock Jamaican accent]
if you wanna test me...

688
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,236
[stammering] Ease up, man.
I got no hackle with you now.

689
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,615
-We'll listen what you have to say.
-Don't bother.

690
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,577
Just by being here,
you're already dead.

691
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,829
-[gunshot]
-[groans]

692
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,414
Two for the price of one.

693
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,291
[Domingo] What are you doing, man?

694
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,919
You're gonna start a war.

695
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,297
"And then many will fall away,

696
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:55,678
and they will betray each other
and hate one another.

697
00:50:55,761 --> 00:51:00,432
And many false prophets will arise
and lead many astray.

698
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,645
But the one who endures to the end...

699
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,773
he will be saved."

700
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,192
[Domingo] You're crazy.

701
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:20,119
Crazy would be leaving you alive
to run a very profitable drug business.

702
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,124
But I got no beef with your cousins
down south of the border...

703
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,168
so today is your lucky day.

704
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,672
But you...

705
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,924
You...

706
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,802
you're full of crazy.

707
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,015
I just killed four people, and...

708
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,268
you didn't even flinch.

709
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,855
You don't scare me.

710
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:50,607
No...

711
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,110
I don't think I do.

712
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,740
Tell me why we should be friends.

713
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,040
Luke Cage.

714
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,376
Clearly, we both have issues with him.

715
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:14,089
I heard he killed your cousin.
Allegedly.

716
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:18,468
Rest assured, I will end him
when the time is right.

717
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,680
But the time is not right.

718
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:25,392
Have you even seen the dashboard footage
that's all over the news?

719
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,187
You don't you see the opportunity?

720
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:32,775
You see a man you want dead who won't die.

721
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,111
I see a marketer's dream.

722
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,239
Why spend all your time

723
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:42,952
killing and intimidating
your criminal customers in the dark

724
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:47,456
when you should be selling guns
to police departments in the light?

725
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,500
Guns that can handle these new threats.

726
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,549
Go on.

727
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,265
Word is you have a weapon
that can take him down.

728
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,810
Kill Luke Cage.

729
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,732
But if you do, and you go big,

730
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:16,026
everyone else will come to you

731
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,738
to help take down
the rest of these super-freaks

732
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:22,116
that are upsetting
the natural order of things.

733
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,576
You gotta go big pharma on this shit.

734
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,915
You invent the disease,
then you sell the cure.

735
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,001
[chuckles]

736
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,922
Oh, Shades, now I see you were right.

737
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,763
I like how she thinks.

738
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,431
And who better to broker the deals, hmm?

739
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,476
No. No, I'm out of this.

740
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,896
[Stryker] No...
You're in...

741
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:55,732
way into this...

742
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,402
until I decide otherwise.

743
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,695
Domingo.

744
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,075
Sorry about the mess, <i>hermano.</i>

745
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:09,163
But I have no doubt...

746
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:11,957
you have people that can clean up.

747
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:14,084
Why am I still alive, man?

748
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:18,047
[Stryker] 'Cause no one's coming at me.

749
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:21,216
They'll ask around, so tell 'em...

750
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,804
I'll murderize everything in sight.

751
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:28,808
'Cause I don't care and I won't quit.

752
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:32,269
You can't bargain with me.

753
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,023
You buy or you die.

754
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,069
[Stryker sighs]

755
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,280
You think Peter Luger's is still open?

756
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,758
[R&B song playing]

757
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,601
[singing]

758
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,348
[inaudible]

759
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:06,113
That footage of Cage and the cops?
It went viral.

760
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,531
What do you want to do about it?

761
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,951
That's great...
That's great.

762
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,703
He's got nowhere to run now.
We'll find him.

763
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:17,249
-It's all coming together.
-But there's gonna be a--

764
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,583
Shh!

765
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,878
I like this song.

766
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,880
[R&B song continues]

767
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:42,899
[song continues]

768
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:25,734
[Burstein] We were working on creating
this artificial skin for burn victims.

769
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,487
We used a process called CRISPR

770
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,865
to fuse the subject's DNA
with another DNA to gain its attributes.

771
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,284
The foreign DNA
was abalone shell, wasn't it?

772
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:37,037
Uh, yeah.
Where did you do your residency?

773
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:43,418
145th Street. Um...
and my fellowship in Hell's Kitchen.

774
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,131
Well, you're correct.

775
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:51,676
We already used abalone to build
better combat equipment for soldiers.

776
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,472
And to genetically enhance
the durability, pliability,

777
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,766
and healing properties of human epidermis.

778
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,811
Okay, so why are these bullets
penetrating his skin then?

779
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,147
Are they dipped in something?

780
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,566
Uh, well, perhaps.

781
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,277
But more likely
because of what they were made from.

782
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,904
You see, uh,
abalone is nearly impenetrable, but...

783
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:11,989
[Claire] Right.

784
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,533
...its stacked plates can be pushed apart
under the right circumstances.

785
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,243
[Luke] Like what?

786
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,702
Hey.

787
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:21,581
[stammers] During the experiment,
your skin cells were bonded

788
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:25,252
with hydrogen covalent bonds
at the exact point of acidity,

789
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,672
-temperature and saline concentration...
-English, please.

790
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:32,051
Well, see, I can replicate
exactly the acidity

791
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:34,428
and the saline portions of the experiment

792
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,680
with the information
that's on the Reva drive that you brought.

793
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,766
But the...
the wild card is the temperature.

794
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,312
Because of what Albert Rackham did,
turning up the heat on the bath,

795
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:47,982
I have no gauge as to the temperature
that catalyzed the experiment.

796
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:51,736
How are you going
to get this stuff out of me?

797
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,155
Right. Uh... [sighs]

798
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:57,701
Imagine that your skin
works like a form of Velcro,

799
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,370
uh, under a sort of lock and key.

800
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:03,123
And in order to cut through it,
he's got to weaken the lock and key,

801
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:05,500
so we can remove the shrapnel.

802
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,544
-How do you plan to do that?
-[Claire sighs]

803
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,839
Uh, I'm going to dip your skin
in boiling acid,

804
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,050
and then, uh, remove the shrapnel.

805
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,143
What? I've tried it with animals.

806
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:25,062
He's putting me in a rotisserie spit?

807
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,731
Um...

808
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,691
I think he wants to deep fry you...

809
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,027
like a turkey.

810
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:36,115
Now, look, we're only gonna have
a short window to do this, uh,

811
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,200
before your skin closes up again.

812
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:43,413
Just so we're clear,
what could go wrong?

813
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,459
[Burstein] Well, your... your skin
could peel off like wax paper, and, uh,

814
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,878
after about ten seconds,
you'd beg me to put a bullet in your head

815
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,338
because the pain would be so bad.
But your...

816
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:55,550
your head looks fine, so I... I guess
the bullet would ricochet off your skull.

817
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,010
[Claire sighs]

818
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,472
Sweet Christmas.

819
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,445
If the procedure gets too painful,

820
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:18,448
just raise your hand in a fist
and I'll shut it down, okay?

821
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:19,824
Like this?

822
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,744
-Right on.
-[Luke chuckles]

823
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,374
You trust this dude?

824
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,293
Hell no.

825
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:30,710
[breathing heavily]

826
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:35,089
If anything happens to me,
if anything goes wrong,

827
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:37,759
make sure he doesn't keep Reva's data.

828
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:40,345
It cannot fall into the wrong hands.

829
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:42,597
I don't care if you have to kill him.

830
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:47,060
I got you.
But let's not go there, okay?

831
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,853
I'm serious.

832
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:51,273
-It's too dangerous.
-[sighs]

833
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,568
We can't have guys like me
running around on every corner.

834
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,986
What are you talking about?

835
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,573
There's nobody like you.

836
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,289
All right, let's go.

837
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,915
[Claire] Okay, okay.

838
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,508
[air hissing]

839
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,096
Good? Okay.

840
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,273
Good.

841
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,908
[Burstein] Keep your hands clear.
[Claire] Yeah.

842
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:46,119
[Burstein] All right. Down.

843
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:53,335
Hang in there.

844
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,296
It's going to be okay.

845
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,382
[muffled screaming]

846
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:15,064
How long do we keep him down?

847
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:19,110
I don't know.
Just have to let the acid do its work.

848
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,658
-Now?
-Not yet.

849
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,200

01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,790
What are you doing?

852
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:37,003
He's not ready yet.

853
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,591
All right. Hold on.

854
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,396
Damn it.

855
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,941
-Dip him again.
-What?

856
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,360
Again! Again!

857
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:06,783
One more.

01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:25,510
Why isn't it working?

[Claire] We're losing him!
[Burstein] It's not working!
