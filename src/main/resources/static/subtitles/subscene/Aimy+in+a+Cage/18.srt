00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,870
<i>Episode 18</i>

20
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,190
Miss, you told me to pay more attention to Wu Hong Da's case.

21
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,960
The police have re-opened the case for investigation now.

22
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,090
Wasn't this case already closed? Why are they investigating it again?

23
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,760
Rumor has it that there is new evidence

24
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,160
that can prove that Zhou Shao Tian has the same pen as Wu Hong Da.

25
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,040
I know.

26
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,350
Make a point of keeping an eye on it. Do not go wrong.

27
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,900
By the way,

28
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,700
Zhou Shao Tian should be back today, right?

29
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,930
Call that whatever Ma Li here

30
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,590
and let him bring this news to Zhou Shao Tian.

31
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,550
Ask Zhou Shao Tian what he should do.

32
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,460
Miss. Why are you thinking on his behalf?

33
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,380
Thinking about him is also for our own good.

34
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,870
Miss Lu. Two policemen are here to find Zhao Shao Tian.

35
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,910
Okay, you may leave.

36
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,240
Dear Sirs. Why are you here?

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,480
Miss Lu. The Director asked us to invite Zhou Shao Tian to the police station.

38
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,140
It's a grave matter and we have offended you but please cooperate.

39
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,840
Tell us where he went and when he's coming back.

40
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,080
You sirs looking for Zhou Shao Tian, I don't dare interfere.

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,790
However, Mister Zhou went out of town.

42
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,460
Regarding when he's returning, I really don't know.

43
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,270
- This... <br> - Then you should at least know where he went?

44
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,320
Mister Zhou was sick and rested for half a month.

45
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,380
So he has a lot of things to do and hasn't seen a lot of people.

46
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,280
This time, I'm sure he has to go a lot of places

47
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,530
and meet a lot of clients.

48
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,190
As for where he is right now,

49
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,670
I really don't know.

50
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,390
Miss Lu, we are only following orders. Just be honest with us.

51
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,650
If not, others will think that you are an accomplice.

52
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,850
What do you mean? Is Miss Lu someone who would be an accomplice?

53
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,380
Miss Lu, please forgive us.

54
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,280
But if you put it this way,

55
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,100
you are making it hard to do our work.

56
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,360
By saying this,

57
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,350
you are saying that I'm delaying your investigation?

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,310
You are implicating me. I'm a weak woman. I really can't handle this.

59
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,260
It's like this. Mr Zhou

60
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,540
will only be back on the following day.

61
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,790
You should also know that there is chaos in the military now.

62
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,330
What if there is no peace?

63
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,510
Of course, I wish for peace too.

64
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,700
Even if everything was peaceful and things were well,

65
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,070
weather can be unpredictable.

66
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,510
Strong winds and rain could delay him two days.

67
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,820
Okay then. We will go back first and report to our Director first.

68
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,010
We can only do this.

69
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,620
Miss Lu, if Mr Zhou returns,

70
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,820
please let us know immediately.

71
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,260
But of course. Take care, I won't be seeing you off.

72
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,400
We are leaving.

73
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,970
Giddy up.

74
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,470
Giddy up.

75
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,570
Brother!

76
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,910
Ah Li, why are you here?

77
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,640
- Brother, you can't go into the city now. <br>- Why? What's going on?

78
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,580
This is a letter from Miss Lu. She insisted that I must stop you.

79
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,820
You must not go into the city.

80
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,940
Ah Li. I won't be going into the city for the time being.

81
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,840
I'll go to the lake for the next two days.

82
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,570
Relay this message to Miss Lu.

83
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,220
- Okay, Brother. <br>- Thank her on my behalf.

84
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,020
Okay.

85
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,190
Cai Hong.

86
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,140
Wu Cai Hong.

87
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,540
- Sorry. <br>- It's okay.

88
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,720
I... would like to take leave.

89
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,200
I would like to go home for a while.

90
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,020
Even though Brother Shao Tiao bought my famiy home for us

91
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,490
before there is any conclusion in the investigation,

92
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,890
I would like Cai Yun and my stepmom to move out.

93
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,170
I will go with you.

94
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,820
Master, you died wrongly.

95
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,750
Zhou Shao Tian, you ungrateful (person)!

96
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,410
You said you would be promoted and not be poor. You wanted to be betrothed.

97
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,910
You did such a toxic thing and even tricked Cai Hong's feelings.

98
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,040
What is our family to do now?

99
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,980
Stepmom, stop crying. There is no evidence now that Brother Shao Tian is the killer.

100
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,440
Before the conclusion of the investigation, I think we should leave here.

101
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,020
Cai Yu and I are going to pack our stuff.

102
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,820
Stop crying, Stepmom.

103
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,540
This is the Wu's family home. I moved in when I married your father.

104
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,200
I have already been kicked out once and I have to leave again.

105
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,520
I'm not moving out.

106
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,350
If Zhou Shao Tian is really the killer, then the money used to buy the house

107
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,890
will be stained with father's blood. Mom, do you still want to live here?

108
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,580
The money didn't belong to your father.

109
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,270
This is the Wu's family home.

110
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,710
I want to protect this place. I want to help him to safeguard it.

111
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,360
Even if you tell me to die, I won't move out. I want to live here until I die.

112
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,500
Cai Yun, what do you think?

113
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,700
If Mom doesn't want to move out, I won't either. I already don't have a father.

114
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,820
I want to be with Mom.

115
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,720
That's right. Cai Yun will follow me.

116
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,110
We are not moving out.

117
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,310
We will live here till we die.

118
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:53,530
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

119
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,320
It's normal that they can't accept the truth.

120
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,930
It's even hard for me to accept it too. It's hard to accept the result.

121
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,670
It's even more so for my stepmom and sister.

122
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,930
When Zhou Shao Tian returns in two days,

123
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,400
everything will become clear.

124
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:34,080
But, us three, already moved out of the house once.

125
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,580
If this time, I let Cai Yun

126
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,830
and my stepmom move out again, my stepmom definitely won't be able to take it.

127
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,850
Don't worry about this. I can buy over the house.

128
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,530
I will deduct the money from the sale of the house from your salary.

129
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,980
Miss. Ma Li is back.

130
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,560
Miss Lu.

131
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,860
So what? You met Zhou Shao Tian? What did he say?

132
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,050
My brother would like to thank you for this news.

133
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,950
He is temporarily living in Chang Xing.

134
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,280
Could Miss Lu do another favour for my brother?

135
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,780
Why does he need me to help him with his problems again?

136
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,110
My brother said that you have a wide connection.

137
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,330
He requested that you get him a similar Parker pen as Jiang Yu's as soon as possible.

138
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,200
Otherwise my brother will jump into the Yellow River

139
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,010
instead of being a fugitive.

140
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,050
Don't think that highly of me. Do I have that wide of a connection?

141
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,430
A 18K Parker fountain pen? That is not a toy.

142
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,850
Even more so, he wants me to find the exact same model.

143
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,920
Miss Lu, I'm begging you. You must help my brother.

144
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,330
My brother has been framed. He can't bear the title of murderer.

145
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:20,380
I can guarantee that he didn't kill Mr. Wu.

146
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,090
Whether your brother has been framed or not, it's the police's job to investigate.

147
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,600
My words don't count.

148
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,650
Miss Lu, please. I'm bowing to you.

149
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,210
Enough. Go back first and wait.

150
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,890
If I have any news, Uncle Lai will contact you.

151
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,640
Thank you, Miss Lu.

152
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,730
Thank you.

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,210
Uncle Lai.

154
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,200
I remember that he seemed to have a confidant.

155
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,390
He liked to receive expensive fountain pens.

156
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,830
Go and find him

157
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,630
and see if he can find a solution.

158
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,330
Yes, I will do it now.

159
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,700
<i>This is not an expensive gift</i>

160
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,200
<i>but I personally dyed it and</i>

161
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,300
<i>weaved it.</i>

162
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,660
<i>Also, you two are alike.</i>

163
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,670
<i>Its name is the same as yours.</i>

164
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,270
<i>It's just like a little rainbow.</i>

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,520
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

166
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,640
<i>Let's be together.</i>

167
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,510
<i>Let me take care of you.</i>

168
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,070
Instead of working, why are you dreaming early in the morning?

169
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,810
Hey.

170
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,670
I only knocked into you lightly

171
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,700
and you are on the ground and can't get up.

172
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,100
Stop pretending.

173
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,900
Fei Fei, what are you doing?

174
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,990
She was slacking off.

175
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,050
I only said a few words to her.

176
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,460
Are you okay?

177
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,790
Brother, where are you going?

178
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,740
We still have important business to discuss in the afternoon.

179
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,540
I already discussed about that business.

180
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,270
You can just greet Boss He and it will be fine

181
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,230
Why did you take my water bucket? I still need to get water for Granny Gu.

182
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,200
Where is the water?

183
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,180
Don't drag me.

184
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,000
Let go.

185
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,220
Jiang Yu. Where are you taking me?

186
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,610
Slow down. Be careful.

187
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,430
Why did you bring me here?

188
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,350
Boatman.

189
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,560
I want to rent your boat.

190
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,540
-How much? <br>-One silver dollar.

191
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,490
This is for you

192
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,870
but I only want your boat. You can take a rest.

193
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,360
Okay.

194
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,640
This way, please.

195
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,650
Get on.

196
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,740
Do you know to row the boat?

197
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,350
I don't want to fall into the water.

198
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,230
Get in when I tell you to.

199
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,590
Cut the nonsense.

200
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,460
Don't be afraid.

201
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,830
I have also gone through supporting a family of three

202
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,070
by being a ferry boatman.

203
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:18,460
I think that after have you found out about Zhou Shao Tian,

204
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,570
you haven't been happy.

205
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,340
My dad is dead.

206
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,970
It's very possible that he was the most trusted person

207
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,260
who killed him.

208
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,260
How could I be happy about this?

209
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,320
I understand.

210
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,590
You won't be able to understand.

211
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:55,110
That kind of hurt was inflicted by someone whom you regarded as family.

212
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,740
You will never understand it.

213
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,140
By the way,

214
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,020
you said that, in the past, you rowed boats

215
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,340
to support your family of three.

216
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,250
But looking at Madam Jiang,

217
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,630
her decent and generous behavior,

218
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,560
as if she came from a scholarly family.

219
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,990
How could it be possible that you worked

220
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,710
as a boatman?

221
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,690
The Jiang home, at that time, had only a little money.

222
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,640
Before that my father was a supporter of the foreign efforts movement.

223
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,720
He was a rich businessman

224
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,900
but he was sabotaged by someone later

225
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,950
and framed for housing opiates.

226
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,780
This resulted in my father's death.

227
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,970
The reason that the court officials gave us was that

228
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,860
my father committed suicide.

229
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,690
Something like this happened to your family.

230
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,080
No wonder you look this way - a face filled with depression.

231
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,060
Furthermore, you have a cold attitude.

232
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,780
When my father passed away, the factory was confiscated.

233
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,420
My house was occupied.

234
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,990
You could say that we went bankrupt overnight.

235
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:35,020
My mother couldn't face the situation and attempted suicide.

236
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,140
Fortunately, I was there and discovered it.

237
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,590
<i>Mom!</i>

238
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,090
It was really hard for us at that time.

239
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,290
To feed my family, I took on all kinds of jobs.

240
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,880
I would do them. When I was working as a boatman,

241
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,910
I had other jobs too.

242
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,240
I really didn't imagine that you had gone through such an experience.

243
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,730
Those days were really tough

244
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,840
but I continued to hang on

245
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,290
just to take revenge.

246
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,940
I can't let my father

247
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,350
wrongfully die.

248
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,660
I must punish those bad people severely.

249
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,870
Did you find those people who harmed your father?

250
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,500
Did you seek revenge already?

251
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,330
Before I could take revenge, that person died.

252
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,840
It was too easy for that bad guy then.

253
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,360
I had the same thought too

254
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,680
but I later found out that

255
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,940
perhaps God

256
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,950
- had arranged something else for me. <br>- What was it?

257
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,470
Perhaps, grudges and revenge should end in grudges and revenge.

258
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,340
Just like in this dirty pond,

259
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,470
such clean and pure flowers would even grow here.

260
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,730
It allows us to forget the unhappy things first.

261
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,870
Can you forget about the grudge towards the person who killed your father?

262
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,120
But thank you for bringing me to such a beautiful place.

263
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,170
After seeing such beautiful things,

264
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:39,610
I forgot about many unhappy things.

265
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:55,500
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

266
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,010
Boss Ke, take a look.

267
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,380
This is the product we created based on your request.

268
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,890
If there is no problem, we will start production at the factory.

269
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,530
-Of course. <br>-Also, if you have any suggestions, we can cater to that.

270
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,730
Not bad. It totally met my request.

271
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,470
Not even a small amount off.

272
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,220
It's good that you are satisfied.

273
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,560
I'm assured of Ling Long's products.

274
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,590
Why isn't Mr Jiang in the company today?

275
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,220
My brother was actually here waiting for your arrival but

276
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,910
he had an urgent matter and had no choice but to take care of it.

277
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,970
But he told me that

278
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,610
you are our valued client.

279
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,310
that I shouldn't carelessly treat you.

280
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,890
Mr Jiang is too formal. We have been friends for many years.

281
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,850
Don't mind this. To add further,

282
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,150
Miss Fang is Mr Jiang's most trusted person.

283
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,980
Furthermore, you are family.

284
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,820
Isn't it the same that you are here with me to see the product?

285
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,240
Boss Ke. Thank you for your compliment.

286
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,180
Not bad.

287
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,480
Brother. Where has you been for the whole day?

288
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,600
Did you go to the pond to appreciate the flowers?

289
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,550
Brother. You ignored such an important client like Boss Ke.

290
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:58,130
I represented you today. Can't you just answer me?

291
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,950
You are very smart.

292
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,150
With you taking care of Boss Ke, I don't have to worry.

293
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,420
But, don't you feel that

294
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,880
taking a woman to appreciate the flowers

295
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,840
would invite gossip?

296
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,630
Who would be such a busybody?

297
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,790
- Brother. <br> - Cai Hong.

298
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:19,000
Deliver these flowers to my mom.

299
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,940
Okay.

300
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,250
Brother.

301
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,600
Why is it so hard to see you lately?

302
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,710
I couldn't see you the whole day and I wondered what you are busy with.

303
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,210
I had some matters to settle.

304
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,530
Don't bother about what it is.

305
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,500
Does it concern Wu Cai Hong?

306
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,350
Brother. In your heart,

307
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,630
is Wu Cai Hong more important than the rest?

308
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,210
Ridiculous.

309
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,640
Miss, What you wanted is here.

310
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,680
So fast?

311
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,630
The head of the military said that

312
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,900
it's such a difficult task but you could do it so easily.

313
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,020
Uncle Lai.

314
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,760
Prepare a gift for me.

315
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,460
I'm going to visit Zhou Shao Tian's mother.

316
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,340
But the Zhou family has been watching you.

317
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,930
It's okay.

318
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,460
Don't worry. I know.

319
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,250
Miss, we are here.

320
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,270
Here.

321
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,200
Take your time.

322
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,550
Aunt Zhou, how are you? I'm Lu Man.

323
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,360
Did Mr Zhou mention me?

324
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,690
Hello.

325
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,940
Then...

326
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,230
Please come in.

Please have some tea, Miss Lu.

329
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,820
Aunt Zhou. You really don't need to go through all this trouble.

330
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,650
Shao Tian is not at home. You...

331
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,910
I know that he's not home, I came especially to visit you.

332
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,460
Shao Tian went on business because of work.

333
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,330
Thus, I brought you a gift. I hope you like it.

334
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,580
Shao Tian is not at home. If you need anything,

335
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,850
just let me know and I will help you.

336
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,570
You have been taking care of Shao Tian.

337
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:29,070
Well, for sharing your kind heart with me,

338
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,210
thank you very much, Miss Lu.

339
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,670
Aunt Zhou, you are being too formal.

340
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,220
Just call me Lu Man.

341
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,510
Please have your tea.

342
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,840
- Did you get scalded? <br>- I'm fine.

343
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,740
Aunt. Could I borrow a place

344
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,280
to clean my clothes?

345
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,350
Please come with me.

346
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,120
Miss Lu. This way, please.

347
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,870
This is Shao Tian's room. No one is here.

348
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:24,270
It's fairly clean, so please use it to clean yourself up.

349
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,510
I will have to trouble you then.

350
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,320
Please make yourself at home.

351
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,040
- Are you okay? <br>- I'm fine.

352
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,510
Aunt. Frankly, I'm here today

353
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,620
because I have something else to tell you.

354
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,990
Two days ago, the police came to find me.

355
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,690
They suspect Shao Tian of harming the boss of Ling Long.

356
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,230
Aunt, please don't worry.

357
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,510
I was afraid that you would be worried. Thus, I'm telling you in advance.

358
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,880
If the police were to come in a few days time to make inquiries,

359
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,000
please watch what you say.

360
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:12,450
Aunt, don't panic. I believe Shao Tian is not that kind of person.

361
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:17,320
There is no conclusion to the investigation now but after it's done, everything will be fine.

362
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,850
Aunt. If there is nothing else, I am leaving first.

363
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,420
<i>Man Mansion.</i>

364
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,840
Miss. You are back. Did it go smoothly?

365
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,570
With me taking care of it, is there anything I can't do?

366
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,940
Uncle Lai.

367
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,810
I came to warn you. Get him out of the city before the gates close.

368
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,630
Tell him to tell Zhou Shao Tian that I have done what he requested.

369
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,170
He can come back without any worries.

370
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,820
Yes, I will do it now.

371
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,220
Giddy up.

372
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,840
Stay here and don't go anywhere else.

373
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,800
- I'm going to tell Director Chen. <br>- Okay, go now.

374
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,570
I will keep watch here.

375
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,520
Shao Tian, you are back.

376
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,120
It's good that you are here. Your boss came.

377
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,940
It's Miss Lu.

378
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,840
She said that you are being investigated regarding Wu Hong Da's case. What's going on?

379
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,110
Did you kill someone?

380
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,120
Do you really hope to see your son as a killer? You are already finding me guilty.

381
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,690
No, I'm just asking you. Tell me.

382
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,800
Is it because of your father's death that

383
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,520
you blame Master Wu.

384
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,350
Thus, you killed him

385
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,300
to take revenge for your father?

386
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,080
<i>Mom.</i>

387
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,990
Why would I vent my anger on Master Wu when he wasn't the one who killed my father.

388
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,790
The one who killed my father

389
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,890
was you.

390
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,930
Let's not talk about this first. Did you kill Wu Da Hong?

391
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:49,990
Let me tell you. The killer is you. You are the one who killed that person.

392
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,380
Don't forget.

393
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,690
When I saw you take my dad's last breath,

394
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,680
that many years, have you been sleeping well at night?

395
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,890
When you are having dreams, did you dream that my father came to look for you?

396
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,750
You are the killer.

397
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,640
Don't say anymore. I'm not.

398
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,870
At that time, I didn't have a choice. Your father was very sick.

399
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:17,370
I couldn't get any money to cure him and raise you.

400
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,140
Who didn't know that it was better for him to die then suffer?

401
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,870
But your dad was tortured by his illness,

402
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,780
he was good as dead.

403
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,000
It was him that begged me to end it for him.

404
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,660
I couldn't do it

405
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,040
but if I didn't do it,

406
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,910
would I have let you do it instead?

407
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,520
I didn't have any choice.

408
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,940
Didn't have any choice?

409
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,130
Talking about it,

410
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,030
we are poor people.

411
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,230
We don't have any money.

412
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,630
I will always remember in my heart

413
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,890
that I will tell you that I hate you.

414
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:16,230
Thus, I didn't kill Cai Hong's father.

415
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,420
I swear on my dad's name that...

416
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,150
if I wanted to kill someone,

417
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,420
he wouldn't rest in peace even in hell.

418
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,700
Young Master. Zhao Shao Tian is back.

419
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,370
Brother.

420
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,700
Zhou Shao Tian is back.

421
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,930
Come with me.

422
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,470
Mr Zhou. We are here to ask you to help us in the investigation regarding Mr Wu's case.

423
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,510
Has there been progress in Boss Wu's case?

424
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,770
It's convenient for us to talk here. We should go in.

425
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,400
Director Chen Suo, what exactly happened

426
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,490
to cause such a ruckus?

427
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:57,970
Brother Shao Tian

428
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,080
Cai Hong. Why do you look so bad today?

429
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,870
Tell me.

430
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,170
After my father passed away,

431
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,140
did you buy a Parker fountain pen?

432
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,210
It's exactly the same as Jiang Yu.

433
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,810
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

434
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,720
Tell me if you bought it.

435
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,830
You are all here today just because of this?

436
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,990
Okay.

437
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:52,150
I did buy the same model of the fountain pen.

438
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,500
Did you kill my father?

439
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,440
<i>You ungrateful thing. Why did you do it?</i>

440
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,300
<i>Why? I was forced by you.</i>

441
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,620
I didn't.

442
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,090
This is the pen.

443
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:58,250
Brother Shao Tian. What is going on?

444
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,490
Cai Hong.

445
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:04,480
In the past, you said that you wanted to buy this fountain pen as a gift for your father's birthday.

446
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,250
Subsequently, you fought with someone over this and didn't manage to buy it.

447
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,270
I wanted to make you happy by getting the same pen.

448
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,740
But, in the past,

449
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,270
why didn't you tell me about it?

450
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,490
I ordered this pen from overseas.

451
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,710
It took a bit of time.

452
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,460
Before I could give it to you, your father had that accident.

453
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,300
I was afraid that you would get sad again.

454
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,020
Thus, I didn't use this as the birthday present.

455
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,300
Later, I knew about the report on Boss Wu.

456
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,410
There was a fountain pen on his dead body.

457
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:42,060
I was afraid that it would cause a misunderstanding.

458
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,550
I didn't take out this fountain pen then.

459
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,110
Cai Hong.

460
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,720
If this is the weapon which killed your father,

461
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,990
why would I still keep this at home?

462
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,130
Think about it. If this fountain pen

463
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:05,070
injured someone, the tip wouldn't be like this.

464
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,580
Director Chen Suo.

465
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,460
You are in this line.

466
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,250
Take a look. If there is a need,

467
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,900
you can go back and run tests on it.

468
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,660
I took the pen back to run some tests

469
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,310
but it looks new.

470
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,750
It probably didn't injure anyone.

471
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,000
Director Chen Suo.

472
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,850
Cai Hong. I went out of the city to conduct some business.

473
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:38,130
I came home. Look, I didn't even change my clothes yet.

474
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,670
And I heard about this.

475
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,660
I know that

476
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,390
you said that you would trust me.

477
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:55,570
I don't blame you. You must been instigated by someone.

478
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,070
Jiang Yu.

479
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,540
I don't want you to lie to Cai Hong again

480
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,540
and sabotage our relationship.

481
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,230
Okay?

482
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,190
Perhaps, Brother Shao Tian is really innocent.

483
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:35,640
He is so good to us. How could he have killed my father?

484
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,980
I know your heart is contradicting itself right now,

485
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,850
but if you keep everyone out, it will become empty.

486
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:46,350
There must be an answer.

487
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,790
I'm at odds now to find out who contacted him about this

488
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,550
and allowed him time to make the preparations.

489
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,870
You are only guessing now.

490
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,740
Perhaps, you are thinking too much.

491
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,610
Once a person lies,

492
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,270
he needs countless lies to redeem himself.

493
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,120
It's a pity that

494
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,910
it was simple to do.

495
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,020
Don't talk to me about this.

496
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,570
I don't want to listen.

497
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,860
<i>I'm here today to take Cai Hong away with me.</i>

498
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,430
<i>Name your price.</i>

499
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,590
<i>It can be double, triple or whatever, it's not a problem.</i>

500
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:51,810
<i>He brought that much money to take you back.</i>

501
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,710
<i>Don't you find it strange?</i>

502
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,700
<i>I'm the General Manager of Rong Da.</i>

503
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,980
<i>Is the salary of the General Manager of Rong Da that high?</i>

504
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,540
<i>I hold thirty percent shares in Rong Da.</i>

505
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,740
<i>You got a bonus already?</i>

506
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:07,870
<i>I loaned money from a bank.</i>

507
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,060
Ms. Lu

508
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,980
Word has it that today, you, Wu Cai Hong, and Jiang Yu

509
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,860
in front of a bunch of police

510
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,180
had a special encounter.

511
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,320
Well, it's all thanks to Ms. Lu.

512
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,270
If it wasn't for your help, I wouldn't be able to leave unscathed.

513
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,190
Am I that great?

514
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:50,780
♫<i> How am I to choose </i>♫

515
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:56,180
