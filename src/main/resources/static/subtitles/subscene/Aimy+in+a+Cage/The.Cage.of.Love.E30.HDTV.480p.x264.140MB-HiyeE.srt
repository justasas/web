The Cage of Love

00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,430
<i>Episode 30</i>

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,660
People such as Lu Man are vicious like snakes and scorpions.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:16,420
Moreover, she is obsessed with the recipe. There is an 80% chance that she killed your father.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,440
But to find a flaw in Lu Man's actions or any criminal evidence,

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,980
I'm afraid it won't be that easy.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,210
What should we do then? Are we going to just sit here and wait?

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,040
As police, we need evidence in our line of work.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,030
I can't do anything without any evidence.

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,490
Why don't we do this?

11
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,570
Let's start from her subordinates first.

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,070
I'm know some of her employees. I will check with them to see if there are any leads.

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,920
- Let me give you a lift.
-I'm walking back.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,780
After being in jail for some time, I would like to have some fresh air and walk around a bit.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,060
- Brother Shao Tian I...
-It's getting late. Go home now.

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,780
<i>Cai Hong. I must get used to not being with you anymore.</i>

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,060
<i>I will continue to walk alone.</i>

18
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,590
-Brother Shao Tian.
- Zhang Xuan, I hope you can help me with something,

19
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,890
Brother Shao Tian. Don't say this. It was fortunate that you took care of me when I was with Rong Da.

20
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,300
I heard about what happened to you.

21
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,720
Don't worry. I'm a righteous person.

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,560
I know. If this isn't the case, I wouldn't have looked for you.

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,930
You have been with Miss Lu for many years. I would like to you find something for me discreetly.

24
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,320
Brother Shao Tian, please tell me.

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,830
At that time, if it weren't for you, I would have been living in the ghettos.

26
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:18,140
Fortunately, your money has helped my mother to cure her illness. I will repay you properly.

27
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,750
I want you to find out for me

28
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,030
about Miss Lu's schedule the day of Wu Hong Da's incident.

29
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,710
This...

30
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,380
- Brother Shao Tian, this is not about money.
- I know that it's about money.

31
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,320
This money can help you get through the critical times.

32
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,020
This is very important to me.

33
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,010
Take it as you are doing me a favour.

34
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,830
Okay?

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,140
Brother Shao Tian, I will do my best. Wait for my news.

36
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,570
Whether I'm successful or not, I will contact you.

37
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,220
Thank you, Zhang Xuan.

38
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,080
After this is done,

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,150
I will thank you again.

40
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,340
Brother.

41
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,150
Where are you going?

42
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,780
Since when do I need to report to you before I go out?

43
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,770
Every day, you leave the house and come back late.

44
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,170
Do you know that I haven't seen you for a long time?

45
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,920
I haven't recovered from my injuries yet.

46
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,300
I don't want Mom to see me in this condition.

47
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,090
She will worry about me.

48
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,310
That's right. If Mom were to find out that you were beaten into this condition because of Wu Cai Hong,

49
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,440
it won't be that simple as being worried about you.

50
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,060
Brother, the murderer will be caught. Mother does not even need to know Cai Hong's identity.

51
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,490
Stay home and take good care of Mom. Don't bother about other matters.

52
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:37,970
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

53
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,060
Jiang Yu. Now what?

54
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,560
Director Li said we have to find hard evidence,

55
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,550
so that we can find an excuse for Lu Man to be investigated at the police station.

56
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,910
If not, it will be hard to explain to the Military Governor.

57
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,950
It's okay. There will definitely be a way.

58
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,150
The investigation has been going on for a long time.

59
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,990
In fact, you have already been cleared of all suspicions.

60
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,800
Thank you for still helping me.

61
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,880
By the way, will you be going to Ling Long?

62
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,790
No. I'm going to the hospital for a check up.

63
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,290
Can I go with you?

64
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,310
I'm not a three year old kid. Why would I need someone to go with me to the hospital?

65
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:01,310
I let you go with me to investigate the case. Why can't I go with you to the hospital?

66
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,990
Just regard this as I'm paying you back.

67
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,100
Let's go then.

68
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,150
Brother. Can I move back to stay here now? <i>Huzhou</i>

69
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,150
Wait a while more.

70
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,070
Wait until we capture Lu Man, then you can move back.

71
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,070
I asked around. They gave up after looking for me for a few days.

72
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,630
I think they will not give me any problems again.

73
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,330
Lu Man didn't find you to create trouble because she doesn't want you to expose her identity.

74
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,000
This woman is very shady and toxic.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,060
Most likely she is already planning a surprise attack. We better be careful.

76
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,110
This is not the first day I was beaten up and harmed.

77
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,060
Don't worry. I will be careful.

78
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,080
Brother, look at yourself. You look more haggard.

79
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,990
Have a good rest. Don't overwork yourself.

80
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,120
Brother.

81
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,990
Are you thinking about Wu Cao Hong again?

82
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,710
I must manage Rong Da properly because of Cai Hong

83
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,020
and also help her to find her father's killer.

84
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,990
Okay.

85
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,170
This is great wine. Where did you get this great wine from?

86
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,330
Brother, you are Miss Lu's favourite person now.

87
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,020
Since Miss is favouring you, you could do few things for me, right?

88
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,860
There's nothing bad with ripping the benefits. Tell me.

89
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,290
What can I help you with?

90
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,760
What do you mean, brother.

91
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,250
I only want to get closer to you.

92
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,040
Every time Miss Lu goes out to handle some major matter,

93
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,740
she only takes Uncle Lai along.

94
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,240
Not only that.

95
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,230
Now even the warlord's people treat me with respect.

96
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,440
All the big and small dyeing factories in Huzhou. That Ling Long and Hua Mei,

97
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,570
I know them very well.

98
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,660
Yes.

99
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,800
When Miss Lu went to see Wu Da Hong of Ling Long,

100
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,020
that old man died after that.

101
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,520
How do you know about this?

102
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,840
Uncle Lai mentioned this when we came here for a meal.

103
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,040
I'm only just guessing.

104
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,990
This is really a good wine.

105
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,470
Don't talk any nonsense.

106
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,930
If you talk any nonsense,

107
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,990
you will die.

108
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,400
Look. I already told you many times.

109
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,830
Fei Fei. Why don't I see your brother lately?

110
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,970
He is too busy with work.

111
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,510
He leaves the house early every day and comes home late.

112
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,550
It could be that he doesn't have the time to come here.

113
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,540
But no matter how busy he is, he should also find time to visit you.

114
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,490
Don't worry, I will lecture him on your behalf.

115
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,650
This little cotton-padded jacket will suffice for his attention.

116
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,590
Let your brother do what a man is supposed to do.

117
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:57,070
But you must advise your brother to take care of his health.

118
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,530
I know.

119
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,100
The doctor already said that you shouldn't let water touch your wounds.

120
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,390
It will heal fast, but can be very itchy. It would be good to use a clutch for a while.

121
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,440
Okay, I know.

122
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,060
Yu Er.

123
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,170
Mom.

124
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,720
Yu Er, Cai Hong.

125
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,750
What are you doing here?

126
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,120
I had some injuries and came here for treatments. I'm better now.

127
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,860
Everything is already fine.

128
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,780
How did you get hurt?

129
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,990
You should ask Cai Hong about this.

130
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,750
I'm sorry, Madam Jiang. Master Jiang got injured because of me.

131
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,010
I will personally apologise to you another day.

132
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,400
Cai Hong. Ever since you left, I have been missing you.

133
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,140
Why didn't you visit me?

134
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,200
What do you want to tell me?

135
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,520
Mom.

136
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,760
Do you want me to start from your family name?

137
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,920
Fei Fei. What are you trying to say?

138
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,160
Mom, don't stand here.

139
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,690
I will take you home first. Come.

140
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,990
Come with me. I have something to tell you.

141
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,380
What did you wanted to tell my mom just now?

142
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,090
I wanted to apologise to her for what my father did.

143
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,950
You should keep quiet.

144
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,360
Do you know why my brother didn't want you to say anything just now?

145
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,530
My mom is an ill person which was caused by your father.

146
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,770
Your presence will only agitate her.

147
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,240
If my mom gets sick again,

148
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,090
when that time comes, the first person who won't let you off is my brother.

149
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:04,090
It was my father's fault. Thus, I wanted to do something for the Jiang family and your brother.

150
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,470
If you really feel a guilty conscious and want to do something for my mom,

151
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,280
please stay far away from her.

152
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,370
Our family is finally enjoying peaceful days. Don't trouble us, please.

153
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,420
I'm not trying to create a mess.

154
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,860
- I only want to...
- I know very well what you are thinking

155
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,160
but you will never get rid of your debt.

156
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,900
If you continues on, the matter will only get worse.

157
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,550
My mom can't take on any more traumas.

158
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,910
She would go crazy when she hears Wu Hong Da's name.

159
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,990
How could she able to accept you?

160
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,960
She'd rather my brother never marry or have children.

161
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,980
She will also never accept Wu Hong Da's daughter.

162
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:13,270
- Hello.
- Brother Shao Tian. I found out what you wanted.

163
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,620
Let's meet at the usual place later.

164
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,020
Okay.

165
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,060
What did you tell Cai Hong at the hospital just now?

166
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:40,020
Other than the grudges between our families, what else do you think I would tell her?

167
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,590
Fei Fei. Cai Hong is different from her father.

168
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:51,810
We shouldn't let our grudges run through the next generation.

169
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,930
You are right

170
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,780
but would you dare to tell Mom this?

171
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,070
Do you think Mom will accept her?

172
00:14:51,360 --> 00:15:03,030
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

173
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,720
Sister. It's late. What are you looking for?

174
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,560
I'm looking for my slave contract.

175
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,910
I'm going back to the Jiang family.

176
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:40,300
It wasn't easy for you to leave from the Jiang family. Why are you jumping back in the fire?

177
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,100
There are certain things you wouldn't understand.

178
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,680
Yes, I don't understand.

179
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,760
Dad is already dead and Ling Long has been returned to Jiang Yu. What else do we owe them?

180
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,770
We owe them a healthy mother

181
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,360
and remorse for what happened to deceased Master Jiang.

182
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,160
I'm going back to the Jiang family and will seek forgiveness from Madam Jiang.

183
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,450
If not, I won't have peace for the rest of my life.

184
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,900
Are you really doing this to redeem yourself of the crimes?

185
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,820
Yes.

186
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,760
I'm also doing this for myself.

187
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,970
Don't tell me that this is Zhang Xuan's corpse.

188
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
I caused him to die.

189
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,920
What exactly is going on?

190
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,620
Don't be anxious. Take your time to tell me.

191
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,470
He was Lu Man's employee. I met him a few days ago.

192
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,980
I wanted him to find out the schedule of Lu Man on the day of Wu Hong Da's incident.

193
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,650
I didn't imagine that...

194
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,360
It's another victim again.

195
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,440
Lu Man must be behind this.

196
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,700
Let's do this.

197
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,520
I will call Jiang Yu first and then find someone to pick up Cai Hong.

198
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,060
Let's have a meeting to see what we should do next.

199
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,080
I will go and pick up Cai Hong.

200
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,960
Be careful on the way. Lu Man may take action.

201
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,190
- Hello.
- Is that Mr Jiang?

202
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,450
- Yes, I am.
- This is Director Chen.

203
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,750
We found a corpse this morning.

204
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,410
He probably is Lu Man's employee, Zhang Xuan.

205
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,910
He should have something to do with our investigation on Lu Man.

206
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,190
I hope you can come down to the police station and help decide what our next step is.

207
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,420
Okay, no problem.

208
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,940
I will bring Wu Cai Hong along with me.

209
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,970
No need. Zhou Shao Tian has already gone to pick her up.

210
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,480
Also, be careful. Lu Man will find men to take revenge.

211
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,980
Don't worry, we will.

212
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,150
What are you doing here?

213
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,770
I'm a maid with the Jiang family. I came back willingly.

214
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,930
Don't tell me you need to see the slave contract?

215
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,830
Didn't you always want to leave?

216
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,900
Since you have already left, why did you come back?

217
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,070
You know the reason why I'm back.

218
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,120
Do you really need to do this?

219
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,590
Whatever has happened has already happened.

220
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,320
What we can only do

221
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,450
is to remember what we should remember.

222
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,450
You must accept that we wouldn't be able to change anything.

223
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,860
Before we can't change everything, I must work hard.

224
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:15,230
I want to seek Madam Jiang's forgiveness. If she doesn't forgive me, I won't leave.

225
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:20,990
What if my mom really won't forgive you?

226
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:26,970
If I don't work hard, how would we know the result?

227
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,070
If you want to remain here, fine. Do whatever you want.

228
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,540
But you should know that

229
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,650
no one in the Jiang family will welcome you.

230
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,470
I know

231
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,980
but there will always be someone to help me.

232
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,000
- Brother Shao Tian.
- Xiao Yun. Where is your sister?

233
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,520
She went out early this morning.

234
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,220
Where did she go?

235
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,590
She went to find Jiang Yu.

236
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,740
Brother Shao Tian. Is anything the matter? I will relay to the message to her.

237
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,060
No need. Thanks.

238
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,040
Mr Zhou. You are here just in time.

239
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,290
The report of Zhang Xuan's corpse is out.

240
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,610
There are stab wounds on his neck, but also some traces of a nail grip.

241
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,170
Thus, we are sure the river is not the scene of the crime.

242
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,980
Rather a place where body was dumped.

243
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,570
I caused him to die.

244
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,970
Zhang Xuan called me that day.

245
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,570
He said that he found out what happened with Boss Wu that day.

246
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:11,330
If he looked for you, this clearly proves that he found evidence of my father's killer.

247
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,620
That's why they took action on him. It's a pity we were one step behind.

248
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,300
Lu Man has already gone insane.

249
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,490
I think not before long we will be able to find the evidence and bring her to justice.

250
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,560
What we need to do now is to keep the secret formula in a safe place.

251
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,520
Lu Man's motive is to get the secret formula.

252
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,550
Thus, the three of you must watch your safety.

253
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,030
The police will also protect you.

254
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:50,530
Cai Hong. You must remember what Director Chen said.

255
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,090
I know Lu Man. She is very cruel.

256
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,560
She will never let it rest. You must watch your safety.

257
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,950
Don't worry. Cai Hong will be staying with my famiiy for the time being.

258
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,910
Why?

259
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,400
Because my slave contract hasn't expired. Thus...

260
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,830
Jiang Yu. Did you forget that I bought the contract and returned it to you personally?

261
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,400
Why did you go back on your words?

262
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,970
It was my own decision to go back to the Jiang family.

263
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,490
Did you forget how the Jiang family treated you?

264
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,980
It's because of how they treated me, that's why I want to seek Madam's forgiveness and apologise to her.

265
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,920
Don't worry about this.

266
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,120
It's the safest place for Cai Hong to stay at my home.

267
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,090
Brother Shao Tian. Don't worry about me. I know what I'm doing.

268
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,070
Since you have already thought it through,

269
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,970
fine then.

270
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,090
If you are not comfortable staying at the Jiang's home,

271
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,030
just come back.

272
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,970
- Young Master.
- Prepare a clean guest room for Miss Wu.

273
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,610
- Yes.
- No need. I can stay at the staff quarters.

274
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,160
Ignore her. Take Miss Wu's suitcase to the guest room first.

275
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,240
Okay.

276
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,790
Brother.

277
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,580
Why did you bring her back again?

278
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,240
Didn't you understand what I told you yesterday?

279
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,870
I thought about it and think that it's still best I come back to seek your mother's forgiveness.

280
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,990
What are you trying to do?

281
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,360
Your family already caused my mom to be in this condition.

282
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,070
Are you going to traumatize her here?

283
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,930
- Fei Fei.
- Don't stop me.

284
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,570
I just don't understand.

285
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,290
You are a refined woman. Why is your skin so thick?

286
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,410
You still insist on coming here even though we beat and scolded you.

287
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:02,500
I know that you don't like me. No matter how you scold me, I don't care about it.

288
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,960
I wanted to say that Madam Jiang has been sick for so many years, living in the shadow of the past.

289
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,080
If I can really seek her forgiveness and make her let go of everything in the past,

290
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,710
perhaps, this may be of help in her recovery.

291
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,280
Impossible. I will never let you do this.

292
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,750
I have been taking care of my mom for many years.

293
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:28,140
I know her condition. I will never let anyone traumatize or harm her.

294
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,320
I will slowly talk to her. I can wait for her.

295
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,090
One month, a year or even forever until she forgives me.

296
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,670
Stop dreaming.

297
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,080
As long as I'm here, I will never let you go near my mom

298
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,020
and traumatize her.

299
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,360
Cai Hong?

300
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,800
Cai Hong, it's you.

301
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,720
Did you miss me and came to see me?

302
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,110
Madam. I plan to come back here today to take care of her.

303
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,120
Really?

304
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,520
I heard from my son that you found a boyfriend and will be getting married.

305
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,840
What happened?

306
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,770
We already broke up.

307
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,920
Child. Let bygones be bygones.

308
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:14,460
Starting from now, regard this as your home and stay here in peace.

309
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,760
Thank you, Madam Jiang.

310
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,070
I only know that you are Cai Hong. I don't know your family name.

311
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,980
- My family name is Wu.
- Wu Cai Hong?

312
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,590
Madam. If you are willing, I will slowly tell you about myself.

313
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,340
I will slowly tell you stories about me and let you get to know the real me.

314
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,850
Okay. I can tell that you must have suffered.

315
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,730
Take time to tell me your stories.

316
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,940
If you have any difficulties, you must tell me. I will help you.

317
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,030
Yu Er will also help you.

318
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,890
Brother. Why did you let Wu Cai Hong into our family again?

319
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,280
What you promised in the past,

320
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,430
did you forget all about it?

321
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:34,700
This morning a dead body was found in the river.

322
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,190
Director Chen suspects that Lu Man killed him to silence him.

323
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:43,120
Director Chen hopes that everyone connected to the Wu Da Hong's case

324
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,460
must be extra careful.

325
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,720
I allowed Wu Cai Hong to move in with us. It's all entirely for her safety.

326
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,950
Why are we considering her safety?

327
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,650
No matter what, she is still our enemy.

328
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,600
Even more so when she is just a common stranger.

329
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,140
We don't need to accept her into our family and protect her twenty four hours a day.

330
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,050
Our grudge with the Wu family has already ended.

331
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:19,860
No matter what you say, you can't change the fact that Wu Cai Hong's father killed our father.

332
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,440
You can forget about this deep grudge

333
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,070
but mom and I will never forget this.

334
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,610
I think you should make Wu Cai Hong leave this house as soon as possible.

335
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,140
Since Lu Man is such a maniac,

336
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,230
you shouldn't let her stay here with us.

337
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:45,090
You should be concerned for your and the Jiang family's safety.

338
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,220
I dare to guarantee that

339
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,210
at least Lu Man wouldn't dare to kill us here.

340
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,700
You don't have to worry safety.

341
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,210
I'm already involved in the Wu Hong Da's case.

342
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,490
If I were to stop now, I'm afraid Lu Man will never let me off.

343
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:11,070
Only when we lock her up, we will then be truly safe.

344
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,970
What you mean is that

345
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,080
before Lu Man is caught,

346
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,910
Wu Cai Hong will be staying with us.

347
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,880
I think that even if Lu Man is caught,

348
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,910
Wu Cai Hong will never leave the Jiang family.

349
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,250
Everything that you are doing

350
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,540
is only an excuse for you to keep her with you.

351
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,810
Am I right?

352
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:14,360
Child. When your brain and heart are in trouble,

353
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:21,040
you should have sunlight. You won't have any shadows in your face then.

354
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,410
Thank you, Madam.

355
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:28,050
Are you willing to tell me your stories now?

356
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,480
Are you really willing to hear my stories?

357
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,700
I'm ready.

358
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:42,510
I actually have a complete and happy family.

359
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,530
Even though my mother died young, I had a father who doted on me.

360
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,960
Under the love, care and protection of my father,

361
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,890
I temporarily forgot the pain of losing my mother.

362
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,920
But not long after that,

363
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,600
my life stopped suddently when I was nineteen years old

364
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,160
and my father was killed.

365
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,230
With the murderer still at large,

366
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,290
my family's business went bankrupt too.

367
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,750
I also have a stepmother and sister.

368
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,520
We were kicked out of the house by the debtors.

369
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,050
Overnight, we became homeless.

370
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,870
No wonder

371
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,130
you are young but on your face,

372
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,640
your age does not match your sorrow.

373
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,780
This wasn't only due to what happened to your family,

374
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:44,990
you also lost your most beloved one.

375
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,930
Cai Hong. If you are willing,

376
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,890
I can be your mother

377
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,410
and you can regard Jiang Yu as your brother.

378
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,070
Frankly, in my heart, you are just like Fei Fei.

379
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,880
We are different.

380
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,310
I don't deserve you being nice to me.

381
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,010
I...

382
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,340
Actually, I'm...

383
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,080
I am actually...

384
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,370
When my father passed away, I then realised that

385
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:25,590
he did many things in the past that I wasn't aware of.

386
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,930
In my eyes he was a respected and competent man.

387
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:37,400
But later, because of a moment of greed, he hurt many people.

388
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,610
He did many unethical things.

389
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,440
I really don't understand

390
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,610
how my kind father could be so ruthless.

391
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:50,950
I also don't want to believe that he was the same person.

392
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,570
I realised now

393
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,530
your grief must stem from your father's case then.

394
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,020
It's not only this.

395
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:06,520
I think I am also very sorry towards all victims of that time.

396
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,360
For the past days,

397
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,620
I have been living in pain and felt utmost remorse.

398
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,280
Child, this is your father's fault.

399
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,110
It's not your fault.

400
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:23,180
Out of my selfishness, I wanted to forgive him

401
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,530
but when I thought about what he did,

402
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,970
I really can't forget about it.

403
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,490
I don't want to forgive him either.

404
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:37,160
That's because you love your father very much and can't accept that he is corrupted.

405
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,220
You will feel a more guilty conscious to those he had harmed.

406
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,480
But Cai Hong, it was your father that committed the wrong deeds.

407
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,540
Your grief will not change his wrongdoings.

408
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:56,040
but talking about this, he is just your father.

409
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,770
He only just wanted to be a good father.

410
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,470
You don't have any other reasons to hate him.

411
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,330
As his daughter,

412
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,920
you only need to think about how well he treated you.

413
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,780
Don't hate him again.

414
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,930
Child, we must learn to let it go.

415
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,180
Can I really let it go?

416
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,740
Letting go is easy to say but hard to do.

417
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,370
Don't look at me for an answer to your plight.

418
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:31,150
For the more than ten years, I find it hard to let it go too.

419
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,890
Hard to?

420
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,990
Wu Cai Hong. I overheard your conversation with my mom.

421
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:11,090
I haven't told Madam about this yet

422
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:16,740
but I believe in Madam. She is a very kind person.

423
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,210
- She will definitely forgive me.
- Stop dreaming.

424
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:25,150
I'm here to tell you not to think that my mom will really forgive you.

425
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,040
My mom is definitely a very kind person

426
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,720
but her kindness

427
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,600
caused her family to go bankrupt. To her enemy,

428
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,730
it will be totally useless.

429
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:41,760
She said that to you because she sympathises and pities you.

430
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,610
What's even more important is that

431
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,470
she doesn't know that it was your father who ruined our Jiang family.

432
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,970
No matter what,

433
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,910
I will use my sincerity to seek forgiveness from your mom.

434
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,980
Are you being sincere or selfish?

435
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,510
You want my mom to forgive you

436
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,520
so she can support you and my brother through thick and thin.

437
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:11,510
You want her to accept you because you want to be with my brother. Am I right?

438
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,480
You have misunderstood me.

439
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:19,150
All this hatred stems from my father's deeds.

440
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,680
Thus, I want to use my sincerity

441
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,400
to end the grudge.

442
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,760
Whether it's a misunderstanding or not,

443
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,060
I still want to tell you that

444
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:38,060
my mom and the Jiang family will never accept a woman who is tainted with the blood of our enemy.

445
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,270
Whether you believe it or not, or whether you will accept it or not,

446
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,900
my repentance is sincere.

447
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:03,390
When it was getting dark, Zhang Xuan said that he wanted to go home. After he left, he was never seen again.

448
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,600
I don't know who killed him.

449
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,490
Did you say anything to him before he died?

450
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,120
No.

451
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,020
- Any abnormalities?
- I saw none.

452
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,380
Wasn't he fine?

453
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,450
- Who was he close with?
-How would I know?

454
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,090
How can I answer it when I have no idea?

455
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:24,020
- I'm really not close to him.
- I really don't know.

456
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,220
Enough, let them go.

457
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,940
Let's go.

458
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:37,930
Director, this Lu Man employees acted really arrogant toward the society.

459
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,860
We interrogated them for the entire afternoon. They all know nothing.

460
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,060
It's very obvious that they all came prepared.

461
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,200
They are very clear about what they should say and not say.

462
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,960
It's okay. Think of another solution.

463
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,190
Yes.

464
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,670
Brother Shao Tian, Brother Ma Li. My sister is not at home.

465
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:58,050
I know that Cai Hong is not here. I came to visit you and Madam Wu.

466
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,030
Ma Li, bring the stuff in.

467
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,640
Cai Yun. We have been investigating your father's case lately.

468
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,320
Murderers kill people in order to conceal their crimes.

469
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,730
Thus, for this period of time, don't leave home unnecessarily.

470
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:16,590
Try not to go to remote places. It might be gangerous for the time being.

471
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,040
Dangerous?

472
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,920
In this world, who else is more dangerous than you?

473
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,280
- Mrs Wu, don't you know that good people...
- I see you are no good person!

474
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,030
- I...
- Ma Li.

475
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,150
Mom.

476
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,700
Madam Wu, Cai Yun. I only hope that you will be careful about your safety.

477
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,720
I understand.

478
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,620
We are taking our leave then.

479
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,790
You are still not leaving?

480
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,550
Yu Er. Cai Hong has suffered a lot.

481
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,870
Try to spend more of your free time with her and cheer her up.

482
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:04,360
Mom. What did Cai Hong tell you?

483
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,130
Cai Hong told me

484
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:17,590
that when she was young, her biological mother passed away.

485
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:23,040
The only family who loved her was her father was killed subsequently.

486
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,120
When her family went bankrupt,

487
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:32,040
she found out that her father did many unethical things.

488
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:38,260
On one hand, she cannot accept such brutal facts,

489
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,460
on the other hand, she feels guilty about the victims.

490
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,580
This was her father's fault. What has it to do with Cai Hong?

491
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,450
The way Cai Hong thinks about this, it show that

492
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,060
she is a kind and mature young lady.

493
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:03,090
But this young lady cannot shoulder all this burden alone.

494
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:11,850
Yu Er. Be nice to her in the future.

495
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,590
I know.
