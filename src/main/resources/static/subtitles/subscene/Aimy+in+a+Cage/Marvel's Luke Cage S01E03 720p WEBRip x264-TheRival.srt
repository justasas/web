10
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:28,400
<i>Pop's Barber Shop</i>

12
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:34,281

14
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:42,289

[men conversing in Spanish]

[man in English] Yeah, that's it.
Let's get outta here.

00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:27,602
[conversing indistinctly]

33
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:31,065
[Misty] Well, check with those people.

34
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:32,232
-They talking?
-[Scarfe] Nah.

35
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:35,485
"I ain't see shit."
It's the catchphrase of the day.

36
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:39,073
Classic. I should get that trademarked.
You know how many times I hear that?

37
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:42,326
-Nah. I can't hear shit either.
-[chuckles]

38
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:46,080
-The hits looked precise.
-Oh, they knew what they were doing.

39
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:48,457
Uh, victims said the assailants
were Spanish-speaking.

40
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,293
Are the victims
a part of Cottonmouth's crew?

41
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:54,588
Who knows? Computer's down.
We can run it back at the station.

42
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:57,174
Or get a first-person ID.

43
00:04:57,257 --> 00:04:58,801
What do you say?
You like hospital food?

44
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:01,595
-[scoffs] Who's driving?
-Shoot for it.

45
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:05,850
-You driving.
-Yes, Miss Daisy.

[Luke] <i>Gold inlay on a mahogany casket?</i>

47
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:12,940
[sighs] I appreciate the sentiment. I do.

48
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:15,567
But... it's a bit much.

49
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,862
Well, um, we do have more...

50
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:20,197
affordable options.

51
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:24,034
Can I see the body?

52
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:26,536
I'm sorry.
That body just arrived from the morgue.

53
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,663
It still has to be prepped for viewing.

54
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:31,125
[sighs]

55
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,961
Look, Mr. Hunter...

56
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:35,504
-Pop...
-Mmm.

57
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:37,422
...was like a father to me.

58
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:43,012
He's my wife's people...
and she's gone now, too.

59
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:46,140
It's just me.
I'm all he has.

60
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:50,060
I just want to make sure
he's taken care of...

61
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:51,811
until I can get the cash to pay for this.

62
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:53,563
Don't worry about it now, brother.

63
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:56,483
It's already taken care of.

64
00:05:57,943 --> 00:06:01,280
Flourish is a silent way
of us treasuring the dearly departed.

65
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:03,615
[breathes deeply]

66
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,409
It's too bad
you're not in a position to give Pop

67
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:07,161
the grand homegoing he deserves.

68
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:10,122
The service should match
the man's integrity.

69
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:12,874
Hmm.

70
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:18,297
-Can we have the room, Joel?
-Uh, no problem, Mr. Stokes.

71
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:30,475
Me and Henry didn't see eye to eye.

72
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:34,854
But I always had his back.

73
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,734
He wouldn't want any drama.
Especially here.

74
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,528
What Pop would have wanted
is for you not to pay

75
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:44,198
for his arrangements
with bloody guilt money.

76
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:47,326
We set a parley.

77
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:49,869
-I thought your word was bond.
-It is.

78
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:54,541
A former associate of mine
was feelin' himself.

79
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:58,837
He's not feelin'
much of anything right now.

80
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,299
Doesn't matter.
Pop's death is still on you.

81
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:03,883
Step off.

82
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:05,177
Before you get hurt.

83
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:08,222
Why?

84
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:09,681
I'm just getting started.

85
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,100
[laughing]

86
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:15,187
Good to know.
Hmm.

87
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,272
How's the job search coming?

88
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:21,276
-Dishwasher.
-[pats Luke]

89
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:31,786
[bell chimes]

90
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,325
I saw you standing out there earlier.

91
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,247
I wasn't ready to come in yet.

92
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,790
[Fish] Yeah, I hear you on that.

93
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:21,211
Walking in this shop
is the hardest thing I've ever done.

94
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:26,591
[sighing] Yeah.

95
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:29,886
I mean, who's ever really ready
to see something like this, though?

96
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,486
[sighs]

97
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,035
How'd you know Pop?

98
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:56,913
We used to play chess
in Marcus Garvey Park.

99
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:00,459
He got too busy to play,
so I started coming here.

100
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,838
When you played him...
who would win?

101
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:05,964
Me.

102
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:08,758
[chuckles]

103
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:09,843
Just 'cause the brother's dead

104
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:11,595
don't mean I gotta start
changing the facts.

105
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,180
[both chuckle]

106
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:17,392
[sighs]

107
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,021
So what will happen to this place?

108
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:24,983
Ah, the bank will swoop in
and take it eventually.

109
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,569
How do you know that?

110
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:32,866
Besides playing chess,
I used to do the man's taxes every year.

111
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:35,702
I know where every account is
and who's owed what.

112
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:40,332
Trust me, soon as the word spreads
that he's gone,

113
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:43,210
the wolves will be at the door.

114
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:47,256
-Not on my watch.
-[scoffs] You got 80 grand lying around?

115
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,300
'Cause that's what it's gonna take
to keep this place open.

116
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,178
So it's too late.

117
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:55,889
Not necessarily.

118
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:59,601
Eighty grand isn't just gonna come
fallin' out of the sky.

119
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:02,354
What should we do?
Talk to the bank?

120
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:05,107
Well, we have a little time.

121
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,442
No one's gonna be asking questions
and shutting things down

122
00:10:07,526 --> 00:10:09,778
as long as things are paid for on time.

123
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:13,282
Why do you think
so many people get Grandma's house

124
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:17,161
without having to fill out extra paperwork
or hire a lawyer?

125
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:21,415
You pay the bills,
people shut up and get on with things.

126
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,670
So what you thinkin' now?

127
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,758
As much I'd like to put my foot
in Cottonmouth's behind,

128
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,677
I need to put my hands in his pockets.

129
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,179
That's how you hurt someone like that.

130
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:39,015
Robbin' Cottonmouth was what caused
all this trouble in the first place.

131
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:41,685
[exhales deeply]

132
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,023
You're absolutely right.

133
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:49,901
I'm not gonna touch him.

134
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,404
Not the way I should.

135
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,325
Since I can't touch the king,

136
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:59,286
I'm gonna take his queen,
his knights...

137
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:01,621
his rooks...

138
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:05,917
I'm knocking all his pieces
off the board.

139
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:08,837
Where you goin' now?

140
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:11,965
Check these fools.

141
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:21,308
Three friends.
Grade school tight.

142
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,393
Playground tight.

143
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:26,646
All-City in basketball in a town
where that really matters.

144
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,316
So what happens?

145
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,192
Y'all don't go pro.

146
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:34,654
One of you...
starts working for Cottonmouth...

147
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,491
makes some money,
sees a slick opportunity,

148
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:39,117
and you guys go for it.

149
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:44,581
You were part of the heist, right?

150
00:11:44,664 --> 00:11:49,002
And the shootout at the barber shop
was payback for the heist.

151
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,879
So, what happened to your man Dante?

152
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:55,800
Shameek killed Dante.

153
00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:59,263
You admit to that?

154
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:02,098
I admit what?

155
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:06,478
I mean, I was assuming Shameek did it.
'Cause I know I didn't.

156
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:07,937
Never assume anything, kiddo.

157
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:10,399
Too bad your boys aren't here
to back up your story.

158
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,985
Maybe he's telling the truth.

159
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,905
Let's say he is.

160
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:18,657
Shameek sees all that cash and says,

161
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,785
"Oh, shit, there's no way
I'm splitting that three ways." So...

162
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:23,036
-Boom!
-[gun fires]

163
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,331
Now it's a two-way split instead of three.

164
00:12:26,415 --> 00:12:28,292
Shameek gets caught
with his share of the cash.

165
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,503
-By Cottonmouth, I'm assuming.
-Mmm-hmm.

166
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:34,673
Who?

167
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:37,091
[both chuckle]

168
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:39,803
-"Who?"
-Cottonmouth.

169
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:41,971
The man you stole from.

170
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:43,222
Dante's former boss.

171
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:46,851
The man who shot up
Pop's Barber Shop

172
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:50,439
and killed a good man
trying to get at you.

173
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:57,821
Hey, look, we don't want you, Chico.

174
00:12:57,904 --> 00:13:03,743
We want the people who killed Shameek
and who shot up the barber shop.

175
00:13:04,744 --> 00:13:05,995
Testify.

176
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,416
Do something good for somebody for once.

177
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:17,549
[breathing shakily]
I can't help you with that.

178
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:24,764
Hey, look, can y'all please
take off these handcuffs?

179
00:13:24,848 --> 00:13:27,351
I'm the victim here. Me.

180
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:30,854
Talk to us.
Talk to a grand jury.

181
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:34,524
You can save lives, Wilfredo.

182
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:37,068
Step up.

183
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:44,033
[grunts]

184
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,913
Well, the streets will handle it.

185
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:51,750
Just like they always do.

186
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,543
[exhales deeply]

187
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:58,882
[Chico breathing heavily]

188
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:02,844
[gasps]

189
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,264
Yeah, they will.

190
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,285
What are you doing?

191
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:31,873
[Scarfe] Letting you go.

192
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:33,375
Like you said...

193
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:36,628
you're the victim...

194
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:39,047
not a suspect, right?

195
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:41,007
So, go.

196
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,176
Wherever.

197
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:46,763
You got no clothes,
you got no money.

198
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:49,516
And your friends are gonna be
looking to finish the job, right?

199
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,477
But you're a man.

200
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,814
You're gonna be just fine, Chico.

201
00:14:57,273 --> 00:15:00,569
Chico is the man.

202
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:07,241
Pop was a friend.

203
00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:11,996
-He deserves the best.
-Yeah.

204
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:14,624
I see you've been busy.

205
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:21,756
What about this man right here?

206
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:25,594
[Stokes] Tone?

207
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,639
I had to let him go.

208
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,726
Nothing humbles a man like gravity.

209
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:34,686
Hmm.

210
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,063
Remember...

211
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:39,983
same as always.

212
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,693
This body can't exist.

213
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,951
-What body?
-[chuckles]

214
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,287
-My man.
-[grunts]

215
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:02,756
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

216
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:08,219
[chuckles]

217
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:12,265
And there's the bartender.

218
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:14,433
Luke Cage.

219
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:18,605
Right in the center...
of the nightclub...

220
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:20,982
of the barber shop...

221
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:22,609
of everything.

222
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,696
-Where you going?
-To see a friend.

223
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,072
Mmm-mmm.

224
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:33,036
Woman, what's your problem?
I've done nothing.

225
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:36,247
There's only one person who worked
for both Pop and Cottonmouth,

226
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,999
and that's you.

227
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:39,375
In the past 72 hours,

228
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:43,087
three people connected are dead.
Shameek, Dante and Pop.

229
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:46,132
And there was another shooting
this morning tied to all of this.

230
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,300
Would you call that nothing?

231
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:48,760
And all that's on me?

232
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:53,264
Why don't y'all find Pop's killer
instead of being all up in my business?

233
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:57,644
Your business and our investigation
are one and the same.

234
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:05,026
You know where I live.

235
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:10,740
You wanna work some things out, hmm?

236
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,702
We can always do it there.

237
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,038
You can even bring handcuffs this time.

238
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:28,967
[Scarfe sighs]

239
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,051
[Misty sighs]

240
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:32,511
[Luke] <i>You don't have to worry.</i>

241
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:34,639
Cottonmouth ain't trying to kill you.

242
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:38,643
[scoffs] Are you kidding?
Were you at the same shootout as I was?

243
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:40,311
It was his boy, Tone.

244
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,105
Tone acted on his own.

245
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:45,358
And... he died on his own, too.

246
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:47,401
He's cleanin' up
and I ain't trying to be next.

247
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:50,822
Cottonmouth has his cash.
That's all he cares about.

248
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:53,617
Hell, you right about that.

249
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,703
Doesn't matter how many people
had to die to get it, huh?

250
00:17:56,786 --> 00:17:58,121
Wasn't like the money fell in your lap.

251
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:01,249
Your hands have blood all over them.

252
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:03,501
That don't matter.
I'm out.

253
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:07,756
-I've caused enough trouble.
-More than enough.

254
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,925
Pop signed his death warrant
the minute he decided to help you.

255
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,637
Well, it's the other way around, ain't it?

256
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:17,431
The bullet that killed Pops
probably bounced off you.

257
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:21,102
You're one of them, ain't you?

258
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,481
You don't know nothin'.

259
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,400
I know this isn't my fault.

260
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:31,655
Parley or no parley,
this is on Cottonmouth.

261
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,744
[inhales deeply]
So help me hurt him.

262
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:46,335
What do you want?

263
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:49,588
Before you guys decided to rob him...

264
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:53,551
how much did Dante tell you
about Cottonmouth's operations?

265
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:56,179
Everything.

266
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,431
Cottonmouth sells guns.

267
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,059
Mariah, his cousin, runs the banks.

268
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:04,145
-Where does all that money go?
-Everywhere you could think.

269
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:08,107
They got drops and stash houses
across the city.

270
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:12,278
Apartments, sham businesses,
street pushers.

271
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,197
I mean, they got it locked in.

272
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,240
Is there a final spot?

273
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:17,491
A central bank?

274
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,706
[Chico] <i>They got a plan</i>
<i>if shit goes down.</i>

275
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:26,500
<i>Everything goes to Crispus Attucks.</i>

276
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:31,630
<i>I even heard they got</i>
<i>this locked room, like a vault,</i>

277
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:34,050
<i>right in the middle of the whole joint.</i>

278
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:40,849
So why rob a gun shipment
if it was all just about a cash grab?

279
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:45,144
[scoffs] Are you crazy?

280
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:49,691
Man, Crispus Attucks is like a fortress.

281
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,944
I mean, they got concrete walls,

282
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:56,197
cats with machine guns,
machetes, dark hallways...

283
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,117
One entrance, one exit.

284
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,995
[stutters] It's like a beehive of misery.

285
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:04,413
That place is a suicide mission, for real.

286
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,754
Did Dante tell you where
any of these other stash houses are?

287
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:15,383
Yeah. I mean,
yeah, we scoped a few out.

288
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:18,720
There was a shooting this morning.

289
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:20,764
A couple of Cottonmouth's people got hit.

290
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:23,599
Yeah. I mean,
the cops got the guns at the heist.

291
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,227
And my guess is that's Domingo and them,

292
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,230
hollering at Cottonmouth
to let him know they ain't happy.

293
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:32,441
If they hit him a few more times...

294
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:35,987
Cottonmouth might just have to move
everything to Crispus to keep it safe.

295
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:41,200
[scoffs] You gonna try
to convince Domingo to hit 'em up?

296
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:43,244
No.

297
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,622
I don't need Domingo to be Domingo.

298
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,127
I can do that all by myself.

299
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,047
-[man] <i>All right, sound check.</i>
-[soul music playing]

00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,005
[woman speaking indistinctly on radio]

311
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:42,840
Hey...

312
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:44,633
you okay?

313
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,595
What the hell happened here?

314
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:52,600
Some dude in a hoodie rolled through.

315
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,768
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

316
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:59,232
"Rolled through"?
Did you see his face?

317
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:01,817
Hey...

318
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:04,362
what can you tell me about him?

319
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:09,742
He was fine.

320
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,912
[scoffs]

321
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,877
What do you mean everything is fine?

322
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,504
Like I said, it's fine.

323
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:26,384
You've got welders reinforcing
doors to rooms I don't even go into.

324
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:27,551
What are they doing?

325
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:30,763
We got hit today.
We need to take precautions.

326
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:34,767
Get the bars down.
Place looks like a goddamn prison now.

327
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,894
And what do you mean "we"?

328
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:40,564
-You got hit again this morning?
-Four of my stash houses were hit today.

329
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:43,276
Fort Knox is my contingency plan.

330
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,486
It's always been the plan
if shit goes down.

331
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,364
That is not a plan.
That's a reaction.

332
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:51,242
You ever hear of not putting
all your eggs in one basket?

333
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:52,785
Look at it.

334
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:54,870
One way in, one way out.

335
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,498
Sight lines as far as the eye can see.

336
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:00,626
Ain't nobody goin' up in the projects.
We got that shit on lockdown.

337
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:03,421
They are not projects.
It's going to be a community

338
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:06,465
as soon as I get the rest of the funding
and we start our construction.

339
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:08,926
[laughing]

340
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,886
That's just spin.

341
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:14,390
It's a front, Mariah.
It's always been a front.

342
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,267
It's real.

343
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,645
This affordable housing initiative
is going to change things, man.

344
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:22,273
Let me worry about the street shit.

345
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:24,858
-You're just the laundromat for the money.
-Uh, no, I'm not.

346
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:27,445
I'm the face on the money.

347
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,531
So what's that make me?
Loose change?

348
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,783
You are a strong asset,

349
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:36,662
whose reckless actions
are often a liability.

350
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,209
Crispus Attucks is real, Cornell.

351
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:43,711
Nothing I do is a hustle.

352
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:48,424
I sincerely care
about what happens up here.

353
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:51,844
The only way to save Harlem
is to do it legally...

354
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,680
and fortify it against the real invaders.

355
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,640
[laughs] Whatever.

356
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:00,644
It's the same as it always was,
and you know it.

357
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:02,396
Keep livin' in that fantasy land.

358
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,983
Well, it has got to be a fantasy
before it become a reality.

359
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:09,820
I mean, look around.

360
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:13,116
Mama Mabel loved this place.

361
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:17,995
It was her political connections
got that jungle gym over there built.

362
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:21,582
[laughs] We doin' this for jungle gyms?

363
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,128
Those political connections

364
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:29,590
were just freaky old men she blackmailed
to push the paperwork through.

365
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:31,967
Why do you think
she blackmailed those politicians?

366
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,596
It was all to serve a greater good.

367
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,348
Have you forgotten that?

368
00:26:40,268 --> 00:26:41,269
No.

369
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:47,691
This building may be your bank right now.

370
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:50,694
But the Crispus Attucks,
Madam C.J. Walker,

371
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:54,198
Adam Clayton Powell,
Shirley Chisholm complexes

372
00:26:54,282 --> 00:26:57,576
will be vibrant communities
reflecting the change

373
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,164
that's gonna keep Harlem black
and us in the green.

374
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:04,917
You focus on the black,
I'll protect our green.

375
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,421
Fort Knox is central to that.

376
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,130
Just need to be ready.

377
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:13,551
I stay ready, baby.

378
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:39,159
How you doing, Ms. Mariah?
Good to see you.

379
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,542
[Scarfe] <i>Oh, it's gonna work.</i>

380
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:50,254
See, that's the thing
about a dude like Chico.

381
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:52,590
Trick is...

382
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:55,718
you gotta get inside his head.
Uh-huh.

383
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:59,513
You gotta make him believe
that he needs us.

384
00:27:59,597 --> 00:28:01,640
That's the whole trick.

385
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:05,644
And then...
you give him the illusion of freedom.

386
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:08,272
Hey.

387
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,317
You didn't hear a word I just said.

388
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:14,528
I'm sorry.

389
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:17,573
-I can't stop thinking about Pop.
-Hmm.

390
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:20,701
You knew him forever, huh?

391
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,870
Since I was nine.

392
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:24,788
He was the reason I played basketball.

393
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:28,709
-He was your coach?
-No. I never saw him outside the shop.

394
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:31,629
My dad used to drag me with him
when he went to go get his hair cut.

395
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,382
-Daddy's girl.
-Always.

396
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:37,760
They would sit around all the time
and just argue about basketball.

397
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:40,012
Larry Bird. Kevin McHale.

398
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,223
-Robert Parish--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa...

399
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:43,307
Celtics?

400
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:47,853
My dad is a Celtics fan.

401
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:51,189
Please, please tell me
that's not the case.

402
00:28:51,274 --> 00:28:53,776
-The most progressive team in NBA history.
-The Celtics?

403
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:57,112
The first black head coach
with Bill Russell.

404
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:59,698
K.C. Jones as head coach
during the height of the '80s

405
00:28:59,782 --> 00:29:01,617
with Bird and McHale.
Come on.

406
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,577
Now I got it all figured out.

407
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:04,828
See...

408
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:07,415
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend

409
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:08,957
because you love the brothers,

410
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,376
and not many brothers can get with a girl

411
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:13,421
who carry a gun and kick their ass.
But that's not the reason.

412
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,923
-Oh, so now you an expert?
-The reason is...

413
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:18,467
you're a Celtics fan
living in New York City. [chuckles]

414
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:20,636
I like the Pistons.

415
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,095
-Oh, shit!
-[laughs]

416
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:26,642
I would hear Pop and my dad
argue so much about basketball,

417
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,018
it made me wanna play.

418
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:29,812
So I did.

419
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:33,607
Pop would complain about players
who couldn't go left or right,

420
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:35,859
or box out, or hustle back on D.

421
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,528
So, I did.

422
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,613
Sounds like he taught you well.

423
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,284
I was playing college ball
before I realized

424
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:46,787
how much watching games at the shop
and those arguments shaped me.

425
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,748
[sighs] A lot of people loved this guy.

426
00:29:49,832 --> 00:29:53,711
Even when it was wild
during the summers...

427
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:57,506
shootouts every other day...
the shop was safe.

428
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:00,676
Nobody ever said anything.

429
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,553
It just was.

430
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:03,887
Always.

431
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:07,057
Until...

432
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,436
-Until what?
-Until Luke Cage started workin' there.

433
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:16,317
You got a real problem with this guy.

434
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:21,864
Well, maybe, you shouldn't have
jumped in the sack with him so quickly.

435
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,242
-[scoffs]
-[chuckles]

436
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,202
How soon did it happen?

437
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:30,581
A couple days after you were undercover
at the Harlem's Paradise?

438
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:34,835
Same night.

439
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:37,380
[chuckles] Damn, girl!

440
00:30:37,463 --> 00:30:39,673
[chuckles] His place or yours?

441
00:30:39,757 --> 00:30:41,008
Shut up.

442
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:46,430
Look, I'm telling you,
there is just something about this dude.

443
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:48,056
-I can't put my finger on it.
-Mmm.

444
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,850
Sounds like you put a lot more
than your finger on him.

445
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,478
-Don't make me choke you out.
-Hey!

446
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:54,522
Watch the tofu supreme!

447
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:57,065
-[laughing]
-And watch the hair!

448
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:58,942
This takes time.

449
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,819
It's too much product.

450
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:15,626
[Domingo] Damn.

451
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:22,966
You can't really appreciate this place
till the lights are on.

452
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,468
Fall back, Zip.

453
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,849
Domingo's right.

454
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:35,353
When the lights are on...

455
00:31:35,438 --> 00:31:37,856
you really can see things
for what they are.

456
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,984
[speaking Spanish]

457
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:44,947
-I got some <i>verdad</i> for you.
-Hmm.

458
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,450
We got hit.
And it was you.

459
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:52,788
You didn't have to send no mercs
to break up my organization.

460
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:55,583
I think somebody's pulling your chain...

461
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,334
and using my name to do it.

462
00:31:58,461 --> 00:32:02,255
'Cause if my people were to hit you,
you'd be dead.

463
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,340
[speaks Spanish]

464
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:13,767
[chuckles]

465
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:16,394
You know what a plover is, Cornell?

466
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:26,238
Plover bird sits
inside the crocodile's mouth.

467
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:27,615
This bird ain't stupid.

468
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:33,496
The plover picks scraps of meat
out of the crocodile's teeth,

469
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:36,331
helping the crocodile avoid infection.

470
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:39,918
And the plover...
he gets a free meal.

471
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:41,629
[Stokes chuckles]

472
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:45,340
Where's this analogy going,
Animal Planet? [laughs]

473
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,346
You're a plover.

474
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:55,476
I'm a crocodile.

475
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:59,855
You peddle your guns,
picking up my scraps.

476
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:04,652
And I allow it.

477
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,286
So you admit raidin' me?

478
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:15,538
[scoffs]

479
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:21,251
-You think I need to bust your shit up?
-[wrapper crinkling]

480
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:28,466
You broke your word, Cornell.

481
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,888
How does Diamondback feel about that?

482
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:42,940
You didn't think I knew...
who your supplier was that night, huh?

483
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:47,653
I was just checking to see
if you would tell me the truth.

484
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:56,537
I want a refund.

485
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,372
-[scoffs]
-Or the product that was promised me.

486
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:02,459
[laughing] Oh, Domingo.

487
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,297
There ain't no return policy.

488
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,424
This ain't L.L. Bean.

489
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:10,508

Nice.

493
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:46,962
So? What's poppin'?

494
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:53,051
Better get that Spanish dictionary.

495
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:57,598
Domingo Colon just declared war on us.

496
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,279

497
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,469

00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:42,090
It's you.

526
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:49,556
Damn it, you're doing it again. [sighs]

527
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:52,100
Damn it,
you just broke my concentration.

528
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:55,562
As usual,
your priorities are all out of whack.

529
00:39:56,646 --> 00:40:01,026
Now, you're looking at a picture
of an empty husk of a building.

530
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:03,570
I'm looking at millions of dollars
of contraband.

531
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:05,948
You know this money
belongs to Cottonmouth.

532
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:07,365
-Allegedly.
-[sighs]

533
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:09,159
Allegedly.

534
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:12,913
Thing I can't figure out...

535
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,332
why would somebody...

536
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:17,334
go through all this hell outside,

537
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:20,295
cause all this mayhem,
and then leave the money behind?

538
00:40:23,256 --> 00:40:26,218
[sighs] To take it off the streets.

539
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:28,261
Once it's logged,

540
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:31,306
whoever it belongs to
doesn't have access to it anymore.

541
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:33,516
That's quite a message
someone's trying to send.

542
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,020
All that gunfire and no bodies.

543
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:39,272
Oh, you got that right.

544
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:43,068
They are nobodies. [sighing]

545
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:45,778
I mean, no bodies.

546
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:47,364
Not one.

547
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:51,743
Some big black dude in a hoodie
takes on direct bullet shots...

548
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:54,079
slaps, punches
and pulls people all over the place

549
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:55,872
and doesn't kill a single one?

550
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:57,665
That doesn't seem strange to you?

551
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,752
It's like this person wanted us
to shut this place down.

552
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:02,337
Who cares?

553
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:05,048
What?

554
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:06,716
I'm serious.

555
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:09,594
Who cares?

556
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:14,766
How many investigations,
from the time we put boots on the ground,

557
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:17,685
begin and end in these projects?

558
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:18,979
Dozens.

559
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:20,813
And now somebody comes along

560
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:26,153
and wants to clean up
a year's worth of patrol work by himself?

561
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:29,239
[stammers]
I don't see anything wrong with that.

562
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:31,033
A vigilante?

563
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:33,076
Yeah, there's something wrong with that.

564
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,579
It's anarchy,
a complete breakdown of the system.

565
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:38,873
There are rules and regulations
to what we do.

566
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:44,129
Yeah, and lawyers...
and paperwork and excuses.

567
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:47,840
Other than mopping up blood...

568
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:51,636
and arresting the same piece of shit
over and over,

569
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,805
you know, not much we can do as cops.

570
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:56,474
Jesus, Scarfe, whose side are you on?

571
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:58,435
I saw the incident up close.

572
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:01,979
What we can do as cops, what we can't do.

573
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:05,483
Now, unless this sidearm that I'm wearing

574
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,486
suddenly turns into some kind
of magic hammer...

575
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,197
this whole job is irrelevant. [scoffs]

576
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:13,658
They have no training.

577
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:15,660
No responsibility.

578
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:17,579
You have to know what you're doing.

579
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:22,250
They don't have the right
to just start meting out justice. Come on.

580
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:25,712
Some guy in a hoodie...

581
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:29,591
hits various gun-running spots
around the city today?

582
00:42:29,674 --> 00:42:31,008
I think that's wonderful.

583
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:32,344
I think we should thank him.

584
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,637
-For doing our job?
-Exactly.

585
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:36,889
I don't like paperwork...

586
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:38,641
but I'd rather get a paper cut
on my finger

587
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,310
than a bullet in my ass.

588
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:43,188
Look at... Look at all them rounds.
Look.

589
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:44,981
You really wanna be
in the middle of all this?

590
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:47,692
And for what?
[stutters] For a chicken banquet dinner

591
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:50,278
and a photo with the mayor as a reward?
[scoffing]

592
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:51,946
-Hell, no.
-Wow.

593
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:57,244
You are a credit to the badge, Scarfe.

594
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:58,953
[cell phone ringing]

595
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,998
Hello.

596
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:04,251
Glad to hear it.

597
00:43:07,044 --> 00:43:08,213
Where?

598
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,760
We'll be there.

599
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:15,553
-It has to be you.
-[Scarfe] Uh-huh.

600
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:17,639
I'll pick you up out front.

601
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:20,517
That was Chico.

602
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:23,978
He wants to talk, needs a pick up.

603
00:43:24,979 --> 00:43:27,732
-This is where you say, "I told you so"?
-Somethin' like that.

604
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:30,610
-You coming?
-No.

605
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:34,406
Your guy in the hoodie left plenty
for the real cops to clean up.

606
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:38,118
I'll get Chico to give up the ghost.
We got rapport.

607
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:40,287
Yeah, you're all about rapport.

608
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,372
Oh, you know that.

609
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:43,540
See you when I see you.

610
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,168
[scoffs]

611
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:49,296
Did you see the guy who attacked you?

612
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:52,257
[tsks] Man, I ain't see shit.

613
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,592
I really need that trademark.

614
00:44:00,473 --> 00:44:02,975
[ship horn blaring]

615
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:06,354
[Scarfe] I was always
a Jumbo's guy myself.

616
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:10,107
Used to love Willie Burger
back in the day.

617
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:14,321
But I can't give up the fries. [chuckling]

618
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:15,530
True.

619
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,201
Where's Detective Knight?

620
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:21,869
Busy.

621
00:44:24,872 --> 00:44:26,874
I suppose you heard about...

622
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:29,461
what happened
at the Crispus Attucks today.

623
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:34,341
That's why I called.

624
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:38,761
It's my turn.

625
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:42,515
Your turn for what?

626
00:44:43,975 --> 00:44:46,186
Tell you everything.

627
00:44:50,857 --> 00:44:52,191
I'm listening.

628
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:56,821
Somebody told me...

629
00:44:56,904 --> 00:44:59,156
we owe it to Pops to come forward.

630
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:03,620
He did his part.

631
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:05,330
I gotta do mine.

632
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:11,127
I'm ready to talk.

633
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:14,506
Cottonmouth.

634
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,300
I'll name names, dates.

635
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:19,927
The whole nine.

636
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:25,975
Pop...

637
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:30,397
he used to always talk to me
about responsibility.

638
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:34,150
About being a man.

639
00:45:36,903 --> 00:45:38,613
Standing up straight.

640
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:43,993
He told me to take charge.

641
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:47,455
Forward, never backwards.

642
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,877
[stutters]

643
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,505
Luke Cage, I don't even-- [gasps]

644
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:57,590
[Scarfe grunting]

645
00:45:57,674 --> 00:45:59,342
[choking]

646
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:17,652
[panting]

647
00:46:22,532 --> 00:46:24,116
[sniffs]

648
00:46:58,192 --> 00:46:59,777
[glass shattering]

649
00:46:59,861 --> 00:47:02,947
-$7 million!
-Cornell!

650
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,408
You don't wanna be
in my face right now, Mariah!

651
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:08,077
If anybody should be breaking shit,
it should be me!

652
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,788
They hit my office.
My office!

653
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:12,957
They took damn near every penny I got,

654
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,501
and you up here talkin' about an office?

655
00:47:14,584 --> 00:47:16,544
You can always make more money.

656
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:19,296
I can't get my name back.

657
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:23,217
And somebody is gonna
start asking questions.

658
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,429
-Step off, Cornell!
-Shut up, Black Mariah.

659
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:29,432
That's my shit to break!

660
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:34,103
You better shut up,
or I will cut your color-struck ass.

661
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:35,229
Call me that again.

662
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:38,065
Uh, Mr. Stokes?

663
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:40,568
Spit it out.

664
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:43,821
There's-- There's a detective here
to see you.

665
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:46,866
The cops are here?

666
00:47:50,995 --> 00:47:53,831
-Detective.
-Well, I've had warmer receptions.

667
00:47:53,915 --> 00:47:58,252
What's the use of having a pig on payroll
if you can't get no early intel?

668
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:01,423
[scoffing] Oh, I've got your intel.
Swinging.

669
00:48:01,506 --> 00:48:03,007
[chuckles softly]

670
00:48:07,386 --> 00:48:08,805
Oh, yeah.

671
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,936
[pouring drink]

672
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:18,898
[grunts]

673
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:26,656
Anything related to how I lost
80% of my cash reserves?

674
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:29,701
Maybe. Maybe.

675
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:36,583
In my trunk,
you will find a deceased individual.

676
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:39,293
One Wilfredo "Chico" Diaz.

677
00:48:39,376 --> 00:48:41,337
I'm sure your homie
down at Spurlock's Mortuary

678
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,755
can hook you up.

679
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:46,468
So that's off your plate.
You're welcome.

680
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:52,431
What else you got for me?

681
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:53,725
What else I got for ya?

682
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:57,479
What else I got-- Oh, well...

683
00:48:57,562 --> 00:49:00,397
I know who's been
busting up your shit all day,

684
00:49:00,482 --> 00:49:04,068
and who raided the projects...
all by himself.

685
00:49:05,444 --> 00:49:09,073
Don't imagine you know anything about...

686
00:49:10,575 --> 00:49:12,827
Luke Cage, do you?

687
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:14,912
Luke Cage?

688
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:18,791
That's who did all this shit?

689
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:20,502
That's what I'm telling you.

690
00:49:21,711 --> 00:49:25,464
And as a proud NYPD detective...

691
00:49:25,548 --> 00:49:27,925
see, my partner and I, well...

692
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:29,761
we're accountable for each other.

693
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:33,097
We need to know
each other's whereabouts, 24/7.

694
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,684
And thanks to my partner's
GPS on her phone,

695
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:39,478
I got Mr. Cage's home address.

696
00:49:39,562 --> 00:49:40,688
And I will give it to you...

697
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:43,190
if you're a good boy.

698
00:49:43,274 --> 00:49:44,483
[chuckles]

699
00:49:46,736 --> 00:49:47,987
Virginia Slim...

700
00:49:49,363 --> 00:49:51,198
you just might prove to be useful.

701
00:49:51,282 --> 00:49:53,075
Virginia Slim, what's that?

702
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:55,703
What else do you call
a skinny white bitch?

703
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:57,163
[laughs]

704
00:49:58,247 --> 00:50:01,125
Time for me to go holler
at the dishwasher.

705
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,334
Personally.

706
00:50:04,378 --> 00:50:07,632
Don't want to know the details.
Just get it done.

707
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:12,053
[music playing faintly]

708
00:50:22,479 --> 00:50:23,606
[grunts]

709
00:50:25,066 --> 00:50:26,275
[door closes]

710
00:50:27,193 --> 00:50:28,778
Goddamn, negro.

711
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:32,323
You all right? What happened to you?
You get hit by a bus?

712
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:35,409
Swear jar.

713
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:36,493
You cursed.

714
00:50:36,578 --> 00:50:40,665
Swear jar?
Come on, man. I...

715
00:50:40,748 --> 00:50:43,167
All right, look,
I don't have anything on me now.

716
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:54,804
[Luke] Yeah, you do.

717
00:50:57,056 --> 00:50:59,726
Now you've got change
that can make change.

718
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:04,647
-[sighs]
-What the hell did you do?

719
00:51:05,982 --> 00:51:08,818
Oh, can you forget
the swear jar for a minute?

720
00:51:10,903 --> 00:51:12,404
What the--

721
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:22,414
Where'd all this money come from?

722
00:51:23,374 --> 00:51:26,210
Bank's not worried about it...
neither should you.

723
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:29,255
Use it for this.

724
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:33,217
You ain't gotta tell me twice.

725
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,845
Ask no questions, tell no lies.

726
00:51:35,928 --> 00:51:39,056
I'll call some people
and we get started on this in here.

727
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:41,517
Good.

728
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:44,687
I see you been at it.

729
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:45,772
[scoffs] Yeah.

730
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,690
You, too.

731
00:51:51,944 --> 00:51:53,279
Why haven't you gone home yet?

732
00:51:53,362 --> 00:51:55,114
[sighs]

733
00:51:55,197 --> 00:51:57,825
Couldn't leave this place lookin' so bad.

734
00:51:57,909 --> 00:52:00,912
That was the thing about Pops.
He had a lot of pride in detail.

735
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:04,791
Like that gold leaf window
with the Pop's Barber Shop logo?

736
00:52:04,874 --> 00:52:08,252
[chuckles]
I polished it every day.

737
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:12,381
P-O-P. Had to be spotless.

738
00:52:12,464 --> 00:52:14,175
[chuckling]

739
00:52:14,258 --> 00:52:16,969
First thing Pop said when he hired me was,

740
00:52:17,053 --> 00:52:19,305
"You do windows, brother."

741
00:52:19,388 --> 00:52:21,766
-That wasn't no question.
-[both chuckling]

742
00:52:23,517 --> 00:52:24,852
[sighs]

743
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,819
We need this place open.

744
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:35,237
I know.

745
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:40,534
You gonna run it?

746
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:42,704
I ain't no barber.

747
00:52:42,787 --> 00:52:44,080
What about you?

748
00:52:44,163 --> 00:52:46,498
[sighing]

749
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:51,170
Another question for another time, my man.

750
00:52:53,505 --> 00:52:56,300
We gotta figure out
something soon either way.

751
00:52:59,595 --> 00:53:01,388
[sighs] I will.

752
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:04,308
You should know that about me by now.

753
00:53:05,434 --> 00:53:06,936
I like to get things done.

754
00:53:07,979 --> 00:53:09,605
Oh...

755
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:11,023
Where you goin' now?

756
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:14,276
I'm starving.

757
00:53:19,448 --> 00:53:21,200
[whistles softly]

758
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:29,083
[sighs]

759
00:53:33,337 --> 00:53:35,589
I've never seen you eat so much.

760
00:53:36,673 --> 00:53:38,801
I guess I worked up
a bit of an appetite today.

761
00:53:38,885 --> 00:53:40,511
Did you go for your run?

762
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:43,597
Something like that.

763
00:53:55,192 --> 00:53:56,693
The food wasn't that good.

764
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:58,905
I just wanted to make things right.

765
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,534
Where'd the money come from?

766
00:54:03,617 --> 00:54:05,161
It doesn't matter.

767
00:54:06,162 --> 00:54:08,664
What matters is what you do with it.

768
00:54:31,896 --> 00:54:33,439
Sweet sister!

769
00:54:45,993 --> 00:54:47,161
[chuckles]
