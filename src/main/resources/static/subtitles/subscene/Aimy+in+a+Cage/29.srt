The Cage of Love

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,590
<i>Episode 29</i>

20
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,430
Even if they suspect me, they can't find any evidence now.

21
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,590
Furthermore, I'm the Military Governor's woman.

22
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,450
For sure they don't have any evidence.

23
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,340
By the way, that rotten rascal Ma Li,

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,740
ever since we saved him from the police, he has gone missing.

25
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,080
I wonder where he is hiding.

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,460
The so-called strong dragon is hiding like a snake.

27
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,850
He grew up in Huzhou.

28
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,720
If he really wants to hide from us,

29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,020
it will be really hard to flush him out.

30
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,480
Thankfully you were always wary of him, Miss.

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,750
Even if Zhou Shao Tian has his own men,

32
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,140
he wouldn't know about us.

33
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,330
Forget it. Let him go.

34
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,820
Let's use our energy to focus on the secret formula.

35
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,780
Miss. Where are you going?

36
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,490
I'm going to see the Military Governor.

37
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,290
I need to serve him well now.

38
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,030
I can't do anything about Police Chief Li now.

39
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,180
This is really hard on you.

40
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,250
What is there to suffer for?

41
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,470
Everything in this world is a transaction.

42
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,070
What I have left now

43
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,990
is just this body.

44
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,430
If I don't use my body as a transaction, what else can I use?

45
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,350
I'm useless.

46
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,320
Miss.

47
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,190
Uncle Lai. What are you saying?

48
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,970
Once I get the secret formula, we will leave for a far distant place.

49
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,990
And start anew.

50
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,570
Sit.

51
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,070
Go out first.

52
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,610
Zhou Shao Tian. Old Cai said that Wu Hong Da was on the phone.

53
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,450
He was going to meet an important client.

54
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,760
That's right. Wu Hong Da told me that he had a very important client that day.

55
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,700
At noon, all three of you weren't at the scene.

56
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,770
Thus, the fourth person that Wu Hong Da met

57
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,040
is very likely to be the killer.

58
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,140
Looking at this now, when Ling Long was facing problems,

59
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,310
and Jiang Yu was in a hurry to acquire Ling Long,

60
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,610
it's possible that person gave him a loan.

61
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,790
I remember that Lu Man visited Wu Hong Da to talk about a collaboration.

62
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,890
Accordingly to the Old Cao's testimony, he was kidnapped because of the secret recipe.

63
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,650
Moreover, it was a young woman.

64
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,130
Thus, I think that the last person to see Wu Hong Da, I'm eighty percent sure that

65
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,980
it was Lu Man. She has been eyeing the secret formula for a long time.

66
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,730
We can try to combine all pieces of evidence together

67
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,180
and create a false plan.

68
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:41,290
Lu Man went to find Wu Hong Da to get the secret formula but he gave the secret formula to Jiang Yu.

69
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,360
When Lu Man couldn't get the secret formula, she killed him.

70
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,770
She had motive

71
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,500
because she wanted to get the secret formula.

72
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,720
She is the Military Governor's concubine.

73
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,030
My father could have borrowed money from the Military Governor.

74
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,090
So he humbly asked iss Lu for help.

75
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,440
Lu Man killed my father.

76
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,900
Cai Hong, we need to uncover facts.

77
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,280
The way the police works is that we need evidence.

78
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,980
Even more so, since Lu Man is the Military Governor's woman,

79
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,480
before we have any concrete evidence, we must be careful.

80
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,950
Otherwise it will all come to naught.

81
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,730
Cai Hong. Old Cai's testimony already proved that Zhou Shao Tian didn't kill your father

82
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,220
but he embezzled money and faked the ledgers. This is a crime.

83
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,710
We can now sell Rong Da.

84
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,720
The returns from the sale and also the Wu Mansion, we will return them to you

85
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,940
to compensate for your losses.

86
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,260
Director Chen, something's not right.

87
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,570
Look at the deed for the Wu family's home. The name on it is Miss Wu Cai Hong

88
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,780
and not Zhou Shao Tian.

89
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,390
Also,

90
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,390
Rong Da's deed and all the assets

91
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,080
are also registered under MIss Wu Cai Hong's name.

92
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,190
So to say, everything that Zhou Shao Tian stole still belongs to Miss Wu?

93
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,340
Director Chen. It's all in black and white on the documents.

94
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,640
According to this document,

95
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,630
other than cash, Rong Da's assets and the Wu family's Mansion already belong to Miss Wu.

96
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,560
We don't need to settle this anymore.

97
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,120
I get it. You can leave first.

98
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,500
Yes.

99
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,960
Looks like your father didn't totally misjudge Zhou Shao Tian.

100
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,910
He was really sincere to you.

101
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,200
Based on the situation now, did Brother Shao Tian commit any crimes?

102
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,380
The courts still need to decide,

103
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,810
but I guess he could go to prison for a long period of time.

104
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,960
Director Chen. Please help me. I don't want Brother Shao Tian to go to jail.

105
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,120
You can't be emotional.

106
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,470
Zhou Shao Tian committed a crime. He needs to pay the price.

107
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,900
To add further, he's connected to your father's death.

108
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,560
Didn't you want to take revenge for your father?

109
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,620
It was retribution.

110
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,480
If it weren't for the revenge, Brother Shao Tian wouldn't have done all that.

111
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,090
He already returned the money to me.

112
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,340
Even more so, he took Ling Long's money to teach my father a lesson.

113
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,150
He wanted to let my father know what it felt to be penniless. He really didn't want to harm my father.

114
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:34,420
Furthermore, when my father passed away, he did everything to help my family.

115
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,890
I don't want to send such a kind man to jail.

116
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,950
Director Chen. Please help me.

117
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:48,510
Cai Hong. I have been a policeman for many years.

118
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:53,570
I have caught many criminals. Each of them had their own stories.

119
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,820
I always remind myself of this phrase.

120
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,930
Poor person is his own savior.

121
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,690
The law is to protect society.

122
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,990
To punish those who have committed crimes.

123
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:11,350
I'm a policeman. I can't teach you how to protect a criminal.

124
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,050
Sorry.

125
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,990
Director Chen.

126
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,730
There is really no way to help Brother Shao Tian?

127
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,010
I'm begging you. Please help him.

128
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,550
Director Chen.

129
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,960
I can only tell you that if no one reports this case,

130
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,940
there is no case then.

131
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,790
I get it.

132
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,090
I will withdraw the report for Brother Zhou Shao Tian. Thank you, Director Chen.

133
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,680
Wait a minute.

134
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,530
I hope that one day both your father and Zhao Shan will learn about your good intentions.

135
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,000
They definitely will.

136
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,710
I just talked to Director Chen.

137
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,940
I don't want Brother Shao Tian to be jailed. Thus, I'm going to sign an amicable agreement with him.

138
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,600
You are not even asking me why?

139
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,090
If you don't do this, you are the not the Wu Cai Hong I know.

140
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,480
He committed those crimes because of my father.

141
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,180
Thus, I don't blame him.

142
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,080
Furthermore, I want to do my best to help him.

143
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,140
Thank you, Jiang Yu.

144
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,140
Why are you thanking me?

145
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,700
Zhou Shao Tian owes your family the money. It's not even my money.

146
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:54,600
Then, can you give me the chance to make amends for my father's mistakes?

147
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,650
What era are we in now?

148
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,790
Is it still a trend for the daughter to pay back?

149
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,130
I have already gotten Ling Long's secret formula. You don't owe me anything.

150
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,500
Zhou Shao Tian.

151
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,460
Brother Shao Tian.

152
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,020
Are you okay?

153
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:39,060
Cai Hong. I did so many bad things to your family

154
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,290
and you are still helping me. You are too foolish.

155
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,360
Zhou Shou Tian, we already took Ling Long's money as evidence.

156
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,980
But now, I hope there is an out of court settlement and withdrawal your complaint.

157
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,950
Cai Hong. You don't need to do this for me.

158
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,850
I don't want you to go to jail.

159
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,850
Cai Hong.

160
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,070
I'm a criminal and I deserve it.

161
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,460
You don't need to plead on my behalf anymore.

162
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,440
I'm corrupted.

163
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,900
Even if I'm released, I would be unable to live a life out there.

164
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,720
Better to let me stay in prison. Let me stay here for the rest of my life.

165
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,730
It would be a relief.

166
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,090
Don't say this.

167
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,090
This was all my father's faults.

168
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,970
If it weren't for him,

169
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,000
your father wouldn't have died.

170
00:12:54,590 --> 00:13:00,720
Cai Hong. If you both sign this amicable settlement, Zhou Shao Tian will be free.

171
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,760
Let me accept the punishment here.

172
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,990
Brother Shao Tian. I'm begging you.

173
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:15,980
Don't just give up like this. If you leave, you can start anew again.

174
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,070
Can I really start anew?

175
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,960
Just like when you first helped me, I will do my best to help you too.

176
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,010
They haven't found my father's killer yet.

177
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,060
I still need your help.

178
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,840
Zhou Shao Tian, Cai Hong's good intentions,

179
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,920
I would advise you to accept them.

180
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,950
When you get out, you can pay back Cai Hong and the Wu family.

181
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,030
It will be more meaningful for you than to stay here.

182
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:12,820
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

183
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,570
Mom.

184
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,710
Shao Tian.

185
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,850
You are home.

186
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,060
I'm home.

187
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,480
Do you know how worried I was about you?

188
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,310
Thanks, Mom.

189
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,160
Everyone was sure that I was the killer.

190
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,930
You were the only one who believed that I was innocent.

191
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,000
Foolish child.

192
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,130
I'm your mother.

193
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:32,380
No matter what happens, I will always believe you.

194
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,850
If you have not seek Cai Hong in time to tell her so,

195
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,030
I'm afraid that I would already have been executed.

196
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,730
Miss Wu already told you?

197
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,700
For the past few days,

198
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,140
I have been thinking a lot in the cell.

199
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:08,450
The threat of an impending death made me want to understand many things.

200
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,110
I didn't understand why when dad died,

201
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,060
you made such a decision.

202
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:20,100
Mom. I committed many mistakes in the past.

203
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,010
I was wrong.

204
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,310
I'm sorry.

205
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,170
I'm sorry.

206
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,500
Shao Tian.

207
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,290
You are home.

208
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,390
You are home.

209
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,450
I'm home.

210
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,940
It's good that you are home.

211
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,550
My Shao Tian has come home.

212
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,390
I'm home.

213
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,280
Let me take a look.

214
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,920
You have lost weight.

215
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,080
I'm fine.

216
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,750
You have lost weight.

217
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,290
I'm fine.

218
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,640
You have suffered.

219
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,910
I'm fine, Mom.

220
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,140
Get up.

221
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,070
Come, sit.

222
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,790
Actually, I really didn't do anything

223
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:21,960
but you must not forget Miss Wu's great kindness.

224
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm just afraid that

225
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,240
I will never be able to lift up my head in front of her again.

226
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,530
Don't think this way.

227
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:39,060
I can see that Miss Wu treats you very well.

228
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,980
But now,

229
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,400
the only thing that I can do now

230
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,180
is to do my best to help her find the killer of her father.

231
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,140
I won't disappoint her again.

232
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:15,330
Dear. With you watching over us, our daughter has retrieved Ling Long's money.

233
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,010
Ling Long's factory and the Wu Mansion

234
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,120
belong to us again.

235
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,580
Thank you God for protecting us.

236
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,940
Stepmom.

237
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,160
I would like to discuss something with you.

238
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,010
Cai Hong. Are you crazy?

239
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,410
Zhou Shao Tian is our family's enemy.

240
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,480
If he didn't betray Old Master and steal Ling Long's money,

241
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,720
Jiang Yu wouldn't have acquired Ling Long that easily.

242
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,040
Forget it that we didn't settle the score with him. He even gave Rong Da to him.

243
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,440
What are you thinking of?

244
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,160
In my opinion, Rong Da is not just a sum of money, but also a first class company with great equipment and dedicated workers.

245
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,760
What's most important is that it was due to Brother Shao Tian's hard work.

246
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,890
He stole it.

247
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,680
If he didn't steal Ling Long's money, with his poor state, how could he have set up Rong Da?

248
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,440
He stole Ling Long's money to take revenge against father. He really wasn't in it for the money.

249
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,290
Even more so when Father owes them a life. I want to use this redeem ourselves.

250
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,350
Brother Shao Tian knows about management.

251
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,410
In my opinion, no one is more suitable than him to run Rong Da.

252
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,520
How did Zhou Shao Tian charm you?

253
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,290
When he was doing well, you didn't want to be with him.

254
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,000
Not that he's broke and not worth anything,

255
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,900
you still sympathize with him and you even want to help him.

256
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,140
Do you want to marry him?

257
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,620
After having gone through so many events, it's impossible for the both of us.

258
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,960
Cai Yun. Don't just stand here and say nothing.

259
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,150
Rong Da belongs to the Wu family.

260
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,320
What are your views?

261
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,590
Sister is right. I will listen to her.

262
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,440
You!

263
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,220
I don't care. Even if the both of you can't manage the company,

264
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,850
we can still sell Rong Da.

265
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,080
Why should we give it to Zhou Shao Tian?

266
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,330
Mom. We are already very fortunate to have our home.

267
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,210
Even so, father snatched Ling Long away from the Jiang family.

268
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,450
I feel that Sister is right in doing this.

269
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,350
Just give in to Sister.

270
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,600
- Mom. <br>- Stepmom.

271
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,110
Aunt.

272
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,300
Brother Shao Tian.

273
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,080
Cai Hong, you are here.

274
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,150
- Aunt. <br>- Miss Wu.

275
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,540
- What are you doing? Get up. <br>- Thank you.

276
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,850
Shao Tian and I should publish a notice of thanks.

277
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,320
Thank you for your kindness in saving him.

278
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,170
Thank you for signing an amicable settlement with him and giving him his freedom.

279
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,810
I will never be able to repay your kindness in this lifetime.

280
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,910
Aunt, get up first.

281
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,990
Get up first and we will talk.

282
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:56,310
When my family was in trouble, he has helped us a lot.

283
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,990
So, this is what I should do.

284
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:08,690
Cai Hong. Don't worry. I will find of a way to find your father's killer.

285
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,160
I will continue to investigate this.

286
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,900
But I'm here today to discuss something else with Brother Shao Tian.

287
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,460
Speak.

288
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,970
I have decided to let you manage Rong Da.

289
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:33,650
Miss Wu. We don't deserve this. You are already being extremely kind to forgive Shao Tian.

290
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,310
- With Rong Da, we cannot accept it. <br>- Cai Hong, did you take into consideration that

291
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,690
but by doing this, don't you think it makes me very pitiful?

292
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,730
Brother Shao Tian. I made this decision after carefully considering this.

293
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,840
Rong Da is an exquisite and profitable company.

294
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,590
It's also part of Ling Long.

295
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,440
It's also my father's business.

296
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,530
You should know that Cai Yun and I doesn't know anything about management.

297
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,290
It will only go bankrupt in our hands.

298
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,090
Why don't we hand it over to someone who's experienced to manage it?

299
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,980
I believe that Rong Da will do well under your management.

300
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,520
Huzhou is such a big place.

301
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,020
I'm not the only know who knows about the dyeing industry.

302
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,030
But our Wu family only trusts you.

303
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,410
Your father's death was also caused by my father.

304
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,470
I hope that I can use it to redeem my family.

305
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,870
It's already in the past.

306
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,220
We have already clear this up.

307
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,760
Even more so,

308
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,990
I also wronged the Wu family.

309
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,910
That's because

310
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,850
you feel apologetic towards my family and Lin Long.

311
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,500
Thus, you should manage Rong Da well

312
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,040
and manage my father's business well.

313
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,380
Do you really want to me to manage Rong Da?

314
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,980
Yes.

315
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,860
Okay, I agree.

316
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,910
This is the authorization paper. Brother Shao Tian is the General Manager of Rong Da.

317
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,150
Also,

318
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,990
this bracelet,

319
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,770
I'm returning this to you.

320
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,750
As of now,

321
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,960
we don't owe each other anything else.

322
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,780
Cai Hong.

323
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,610
Is this the answer that you are giving me?

324
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,070
I remember you told me that

325
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,010
we can start anew.

326
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,720
Sorry.

327
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,530
You don't need to apologise to me.

328
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,470
You really don't need to.

329
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,880
This is fate.

330
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,450
I can only hate fate.

331
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:06,110
If I didn't have any grudges with your family, we wouldn't have come to this stage.

332
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,460
Brother Shao Tian.

333
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,720
This bad deed

334
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,630
met with a wrong opponent.

335
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,980
Thus,

336
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,040
everything was doomed.

337
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:37,070
As for happiness, it depends on the right time

338
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,590
and the right person.

339
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,180
It's Jiang Yu, right?

340
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:19,030
Brother Shao Tian. You will meet a better woman than me.

341
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,250
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

342
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,460
<i>Whether you care or not,</i>

343
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,990
<i>whether you respond or not,</i>

344
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,570
<i>or whether you know or not,</i>

345
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,870
<i>that in this world,</i>

346
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:10,870
<i>there will always be someone watching over you.</i>

347
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,010
<i>Beatiful and bright rainbow,</i>

348
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,060
<i>appears only when the skies are no longer filled with rain.</i>

349
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,900
<i>No matter how, we will never be able to catch it.</i>

350
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,030
Brother.

351
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,630
- Fei Fei. <br>-I got good news.

352
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,940
Wu Cai Hong gave Rong Da to Zhou Shao Tian.

353
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,960
Looks like Wu Cai Hong loves Zhou Shao Tian very much.

354
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,360
Brother Zhou Shao Tian did so many things. She didn't even teach him a lesson.

355
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,330
That's because Wu Cai Hong is too kind.

356
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:59,990
Good always prevails against evil. We can only hope it can also ever come the hatred.

357
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,140
Brother.

358
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:08,060
Then... do you still like Wu Cai Hong?

359
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,530
Do you have any other matters?

360
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,420
If no, I'm going to work.

361
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,950
You are going to work now?

362
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:21,360
When you were injured and stayed in the hospital, you still went out with Cai Hong with your wounds.

363
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,490
I see you are quite bored recently.

364
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,990
Brother, until when are you going to act like this?

365
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,530
I already said many times.

366
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:38,120
I did this to find out who the killer of Wu Hong Da is.

367
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,350
Do you need to do this?

368
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,210
It has already been proven that you are not the killer.

369
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:47,010
Who the killer is, it doesn't concern us at all.

370
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,300
You are trying to help Wu Cai Hong to find the killer.

371
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,130
Frankly, you still want to be with her.

372
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,790
Are you done talking?

373
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,760
Miss, Director Chen is requesting to see you.

374
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,270
Director Chen?

375
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,190
Let him wait downstairs.

376
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,570
Yes.

377
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,520
- Miss Lu. <br>- Director Chen.

378
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,700
I didn't notify you in advance. I hope that I didn't impose on you.

379
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,010
Talking about this, you did.

380
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,950
I have an appointment with the Military Governor.

381
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:50,720
If you insist that I don't go, I don't have a choice then.

382
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,560
Please sit.

383
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,730
Okay.

384
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:01,300
I wonder why you are here to see me.

385
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,360
Miss Lu. I have a few questions to consult you.

386
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,740
Please speak.

387
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,690
Regarding the previous owner, Wu Hong Da,

388
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,070
do you still remember him, Miss Lu?

389
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,080
Yes.

390
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,800
We investigated and heard that before the incident happened to Wu Hong Da,

391
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,900
you went to meet him.

392
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,370
Yes. At that time, I wanted to set up a dyeing factory in Huzhou.

393
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,570
Thus, I paid him a visit.

394
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,470
The first time was with my father, when I wanted to get acquainted with him.

395
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,630
And the second time was when I wanted to share something with Master Wu.

396
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,850
What's wrong with this?

397
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:41,740
Looks like Miss Lu is very interested in the secret formula.

398
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,520
I do want the secret formula but within Huzhou,

399
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,960
there are many others who want it too.

400
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,790
Director Chen. Think about this. If Wu Hong Da didn't have the secret formula,

401
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,690
first, I'm not short of money and contacts.

402
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,570
Why would I want to share it with him?

403
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,890
Then, on the day of Wu Hong Da's incident,

404
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,410
did you see him?

405
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,320
It was such a long time ago.,

406
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,750
How could I remember it?

407
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,740
Please try to remember.

408
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,600
It seems like I was with a friend that day.

409
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,450
Director Chen. Since you have the time, why don't you pay that friend of mine a visit?

410
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:28,230
He should be able to testify.

411
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:33,290
Listening to you, are you suspecting me?

412
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,750
Of course not.

413
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,230
We rely on evidence in our line of work.

414
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,040
I just want to clear every detail of this case.

415
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,370
By the way, Miss Lu, I would still like to ask you a question.

416
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,090
Wu Hong Da's staff, Old Cai, was kidnapped a few days ago.

417
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,300
It wasn't easy for us to save him.

418
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,330
In the end, he told me that the person who kidnapped him was a young woman.

419
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,650
She also kept asking about

420
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,140
- the secret formula... <br>- Director Chen.

421
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,440
In Huzhou,

422
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,470
there are many young women.

423
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,040
If you came to question me based on a groundless rumour,

424
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,760
I feel it is a little bit inappropriate.

425
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,700
It was Zhou Shao Tian's man, Ma Li who told us that

426
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,520
he told you that the secret formula was with Old Cai's wife.

427
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,320
Yes. Ma Li did tell me.

428
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,890
I also used his tip to find Old Cai's wife

429
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:27,090
but Director Chen, I looked for his wife to buy the secret formula.

430
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,040
I didn't do anything else.

431
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,530
If this is the case, I can also prove that Jiang Yu went to find Old Cai's wife for the secret formula too.

432
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,780
Furthermore, the secret formula belongs to the Jiang family in the first place.

433
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,000
He would want the secret formula more than I do.

434
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,100
Is this how you conduct your case?

435
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,680
Director Chen. You said that you are not suspecting me

436
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,930
but to me it seems like you are investigating me undercover.

437
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:54,920
Sorry. I have an appointment with the Military Governor.

438
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,050
I won't be seeing you out.

439
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:11,030
Miss Lu. I'm only here today on official matters. If I have offended you, please accept my apologies.

440
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:17,700
Director Chen. I hope that you find concrete evidence first before you return here with official matters.

441
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,890
I'm not this patient all the time.

442
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,990
Uncle Lai, see the guest out.

443
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,550
This way, please.

444
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,880
Sister, what are you doing?

445
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,920
I am packing a milled powder.

446
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,920
- Are you having a fever? <br>- It's not for me.

447
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,650
Is it Brother Shao Tian then?

448
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,210
No.

449
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,490
Sister, where are you going?

450
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:14,410
To the police station to check if there is any progress in the case. Be good and wait here for me.

451
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,540
Police station?

452
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:21,070
If she's not going with Brother Shao Tian,

453
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,640
she must be going with Jiang Yu.

454
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,510
Mr Jiang.

455
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,590
Uncle Lai. Prepare the rickshaw.

456
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,450
I'm going to see the Military Governor.

457
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,980
Miss.

458
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,610
Military Governor. What are you here?

459
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,020
Did you come to pick me up?

460
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:06,810
Who is so brave to make you so angry?

461
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:11,330
Chief Police Li just phoned me.

462
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,330
He said that Director Chen will be visiting you to have a talk.

463
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:19,030
I believe you already met Superintendent Chen.

464
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:23,120
I thought what could happen. It's just this small matter.

465
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,450
You are unhappy.

466
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,070
Is that so?

467
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,770
Human life is such a trivial issue, right?

468
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:36,010
Yet what else could be bigger than this?

469
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,190
Military Governor.

470
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,910
I have been framed.

471
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,220
I raised flowers to look at them.

472
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,170
I raised a dog out of boredom.

473
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:00,410
I raised you so that you can live well.

474
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:03,300
It's to make me happy

475
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,950
and not for you to give me trouble!

476
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,410
Military Governor. I was framed. I didn't do anything.

477
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:16,100
Don't be so anxious to explain yourself. I am a warlord.

478
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,300
Even dogs hide from me.

479
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,010
I would also never let anyone take advantage of me.

480
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:32,240
Moreover, you are better than a dog. At least you can talk.

481
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,760
But mark this.

482
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,990
If you give me any trouble and make me unhappy,

483
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,830
I will strangle you to death.

484
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,210
I understand. I won't give you any trouble.

485
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,840
I definitely won't give you any trouble.

486
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,290
I don't care whether you really did it or not.

487
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,110
Don't ever do it again.

488
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,290
I understand.

489
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:02,060
In the future, I will only make you happy and won't give you any trouble.

490
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:09,170
Don't be sad. I already talked to Chief Police Li.

491
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,960
If they don't have any real evidence, they won't dare to disturb you again.

492
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,170
I know that you still dote on me.

493
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,490
You said that

494
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,780
I'm better than a dog.

495
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,610
I will be better than a dog.

496
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,370
Do you know that?

497
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,120
Will I really know that?

498
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,870
Military Governor.

499
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,900
Military Governor.

500
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,170
I made this drug accordingly to the Chinese medicine' recipe.

501
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,720
It will help the injuries to heal faster.

502
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,140
You can try this.

503
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,990
I'm not even a woman. How could I need to be so fair and clear.

504
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,860
Okay, thanks.

505
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:47,210
- What a coincidence. <br>- It's a coincidence.

506
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,740
We are here to check if there is any new progress on the Wu Hong Da's case.

507
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:56,050
I understand this land belongs to Lu Man. So I came to see if I can provide some clues to the police.

508
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,780
Let's go.

509
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,940
I just went to visit Lu Man.

510
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,980
She admitted that she met Wu Hong Da.

511
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,660
She also admitted that she's interested in the secret formula.

512
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,240
Other than this,

513
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,990
we don't have any other leads.

514
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:25,220
People such as Lu Man are vicious like snakes and scorpions. Moreover, she is obsessed with the recipe.

515
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,030
It's eighty nine percent that she killed Boss Wu.

516
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,720
♫<i> How am I to choose </i>♫

517
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:59,120
♫<i> the colour between you and me? </i>♫

518
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,810

00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:10,220
