1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,062
- [breathes deeply]
- [man] What are you doing here, nigga?

2
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,238
I'm not gonna ask you again.

3
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:28,618
Young man...

4
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:32,288
I've had a long day.

5
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,499
I'm tired.

6
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,586
But I'm not tired enough...

7
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:41,005
to ever let nobody call me that word.

8
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:46,678
You see a nigga standin' in
front of you? [breathing heavily]

9
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:50,306
Across the street from a building named
after one of our greatest heroes?

10
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:54,310
- [gun cocks]
- Yeah, a dead one.

11
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:55,687
[Luke exhales]

12
00:00:56,938 --> 00:00:59,440
[theme music playing]

14
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:13,056
[gunshots]

15
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:17,936
[gunshot]

16
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:46,255
[Scarfe] You're doing it
again. I hate it when you do that.

17
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:49,342
Hate it when I do what?

18
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:52,470
Stare at the photos like
they're about to start moving.

19
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:54,597
They are talkin' and movin'.

20
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,076
You just have to be still
enough to hear what they're sayin'.

21
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,684
Whatever, Horton.

22
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,481
A clue is a clue, no matter how small.

23
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:05,608
This was deeply personal.

24
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:08,652
Well, money invites the beast.

25
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:10,650
There's nothing in Chico's jacket

26
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,282
to suggest he was
capable of that type of violence.

27
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:15,409
I don't think he has the stomach for it.

28
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:19,080
Stomach? [sighs]

29
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:21,958
There was vomit found at the junkyard.

30
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,044
Inside it were fibers consistent
with that of a winter mask.

31
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:28,547
One of the robbers didn't have
the heart to go through with it.

32
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:31,425
My guess, it was babyface Chico.

33
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:35,889
Uh, he was the last man standing.

34
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:38,850
You mean to tell me Benjamin
Franklin was wrong?

35
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:43,062
Well, in this case, it was all
about the Benjamins either way.

36
00:03:43,146 --> 00:03:44,856
[scoffs] Always is.

37
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,067
Somebody got jacked, and
somebody got pissed...

38
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:50,069
And somebody got dead.

39
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:52,363
This ain't over yet.

40
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:08,880
Eh, I just never got into Donald Goines.

41
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:10,256
[chuckling] Are you crazy?

42
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:14,052
Donald Goines was a street poet.

43
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:16,554
- [Pop chuckles]
- [Luke] I didn't say Goines isn't.

44
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:20,058
But Walter Mosley, George
Pelecanos? [clicks tongues] Boom.

45
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:22,226
I bet you're into Richard Price.

46
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,770
I dig Price.

47
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:25,354
Dennis Lehane, too.

48
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:28,607
What about Chester Himes?

49
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:30,318
Without question.

50
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:33,237
[clears throat] My biggest
beef with Donald Goines

51
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:36,115
is that he wrote about
criminals and he died like one.

52
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,078
[chuckles] You don't have
to get all Fox News about it.

53
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:41,454
[Pop chuckling]

54
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:43,747
Goines invented Kenyatta,

55
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:46,209
the best black hero this side of Shaft.

56
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:48,020
- [customer] Thank you, my brother.
- All right.

57
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:50,463
- Keep that magic touch.
- I'll keep working on it.

58
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:51,714
See you next week, Victor.

59
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:55,051
So you're saying Kenyatta
is better than Easy Rawlins?

60
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:56,552
I ain't saying all that.

61
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:59,597
I'm just saying Kenyatta's my favorite.

62
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,059
He took the fight to the man...

63
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:06,354
in the streets by his self.

64
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:09,607
Just like somebody else
could if he wasn't sweeping hair

65
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,650
and washing dishes.

66
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:13,694
[sighs] Don't start, Pop.

67
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:18,366
The whole neighborhood is yapping
about how Zip and two goons

68
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:21,619
got the beat down at
Genghis Connie's last night.

69
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:22,954
Hmm.

70
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:27,791
I heard it was four guys.

71
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:31,587
[chuckling]

72
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:34,548
I knew it had to be you.

73
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:39,512
[chuckles] No wonder you came
into the shop so light on your feet.

74
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:43,141
Either that or someone finally
gave you some trim.

75
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:44,475
Oh!

76
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:47,811
[both laugh]

77
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:51,649
[Pop] Mmm. Mmm.

78
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:59,407
So that's how it works? Those
thugs shake people down?

79
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,996
They work for Mariah or Cottonmouth?

80
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:08,582
[grunts]

81
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:15,089
A little bit of both.

82
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,508
They related?

83
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:20,136
- Aunt and nephew?
- Cousins.

84
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:22,888
Their grandma was Mama Mabel.

85
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:24,848
Who's Mama Mabel?

86
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:28,144
[sighs] The devil's ex-wife.

87
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:32,273
They ever come at you sideways?

88
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:33,983
No.

89
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:37,653
This place right here is
Switzerland. Everybody knows that.

90
00:06:40,323 --> 00:06:41,907
Where you from, Luke?

91
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:44,327
Chicago.

92
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,537
You ain't from no Chicago.

93
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:50,166
Where are you from, really?

94
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:54,462
Savannah, Georgia.

95
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:56,005
All right.

96
00:06:56,923 --> 00:06:58,757
Country boy.

97
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:03,137
You know how the wind feels fluffy, like
you could stuff it into a pillowcase

98
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:05,389
- right before a big thunderstorm?
- Mmm-hmm.

99
00:07:05,473 --> 00:07:07,683
Harlem's the same.

100
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,560
Trouble smells a certain way.

101
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:12,313
You can... touch it.

102
00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:14,732
Cottonmouth.

103
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:17,944
He's gonna fall behind
lookin' for Chico.

104
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:19,528
That's the way that works.

105
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:21,697
Ain't no secrets uptown.

106
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:26,660
I mean, you could set a watch by
the way that shit will play out.

107
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:28,871
[scoffs]

108
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:30,248
I'm fresh out of singles.

109
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:32,791
- I ain't gonna break no ten for that.
- [laughs]

110
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,710
[chuckles] Oh, no, no.

111
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:36,545
- [door opens]
- [bell chimes]

112
00:07:58,109 --> 00:08:00,361
Something real about a razor.

113
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:05,324
You should let me use my
clippers. You gonna bump up.

114
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:07,326
Nah. [inhales deeply]

115
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,869
Doesn't have the same feel.

116
00:08:08,952 --> 00:08:10,788
The clippers are idiot-proof.

117
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:14,583
That's what's missin' nowadays, Pop.

118
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:17,086
Attention to detail.

119
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:20,964
Everyone wants things fast, quick.

120
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:24,260
Me? I like to take my time.

121
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:29,515
[Pop] Time is a luxury most...
working class men cannot afford.

122
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:30,766
[Stokes] True.

123
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:35,104
Time is precious. Shouldn't be wasted.

124
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:38,899
Mmm...

125
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:41,444
A good razor shave is
like a vacation to me.

126
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:45,364
It's incredible how few
people take advantage.

127
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:48,076
- [Pop] It's a lost art.
- [Stokes] Exactly.

128
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,799
That's the problem
with these youngsters.

129
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:51,370
They want it all.

130
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:54,373
But they don't want to put in the work.

131
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,126
They'll rob...

132
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,588
lie, cheat, steal, just
to get what they want.

133
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:03,507
Damn shame if you ask me.

134
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:06,594
[softly] Yeah.

135
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:08,679
- Shame.
- Mmm-hmm.

136
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:13,059
How'd you... cut your hands?

137
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:15,686
Oh, uh, eh... shaving.

138
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:19,732
[chuckling] That's why I needed
a professional touch, you dig?

139
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:23,111
- [Pop] Sorry, brother.
- Twelve feet.

140
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,405
Two guns.

141
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:28,991
Four seconds.

142
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:31,119
You gonna move?

143
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:33,454
No, not yet.

144
00:09:35,123 --> 00:09:38,041
Just 'cause they call you Bobby
Fish don't mean you're Bobby Fischer.

145
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:40,128
And you ain't Turkish neither, Turk.

146
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,670
Not last time I checked.

147
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:43,506
[Turk] That's not what
your daughter said.

148
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:45,632
[Bobby chuckling] Yeah,
but your mama confirmed it.

149
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:48,278
[Turk] Oh, you think you can throw
me off my game talking about my mama?

150
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:50,763
[Bobby] Oh, no, she
is a well-established ho.

151
00:09:50,846 --> 00:09:53,141
That should not faze you one bit.

152
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:54,267
Check.

153
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,234
That's a cheap broom.

154
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:05,236
Old.

155
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:09,823
I just got home.

156
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:11,742
College?

157
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,287
Three years this time...

158
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,579
Seagate.

159
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,790
I'm from 'round the way.

160
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:20,126
Grew up right here.

161
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,045
Everyone knows Pop.

162
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:28,259
There was this little
Puerto Rican kid...

163
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:31,929
I can't remember his
name... It's like, um...

164
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:33,722
Rico or, uh...

165
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:35,808
Chico.

166
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:39,853
Yeah...

167
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:43,316
Chico.

168
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:47,945
He used to shape me up back in the day.

169
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:51,615
He was real good, too.

170
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:55,578
I was hoping he was still around.

171
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:00,833
People come and go.

172
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,167
You know how it is, right?

173
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:04,545
Yeah.

174
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,759
[Luke] Pop...

175
00:11:10,843 --> 00:11:12,970
I've got some fresh towels right here.

176
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:15,806
You've got some dirty ones.

177
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,850
I could take 'em out if you want.

178
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,478
No sweat at all.

179
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:24,690
I'm good, Luke.

180
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:26,024
[Stokes] Big man...

181
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:28,819
you work here, too?

182
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:33,115
This brother got more
jobs than a Jamaican.

183
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:35,117
- [laughing]
- [chuckles]

184
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:38,454
[Stokes] What's your name again?

185
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:41,249
- Luke.
- Luke. [snaps fingers]

186
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:43,166
[inhales sharply] Mmm, old school.

187
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:45,336
Biblical. [chuckles]

188
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:47,170
I'm all about the old school.

189
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,965
You know that...

190
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:52,385
eye for an eye, tooth
for a tooth kind of thing.

191
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:54,637
Fire and brimstone.

192
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,765
[inhales sharply] See... back then...

193
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:02,436
do someone wrong, wasn't
no beggin' and pleadin'.

194
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:04,938
Just took care of it.

195
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,317
Handled your business.

196
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:13,322
What about turning the other cheek?

197
00:12:13,406 --> 00:12:14,573
Mmm...

198
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:17,410
Jesus saves...

199
00:12:17,493 --> 00:12:18,827
I don't.

200
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:22,998
You want a hot towel?

201
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,876
Not today. [exhales]

202
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,503
Gotta keep it movin'.

203
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:30,839
I'm a working man, too.

204
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:38,096
[Tone] Chico falls through...

205
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,640
we need to holler at him.

206
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,976
[Stokes] Thanks for the shave, Henry.

207
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:46,188
I'm loyal to my people.

208
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:49,608
[Luke] You're forgetting
something, Mr. Stokes.

209
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:59,493
Unless your last name is
Corleone, Shaft or Riley...

210
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:02,455
you owe my man $25.

211
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:05,290
Don't worry about it, Cornell.

212
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:09,337
Nah, it's all good.

213
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,630
[Stokes chuckles]

214
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:15,343
Tone, pay the man.

215
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:19,555
[bell chimes]

216
00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:35,195
[door closes]

217
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:46,582
They got Shameek.

218
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,961
Cottonmouth did it personally.
Did you see his knuckles?

219
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:52,755
I'm sorry, Pop.

220
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:55,173
You never liked him anyway.

221
00:13:55,257 --> 00:13:56,550
That's not entirely true.

222
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:59,928
Shameek is gone. I don't
condone what he did.

223
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:02,473
But it's not too late for Chico.

224
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:04,892
Pop, stay out of it.

225
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:06,644
Some people you just gotta let go.

226
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:08,771
I can't just turn my back on him.

227
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:12,232
You used to find people, right?

228
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:14,693
That was a long time ago.

229
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:17,363
It ain't exactly a skill you lose.

230
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,741
Look, this place is Switzerland.

231
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:22,785
If we can find him before they do,

232
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:26,372
maybe I can set up a
parley with Cottonmouth.

233
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,045
I don't think so, man.

234
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:36,214
I'm sorry, Pop. I can't do it.

235
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:38,801
Hey... yes.

236
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:40,678
You are sorry.

237
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:44,473
Now, I hadn't seen
Reva since she was five.

238
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:46,767
So when she comes
home with a convict husband

239
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,144
and a shaky-ass story...

240
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:50,979
I ain't ask her no questions.

241
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:56,193
And when that same well-read ex-con
comes back wanting to be paid in cash...

242
00:14:56,276 --> 00:15:00,030
and lifting up refrigerators like
they're empty cardboard boxes,

243
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:02,950
I just nodded my head again.

244
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:08,622
What did you tell me about
keeping your secrets?

245
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:14,044
That I owed you one.

246
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:18,591
Well, time is due.

247
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:23,721
I'm collecting.

248
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,605
[indistinct chatter]

249
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:35,816
[boy 1] Whoo!

250
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:38,068
[boy 2] Hey!

251
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:45,367
- [boy 3] Five-O! Five-O!
- [boy 4] Let's go!

252
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:48,245
[Scarfe] Whoa! Hold
up... Hold up, hold up!

253
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:49,556
[chuckling] Where's everybody goin'?

254
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,665
Come on, Chauncey. You know the drill.

255
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:56,253
Have you seen this kid? Chico?

256
00:15:57,463 --> 00:15:59,089
[Chauncey] No, I don't know that dude.

257
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:00,382
Stop it.

258
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,513
His initials are painted right here.

259
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:08,474
Just like all the other St.
Nick playground legends.

260
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:09,933
You seen him or not?

261
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:12,352
Nah.

262
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:16,356
Wastin' time, Misty.

263
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,191
Yo, pass me the rock.

264
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:19,818
[chuckling]

265
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:22,655
What, you fittin' to
play one-on-one with me?

266
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:26,534
No. That wouldn't be fair to you.

267
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:28,160
[all exclaim]

268
00:16:28,243 --> 00:16:29,870
Come on, let's play H-O-R-S-E.

269
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:32,956
Shot for shot. And if I win...

270
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,252
you tell me everything I need to
know about Wilfredo Chico Diaz.

271
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,129
What's in it for me?

272
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:43,466
A get out of jail free
card for any non-violent felony.

273
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:45,844
[scoffs] Not doin' that shit. No way.

274
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:48,847
- [ball bounces]
- We good?

275
00:16:50,473 --> 00:16:52,184
[boy 1] Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

276
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:53,727
Ladies first.

277
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:55,938
- [all exclaim]
- [boy 2] Come on, Chauncey.

278
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:57,272
[Chauncey chuckles]

279
00:17:02,402 --> 00:17:04,530
[boy 2] Come on,
man. It's your thing, man!

280
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:07,700
[indistinct chatter]

281
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:13,831
Hey, you better shoot like
Cheryl Miller, not Barney Miller.

282
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:17,334
Sometimes I forget how old you are.

283
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:20,522
I mean, he gonna hold your purse, too?

284
00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:22,130
[all chuckling]

285
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,426
Wow!

286
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:34,852
[all exclaim]

287
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:39,522
Come here.

288
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:42,525
You see that?

289
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:46,071
This is my court, too.

290
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:49,700
Let's play.

291
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:53,120
[all exclaim]

292
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:56,874
- [boy 1] Oh, come on, now!
- [all exclaim]

293
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:04,506
[inaudible]

294
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:45,463
[men speaking indistinctly]

295
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:56,599
- [knock on door]
- Yes.

296
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:00,437
Hey.

297
00:19:08,403 --> 00:19:10,488
Mmm-mmm. That's not nearly enough.

298
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:12,658
[laughing] What?

299
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:14,326
It's not enough.

300
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:17,329
I need the rest so I
can make the deposit.

301
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:20,165
Well, I need to find the guy who has it.

302
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,336
Look... I borrowed from those donations,

303
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,339
at your request, so you
could refurbish your club.

304
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:30,467
You go and make a gun deal with Domingo.

305
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,720
Then you get jacked and
we're all exposed.

306
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:35,723
You promised this would be
taken care of, but it's not.

307
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:37,640
You don't give me orders.

308
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:39,267
We're partners. You're not my boss.

309
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:42,688
We're family,
Cornell. But think about it.

310
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:44,522
Do you really want to go to jail?

311
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:46,942
- Do you want to lose your club?
- Of course not.

312
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:49,695
Then you need to fix
this shit right now.

313
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:54,657
Does your guard dog want
a drink of water?

314
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:56,910
- [chuckles softly]
- Don't worry about him.

315
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:59,788
You worry about the
politics, I worry about my job.

316
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:02,708
Your job is to uncomplicate my life.

317
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:06,128
And your job is to
turn my water into wine.

318
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,134
Family first, right?

319
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:14,845
Always.

320
00:20:16,304 --> 00:20:18,598
I'm coming by the club tonight.

321
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:20,100
[chuckles]

322
00:20:20,183 --> 00:20:22,895
Why? I thought you said you
don't want to be seen there.

323
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:23,979
I don't.

324
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:26,356
But I like the music.

325
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:31,319
I'm going to be on you
until this is resolved.

326
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:34,823
It's getting resolved.

327
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:36,574
You best believe that.

328
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:42,790
[gun cocks]

329
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:46,668
- You ain't gonna fire that.
- I'll kill you.

330
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:48,628
Shameek is dead.

331
00:20:48,711 --> 00:20:51,673
They have his half of the
money. Now they want yours.

332
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:56,678
- Shameek is dead?
- Yeah.

333
00:20:57,595 --> 00:20:59,347
Well, good. [spits]

334
00:21:00,515 --> 00:21:03,185
Then you just want my
money for yourself, don't you?

335
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,521
I couldn't care less.

336
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:08,982
I came here because Pop
asked me to come for you.

337
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,359
Pops?

338
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,695
For your dad.

339
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,197
[breath trembling]

340
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,366
Why does everybody bring him
up? He was never there for me.

341
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,118
I'm sick and tired of hearing about him.

342
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:23,205
Pop thinks he has a
way to clear this mess up.

343
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:25,498
I know you didn't kill Dante...

344
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:27,167
or Shameek.

345
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,211
All you guys wanted was the cash.

346
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:31,504
It was an inside job.

347
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:34,049
Dante's safe idea.

348
00:21:34,132 --> 00:21:35,843
Look...

349
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:38,971
I found you in four hours for free.

350
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:44,059
Imagine how fast someone Cottonmouth
pays will find you.

351
00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:45,518
[inhales sharply]

352
00:21:45,602 --> 00:21:49,940
The only chance you have at survival
is if you come with me right now.

353
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:55,946
Well, I got a half a million
new chances is the way I see it.

354
00:22:07,082 --> 00:22:10,377
Tell Pops... I'm sorry.

355
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:15,715
He was always good to me.

356
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:18,010
He deserves better.

357
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,694
Took your rook, rookie.

358
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:39,489
Hmm.

359
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:44,202
- It's your move, son.
- [chuckling] Mmm-hmm.

360
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:46,329
- Don't get scared now.
- Oh, no, no, no...

361
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:47,998
- [bell chimes]
- [indistinct chatter]

362
00:22:55,213 --> 00:22:56,965
[gate creaking]

363
00:23:00,427 --> 00:23:02,220
[Luke] Want some
catfish with that hot sauce?

364
00:23:02,304 --> 00:23:03,555
[chuckling]

365
00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:07,267
- You count calories, Power Man?
- [sighs]

366
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,602
Fork will kill you quicker
than any bullet.

367
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:13,315
[chuckling]

368
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,609
I found Chico.

369
00:23:18,778 --> 00:23:20,488
He ain't coming.

370
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:23,658
You can't save everybody.

371
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:27,329
You're wrong about that.

372
00:23:28,371 --> 00:23:31,916
What would have happened in my
life if people gave up on me?

373
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:35,045
I was no angel.

374
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:39,091
No, I was a beast.

375
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:42,219
<i>- [man grunting]</i>
- [Pop] <i>I was a beast.</i>

376
00:23:42,302 --> 00:23:43,845
<i>No two ways about it.</i>

377
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:46,974
[Luke] <i>They call you Pop
because you were the OG?</i>

378
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:51,811
[Pop] <i>No, it was the sound my fist
made when I knocked a fool out.</i>

379
00:23:51,894 --> 00:23:53,855
<i>Snap, crackle, pop!</i>

380
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:58,860
<i>Cottonmouth lost three teeth as a kid.</i>

381
00:23:58,943 --> 00:24:02,530
<i>[chuckles] Wilfredo saw him
smile and the name just stuck.</i>

382
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:07,744
<i>And Fredo was the craziest little
Puerto Rican in black Harlem.</i>

383
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:11,331
<i>I used to call 'em Thing
One and Thing Two.</i>

384
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:12,891
Hey, yo, yo, yo. Can I take your photo?

385
00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:15,335
- Yeah, yeah. Jamel, right?
- Right over here, man. Thanks.

386
00:24:15,418 --> 00:24:16,544
Yeah, yeah. [mutters]

387
00:24:16,628 --> 00:24:19,589
[Luke] <i>What'd that make
you? The Cat in the Hat?</i>

388
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:22,009
<i>- [shutter clicks]</i>
- [Pop] <i>Something like that.</i>

389
00:24:25,387 --> 00:24:27,305
[Luke] So what happened?

390
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:28,765
[Pop] We got popped.

391
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:34,437
Wilfredo went from selling
crack to smoking crack.

392
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:38,858
I got caught with a
gun and a bag of money.

393
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:40,402
Kept my mouth shut.

394
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:43,905
Went on pause for ten years.

395
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:46,241
My woman was pregnant when I went in.

396
00:24:46,324 --> 00:24:48,410
I haven't seen her or...

397
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:51,579
my son since he was 13.

398
00:24:51,663 --> 00:24:54,207
I have this nightmare that...

399
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,544
one day, he's gonna come to the shop...

400
00:24:57,627 --> 00:25:01,131
ask for a cut, sit in my chair...

401
00:25:01,214 --> 00:25:03,091
and I'm not even gonna know him.

402
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:08,888
I didn't have one single
skill when I got out.

403
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:13,017
I could've gone back to the streets.

404
00:25:15,603 --> 00:25:17,355
But you weren't that guy anymore.

405
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:20,275
I wasn't... and I'm not.

406
00:25:20,358 --> 00:25:22,360
And that's what I go through every day.

407
00:25:22,444 --> 00:25:24,279
Trying not to be that person.

408
00:25:25,697 --> 00:25:27,365
I'm not that guy either.

409
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:30,577
I thought you was
innocent, Shawshank. Mmm.

410
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:33,830
I ain't guilty. [sighs]

411
00:25:33,913 --> 00:25:37,167
But... I ain't innocent either.

412
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,963
I had to balance my
dirt... so I opened up this shop.

413
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,759
So those young
knuckleheads have a place to get away.

414
00:25:46,843 --> 00:25:49,846
Like Fredo's son, Chico.

415
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:56,228
And certain... muscle-headed
fugitives lookin' for a change of pace.

416
00:25:58,563 --> 00:26:00,148
[Pop chuckles]

417
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:02,275
After what I did at Genghis Connie's...

418
00:26:03,735 --> 00:26:08,030
for the first time in a
long time... I felt at peace.

419
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:09,366
[Pop] Mmm-hmm.

420
00:26:09,449 --> 00:26:11,909
I made a decision when
I got back to the crib.

421
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:16,414
I'm done running.

422
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:21,586
Boys run.

423
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:24,672
Men stand.

424
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:26,174
You're a man.

425
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:30,928
I am who I am.

426
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,848
Or...

427
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:38,853
maybe I have a chance to find
out who I could really be.

428
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:41,398
That's right.

429
00:26:41,981 --> 00:26:44,108
- [Luke] Hmm?
- Yeah.

430
00:26:44,192 --> 00:26:46,278
Come on. Let's get going.

431
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:51,824
Hey, Pop.

432
00:26:51,908 --> 00:26:53,701
Damn. Y'all still at it, huh?

433
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:55,537
- He don't know when to quit.
- Oh, I know.

434
00:26:56,496 --> 00:26:58,206
[Bobby] Until I win.

435
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,832
Gonna leave it open?

436
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:01,501
Yeah, till we shut the doors...

437
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:04,086
[chuckles] whether it's empty or not.

438
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:06,214
I'm gonna go get my smock.

439
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:25,775
[grunts]

440
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:28,027
What... were you thinking?

441
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,781
Sorry. I'm sorry! [sniffles]

442
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:34,826
[Pop exclaims] You dummy.

443
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:38,371
- You dummy.
- What's up?

444
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:39,497
Dummy.

445
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:41,458
[both sobbing]

446
00:27:49,757 --> 00:27:50,883
You did good.

447
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:54,387
That's what.

448
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:58,475
My bad, Mr. Hunter.

449
00:28:01,436 --> 00:28:03,187
Where's the restroom key? Just...

450
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:04,731
Get out of here.

451
00:28:04,814 --> 00:28:06,399
Go.

452
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:08,235
You heard me.

453
00:28:17,118 --> 00:28:18,578
You got to get him out of here.

454
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:23,583
And you know damn well, Chico
ain't gonna show up for work today.

455
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:26,919
Of course not, but... Pop
will tell us the truth

456
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:28,921
about who Chico really is.

457
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:30,632
He's just a barber, right?

458
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:32,592
Ah, he's a little bit of everything.

459
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:35,136
Not a very good judge of character.

460
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,764
He's got a big heart. We
should fault him for that?

461
00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:39,140
[Scarfe] Nope.

462
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:43,311
Gimme a second. And
don't start without me.

463
00:28:43,395 --> 00:28:45,187
Can't do the one-two punch without you.

464
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:48,441
Turk.

465
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:52,487
Misty.

466
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:55,865
I'm surprised to see
you this far uptown.

467
00:28:55,948 --> 00:28:59,160
I'm mostly Midtown nowadays, you know?

468
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:01,246
Puffy ain't got shit on me, baby.

469
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:03,915
I'm the real bad boy worldwide.

470
00:29:03,998 --> 00:29:07,335
Yeah, your rap sheet got so many
hits, your record could put out a record.

471
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:11,088
Hey, I just fell through to see my man,
Bobby Fish, and to play some chess.

472
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:13,841
Well, you need to fall
your ass back downtown,

473
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:16,093
'cause if I catch you
around here again...

474
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:18,763
it's gonna be checkmate.

475
00:29:18,846 --> 00:29:21,349
Understood? Mr. Barrett?

476
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:23,310
I hear you...

477
00:29:24,852 --> 00:29:26,396
Detective.

478
00:29:27,314 --> 00:29:28,481
Loud and clear.

479
00:29:33,152 --> 00:29:35,530
Did anyone see you come here?

480
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:38,491
- Hmm?
- No... I don't think so.

481
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:40,535
- [door opens, bell chimes]
- Luke, check.

482
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:47,584
[whispers] Five-O!

483
00:29:48,668 --> 00:29:51,170
You need to go in the
bathroom and hide. Go.

484
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,758
Go!

485
00:29:57,677 --> 00:29:59,596
- Hey, Misty.
- Fish.

486
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,097
- How you doin'?
- Good to see you.

487
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,181
You, too.

488
00:30:02,264 --> 00:30:03,951
- [Misty] Is Pop around?
- [Fish] He's in the back.

489
00:30:03,975 --> 00:30:05,101
He'll be out in a minute.

490
00:30:06,686 --> 00:30:09,689
- [pats Pop]
- Let me stall 'em. Sit tight.

491
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:14,110
[chuckles] Whoa.

492
00:30:14,193 --> 00:30:17,405
Detective Mercedes Knight.

493
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:20,032
It's Misty now, Pop. You know that.

494
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:21,743
[Pop] All right, all right.

495
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:23,119
[chuckles]

496
00:30:23,202 --> 00:30:26,080
Call yourself whatever
you want to, Detective.

497
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:27,499
- Hey!
- [chuckles] Ooh!

498
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:29,459
I respect authority.

499
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:31,461
[both chuckle]

500
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:33,755
I bet Kelly must be really
proud of you, hmm?

501
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:37,592
He's still mad I went to Temple instead
of playin' for St. John's.

502
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,761
- Bam!
- Swish!

503
00:30:39,844 --> 00:30:41,262
[both laugh]

504
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,515
Is this your partner?

505
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:46,100
Detective Rafael Scarfe.

506
00:30:49,854 --> 00:30:51,313
[softly] Okay.

507
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:53,358
How can I help you?

508
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:56,068
We're looking for
someone who works for you.

509
00:30:56,152 --> 00:30:57,612
Wilfredo Chico Diaz?

510
00:30:57,695 --> 00:31:00,322
You heard about that shooting...

511
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:01,991
at the junkyard?

512
00:31:02,074 --> 00:31:03,826
Near the edge of the river?

513
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:06,037
No.

514
00:31:06,621 --> 00:31:07,872
Really?

515
00:31:08,748 --> 00:31:11,208
There was a shootout.

516
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:13,920
Looks like a gun deal that was robbed.

517
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,172
Turned into a bloodbath.

518
00:31:16,255 --> 00:31:19,551
Dante Chapman was
found dead at the scene.

519
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:24,346
Shameek Smith was found about
18 hours later, beaten to death.

520
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:27,809
Last person to see Shameek Smith alive,

521
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:30,102
other than a strip club...

522
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:32,730
was right here at the
shop with his homeboy.

523
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:35,692
Uh, they were both here.

524
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:40,112
Chico gave Shameek a fade in that chair,

525
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:42,031
right next to where you're standing.

526
00:31:42,114 --> 00:31:45,367
That's it though. That's the
last time I saw them both.

527
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:47,369
You really think Chico
killed his friend?

528
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:50,122
Over money?

529
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:53,125
You are?

530
00:31:58,423 --> 00:31:59,716
Luke Cage.

531
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,886
Detective Misty Knight.

532
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,472
Detective.

533
00:32:06,473 --> 00:32:09,100
Looks like you found some
better clothes to audit in.

534
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:15,440
[exhales]

535
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:20,319
Look... when my guys are here,

536
00:32:20,402 --> 00:32:22,113
they know the rules.

537
00:32:22,196 --> 00:32:24,824
Respect, no street talk.

538
00:32:24,907 --> 00:32:27,660
But when they leave, I got no control.

539
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:30,955
Understood, but Chico
is a person of interest

540
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:33,249
who might have pertinent information.

541
00:32:33,332 --> 00:32:34,751
Pertinent information?

542
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:37,504
Like, someone
saying who they really are?

543
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,298
Pertinent as in useful.

544
00:32:41,382 --> 00:32:42,967
As in factual.

545
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,428
Like, uh... Chico's
number. You got that, right?

546
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:49,974
He missed work the last two days.

547
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,147
His booth rent is due, so
maybe he'll return my call.

548
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,941
If you see him, tell him to call me.

549
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:02,862
Call me anyway.

550
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,115
He may not be safe otherwise.

551
00:33:07,449 --> 00:33:08,910
Will do.

552
00:33:10,244 --> 00:33:13,080
- [chuckles]
- Nice meeting you, Luke.

553
00:33:13,164 --> 00:33:16,501
You too... Detective.

554
00:33:27,554 --> 00:33:29,221
- [door opens]
- [bell chimes]

555
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:36,437
Really? [scoffs]

556
00:33:36,521 --> 00:33:37,939
We had coffee.

557
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:41,317
Mmm-hmm. [chuckles] Right.

558
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:46,823
You gonna call Cottonmouth?

559
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:48,700
No.

560
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:51,452
You need to see him.

561
00:33:51,536 --> 00:33:53,245
What?

562
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:54,581
He's going to want to see you.

563
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:59,335
No. I'm afraid our... friends in
blue might have eyes on the shop.

564
00:34:00,461 --> 00:34:03,255
You work at Harlem's Paradise.

565
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:05,299
You have a reason to go there.

566
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:10,096
You can't do this kind
of thing on the phone.

567
00:34:13,558 --> 00:34:14,559
[sighs]

568
00:34:16,102 --> 00:34:18,479
Look, man, Wilfredo...

569
00:34:19,438 --> 00:34:22,358
he died... on these streets.

570
00:34:25,111 --> 00:34:28,322
I don't wanna see
Chico go out the same way.

571
00:34:30,825 --> 00:34:32,451
Can you do this for me?

572
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,376
I'm on it.

573
00:34:41,043 --> 00:34:42,044
All right.

574
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:46,716
[softly] Thanks.

575
00:34:52,096 --> 00:34:53,514
[dishes clattering]

576
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,061
[Nate] You're late. I have your money.

577
00:35:00,062 --> 00:35:01,981
Cage.

578
00:35:02,064 --> 00:35:04,025
Cage!

579
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:05,943
Do you hear me?

580
00:35:06,027 --> 00:35:07,236
Cage!

581
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:08,821
[indistinct chatter]

582
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:20,416
Your brother down there told
Candace to send me up a Blue Hawaiian.

583
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:23,002
Like he gonna get up on
me with a Blue Hawaiian.

584
00:35:23,085 --> 00:35:24,378
[both laugh]

585
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:27,924
Ah, he lucky I let his ass in here.

586
00:35:29,591 --> 00:35:30,927
I need to speak to your man.

587
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,137
What? You didn't get
tipped at the barber shop?

588
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,471
Pat him down.

589
00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:43,480
He's clean.

590
00:35:44,857 --> 00:35:46,442
Thought you already had a job.

591
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:49,862
'Cause I could use some more ice.

592
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,448
I'm here for Pop.

593
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:56,368
Pop is a grown-ass
man. Why ain't he here?

594
00:35:57,536 --> 00:36:00,456
He said you wouldn't wanna
hear this over the phone.

595
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:02,041
So he sent me.

596
00:36:02,124 --> 00:36:04,626
Ha! The suspense is killing me.

597
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:07,379
Pop wants to set up a parley for Chico.

598
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:11,050
He doesn't want him to
end up like Shameek.

599
00:36:12,426 --> 00:36:14,386
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

600
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:17,306
Those cuts on your hands say different.

601
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:19,225
[cell phone vibrates and chimes]

602
00:36:21,268 --> 00:36:24,856
All I'm saying is that if you want
to talk to Pop about Chico,

603
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:26,398
that can be arranged.

604
00:36:26,482 --> 00:36:28,525
All of your goods will be returned.

605
00:36:29,861 --> 00:36:32,780
The only thing our mutual
friend wants is safe passage.

606
00:36:34,031 --> 00:36:37,493
He'll never come back to New York, ever.

607
00:36:37,576 --> 00:36:39,536
I don't speak Chinese.

608
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:43,082
[laughs] 'Cause that's
what this conversation is to me.

609
00:36:43,165 --> 00:36:46,627
If I got somethin' to say to Pop, I
say it to him my damn self, you dig?

610
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,257
[sighs] There's history.

611
00:36:52,674 --> 00:36:54,301
Pop understands your trouble.

612
00:36:56,387 --> 00:36:59,181
He's just asking you to
remember your history.

613
00:37:07,273 --> 00:37:08,607
[Stokes inhales deeply]

614
00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:15,489
Tell Pop I'll come by the
barbershop for a haircut.

615
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:19,201
Same time as before.

616
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:20,661
You understand?

617
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:23,998
I'll tell him.

618
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:27,376
By the way...

619
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,212
you're fired.

620
00:37:31,713 --> 00:37:33,007
No, I'm not.

621
00:37:33,966 --> 00:37:36,010
I quit before I walked in.

622
00:37:39,013 --> 00:37:40,514
[chuckles]

623
00:37:40,597 --> 00:37:42,850
- [upbeat music playing]
- [crowd cheering]

624
00:37:53,945 --> 00:37:55,947
We got eyes on the boy.

625
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,614
What do you want me to do?

626
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:00,701
- Your man say where he was?
- No.

627
00:38:02,787 --> 00:38:03,996
[Stokes] Hmm.

628
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,625
Let it go.

629
00:38:09,794 --> 00:38:11,420
Take care of it in the morning.

630
00:38:13,005 --> 00:38:14,090
You sure?

631
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:16,467
If he's out on the streets
slippin', handle it.

632
00:38:17,384 --> 00:38:20,512
But if he's not moving
around, I'll deal with it, all right?

633
00:38:24,225 --> 00:38:25,434
[crowd cheering and whistling]

634
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:28,246
Now let me holler at y'all for a minute.

635
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,772
'Cause I got somethin'
that I need to say.

636
00:38:30,857 --> 00:38:32,399
What y'all know about that thing?

637
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:34,294
[Mariah] You're wasting
your gifts, my brother.

638
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:37,654
This gangster life...

639
00:38:37,738 --> 00:38:40,032
not what our ancestors fought for.

640
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:42,326
Not what our people died for.

641
00:38:42,409 --> 00:38:44,286
This is exactly what they died for.

642
00:38:44,996 --> 00:38:48,790
Self-determination, control, power.

643
00:39:16,986 --> 00:39:20,489
That boy we was looking
for earlier today...

644
00:39:20,572 --> 00:39:22,199
he's at Pop's Barber Shop.

645
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:25,870
- You seen him?
- With my own two eyes.

646
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,955
How long ago?

647
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,706
A little while back.

648
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,460
Hey!

649
00:39:33,544 --> 00:39:34,545
Hey!

650
00:39:35,212 --> 00:39:37,173
Yo, what's up with my money?

651
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,020
[clippers buzzing]

652
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:52,271
[Pop] You need to leave?

653
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:54,315
I'm just gonna pick up
dinner from Boulevard.

654
00:39:54,398 --> 00:39:56,525
Where's Luke?

655
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:04,116
- Have you seen him?
- Girl, you just don't quit, do you?

656
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,286
- I just want to take him out for coffee.
- [scoffs]

657
00:40:16,587 --> 00:40:19,340
You know what people
remember besides black martyrdom?

658
00:40:19,423 --> 00:40:20,757
What?

659
00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:22,509
Black money.

660
00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:27,098
Don't you ever get sick of
people calling you a criminal?

661
00:40:27,181 --> 00:40:29,225
[gun clicks]

662
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:32,561
You gonna at least wait for
Chico to come outside, right?

663
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,982
Right?

664
00:41:00,464 --> 00:41:02,008
What he sayin'?

665
00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:06,095
He'll only talk to
you. Right here at the shop.

666
00:41:10,432 --> 00:41:13,019
I want something better.

667
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:15,687
- Like what?
- Respect.

668
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:18,774
It's all that ever really matters.

669
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:25,697
Money outlasts respect.

670
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:29,410
Respect will put your
name on the side of a building...

671
00:41:30,327 --> 00:41:34,581
but the money that put your name
up there comes from someplace.

672
00:41:39,753 --> 00:41:41,463
At what cost, Cornell?

673
00:41:41,547 --> 00:41:45,384
When you find out... you'll tell me.

674
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,100
[all cheering]

675
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:02,776
What are you doing out
here with that bag, man?

676
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:04,945
- There's no TV back there.
- Are you serious?

677
00:42:10,492 --> 00:42:11,493
Pop!

678
00:42:22,504 --> 00:42:23,505
[bullet ricochets]

679
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,382
[screams]

680
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:37,436
[muffled screaming]

681
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,856
[whispering] Stay dead. Stay dead.

682
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:46,570
[gunfire stops]

683
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,415
[whimpering]

684
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,626
[gagging]

685
00:43:10,511 --> 00:43:12,429
- You should've waited.
- Shut up, man.

686
00:43:26,693 --> 00:43:28,237
You okay?

687
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:31,490
Pop! [softly] Pop.

688
00:43:31,573 --> 00:43:33,700
Oh, Pop... [crying]

689
00:43:33,784 --> 00:43:35,369
[gagging]

690
00:43:35,452 --> 00:43:36,495
- Come on...
- [Pop grunts]

691
00:43:36,578 --> 00:43:38,705
- [wheezing]
- You hear the sirens?

692
00:43:39,706 --> 00:43:42,709
[panting] They're
almost here. They comin'.

693
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:46,087
Someone call the goddamn ambulance!

694
00:43:47,381 --> 00:43:48,840
[Luke sobbing]

695
00:43:50,551 --> 00:43:51,760
[Pop straining] Swear...

696
00:43:53,387 --> 00:43:56,140
Swear jar...

697
00:43:56,765 --> 00:43:59,393
[crying] I will. I will.

698
00:44:01,853 --> 00:44:03,104
[gulps]

699
00:44:03,189 --> 00:44:04,898
Luke...

700
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,863
[stuttering] Forward... always.

701
00:44:11,947 --> 00:44:13,365
[gagging]

702
00:44:16,034 --> 00:44:17,494
Always...

703
00:44:19,413 --> 00:44:22,666
[stuttering] forward.

704
00:44:26,878 --> 00:44:28,214
[whispers] Always forward.

705
00:44:29,423 --> 00:44:30,424
[mumbling]

706
00:44:32,343 --> 00:44:33,760
[crying] No.

707
00:44:35,429 --> 00:44:37,306
[sniffling] No...

708
00:44:38,224 --> 00:44:40,351
No! [sobbing]

709
00:44:42,228 --> 00:44:43,437
No!

710
00:44:45,146 --> 00:44:46,815
[screaming] No!

711
00:44:49,985 --> 00:44:52,696
[breathing heavily]

712
00:44:53,822 --> 00:44:55,282
[sniffles]

713
00:45:06,668 --> 00:45:09,004
[indistinct radio chatter]

714
00:45:09,087 --> 00:45:11,131
[Lonnie] Mommy, I'm okay.

715
00:45:11,214 --> 00:45:14,134
I'm okay. Luke covered me.

716
00:45:14,217 --> 00:45:17,053
He said he didn't move because he
didn't want them to shoot again.

717
00:45:17,137 --> 00:45:20,140
- [Patty sighs] You see who did this?
- [Lonnie] No, Mama.

718
00:45:20,223 --> 00:45:22,184
[officer] Excuse me, ma'am.
Will you come with me?

719
00:45:25,896 --> 00:45:27,773
[Scarfe] You get a look at the shooter?

720
00:45:27,856 --> 00:45:29,024
Nah.

721
00:45:29,107 --> 00:45:31,151
It's a miracle I'm even alive, man.

722
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,374
Luke.

723
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:48,419
Luke?

724
00:45:49,336 --> 00:45:50,754
Are you okay?

725
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:57,428
You didn't get hit?

726
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:00,514
I said I'm okay.

727
00:46:04,851 --> 00:46:06,312
What happened?

728
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,855
They started firing.

729
00:46:09,773 --> 00:46:11,983
The kid, Lonnie, was in
the middle of the room.

730
00:46:12,901 --> 00:46:15,153
So, once I saw the flash...

731
00:46:16,071 --> 00:46:17,864
instincts kicked in.

732
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:21,993
I grabbed him... and I shielded him.

733
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:26,832
You... shielded him? You
shielded him with what?

734
00:46:30,794 --> 00:46:32,838
Have the paramedics seen you yet?

735
00:46:34,255 --> 00:46:37,050
I said I'm good.

736
00:46:40,804 --> 00:46:43,390
How long have you been working
here at the shop?

737
00:46:43,474 --> 00:46:45,141
Five months.

738
00:46:47,018 --> 00:46:52,524
Did Chico reach out to Pop since
we were in here earlier?

739
00:46:54,526 --> 00:46:57,028
Was he hiding out here the whole time?

740
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:06,246
- What did they get from the canvass?
- [Scarfe] Uh, patrol got nothing.

741
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:09,207
Traffic cam picked up a black Escalade.

742
00:47:09,332 --> 00:47:12,961
Tracked it to Hunts Point in the
Bronx, but it was torched. No prints.

743
00:47:13,044 --> 00:47:15,255
[inhales sharply] They were after Chico?

744
00:47:15,338 --> 00:47:17,674
- There's no doubt in my mind.
- Hmm.

745
00:47:17,758 --> 00:47:20,927
I checked out Cottonmouth. He's
been at the club all night in VIP.

746
00:47:21,845 --> 00:47:24,264
- So we don't have shit?
- No.

747
00:47:24,347 --> 00:47:27,934
No decent witnesses except
for Chico, but then what else?

748
00:47:28,018 --> 00:47:29,227
Nothin'?

749
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,205
[indistinct chatter]

750
00:47:52,584 --> 00:47:54,294
[man] Yeah, baby. Uh-huh.

751
00:48:05,597 --> 00:48:07,766
- [mouthing] Upstairs.
- I'm coming with you.

752
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:10,018
- Nah.
- No, I need to be there.

753
00:48:13,396 --> 00:48:15,065
[Stokes] What's wrong, Shades?

754
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:19,194
- You should've waited.
- Waited? [scoffs]

755
00:48:19,277 --> 00:48:22,531
Bump that noise. I got
the call. It was me.

756
00:48:22,614 --> 00:48:24,074
What happened?

757
00:48:24,157 --> 00:48:25,826
Look, Turk calls me.

758
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:29,120
Tells me he saw Chic
at the shop, slippin'.

759
00:48:29,204 --> 00:48:32,791
I came and ask you if it was
important if the nigga was breathing.

760
00:48:32,874 --> 00:48:34,250
You seem non-committal...

761
00:48:35,669 --> 00:48:37,045
so I make an executive decision.

762
00:48:38,129 --> 00:48:39,590
[both laughing]

763
00:48:39,673 --> 00:48:42,175
That's what you call...
an executive decision?

764
00:48:42,258 --> 00:48:43,594
[chuckles]

765
00:48:43,677 --> 00:48:45,053
Yeah, okay.

766
00:48:46,262 --> 00:48:48,223
Mmm, so you caught him slippin' outside?

767
00:48:48,306 --> 00:48:51,101
No, bro, I lit that shit
up like the Fourth of July.

768
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:54,771
<i>[chuckling] It was all so Django
Candyland shit for real.</i>

769
00:48:54,855 --> 00:48:56,898
Lights, camera, action,
baby! [clapping hands]

770
00:48:56,982 --> 00:48:59,150
Somebody call Quentin! [laughing]

771
00:49:03,905 --> 00:49:06,742
I suggested... we wait.

772
00:49:06,825 --> 00:49:08,451
[Tone] Wait?

773
00:49:08,535 --> 00:49:11,622
[stammers] Wait for what, Shades?

774
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:15,291
You ain't even down with the
clique. You can't give orders.

775
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:18,128
It was loud 'cause it's supposed to be.

776
00:49:18,211 --> 00:49:21,422
Niggas need to know you
don't rob Cottonmouth!

777
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:23,717
[yelling] My name is not Cottonmouth!

778
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:29,347
[Tone] My bad.

779
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,974
My bad.

780
00:49:31,683 --> 00:49:33,351
He's dead, right?

781
00:49:33,434 --> 00:49:36,354
Chico's laid out... He's done.

782
00:49:36,437 --> 00:49:38,649
It don't matter. We got the money!

783
00:49:42,235 --> 00:49:43,820
[breathes deeply]

784
00:49:43,904 --> 00:49:45,656
You had to do it, I guess.

785
00:49:52,162 --> 00:49:53,872
Pops can rebuild. [inhales sharply]

786
00:49:55,624 --> 00:49:57,668
He won't like it but
I'll donate some money...

787
00:49:58,877 --> 00:50:00,336
anonymously.

788
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,516
It's all gonna be okay.
[chuckles softly]

789
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,696
[pats arm]

790
00:50:09,012 --> 00:50:10,388
What?

791
00:50:12,933 --> 00:50:14,059
Pops is dead.

792
00:50:17,813 --> 00:50:20,106
A casualty of war.

793
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,358
You know... [stammers] Shit happens.

794
00:50:22,442 --> 00:50:23,819
[Turk] Yo...

795
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:25,571
Where's my money?

796
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:29,783
How the hell did you get up here?

797
00:50:29,866 --> 00:50:31,952
I'm Turk Barrett, baby.

798
00:50:32,035 --> 00:50:34,454
The door ain't been built
yet that can hold me back.

799
00:50:34,537 --> 00:50:36,414
Now, where's my money?

800
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:39,250
Okay, Mr. Barrett.

801
00:50:39,334 --> 00:50:42,295
Tone promised to pay you
for finding Chico, right?

802
00:50:42,378 --> 00:50:44,464
- Yeah.
- That right?

803
00:50:47,759 --> 00:50:49,260
Okay.

804
00:50:50,136 --> 00:50:51,471
Hey, hey, hey!

805
00:50:51,554 --> 00:50:53,306
[screaming]

806
00:50:57,018 --> 00:50:58,979
[panting]

807
00:51:01,397 --> 00:51:06,653
You can collect your money from
Tone downstairs, Mr. Barrett!

808
00:51:09,781 --> 00:51:12,951
I assume that completes our business.

809
00:51:14,285 --> 00:51:16,371
Y'all Harlem niggas are off the hook.

810
00:51:16,454 --> 00:51:19,082
I'm going back to Hell's
Kitchen, where it's safe.

811
00:51:19,165 --> 00:51:20,583
[scoffs]

812
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,176
Is that sufficient?

813
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,598
There's enough there.

814
00:51:40,186 --> 00:51:42,063
You all right, cuz?

815
00:51:42,147 --> 00:51:43,857
With what?

816
00:51:45,692 --> 00:51:48,403
Extortion? Well...

817
00:51:49,404 --> 00:51:51,614
Murder, no!

818
00:51:51,698 --> 00:51:53,241
I'm not good.

819
00:51:55,201 --> 00:51:56,662
Don't expect me to be.

820
00:51:56,745 --> 00:51:58,747
The money's still green.

821
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:03,960
That it is.

822
00:52:05,378 --> 00:52:06,963
You should get outta here.

823
00:52:08,006 --> 00:52:11,176
You shouldn't be seen
associating with known criminals...

824
00:52:11,259 --> 00:52:12,886
Councilwoman.

825
00:52:12,969 --> 00:52:14,429
Take the side exit.

826
00:52:14,512 --> 00:52:16,973
I got some garbage to
clean up downstairs.

827
00:52:26,733 --> 00:52:28,484
Sorry about Pop.

828
00:52:30,987 --> 00:52:32,823
Yeah, so am I.

829
00:52:32,906 --> 00:52:34,365
I know what he meant to you.

830
00:52:35,325 --> 00:52:36,534
[Stokes sighs deeply]

831
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:42,749
Believe it or not, there's
supposed to be rules to this shit.

832
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,272
He must have gotten hit.

833
00:53:09,442 --> 00:53:10,777
What?

834
00:53:12,904 --> 00:53:14,823
Luke...

835
00:53:14,906 --> 00:53:16,241
Cage.

836
00:53:18,284 --> 00:53:19,953
He shielded the kid.

837
00:53:21,747 --> 00:53:24,916
He had bullet holes in his shirt.

838
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,460
Blood everywhere, none of it his?

839
00:53:29,629 --> 00:53:31,464
How did he not get hit?

840
00:53:33,716 --> 00:53:35,260
You're drunk.

841
00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:40,140
Not yet.

842
00:54:38,824 --> 00:54:42,243
- [breathing deeply]
- [man] What are you doing here, nigga?

843
00:54:50,668 --> 00:54:52,295
I'm not gonna ask you again.

844
00:54:55,423 --> 00:54:56,967
Young man...

845
00:54:58,134 --> 00:55:00,345
I've had a long day.

846
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:03,681
I'm tired.

847
00:55:03,764 --> 00:55:05,808
But I'm not tired enough...

848
00:55:05,892 --> 00:55:08,895
to ever let nobody call me that word.

849
00:55:11,564 --> 00:55:13,733
You see a nigga
standin' in front of you?

850
00:55:15,026 --> 00:55:18,779
Across the street from a building named
after one of our greatest heroes?

851
00:55:19,697 --> 00:55:22,617
- [gun cocks]
- Yeah, a dead one.

852
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,035
[Luke sighs]

853
00:55:25,286 --> 00:55:27,497
You even know who Crispus Attucks was?

854
00:55:28,748 --> 00:55:30,250
A free black man.

855
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:34,045
The first man to die for
what became America.

856
00:55:35,922 --> 00:55:39,675
He could've acted scared when
those Brits raised their guns.

857
00:55:39,759 --> 00:55:41,802
Blended in, in the crowd.

858
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:43,429
But he stepped up!

859
00:55:44,347 --> 00:55:46,057
He paid with his life.

860
00:55:46,807 --> 00:55:48,559
But he started something.

861
00:55:49,644 --> 00:55:51,687
That's what Pop did...

862
00:55:51,771 --> 00:55:52,855
Not me.

863
00:55:53,523 --> 00:55:56,526
I laid in the cut until he stepped up!

864
00:55:57,402 --> 00:55:59,195
And it cost him his life, too.

865
00:56:01,072 --> 00:56:03,574
I ain't laying back no more!

866
00:56:04,367 --> 00:56:05,535
You wanna shoot me?

867
00:56:06,577 --> 00:56:08,288
Do it.

868
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:09,872
Pull the trigger, nigga!

869
00:56:09,956 --> 00:56:12,667
I ain't got all night.
[breathing heavily]

870
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,169
Do it!

871
00:56:15,045 --> 00:56:17,838
What, you scared?

872
00:56:17,923 --> 00:56:20,133
[breathing heavily] Fine.

873
00:56:21,134 --> 00:56:22,677
I'll do it for you.

874
00:56:58,171 --> 00:57:00,090
Always forward, Pop.

875
00:57:01,882 --> 00:57:03,343
Forward...

876
00:57:04,594 --> 00:57:06,096
always.

877
00:57:09,557 --> 00:57:11,559
[funk music playing]
