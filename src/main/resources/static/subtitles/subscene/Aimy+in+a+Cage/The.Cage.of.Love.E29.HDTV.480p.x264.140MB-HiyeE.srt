The Cage of Love

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,590
<i>Episode 29</i>

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,430
Even if they suspect me, they can't find any evidence now.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,590
Furthermore, I'm the Military Governor's woman.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,450
For sure they don't have any evidence.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,340
By the way, that rotten rascal Ma Li,

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,740
ever since we saved him from the police, he has gone missing.

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,080
I wonder where he is hiding.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,460
The so-called strong dragon is hiding like a snake.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,850
He grew up in Huzhou.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,720
If he really wants to hide from us,

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,020
it will be really hard to flush him out.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,480
Thankfully you were always wary of him, Miss.

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,750
Even if Zhou Shao Tian has his own men,

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,140
he wouldn't know about us.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,330
Forget it. Let him go.

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,820
Let's use our energy to focus on the secret formula.

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,780
Miss. Where are you going?

19
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,490
I'm going to see the Military Governor.

20
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,290
I need to serve him well now.

21
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,030
I can't do anything about Police Chief Li now.

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,180
This is really hard on you.

23
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,250
What is there to suffer for?

24
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,470
Everything in this world is a transaction.

25
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,070
What I have left now

26
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,990
is just this body.

27
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,430
If I don't use my body as a transaction, what else can I use?

28
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,350
I'm useless.

29
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,320
Miss.

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,190
Uncle Lai. What are you saying?

31
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,970
Once I get the secret formula, we will leave for a far distant place.

32
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,990
And start anew.

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,570
Sit.

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,070
Go out first.

35
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,610
Zhou Shao Tian. Old Cai said that Wu Hong Da was on the phone.

36
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,450
He was going to meet an important client.

37
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,760
That's right. Wu Hong Da told me that he had a very important client that day.

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,700
At noon, all three of you weren't at the scene.

39
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,770
Thus, the fourth person that Wu Hong Da met

40
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,040
is very likely to be the killer.

41
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,140
Looking at this now, when Ling Long was facing problems,

42
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,310
and Jiang Yu was in a hurry to acquire Ling Long,

43
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,610
it's possible that person gave him a loan.

44
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,790
I remember that Lu Man visited Wu Hong Da to talk about a collaboration.

45
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,890
Accordingly to the Old Cao's testimony, he was kidnapped because of the secret recipe.

46
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,650
Moreover, it was a young woman.

47
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,130
Thus, I think that the last person to see Wu Hong Da, I'm eighty percent sure that

48
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,980
it was Lu Man. She has been eyeing the secret formula for a long time.

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,730
We can try to combine all pieces of evidence together

50
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,180
and create a false plan.

51
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:46,290
Lu Man went to find Wu Hong Da to get the secret formula but he gave the secret formula to Jiang Yu.

52
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,360
When Lu Man couldn't get the secret formula, she killed him.

53
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,770
She had motive

54
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,500
because she wanted to get the secret formula.

55
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,720
She is the Military Governor's concubine.

56
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,030
My father could have borrowed money from the Military Governor.

57
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,090
So he humbly asked iss Lu for help.

58
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,440
Lu Man killed my father.

59
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,900
Cai Hong, we need to uncover facts.

60
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,280
The way the police works is that we need evidence.

61
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,980
Even more so, since Lu Man is the Military Governor's woman,

62
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,480
before we have any concrete evidence, we must be careful.

63
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,950
Otherwise it will all come to naught.

64
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,730
Cai Hong. Old Cai's testimony already proved that Zhou Shao Tian didn't kill your father

65
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:38,220
but he embezzled money and faked the ledgers. This is a crime.

66
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,710
We can now sell Rong Da.

67
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,720
The returns from the sale and also the Wu Mansion, we will return them to you

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,940
to compensate for your losses.

69
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,260
Director Chen, something's not right.

70
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:56,570
Look at the deed for the Wu family's home. The name on it is Miss Wu Cai Hong

71
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,780
and not Zhou Shao Tian.

72
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,390
Also,

73
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,390
Rong Da's deed and all the assets

74
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,080
are also registered under MIss Wu Cai Hong's name.

75
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:14,190
So to say, everything that Zhou Shao Tian stole still belongs to Miss Wu?

76
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,340
Director Chen. It's all in black and white on the documents.

77
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,640
According to this document,

78
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,630
other than cash, Rong Da's assets and the Wu family's Mansion already belong to Miss Wu.

79
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,560
We don't need to settle this anymore.

80
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,120
I get it. You can leave first.

81
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,500
Yes.

82
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,960
Looks like your father didn't totally misjudge Zhou Shao Tian.

83
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,910
He was really sincere to you.

84
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,200
Based on the situation now, did Brother Shao Tian commit any crimes?

85
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,380
The courts still need to decide,

86
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,810
but I guess he could go to prison for a long period of time.

87
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,960
Director Chen. Please help me. I don't want Brother Shao Tian to go to jail.

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,120
You can't be emotional.

89
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,470
Zhou Shao Tian committed a crime. He needs to pay the price.

90
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,900
To add further, he's connected to your father's death.

91
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,560
Didn't you want to take revenge for your father?

92
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,620
It was retribution.

93
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,480
If it weren't for the revenge, Brother Shao Tian wouldn't have done all that.

94
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,090
He already returned the money to me.

95
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,340
Even more so, he took Ling Long's money to teach my father a lesson.

96
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,150
He wanted to let my father know what it felt to be penniless. He really didn't want to harm my father.

97
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:39,420
Furthermore, when my father passed away, he did everything to help my family.

98
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,890
I don't want to send such a kind man to jail.

99
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,950
Director Chen. Please help me.

100
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,510
Cai Hong. I have been a policeman for many years.

101
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,570
I have caught many criminals. Each of them had their own stories.

102
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,820
I always remind myself of this phrase.

103
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,930
Poor person is his own savior.

104
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,690
The law is to protect society.

105
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,990
To punish those who have committed crimes.

106
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,350
I'm a policeman. I can't teach you how to protect a criminal.

107
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,050
Sorry.

108
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,990
Director Chen.

109
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,730
There is really no way to help Brother Shao Tian?

110
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,010
I'm begging you. Please help him.

111
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,550
Director Chen.

112
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,960
I can only tell you that if no one reports this case,

113
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,940
there is no case then.

114
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,790
I get it.

115
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:54,090
I will withdraw the report for Brother Zhou Shao Tian. Thank you, Director Chen.

116
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,680
Wait a minute.

117
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,530
I hope that one day both your father and Zhao Shan will learn about your good intentions.

118
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,000
They definitely will.

119
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,710
I just talked to Director Chen.

120
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,940
I don't want Brother Shao Tian to be jailed. Thus, I'm going to sign an amicable agreement with him.

121
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,600
You are not even asking me why?

122
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,090
If you don't do this, you are the not the Wu Cai Hong I know.

123
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,480
He committed those crimes because of my father.

124
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,180
Thus, I don't blame him.

125
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,080
Furthermore, I want to do my best to help him.

126
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,140
Thank you, Jiang Yu.

127
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,140
Why are you thanking me?

128
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,700
Zhou Shao Tian owes your family the money. It's not even my money.

129
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,600
Then, can you give me the chance to make amends for my father's mistakes?

130
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,650
What era are we in now?

131
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,790
Is it still a trend for the daughter to pay back?

132
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,130
I have already gotten Ling Long's secret formula. You don't owe me anything.

133
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,500
Zhou Shao Tian.

134
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,460
Brother Shao Tian.

135
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,020
Are you okay?

136
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,060
Cai Hong. I did so many bad things to your family

137
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,290
and you are still helping me. You are too foolish.

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,360
Zhou Shou Tian, we already took Ling Long's money as evidence.

139
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,980
But now, I hope there is an out of court settlement and withdrawal your complaint.

140
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,950
Cai Hong. You don't need to do this for me.

141
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,850
I don't want you to go to jail.

142
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,850
Cai Hong.

143
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,070
I'm a criminal and I deserve it.

144
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,460
You don't need to plead on my behalf anymore.

145
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,440
I'm corrupted.

146
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,900
Even if I'm released, I would be unable to live a life out there.

147
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,720
Better to let me stay in prison. Let me stay here for the rest of my life.

148
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,730
It would be a relief.

149
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,090
Don't say this.

150
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,090
This was all my father's faults.

151
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,970
If it weren't for him,

152
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,000
your father wouldn't have died.

153
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:05,720
Cai Hong. If you both sign this amicable settlement, Zhou Shao Tian will be free.

154
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,760
Let me accept the punishment here.

155
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,990
Brother Shao Tian. I'm begging you.

156
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:20,980
Don't just give up like this. If you leave, you can start anew again.

157
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,070
Can I really start anew?

158
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,960
Just like when you first helped me, I will do my best to help you too.

159
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,010
They haven't found my father's killer yet.

160
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,060
I still need your help.

161
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,840
Zhou Shao Tian, Cai Hong's good intentions,

162
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,920
I would advise you to accept them.

163
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,950
When you get out, you can pay back Cai Hong and the Wu family.

164
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,030
It will be more meaningful for you than to stay here.

165
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:17,820
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

166
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,570
Mom.

167
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,710
Shao Tian.

168
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,850
You are home.

169
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,060
I'm home.

170
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,480
Do you know how worried I was about you?

171
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,310
Thanks, Mom.

172
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,160
Everyone was sure that I was the killer.

173
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,930
You were the only one who believed that I was innocent.

174
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,000
Foolish child.

175
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,130
I'm your mother.

176
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:37,380
No matter what happens, I will always believe you.

177
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,850
If you have not seek Cai Hong in time to tell her so,

178
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:48,030
I'm afraid that I would already have been executed.

179
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,730
Miss Wu already told you?

180
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,700
For the past few days,

181
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,140
I have been thinking a lot in the cell.

182
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:13,450
The threat of an impending death made me want to understand many things.

183
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,110
I didn't understand why when dad died,

184
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,060
you made such a decision.

185
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,100
Mom. I committed many mistakes in the past.

186
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,010
I was wrong.

187
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,310
I'm sorry.

188
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,170
I'm sorry.

189
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,500
Shao Tian.

190
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,290
You are home.

191
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,390
You are home.

192
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,450
I'm home.

193
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,940
It's good that you are home.

194
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,550
My Shao Tian has come home.

195
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,390
I'm home.

196
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,280
Let me take a look.

197
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,920
You have lost weight.

198
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,080
I'm fine.

199
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,750
You have lost weight.

200
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,290
I'm fine.

201
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,640
You have suffered.

202
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,910
I'm fine, Mom.

203
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,140
Get up.

204
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,070
Come, sit.

205
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,790
Actually, I really didn't do anything

206
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:26,960
but you must not forget Miss Wu's great kindness.

207
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm just afraid that

208
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,240
I will never be able to lift up my head in front of her again.

209
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,530
Don't think this way.

210
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:44,060
I can see that Miss Wu treats you very well.

211
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,980
But now,

212
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,400
the only thing that I can do now

213
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,180
is to do my best to help her find the killer of her father.

214
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,140
I won't disappoint her again.

215
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:20,330
Dear. With you watching over us, our daughter has retrieved Ling Long's money.

216
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,010
Ling Long's factory and the Wu Mansion

217
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,120
belong to us again.

218
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,580
Thank you God for protecting us.

219
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,940
Stepmom.

220
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,160
I would like to discuss something with you.

221
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,010
Cai Hong. Are you crazy?

222
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,410
Zhou Shao Tian is our family's enemy.

223
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,480
If he didn't betray Old Master and steal Ling Long's money,

224
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,720
Jiang Yu wouldn't have acquired Ling Long that easily.

225
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,040
Forget it that we didn't settle the score with him. He even gave Rong Da to him.

226
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,440
What are you thinking of?

227
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:09,160
In my opinion, Rong Da is not just a sum of money, but also a first class company with great equipment and dedicated workers.

228
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,760
What's most important is that it was due to Brother Shao Tian's hard work.

229
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,890
He stole it.

230
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,680
If he didn't steal Ling Long's money, with his poor state, how could he have set up Rong Da?

231
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:23,440
He stole Ling Long's money to take revenge against father. He really wasn't in it for the money.

232
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,290
Even more so when Father owes them a life. I want to use this redeem ourselves.

233
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,350
Brother Shao Tian knows about management.

234
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,410
In my opinion, no one is more suitable than him to run Rong Da.

235
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,520
How did Zhou Shao Tian charm you?

236
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,290
When he was doing well, you didn't want to be with him.

237
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,000
Not that he's broke and not worth anything,

238
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,900
you still sympathize with him and you even want to help him.

239
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,140
Do you want to marry him?

240
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,620
After having gone through so many events, it's impossible for the both of us.

241
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,960
Cai Yun. Don't just stand here and say nothing.

242
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,150
Rong Da belongs to the Wu family.

243
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,320
What are your views?

244
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,590
Sister is right. I will listen to her.

245
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,440
You!

246
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:19,220
I don't care. Even if the both of you can't manage the company,

247
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,850
we can still sell Rong Da.

248
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,080
Why should we give it to Zhou Shao Tian?

249
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,330
Mom. We are already very fortunate to have our home.

250
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,210
Even so, father snatched Ling Long away from the Jiang family.

251
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,450
I feel that Sister is right in doing this.

252
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,350
Just give in to Sister.

253
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,600
- Mom.
- Stepmom.

254
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,110
Aunt.

255
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,300
Brother Shao Tian.

256
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,080
Cai Hong, you are here.

257
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,150
- Aunt.
- Miss Wu.

258
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,540
- What are you doing? Get up.
- Thank you.

259
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,850
Shao Tian and I should publish a notice of thanks.

260
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,320
Thank you for your kindness in saving him.

261
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,170
Thank you for signing an amicable settlement with him and giving him his freedom.

262
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:51,810
I will never be able to repay your kindness in this lifetime.

263
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,910
Aunt, get up first.

264
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,990
Get up first and we will talk.

265
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:01,310
When my family was in trouble, he has helped us a lot.

266
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,990
So, this is what I should do.

267
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:13,690
Cai Hong. Don't worry. I will find of a way to find your father's killer.

268
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,160
I will continue to investigate this.

269
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,900
But I'm here today to discuss something else with Brother Shao Tian.

270
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,460
Speak.

271
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:32,970
I have decided to let you manage Rong Da.

272
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:38,650
Miss Wu. We don't deserve this. You are already being extremely kind to forgive Shao Tian.

273
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:43,310
- With Rong Da, we cannot accept it.
- Cai Hong, did you take into consideration that

274
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,690
but by doing this, don't you think it makes me very pitiful?

275
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:51,730
Brother Shao Tian. I made this decision after carefully considering this.

276
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,840
Rong Da is an exquisite and profitable company.

277
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,590
It's also part of Ling Long.

278
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,440
It's also my father's business.

279
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,530
You should know that Cai Yun and I doesn't know anything about management.

280
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,290
It will only go bankrupt in our hands.

281
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:09,090
Why don't we hand it over to someone who's experienced to manage it?

282
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,980
I believe that Rong Da will do well under your management.

283
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,520
Huzhou is such a big place.

284
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,020
I'm not the only know who knows about the dyeing industry.

285
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,030
But our Wu family only trusts you.

286
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:33,410
Your father's death was also caused by my father.

287
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,470
I hope that I can use it to redeem my family.

288
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,870
It's already in the past.

289
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,220
We have already clear this up.

290
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,760
Even more so,

291
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,990
I also wronged the Wu family.

292
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,910
That's because

293
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,850
you feel apologetic towards my family and Lin Long.

294
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,500
Thus, you should manage Rong Da well

295
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,040
and manage my father's business well.

296
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:17,380
Do you really want to me to manage Rong Da?

297
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,980
Yes.

298
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,860
Okay, I agree.

299
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,910
This is the authorization paper. Brother Shao Tian is the General Manager of Rong Da.

300
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,150
Also,

301
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,990
this bracelet,

302
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,770
I'm returning this to you.

303
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,750
As of now,

304
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,960
we don't owe each other anything else.

305
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,780
Cai Hong.

306
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,610
Is this the answer that you are giving me?

307
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,070
I remember you told me that

308
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,010
we can start anew.

309
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,720
Sorry.

310
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,530
You don't need to apologise to me.

311
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,470
You really don't need to.

312
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,880
This is fate.

313
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,450
I can only hate fate.

314
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:11,110
If I didn't have any grudges with your family, we wouldn't have come to this stage.

315
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,460
Brother Shao Tian.

316
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,720
This bad deed

317
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,630
met with a wrong opponent.

318
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,980
Thus,

319
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,040
everything was doomed.

320
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:42,070
As for happiness, it depends on the right time

321
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,590
and the right person.

322
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,180
It's Jiang Yu, right?

323
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,030
Brother Shao Tian. You will meet a better woman than me.

324
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,250
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

325
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,460
<i>Whether you care or not,</i>

326
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,990
<i>whether you respond or not,</i>

327
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:08,570
<i>or whether you know or not,</i>

328
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,870
<i>that in this world,</i>

329
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:15,870
<i>there will always be someone watching over you.</i>

330
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,010
<i>Beatiful and bright rainbow,</i>

331
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:28,060
<i>appears only when the skies are no longer filled with rain.</i>

332
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,900
<i>No matter how, we will never be able to catch it.</i>

333
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,030
Brother.

334
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,630
- Fei Fei.
-I got good news.

335
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,940
Wu Cai Hong gave Rong Da to Zhou Shao Tian.

336
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,960
Looks like Wu Cai Hong loves Zhou Shao Tian very much.

337
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,360
Brother Zhou Shao Tian did so many things. She didn't even teach him a lesson.

338
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,330
That's because Wu Cai Hong is too kind.

339
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,990
Good always prevails against evil. We can only hope it can also ever come the hatred.

340
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,140
Brother.

341
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:13,060
Then... do you still like Wu Cai Hong?

342
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,530
Do you have any other matters?

343
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,420
If no, I'm going to work.

344
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,950
You are going to work now?

345
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:26,360
When you were injured and stayed in the hospital, you still went out with Cai Hong with your wounds.

346
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,490
I see you are quite bored recently.

347
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,990
Brother, until when are you going to act like this?

348
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,530
I already said many times.

349
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:43,120
I did this to find out who the killer of Wu Hong Da is.

350
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,350
Do you need to do this?

351
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,210
It has already been proven that you are not the killer.

352
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,010
Who the killer is, it doesn't concern us at all.

353
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,300
You are trying to help Wu Cai Hong to find the killer.

354
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,130
Frankly, you still want to be with her.

355
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,790
Are you done talking?

356
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,760
Miss, Director Chen is requesting to see you.

357
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,270
Director Chen?

358
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,190
Let him wait downstairs.

359
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,570
Yes.

360
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,520
- Miss Lu.
- Director Chen.

361
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,700
I didn't notify you in advance. I hope that I didn't impose on you.

362
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,010
Talking about this, you did.

363
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,950
I have an appointment with the Military Governor.

364
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,720
If you insist that I don't go, I don't have a choice then.

365
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,560
Please sit.

366
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,730
Okay.

367
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,300
I wonder why you are here to see me.

368
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,360
Miss Lu. I have a few questions to consult you.

369
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,740
Please speak.

370
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,690
Regarding the previous owner, Wu Hong Da,

371
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,070
do you still remember him, Miss Lu?

372
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,080
Yes.

373
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,800
We investigated and heard that before the incident happened to Wu Hong Da,

374
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,900
you went to meet him.

375
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,370
Yes. At that time, I wanted to set up a dyeing factory in Huzhou.

376
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,570
Thus, I paid him a visit.

377
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,470
The first time was with my father, when I wanted to get acquainted with him.

378
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,630
And the second time was when I wanted to share something with Master Wu.

379
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:41,850
What's wrong with this?

380
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:46,740
Looks like Miss Lu is very interested in the secret formula.

381
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,520
I do want the secret formula but within Huzhou,

382
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,960
there are many others who want it too.

383
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,790
Director Chen. Think about this. If Wu Hong Da didn't have the secret formula,

384
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,690
first, I'm not short of money and contacts.

385
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,570
Why would I want to share it with him?

386
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,890
Then, on the day of Wu Hong Da's incident,

387
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,410
did you see him?

388
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,320
It was such a long time ago.,

389
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,750
How could I remember it?

390
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,740
Please try to remember.

391
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,600
It seems like I was with a friend that day.

392
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,450
Director Chen. Since you have the time, why don't you pay that friend of mine a visit?

393
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,230
He should be able to testify.

394
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:38,290
Listening to you, are you suspecting me?

395
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,750
Of course not.

396
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,230
We rely on evidence in our line of work.

397
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,040
I just want to clear every detail of this case.

398
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,370
By the way, Miss Lu, I would still like to ask you a question.

399
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,090
Wu Hong Da's staff, Old Cai, was kidnapped a few days ago.

400
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,300
It wasn't easy for us to save him.

401
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,330
In the end, he told me that the person who kidnapped him was a young woman.

402
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,650
She also kept asking about

403
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,140
- the secret formula...
- Director Chen.

404
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,440
In Huzhou,

405
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,470
there are many young women.

406
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,040
If you came to question me based on a groundless rumour,

407
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,760
I feel it is a little bit inappropriate.

408
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,700
It was Zhou Shao Tian's man, Ma Li who told us that

409
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,520
he told you that the secret formula was with Old Cai's wife.

410
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,320
Yes. Ma Li did tell me.

411
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,890
I also used his tip to find Old Cai's wife

412
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,090
but Director Chen, I looked for his wife to buy the secret formula.

413
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,040
I didn't do anything else.

414
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:39,530
If this is the case, I can also prove that Jiang Yu went to find Old Cai's wife for the secret formula too.

415
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,780
Furthermore, the secret formula belongs to the Jiang family in the first place.

416
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:46,000
He would want the secret formula more than I do.

417
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,100
Is this how you conduct your case?

418
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,680
Director Chen. You said that you are not suspecting me

419
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,930
but to me it seems like you are investigating me undercover.

420
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,920
Sorry. I have an appointment with the Military Governor.

421
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,050
I won't be seeing you out.

422
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:16,030
Miss Lu. I'm only here today on official matters. If I have offended you, please accept my apologies.

423
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:22,700
Director Chen. I hope that you find concrete evidence first before you return here with official matters.

424
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,890
I'm not this patient all the time.

425
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,990
Uncle Lai, see the guest out.

426
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,550
This way, please.

427
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,880
Sister, what are you doing?

428
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,920
I am packing a milled powder.

429
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,920
- Are you having a fever?
- It's not for me.

430
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,650
Is it Brother Shao Tian then?

431
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,210
No.

432
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,490
Sister, where are you going?

433
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:19,410
To the police station to check if there is any progress in the case. Be good and wait here for me.

434
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,540
Police station?

435
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,070
If she's not going with Brother Shao Tian,

436
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,640
she must be going with Jiang Yu.

437
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,510
Mr Jiang.

438
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,590
Uncle Lai. Prepare the rickshaw.

439
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,450
I'm going to see the Military Governor.

440
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,980
Miss.

441
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,610
Military Governor. What are you here?

442
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,020
Did you come to pick me up?

443
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:11,810
Who is so brave to make you so angry?

444
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:16,330
Chief Police Li just phoned me.

445
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,330
He said that Director Chen will be visiting you to have a talk.

446
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:24,030
I believe you already met Superintendent Chen.

447
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,120
I thought what could happen. It's just this small matter.

448
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,450
You are unhappy.

449
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,070
Is that so?

450
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,770
Human life is such a trivial issue, right?

451
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:41,010
Yet what else could be bigger than this?

452
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,190
Military Governor.

453
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,910
I have been framed.

454
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,220
I raised flowers to look at them.

455
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,170
I raised a dog out of boredom.

456
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,410
I raised you so that you can live well.

457
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:08,300
It's to make me happy

458
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,950
and not for you to give me trouble!

459
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,410
Military Governor. I was framed. I didn't do anything.

460
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:21,100
Don't be so anxious to explain yourself. I am a warlord.

461
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,300
Even dogs hide from me.

462
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,010
I would also never let anyone take advantage of me.

463
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:37,240
Moreover, you are better than a dog. At least you can talk.

464
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,760
But mark this.

465
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,990
If you give me any trouble and make me unhappy,

466
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,830
I will strangle you to death.

467
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,210
I understand. I won't give you any trouble.

468
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,840
I definitely won't give you any trouble.

469
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,290
I don't care whether you really did it or not.

470
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,110
Don't ever do it again.

471
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,290
I understand.

472
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:07,060
In the future, I will only make you happy and won't give you any trouble.

473
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:14,170
Don't be sad. I already talked to Chief Police Li.

474
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,960
If they don't have any real evidence, they won't dare to disturb you again.

475
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,170
I know that you still dote on me.

476
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,490
You said that

477
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,780
I'm better than a dog.

478
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,610
I will be better than a dog.

479
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,370
Do you know that?

480
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:44,120
Will I really know that?

481
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,870
Military Governor.

482
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,900
Military Governor.

483
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,170
I made this drug accordingly to the Chinese medicine' recipe.

484
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,720
It will help the injuries to heal faster.

485
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,140
You can try this.

486
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,990
I'm not even a woman. How could I need to be so fair and clear.

487
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,860
Okay, thanks.

488
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,210
- What a coincidence.
- It's a coincidence.

489
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,740
We are here to check if there is any new progress on the Wu Hong Da's case.

490
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:01,050
I understand this land belongs to Lu Man. So I came to see if I can provide some clues to the police.

491
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,780
Let's go.

492
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,940
I just went to visit Lu Man.

493
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,980
She admitted that she met Wu Hong Da.

494
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,660
She also admitted that she's interested in the secret formula.

495
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,240
Other than this,

496
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,990
we don't have any other leads.

497
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,220
People such as Lu Man are vicious like snakes and scorpions. Moreover, she is obsessed with the recipe.

498
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,030
It's eighty nine percent that she killed Boss Wu.
