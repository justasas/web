00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:15,417
[theme music playing]

3
00:01:29,198 --> 00:01:31,576
[men shouting in distance]

4
00:01:35,622 --> 00:01:37,415
[radio chatter in distance]

5
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,213
[debris shifting]

6
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,843
[engine revving]

7
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:50,261
- [man] All the way.
- [indistinct radio chatter]

8
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,305
Break it up a little bit. There you go.

9
00:01:52,388 --> 00:01:55,016
Pin that area.
That needs to be cut, as well.

10
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:59,062
- Johnson. Yeah, I see it. I see it.
- Right.

11
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:01,189
[conversation continues indistinctly]

12
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:08,613
- Hey.
- Hey.

13
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:10,281
Any survivors?

14
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,075
Inside, your guess is as good as ours.

15
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:13,159
We're lucky only the restaurant

16
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:15,411
and the apartments above collapsed,
and not the whole structure.

17
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:16,788
This could've been a hell of a lot worse.

18
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,623
- Who's this guy?
- [firefighter] Chinese guy's the owner.

19
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:21,250
Says his wife and their tenant
were in the restaurant when it happened.

20
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:25,213
Can you, uh...
give me a call if anything changes?

21
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:27,340
- No problem.
- What's the matter?

22
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:31,385
This is... Luke Cage's place.

23
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:36,725
Rafe, this was outside in,

24
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:38,101
- not inside out.
- [Scarfe] Uh-huh.

25
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:41,104
Or there'd be shit
all across the street like projectiles

26
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:43,648
if the explosion had been on the inside.

27
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:51,615
If that damn thing works,
we get answers?

28
00:02:51,698 --> 00:02:53,783
If that damn thing works.

29
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:56,160
I'll call the precinct,
tell 'em we're on our way,

30
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,829
have 'em cue up the footage.

31
00:02:58,872 --> 00:03:01,875
Hey, they got their job to do,
we got our job to do.

32
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,091
Sir.

33
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:13,386
Are you sure
Luke Cage is in there with her?

34
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:15,722
I think so. Not really sure.

35
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:36,075
[Rackham] <i>Shut up!</i>
<i>In here, you got no voice.</i>

36
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:38,912
<i>You got no rights.</i>

37
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:40,579
<i>You used to be a citizen...</i>

38
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:44,500
<i>but from the moment you reached</i>
<i>the bottom of stupid,</i>

39
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,836
<i>your dumb asses</i>
<i>belonged to the state of Georgia.</i>

40
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,130
<i>- If you are a recidivist...</i>
- Bend over.

41
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:51,465
<i>- ...then you know the rules.</i>
- Cough.

42
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:53,885
<i>- If, however...</i>
- [coughs]

43
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,721
...this is your first visit
to the Seagate theme park...

44
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:58,222
let me just say...

45
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:02,852
long as you follow the rules,
you'll be fine.

46
00:04:02,936 --> 00:04:04,520
Rule number one.

47
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:09,358
You will obey every rule I say
after rule number one.

48
00:04:10,193 --> 00:04:11,986
Rule number two.

49
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,323
None but the righteous shall see God.

50
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:17,408
And since we ain't got
no righteous people in here,

51
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:20,411
God ain't gonna have to worry about
your shitty prayers.

52
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,748
So that means
I'm his mean, shitty substitute.

53
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:24,916
[Luke scoffs]

54
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:28,169
Rule number three.

55
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:30,588
Ain't no talking when I'm talking.

56
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:32,090
[grunts and coughs]

57
00:04:33,717 --> 00:04:35,927
Don't start a fight
if you can't take a punch.

58
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,139
I'm surprised I had to tell
a former law officer to follow the rules.

59
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:43,017
[straining] New life.
Not quite used to it yet.

60
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:44,936
[Rackham] Yeah, well...

61
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:49,107
Come on.
Good thing you have many years to adjust.

62
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:53,652
And remember, how you start...

63
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:57,824
is how you end in places like this.

64
00:04:57,907 --> 00:05:00,034
No one does it alone.

65
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:07,625
- All right, get 'em to their cells.
- [guard] You heard him. Let's go.

66
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:17,010
[breathing heavily]

67
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,146
[yelling]

68
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:31,816
[crying]

69
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:34,944
I didn't do it.

70
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:37,030
[men shouting in distance]

71
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:52,045
Just remember who you are...
and you'll get through this.

72
00:05:53,296 --> 00:05:54,672
[breathing heavily]

73
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,299
[softly] Carl Lucas.

74
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,386
I am Carl Lucas.

75
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,473
Damn it.

76
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:06,225
I'm Carl Lucas.

77
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:11,147
[Reva] If you don't make attempts
to befriend someone,

78
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,067
loneliness is guaranteed
to eat you alive.

79
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:19,864
Let's start with you, Reggie.

80
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:21,615
In here, I'm Squabbles.

81
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:26,329
Reggie... he had a job, family, a life.

82
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:27,872
You still have a family.

83
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:30,583
I haven't seen my family in years.

84
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:35,629
I asked them for forgiveness.
It seems like they don't really care.

85
00:06:35,713 --> 00:06:37,715
[Reva] How have you dealt with it?

86
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:41,135
I haven't seen my family
since the first time I was here.

87
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:44,472
Now I just take it one day at a time.

88
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,683
[inmates agreeing indistinctly]

89
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:51,437
Carl?

90
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:59,695
I don't need to, want to
or have to get to know anybody.

91
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:04,533
That's like
placing yourself in solitary...

92
00:07:04,617 --> 00:07:06,327
without actually going to the hole.

93
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,704
You can't trust nobody
in a place like this.

94
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:10,789
'Cause you used to be a cop?

95
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:12,917
[inmates murmuring]

96
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,836
I ain't the first cop to do time.

97
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:19,423
And I ain't ever sent nobody to Seagate,
so I ain't got that problem.

98
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:25,179
But trust in places like this...
sets you up for failure.

99
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,767
[Squabbles]
You know she ain't mean no harm.

100
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:32,478
Reminding you of what you ain't got
can be pretty damn mean.

101
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:34,438
Or it can help you focus.

102
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:37,733
You know, this type of loneliness in here,
it can kill.

103
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,528
Not if you stay strong.

104
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:42,864
And if you believe that, you're dumb.

105
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:45,324
You know, strength has its limits.

106
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:47,326
Everybody eventually caves.

107
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:51,705
If you're looking for a friend,
keep looking, Squabbles.

108
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:55,334
It can't be that hard
finding one in a place like this.

109
00:07:56,585 --> 00:07:59,797
Yeah, it is...
and most of them act like you.

110
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:04,802
[indistinct chatter on PA]

111
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:12,894
[Shades] That the dude you mentioned?

112
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:15,604
[Rackham] Yeah, that's him.

113
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:20,109
They say three things get a cop locked up.

114
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:23,321
Pride, power, or pussy.

115
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:25,990
Yeah, well, I take pride
in my power over pussy,

116
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:27,825
and I ain't never seen a day in lock-up.

117
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:30,744
What's he in here for?

118
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,122
[Rackham] I've seen his jacket.

119
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:35,791
With that amount of years
for what they said he did...

120
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:38,544
[chuckling] I'm guessing
he pissed someone off good.

121
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,297
Ah, he was sent here to rot.

122
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,218
Yo, man, time's up.

123
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:52,433
[Comanche] What you wanna do?

124
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:55,686
See if he bends or breaks.

125
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:09,867
[grunting and straining]

126
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:11,995
[Luke grunting]

127
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,498
[all grunting]

128
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:28,136
[groaning]

129
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:32,098
[alarm blaring]

130
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:34,600
[all grunting]

131
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:39,813
[both coughing]

132
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:45,278
I'm not just gonna take shit
because you're dishing it out, you hear?

133
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:47,613
[guard] Hands in the air!

134
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:50,908
I'm just trying to survive!

135
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,951
[grunts]

136
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:57,456
Guess I found me a gladiator.

137
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,292
[breathing heavily]

138
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:04,047
[shutter slides open]

139
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:07,300
[Rackham]
Well, you're a hell of a fighter, Lucas.

140
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:09,302
You learn that in the military...

141
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:12,680
or during your police training?

142
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:13,972
Hmm?

143
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:16,850
How'd you like to live like a king...

144
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:19,270
using them fists of yours?

145
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:24,192
We got some bad boys
who's pretty good with their hands.

146
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:27,236
And they making money in here.
Good-ass money.

147
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:29,947
I want you to get in on this.

148
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:34,118
Believe it or not,
it'll benefit both of us.

149
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:37,413
And I get a little extra coin.
And you... [clicks tongue]

150
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:38,956
if you survive...

151
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,293
get to be your own man.

152
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:48,216
Untouched, extra rations,
maybe a conjugal or two, hmm?

153
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:51,177
It's a good offer, convict.

154
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:54,097
Slavery was always a good offer...

155
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,890
to a master.

156
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:05,149
[men shouting in distance]

157
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,454
[grunting softly]

158
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:30,758
Connie.

159
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:33,177
- Connie!
- [groans]

160
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:35,721
- [Luke sighs]
- [groaning]

161
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:38,516
Ow. What happened?

162
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:40,226
The building fell on us.

163
00:11:41,185 --> 00:11:42,395
[Connie] How?

164
00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:46,815
Something came flying at the building,
and I got you out of the way.

165
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:50,819
[coughing] My... my leg... is trapped.

166
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:53,322
- [shuddering] I smell...
- [Luke] Gas.

167
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:56,575
We're not going to have a lot of time,
but we have to be careful.

168
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:57,951
[panting]

169
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:02,498
If this rubble shifts the wrong way
or if we make the wrong move...

170
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:04,667
it could set off a spark
and this whole place could blow.

171
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,796
Who do you think's gonna move the rubble?
You? Me?

172
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,300
You think they can get to us?

173
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,802
If they can't get to us,
we gonna have to get to them.

174
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:16,053
How?

175
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:21,850
Okay, Connie.

176
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:25,188
The best way I can put this is...

177
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:28,899
I'm kind of strong.

178
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:39,910
[whispering] Holy shit!

179
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:49,253
- [grunting]
- [rubble shifting]

180
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:56,802
[groaning]

181
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:05,353
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

182
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:06,854
Hey, you wanna play?

183
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:12,150
Hey, man, I'm talking to you.
Wake up! Hey, wake up!

184
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:21,118
[Squabbles] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

185
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,580
You think can't nobody read that look
a thousand miles out?

186
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:29,793
Cop a squat before you do
something stupid like catch a body.

187
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,713
You know, the best way
to stay out of the hole

188
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:35,883
is to stay out of your head,
especially when it's full of hate.

189
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:49,272
[grunting]

190
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:52,107
[sighing loudly]

191
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,317
[inhaling deeply]

192
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:56,529
Breathe some of this fresh air,
young blood.

193
00:13:56,612 --> 00:13:58,281
Count down your days.

194
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,039
[Squabbles] Man, you outta your mind?
You mean to tell me...

195
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:12,085
[stuttering] this cover
of <i>Rolling Stone</i> with Lisa Bonet, and...

196
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:17,675
the hair, the...
the nakedness, her eyes on me...

197
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:20,636
- On you?
- On me!

198
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:23,556
You mean to tell me this ain't hot?

199
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,893
Says it right here, on the cover.
"The Hot Issue."

200
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:32,147
Come out of the time machine, Squabs.
There's a lot of new honeys out there.

201
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,983
You don't know nothing about Beyoncé?

202
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:36,485
Nicki Minaj?

203
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:39,697
- Lisa Bonet's daughter?
- She got a daughter?

204
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,198
[indistinct chatter over TV]

205
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:43,867
Zoë.

206
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:46,745
Or like I call her, Godfather, Part Two.

207
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:51,459
The sequel better than the original?

208
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:52,960
[Luke] Close.

209
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,921
Look, I was defendin' myself
killing that dude.

210
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:58,841
- But you went to his house.
- It was... Whatcha... whatcha call it?

211
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:01,969
- Preventative.
- Just more excuses.

212
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:04,096
That's all I've heard
for the last 20 minutes.

213
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:06,724
I mean, do any of you
ever say to yourself,

214
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:09,685
"I... I have to take responsibility
for what I did,

215
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:10,853
the reason I'm here"?

216
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:12,646
What, you mean,
like, the... the 12 steps?

217
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,649
Yeah, yeah, unless you were set up.

218
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:17,318
I know I was set up.

219
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:18,777
- [chuckling]
- [inmate] Me, too.

220
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:22,573
- [inmates agreeing indistinctly]
- Even if you were set up...

221
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:26,076
you have to see your involvement
in what went down.

222
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,620
You ever say that to yourself?

223
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:31,540
You ask these men
to come clean with themselves,

224
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:33,459
and they don't know a thing about you.

225
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:38,589
What gives you the right to listen to us,
but not share anything about yourself?

226
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,549
That's not my role.

227
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:43,427
- Trust has to be earned.
- True.

228
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:46,722
Maybe if you tell us
what you're fighting...

229
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:48,891
we'll be a little more open
to do the same.

230
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:54,438
Did you do something wrong
that you need to take responsibility for?

231
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,943
- I did.
- What happened?

232
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:03,155
Was it a brother, sister,
or family member that you

233
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:05,073
didn't focus on like you should have,

234
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:08,452
while you were growing your life,
earning your degree?

235
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:18,003
Time's up, guys.

236
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,011
Mr. Lucas?

237
00:16:29,014 --> 00:16:30,223
Two minutes.

238
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:43,070
Most you've said since you've been here.

239
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:46,990
I might have gone
a few words past necessary.

240
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:52,996
My brother, he died in jail
while I was getting my masters.

241
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:59,002
I knew he needed help, but at the time
I felt I did all I could do, and I have...

242
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:02,673
[inhales] regretted feeling
that way ever since.

243
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:07,470
- Sorry I pressed.
- You did.

244
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:11,306
But don't be sorry.

245
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:14,602
And don't act
like you did it for the guys 'cause...

246
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:16,687
you did it to keep me from pressing you.

247
00:17:19,482 --> 00:17:20,691
Guilty.

248
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,736
What did that question spark in you?

249
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:31,034
I know...
what it's like to be on this side.

250
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:35,664
And... from where I'm at...

251
00:17:36,582 --> 00:17:39,001
that idea seems like bullshit.

252
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:42,045
[scoffing] You innocent?

253
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,548
Doesn't matter.

254
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,427
[sighs]

255
00:17:53,682 --> 00:17:54,975
You are.

256
00:17:56,018 --> 00:17:59,480
I'm guilty of a lot of things
that people will never know about.

257
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:04,067
I guess it's karma's way
of reminding me...

258
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:06,529
that she can be a bitch.

259
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,072
You should tell the group that.

260
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,325
You really do care, don't you?

261
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:14,953
I do.

262
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:25,088
[guard] Let's go, Carl.

263
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:32,805
It's not often I see a prisoner
leave you speechless.

264
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:34,890
[sighs]

265
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:38,811
He's in prison, but...

266
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:42,064
[inhaling sharply] he's not a prisoner.

267
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:44,024
Slo-mo, frame by frame.

268
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:48,612
[man] It wasn't a gas leak.

269
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,740
That was not a gas leak.

270
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:54,117
Who the hell would use a rocket in Harlem?

271
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,953
Who do you think?

272
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:03,293
So, some of the inmates think people
are being experimented on in Seagate?

273
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,419
Yes.

274
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:07,005
Jimmy Quinto said that, uh,

275
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:11,176
he was gonna get his sentence reduced
if he went through some experiments.

276
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:14,722
- Now, was he lying?
- [chuckling] Of course he was.

277
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:17,975
He probably did a plea bargain...
[stammers] or testified.

278
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:20,644
Jimmy Quinto? A snitch?

279
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:23,480
- Nah. No way.
- [inmate] Nah.

280
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:25,148
He ain't here.

281
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:27,610
Ain't nobody heard of him dying, so...

282
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:30,528
[Reva] I know you all think
because Seagate is privately owned,

283
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:33,907
there's some <i>X-Files</i> stuff
permeating the place.

284
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:35,075
There isn't.

285
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:38,411
Just think about all the stories
you've heard about Seagate.

286
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:42,124
The ghost stories,
millionaires hidden in dungeons.

287
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,586
[chuckling]
Tupac still alive on an island.

288
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:47,045
So he just got out?

289
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:49,506
More than likely, Jimmy just got out.

290
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:53,636
Only problem is you work for Seagate.

291
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:57,640
So, if it is true...
why would you admit it?

292
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,808
Good point.

293
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:03,604
I give you my word, Carl.

294
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:07,149
There are no experiments happening here.

295
00:20:09,526 --> 00:20:12,237
Damn, long as I've been coming here,

296
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,490
I ain't never heard her give her word,
young blood.

297
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,665
[Reva] You know, I appreciate this,
you staying behind.

298
00:20:26,835 --> 00:20:30,255
Took me a while to realize
that I was raised with manners.

299
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,676
Should've done this a long time ago.

300
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:38,681
Stacking chairs is easier than talking.

301
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:42,184
Why can't I get you to talk?

302
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:45,478
Hmm?

303
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:49,566
You're not a murderer.
You're not some serial killer.

304
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,235
You're a man who trusted the wrong people.

305
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,364
You made a few stupid mistakes...
caught a bad break.

306
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:58,575
Do you know how I caught that bad break?

307
00:21:00,577 --> 00:21:02,204
Talking to people.

308
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:05,916
- Trusting them.
- So why do you come here?

309
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,127
Because you provide hope.

310
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:11,254
Thank you.

311
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:14,758
When you're not trying to hit somebody
with that hierarchy of needs shit...

312
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:16,593
Oh, you couldn't just be nice, could you?

313
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:19,096
- I have a reputation to live up to.
- [chuckling]

314
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:20,931
Back away, Lucas.

315
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,272
I guess I gotta go.

316
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:47,958
[door closes]

317
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:50,878
[Rackham chuckling]

318
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,421
Doc Connors, huh?

319
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:57,509
[chuckling] Getting caught up with her
ain't the smartest thing,

320
00:21:57,592 --> 00:22:00,012
but, man, she's gorgeous,
I'll give you that.

321
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:03,098
- You looking out for me now?
- Why, you want pussy?

322
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:04,599
I can get you that.

323
00:22:04,682 --> 00:22:07,102
You ain't got to wet dream
about Doc Connors.

324
00:22:07,185 --> 00:22:09,354
You want extra shit?
I'll get you that, too.

325
00:22:09,437 --> 00:22:12,565
This about me fighting for you?
That's not the lane I want to play in.

326
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:15,235
[chuckling] You must smell a lot of shit

327
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:17,404
having your ass
on your shoulders all the time.

328
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:19,489
I make you an easy offer,
throw in some perks,

329
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:20,991
and you just shrug 'em off.

330
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:24,119
Well, it's lucky I'm a patient man.

331
00:22:24,202 --> 00:22:26,204
Smart enough to know you'd say no.

332
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:28,456
Gave me time to build a backup plan.

333
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:37,090
Squabbles, put down that shiv!

334
00:22:37,174 --> 00:22:38,216
[blowing whistle]

335
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:43,889
You don't fight,
I tear your little world apart,

336
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:45,515
starting with your homie Squabbles.

337
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:48,351
- [Squabbles grunting]
- [guard] Get down! Get down!

338
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,937
Stay seated! Stay seated!

339
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,564
- [grunting]
- Look at me when I'm talking to you.

340
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:56,068
Rackham, stop!

341
00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:59,696
I don't move quick, your man's gonna get
another 20 years, easy. Or life.

342
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,115
You want this stopped,
you tell me what I wanna hear.

343
00:23:03,992 --> 00:23:06,161
- [blowing whistle]
- [guard] Stop moving!

344
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:08,288
You son of a bitch.

345
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:11,291
Yeah, that's "smart son of a bitch"
to you.

346
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,711
You want me?

347
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:18,841
Squabbles has to be by my side
every step of the way.

348
00:23:18,924 --> 00:23:21,134
[breathing heavily] Only way I fight.

349
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:25,889
Can't believe you fell for
the club in the gut again. [chuckling]

350
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:30,018
[rap music playing]

351
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,646
[Squabbles] You know,
strategy's name of the game,

352
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,690
you want to whip some serious ass.

353
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,987
Stay on your center line.

354
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:45,367
Head, chin, chest, stomach,
and if you have to,

355
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,160
get at them nuts.

356
00:23:47,244 --> 00:23:49,246
Stay inside your man's shoulders.

357
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:53,375
You used to box?

358
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:56,962
I used to live on 42nd Street
back in the day.

359
00:23:57,045 --> 00:24:01,049
[chuckling] Uh, <i>Five Deadly Venoms,</i>

360
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:02,885
<i>Clan of the White Lotus,</i>

361
00:24:02,968 --> 00:24:05,137
<i>Five Fingers of Death.</i>

362
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:08,640
You think you can fight
because you watch kung fu flicks?

363
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:13,395
I know I can fight because
I owned that corner back when I sold dope.

364
00:24:13,478 --> 00:24:16,273
And any asshole who tried to take
anything from me

365
00:24:16,356 --> 00:24:20,610
learned up close how I became
Golden Glove champ for seven years.

366
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:25,157
Watched kung fu flicks
when I wasn't on the corner.

367
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,159
What was your favorite movie?

368
00:24:28,743 --> 00:24:30,412
Jet Li.

369
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:34,582
Uh, the remake of <i>Chinese Connection,</i>
<i>Fist of Legend.</i>

370
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,751
Better than the original.

371
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,587
You'd choose Jet over Bruce?

372
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:44,217
Nah... you can't oversee my training.

373
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:48,221
I can have an opinion.

374
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,975
It's like assholes. Everyone's got one.

375
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:00,817
[Comanche] You know how this goes?

376
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:05,113
You win, you get whatever
you want up in this joint.

377
00:25:05,197 --> 00:25:08,158
Booze, bitches, extra rations,
shit like that.

378
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:09,742
I don't want none of that.

379
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:13,580
What kind of nigga are you?

380
00:25:13,663 --> 00:25:16,583
The kind that doesn't like
being called a nigga.

381
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,126
[Comanche chuckling]

382
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,548
[blows landing]

383
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:25,883
[inmate] That's it, right there.

384
00:25:26,718 --> 00:25:29,721
- [inmates grunting]
- Yeah, break him up, break him up.

385
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:33,391
What you got?

386
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:38,021
[grunting]

387
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:39,772
Work it.

388
00:25:41,816 --> 00:25:44,194
- You got him now. Lay him up.
- Sending the fights out?

389
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:46,904
- [grunting]
- Yeah!

390
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:48,573
Welcome to the Internet.

391
00:25:48,656 --> 00:25:50,033
[inmate] That's how you finish!

392
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,494
Oh, yeah, he ain't gettin' up.

393
00:25:55,455 --> 00:25:58,208
Smart move with the hair.
Nothin' to grab.

394
00:25:59,376 --> 00:26:02,004
I'm still mad at you
for picking Jet Li over Bruce Lee.

395
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:05,465
Well, take it out on these bastards then.

396
00:26:06,383 --> 00:26:08,093
[chuckles softly]

397
00:26:16,268 --> 00:26:18,270
[grunting]

398
00:26:20,438 --> 00:26:23,316
Keep him off of you.
That's it, right there.

399
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,904
Yeah, there you go.

400
00:26:35,412 --> 00:26:37,330
[Connie screaming]

401
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:43,378
How's your leg?

402
00:26:44,587 --> 00:26:46,381
Uh, probably broken.

403
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:49,967
How are you doing this?

404
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,602
[inaudible]

405
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:05,024
[grunts]

406
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:17,995
[bones cracking]

407
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:22,584
[bone crunching]

408
00:27:24,461 --> 00:27:25,628
[yells]

409
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:37,765
[grunting]

410
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,025
- Get better next time. [chuckles]
- Yeah, yeah.

411
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:52,364
[Squabbles] See something.
You're changing.

412
00:27:53,615 --> 00:27:56,118
You're not really taking care of yourself.

413
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:58,953
[Luke] Why?

414
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:00,997
[Squabbles]
When's the last time you showered?

415
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,749
Or cut your hair?

416
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:09,046
Just seems like you're spiraling downward.

417
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:12,217
What I'm doing
ain't got no questions or answers.

418
00:28:14,677 --> 00:28:16,012
Are you losing your way?

419
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,017
When I figure out a way
to cut all this shit loose

420
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,686
and get us out
from under Rackham, I will.

421
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,937
All right.

422
00:28:26,273 --> 00:28:27,482
Widen your stance.

423
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:31,236
And stay on your line like I told you,
and your chin down.

424
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:33,905
[suspenseful music playing on TV]

425
00:28:52,424 --> 00:28:54,426
God, Carl. What happened to you?

426
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,099
- Were you attacked?
- I got into a fight or two.

427
00:29:04,227 --> 00:29:06,271
You haven't been to group in months.

428
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:08,440
Things changed.

429
00:29:09,357 --> 00:29:12,985
So you reverted to your non-verbal self.

430
00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:18,074
Who's the white dude?

431
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:23,621
The prison doctor, Dr. Burstein.

432
00:29:24,872 --> 00:29:27,292
Do you need to talk to me
about anything?

433
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:30,837
Reva, when it comes to me,
there's nothing to talk about.

434
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,922
- Squabbles...
- Ain't got shit to say about me.

435
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:37,302
No, he hasn't said a word about you
no matter how many times I begged him to.

436
00:29:37,385 --> 00:29:41,681
But I could tell by his silence
that you were in a very bad place.

437
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:42,849
Begging?

438
00:29:42,932 --> 00:29:45,852
I thought I had broken through, Carl.

439
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:48,188
We had broken through, but you...

440
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:51,233
Now you just seem broken.

441
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:54,361
It's not what you think.

442
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:59,199
It ain't all about me.

443
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:03,786
Sometimes...

444
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:08,250
survival costs.

445
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:21,429
[Shades speaking indistinctly]

446
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,896
[Rackham] Aw, y'all are breaking my heart.

447
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:32,357
- Hey, hey, hey!
- It's okay.

448
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,653
Remember, you push, I push back harder.

449
00:30:36,736 --> 00:30:38,405
Keeps order, Carl.

450
00:30:41,324 --> 00:30:42,742
Not smart.

451
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,663
Made me realize
there's two folks in here you care for.

452
00:30:48,623 --> 00:30:50,041
[chuckling]

453
00:30:59,842 --> 00:31:03,430
[Scarfe] Plates are blurred.
Closer traffic cam got knocked out.

454
00:31:04,221 --> 00:31:06,223
Damn SUV passed right under it.

455
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:08,518
That's not enough to go after Cottonmouth.

456
00:31:09,436 --> 00:31:10,562
How about the bomb squad?

457
00:31:10,645 --> 00:31:12,814
Get 'em down to Genghis Connie's
after everything's secure?

458
00:31:12,897 --> 00:31:13,940
[cell phone ringing]

459
00:31:14,857 --> 00:31:16,150
Detective Knight.

460
00:31:18,736 --> 00:31:20,112
[Scarfe] What?

461
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:22,824
It's that firefighter.
Something's happening.

462
00:31:22,907 --> 00:31:24,409
Okay, thanks.

463
00:31:24,492 --> 00:31:25,827
Go, I got this.

464
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,919
Hey, give me hard copies
of those videos, huh?

465
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:46,180
Yo, Zip. [sighing]
It's me, Detective Scarfe.

466
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,476
I need to talk to Cottonmouth.

467
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:17,587
I got to ask you a question...
and I need an honest answer.

468
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:22,717
You tied to anybody in here?
In a relationship?

469
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:25,011
Related to anybody?

470
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:26,888
I work with Dr. Burstein,

471
00:32:26,971 --> 00:32:30,182
but that's to do psych-evals
for the patients he works with.

472
00:32:30,266 --> 00:32:31,768
He's not in the infirmary.

473
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:34,604
What does he do other than creep around?

474
00:32:35,647 --> 00:32:37,314
He's a legitimate doctor.

475
00:32:38,274 --> 00:32:39,776
Carl, you can trust me.

476
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:41,277
[breathing heavily]

477
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:45,156
The guards established a fight ring and
the convicts fight until they're broken.

478
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,951
What happens to them after that,
I don't know.

479
00:32:50,412 --> 00:32:53,748
That's why my face
looks the way it does.

480
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:58,169
And I may have dragged you
into this bullshit unintentionally.

481
00:32:58,252 --> 00:32:59,837
- Me?
- Yeah.

482
00:32:59,921 --> 00:33:01,673
Rackham's a smart dude.

483
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,341
He knows I like coming here.

484
00:33:05,843 --> 00:33:07,136
Seeing you.

485
00:33:08,513 --> 00:33:10,807
He's going after the people I care about.

486
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:15,603
Which is why
I need you to stop coming here.

487
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:17,605
Leave this place and don't look back.

488
00:33:17,689 --> 00:33:20,983
- I'll inform the warden.
- You can't tell anybody shit, Reva.

489
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:24,612
This setup ain't happened
without the warden being in on it.

490
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:26,280
You can't trust anybody.

491
00:33:26,363 --> 00:33:29,075
I have worked here for years.
I have to do something.

492
00:33:29,158 --> 00:33:30,952
Leave.

493
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:33,079
Before this place turns you to salt.

494
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,924
Contact my lawyer.
Tell him I'm ready to talk.

495
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:46,843
I'll use him to get me
out of this hellhole,

496
00:33:46,926 --> 00:33:48,928
and then I'll take Rackham down myself.

497
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:51,931
- How long have you been fighting?
- Long enough.

498
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:57,144
- You didn't know anything about this?
- God... no!

499
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:04,569
Whenever, wherever... you find me.

500
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:09,907
Carl.

501
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:14,036
Why did you come tell me this?

502
00:34:17,206 --> 00:34:19,000
Because you give me hope.

503
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:28,092
[Squabbles] If you'd have told me sooner,

504
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:30,678
we probably could've done
something about it,

505
00:34:30,762 --> 00:34:32,472
like take out Rackham.

506
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,558
Someone would take his place.

507
00:34:35,642 --> 00:34:37,477
The hell you gonna do about it?

508
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:41,814
Stop fighting.

509
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:44,734
He not gonna let you just
walk away from the fight game.

510
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,193
I know.

511
00:34:47,236 --> 00:34:48,738
I got a plan, though.

512
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:52,241
I'm gonna build
evidence against Rackham...

513
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,869
then shut his shit down.

514
00:34:54,952 --> 00:34:56,203
[Squabbles sighing]

515
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,962
[exhaling sharply]

516
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:15,306
Hey, you look a little shook, Squabbles.

517
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:18,726
What was Lucas talking about?

00:35:24,649 --> 00:35:25,983
[razor whirring]

519
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:03,563
What's up, Carl Lucas?

520
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:10,570
Yo... you've been owning
those cats in the ring.

521
00:36:10,653 --> 00:36:12,697
It's either that or get owned.

522
00:36:17,827 --> 00:36:19,996
You know one thing I don't believe in?

523
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,414
Coincidences.

524
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:24,375
What you want?

525
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:27,128
[Comanche] I hear you tryin'
to get outta the fight game?

526
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:29,088
Who told you that?

527
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:30,464
Your girlfriend.

528
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:34,010
[Shades]
Squabbles didn't give you up easy.

529
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:39,390
- He alive?
- Ain't the question.

530
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:41,350
You're right.

531
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:45,104
Remember what happened
the last time I faced off with you two?

532
00:36:45,187 --> 00:36:46,814
[Comanche] Last time was a test.

533
00:36:48,107 --> 00:36:49,942
Rackham says you don't change your mind...

534
00:36:50,026 --> 00:36:52,444
we give you time
in the infirmary to think about it.

535
00:36:52,528 --> 00:36:54,697
[Shades] See, I'm of the mind
that we stomp your ass.

536
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:56,991
And find a new dude
to fight for Rackham.

537
00:36:58,242 --> 00:37:01,788
Especially since you trying to expose
some shit that's going on at Seagate.

538
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:03,497
[chuckling]

539
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,459
[sighing]

540
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:11,547
I guess I can't trust
nobody around here, can I?

541
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,425
[grunting]

542
00:37:49,836 --> 00:37:51,921
[EKG beeping]

543
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:06,102
[Burstein] He was attacked.

544
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:08,730
He's got internal damage.
He won't survive a transfer.

545
00:38:10,064 --> 00:38:11,648
[softly] Oh, Carl.

546
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:14,526
[sighing]

547
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,987
I trusted you.

548
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,990
[stuttering] It wasn't me.
They beat it out of Squabbles.

549
00:38:19,073 --> 00:38:20,867
They killed him.

550
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,994
[breathing heavily]

551
00:38:24,787 --> 00:38:26,372
[shushing]

552
00:38:26,455 --> 00:38:27,999
[crying]

553
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,630
You have to try to save him.

554
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:36,465
I've never had a patient
start off in this kind of shape.

555
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,425
- He's damaged goods.
- Do it for me.

556
00:38:38,509 --> 00:38:41,178
- His chances of survival...
- Do it for me.

557
00:38:42,263 --> 00:38:43,514
[sighs]

558
00:38:47,518 --> 00:38:49,061
Take the ferry home.

559
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:52,564
You don't have to be here for this.

560
00:38:52,648 --> 00:38:53,775
Go.

561
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:09,957
Yeah, you're probably gonna die.

562
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:12,794
But you're already dying.

563
00:39:13,753 --> 00:39:19,175
What you're about to see is different
from anything you've ever experienced.

564
00:39:34,982 --> 00:39:36,483
[machine beeps]

565
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:46,368

[machine whirring]

567
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:14,688
- Where's Lucas?
- Albert, this isn't the time.

568
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:19,902
Why're you trying to save him?

569
00:40:19,986 --> 00:40:22,363
Albert, quit overreacting.

570
00:40:22,446 --> 00:40:24,740
He probably won't survive anyway.

571
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:29,203
You son of a bitch!
You think you're gonna rat me out?

572
00:40:29,286 --> 00:40:31,247
You're gonna die tonight, Carl.

573
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,207
Albert, please!

574
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:39,130
We had a good system.

575
00:40:40,047 --> 00:40:43,759
I made money... and you got to live.

576
00:40:46,012 --> 00:40:48,139
Now I need to watch you burn.

577
00:40:48,222 --> 00:40:50,850
- You can't do this.
- Yeah, you gonna stop me?

578
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:52,726
[machine whirring and hissing]

579
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:55,229

582
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:13,956

00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:22,924

[clattering]

587
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,571
We're gonna get out of here.

588
00:42:27,654 --> 00:42:29,573
I'm gonna need you to crawl into there.

589
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,744
When and if we get out of here,

590
00:42:33,827 --> 00:42:36,163
you're going to have to explain
how you got this way.

591
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:38,832
[Connie grunting]

592
00:42:41,085 --> 00:42:42,794

[exhales sharply]

[screaming]

597
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:34,346
Sweet Christmas.

598
00:43:38,434 --> 00:43:39,601
[screaming]

599
00:43:41,978 --> 00:43:44,106
- [Misty] What's going on?
- [thudding]

600
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:49,528
- Back up, newsboy!
- [Misty] Hey, let him through.

601
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:51,988
Shine your light down here.

602
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,201
[thudding continues]

603
00:43:57,703 --> 00:43:59,913
Damn sure don't know what that is.

604
00:44:10,716 --> 00:44:13,552
- [whistle blowing]
- [yells]

605
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:17,181
What the hell?

606
00:44:17,264 --> 00:44:19,058
[whistle blowing]

607
00:44:23,854 --> 00:44:25,314
[Luke grunting]

608
00:44:29,193 --> 00:44:31,820
- [firefighter] Can you move?
- I'll be damned.

609
00:44:32,863 --> 00:44:35,699
I can, but I'm gonna need some help.

610
00:44:35,782 --> 00:44:37,784
Connie's leg is broken.

611
00:44:37,868 --> 00:44:39,745
[Connie] I can't believe you did this.

612
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,915
[whispering] Which is why
I think you should keep

613
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:46,168
what happened down here between us.

614
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:00,182
[sighing]

615
00:45:10,901 --> 00:45:13,195
You look like a damn fool.

616
00:45:16,698 --> 00:45:18,992
[line ringing]

617
00:45:19,075 --> 00:45:20,952
[woman] <i>Operator.</i>
<i>How can I direct your call?</i>

618
00:45:21,036 --> 00:45:23,914
I'd like to place a collect call
to Dr. Reva Connors.

619
00:46:10,211 --> 00:46:11,628
[chuckling]

620
00:46:43,244 --> 00:46:44,870
[sighs]

621
00:46:45,787 --> 00:46:48,540
I still can't believe
I punched through that wall.

622
00:46:50,334 --> 00:46:53,044
No one's survived
Seagate's waters either.

623
00:46:55,672 --> 00:46:58,216
Did Burstein know
that I would get these...

624
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,218
These abilities?

625
00:47:00,302 --> 00:47:03,805
The bath was only supposed
to heal you at a faster rate.

626
00:47:09,102 --> 00:47:12,356
I can't do anything
that'll let people know who or what I am.

627
00:47:14,441 --> 00:47:17,819
Hell, I don't even know
how I would explain it.

628
00:47:25,952 --> 00:47:27,203
Reva.

629
00:47:29,122 --> 00:47:31,458
When we asked you
about the experiments...

630
00:47:32,626 --> 00:47:34,503
you said they weren't true.

631
00:47:37,423 --> 00:47:38,882
Carl, I...

632
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,093
I promise I'll explain it all.

633
00:47:43,178 --> 00:47:45,263
I'll tell you everything.

634
00:47:46,765 --> 00:47:48,600
How'd you get your hands on all my info?

635
00:47:48,684 --> 00:47:50,852
You haven't always been a convict.

636
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:53,480
I haven't always been a psychologist.

637
00:47:58,652 --> 00:47:59,778
[sighs]

638
00:48:06,952 --> 00:48:09,663
Thank you for saving my life.

639
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:13,750
Thank you for changing mine.

640
00:48:30,266 --> 00:48:32,394
You're gonna need a new name.

641
00:48:34,355 --> 00:48:35,897
Any ideas?

642
00:48:37,608 --> 00:48:40,986
[inhaling deeply]
My father's a preacher.

643
00:48:45,115 --> 00:48:47,659
He used to say, one way or the other...

644
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,204
I would regret the life that I led.

645
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,001
He used to say...

646
00:48:57,168 --> 00:49:00,464
"The Spirit of the Lord is on me...

647
00:49:00,547 --> 00:49:05,677
because I have been anointed
to preach good news to the poor.

648
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:12,601
He has sent me to proclaim
freedom for the prisoners,

649
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:15,145
and recovery of sight for the blind...

650
00:49:16,397 --> 00:49:18,482
to release the oppressed."

651
00:49:20,776 --> 00:49:22,235
What is that?

652
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,409
Luke 4:18.

653
00:49:32,454 --> 00:49:34,665
He used to tell me that...

654
00:49:34,748 --> 00:49:38,043
no one can cage a man
if he truly wants to be free.

655
00:49:39,335 --> 00:49:42,964
So Luke... Freeman?

656
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:44,382
Nah.

657
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:46,677
That's a bit on the nose.

660
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:10,451
- How you doing?
- [inhales deeply]

661
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:12,536
I'll survive.

662
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:15,622
[chuckles] That's the understatement
of the year.

663
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,711
Look, we need to, uh,
talk about what happened.

664
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,088
Not now.

665
00:50:26,592 --> 00:50:28,802
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

666
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:32,639
I've been hearing some pretty miraculous
things about you surviving that explosion.

667
00:50:32,723 --> 00:50:34,140
You saved the owner's life.

668
00:50:34,224 --> 00:50:36,267
Why don't you just tell us your name?

669
00:50:46,361 --> 00:50:48,238
My name is Luke Cage.
