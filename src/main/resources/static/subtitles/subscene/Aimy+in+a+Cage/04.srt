The Cage of Love

19
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,620
<i>Episode 4 </i>

20
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,900
May we have good cooperation.

21
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,900
I have a request.

22
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,800
I want to work at Ling Long.

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,400
Since you want to stay in Ling Long so much,

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,800
I will fulfill your wish.

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,500
You better not regret it.

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,000
Is this alright?

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
<i>Yes. Pack it up</i>

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
<i>and tidy it up.</i>

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
<i>-Towards this side. <br>-Okay</i>

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,600
<i>Hold it tightly. Be careful.</i>

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,200
<i>-It is done. <br>-Where do I put this?</i>

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
<i>You put this here.</i>

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
<i>This is crooked. Towards this side more.</i>

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,900
<i>Coming. Coming!</i>

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,600
<i>Is it alright?</i>

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,400
<i>-Alright. <br>-Wipe this clean.</i>

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
Today, the new boss is coming.

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,800
-Yes. I even heard that the new boss is handsome<br>-Really?

39
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,700
<i>Come, help us to put them in.</i>

40
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,300
<i>Rinse them well, all right?</i>

41
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,700
Miss Wu.

42
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,500
Miss Wu.

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,500
Master.

44
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,000
Take care.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Boss Jiang.

46
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,500
Boss is here.

47
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,600
- It's the new boss. <br>- Hello, Boss.

48
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
It has been hard on everyone. Go back to work.

49
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,400
Okay, let's go.

50
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,600
Quick.

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,100
Over here.

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,200
Over here.

53
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,200
Come in.

54
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
Boss Jiang.

55
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,200
This dress suits you very well.

56
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,500
As a worker, you should look like one.

57
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,100
I'm a secretary,

58
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,800
not a worker.

59
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,800
Aren't you?

60
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,100
Did you memorise the secretary's codes that I wanted you to do?

61
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,200
I have memorised them.

62
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,300
Recite them to me.

63
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
First.

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,100
The boss will only give the instructions once. His secretary needs to remember everything.

65
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,000
Second.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,800
During working hours the secretary is not allowed to slack off.

67
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,030
Third.

68
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,200
The secretary must be on twenty four hour call

69
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,400
and is not allowed any delays in the tasks given her.

70
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,200
Fourth

71
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,800
Boss orders are to be executed immediately, regardless whether they are right or wrong.

72
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,960
Fifth.

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,800
Boss needs should be met with effort and fulfilled unconditionally.

74
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,790
They cannot be refused.

75
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Sixth.

76
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,500
If the secretary neglects any of the above rules, boss has the right to fire her.

77
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,400
Not bad. These rules,

78
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,900
not only must you remember them clearly,

79
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,400
even when you are asleep or dreaming, you must remember them.

80
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,500
If you don't follow them,

81
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,800
I will have you disappear from my sight immediately.

82
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,500
The second condition,

83
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,400
as a Secretary you have to stay close to me.

84
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,300
Never a step away.

85
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,800
Everyone should already know that

86
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Ling Long has gone through an exquisite merger.

87
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm your new boss.

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,100
<i>New boss?</i>

89
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,600
Miss.

90
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,800
This...

91
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,900
Miss. This...

92
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,100
It's cold.

93
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Since everyone is already part of the staff,

94
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,000
I hope that everyone will be loyal to me.

95
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,800
Staff is the most important.

96
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
Some people will have no doubts while others will doubt me.

97
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,830
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

98
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Are you trying to scald me to death?

99
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
<i>What is he doing?</i>

100
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,300
<i>He's being too extreme by doing this.</i>

101
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,100
<i>Miss. This...</i>

102
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,300
Does anyone have any objections?

103
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
If you do,

104
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,000
you can leave anytime. Don't force yourself.

105
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,600
I can give you two month's salary

106
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
as severance pay.

107
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,700
<i>This...</i>

108
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
It's still not hot enough.

109
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,200
Jiang Yu.

110
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,600
What are you trying to do?

111
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,400
It's either too hot or too cold? You have no intention of drinking it at all.

112
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,600
This...

113
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,830
I don't want to drink it. So what?

114
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,740
You are not happy?

115
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,000
If you are not happy, you can go home.

116
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,800
Jiang Yu. You are being too extreme.

117
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
If you are not happy either, you also can scram and go home with her.

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,900
- Do you think I wouldn't dare to? <br>- Secretary Zhou, forget it.

119
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,500
Brother Shao Tian, don't be like this.

120
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,100
I hope we can cooperate in the future.

121
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,660
If the factory produces good results,

122
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,800
I will not treat you badly.

123
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,200
<i>Yes.</i>

124
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,300
Okay, go back to work. End of meeting.

125
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,800
<i>Go! Let's go!</i>

126
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Brother,

127
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,700
it looks like you won't have peace if Zhou Shao Tian is working in Ling Long.

128
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,890
Why don't you tell him to leave?

129
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,830
He is a long time staff.

130
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,500
I hope that with him around, he will stabilise the emotions of the rest of the staff.

131
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,400
But don't worry.

132
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,800
He will leave anyways.

133
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,100
Cai Hong.

134
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,700
Let's leave Ling Long together.

135
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,600
I know you would prefer to stay in your home.

136
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
No, I can't go.

137
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,100
If I leave now, it will affect my plan regarding Jiang Yu.

138
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,900
Maybe, the death of my father...

139
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,800
- I will never discuss the truth about my father's death. <br>- But if you continue to stay here,

140
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,700
you might not find evidence

141
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,000
and waste your time.

142
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,400
I am fine with it.

143
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,000
Shao Tian, you don't need to worry about me.

144
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,900
As long as there is a glimmer of hope, I won't give up.

145
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,800
Cai Hong, I am sorry.

146
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,300
How can I blame you?

147
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,600
I chose it in this way.

148
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,800
Thus, no matter how Jiang Yu treats me,

149
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,000
I am fine with it.

150
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,800
Cai Hong.

151
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,600
As long as you stay in Ling Long,

152
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,600
I will stay with you and protect you.

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
I think the secretary's post

154
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,800
is still not suitable for Miss Wu.

155
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,200
Why doesn't Miss Wu

156
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,500
decide herself to stay or leave.

157
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:14,940
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

158
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,400
I want to go to the bathroom.

159
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
I know.

160
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,600
The second condition of being your secretary

161
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,200
during working hours I must

162
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,300
never be a step away.

163
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,200
Take a look if you want to. Don't be shy.

164
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,200
Boss Wang from Suzhou is here.

165
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,800
For this afternoon, I reserved a private room, to give you privacy.

166
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Check the arrangements. I will go over in a while.

167
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,100
Alright.

168
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,100
Wu Cai Hong.

169
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,100
What are you doing here?

170
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,400
Who told you that you could enter <br> my brother's office without permission?

171
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,900
I am sorry, I will put the files in order as soon as possible.

172
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,800
There is no need to.

173
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,770
You are just a worker. I am the boss now.

174
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,190
Brother,

175
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,400
Cai Hong must have a problem adjusting.

176
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,200
Everything she had is gone.

177
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,000
Boss Jiang.

178
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Wu Cai Hong.

179
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
My shoes are dirty. Clean them for me.

180
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,700
If you don't want to do it, you can leave.

181
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,200
<i>- Look. Isn't that Miss Wu? <br>- Yes, it's really her.</i>

182
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,400
<i>She was always so dignified. Now she is pitiful.</i>

183
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,700
<i>That's right. She's really pitiful.</i>

184
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,100
<i>Okay, don't say anymore.</i>

185
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,300
What are you doing? Boss Jiang.

186
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,880
If your shoes are dirty, I will clean them for you.

187
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,800
Between the both of you, who exactly is my secretary?

188
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,700
Look. She's really cleaning his shoes.

189
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,600
The cloth is already dirty. Shouldn't you change it?

190
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,200
Jiang Yu.

191
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Shao Tian.

192
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,900
I am fine.

193
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,400
I am okay.

194
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,900
There is no cloth?

195
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,300
You can use your own hand.

196
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,000
<i>She is using her hands?</i>

197
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,100
That's it.

198
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,700
What are you looking at? Go back to work.

199
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,300
<i>Go back to work.</i>

200
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,400
Come.

201
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,800
I am okay.

202
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,600
<i>Take care of this. Add the water.</i>

203
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,600
I never said your position was allowed <i>(to ride here.)</i>.

204
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
If in fifteen minutes

205
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
you are not in the Zuixian building,

206
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,800
you don't need to come to work tomorrow.

207
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,600
Let's go!

208
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Cai Hong,

209
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,600
Cai Hong. Cai Hong.

210
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,000
Shao Tian.

211
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,500
Let's go.

212
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,800
Sounds interesting.

213
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,100
Let's go!

214
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,900
<i>Watch out. Why are you riding a bicycle here?</i>

215
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,400
<i>Move aside.</i>

216
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,700
<i>Seriously. There are so many people here. Why is he riding his bicycle here?</i>

217
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,000
<i>Be careful.</i>

218
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,100
<i>Move aside.</i>

219
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Boss Wang.

220
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,400
Boss Wang, the price which we quoted you is already the lowest price Ling Long can offer.

221
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,200
What concerns do you have?

222
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,800
I chose Ling Long

223
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,400
because it lays in the old city of Huzhou

224
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,200
and because I could always rely on the quality.

225
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,200
I enjoyed collaborating with Ling Long in the past.

226
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,400
But, I heard that the boss of Ling Long has changed.

227
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,800
I do not know the new boss.

228
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,100
I wonder if the current Ling Long is still the same as in the past.

229
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,400
Boss Wang. I have acquired Ling Long.

230
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,200
It will be just as remarkable as in the past.

231
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
I'm sure that you

232
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,000
won't find a company better than ours.

233
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Even one with less cost.

234
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,500
If there are any problems,

235
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,950
I will give you the entire goods for free.

236
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,800
<i>What are you doing?</i>

237
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Be careful of the cage, Cai Wong.

238
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,700
Cai Hong, sit on tight.

239
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,500
Boss Jiang, you are really too young and too arrogant in your pressing.

240
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,800
It's just that the goods I wanted

241
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,000
were personally ordered by the northeast marshall, Zhang Lin Zhang.

242
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,200
If anything happens,

243
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,200
you will lose your head. <i>(be in trouble)</i>

244
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,700
Who told you to come in?

245
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Leave.

246
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,600
Cai Hong?

247
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,900
Uncle Wang.

248
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,200
I haven't seen you for a few years. We finally meet here.

249
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,900
Come, sit down and dine with us.

250
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,200
Sit.

251
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,200
You and Boss Jiang...

252
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,300
She is my secretary now.

253
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,800
I am just learning about everthing

254
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,000
and gaining some experience.

255
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,400
By the way, Uncle Wang,

256
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,800
are you here in Huzhou to order some goods from Ling Long?

257
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,400
We haven't finished the negotiation yet.

258
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,800
It was Marshall Lin Zhang who ordered the goods,

259
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,200
so I need to tread cautiously.

260
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
There is a variety of fabrics,

261
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,200
you should get it from Ling Long.

262
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Why do you say this?

263
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,000
From what I know,

264
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
there are a number of fabrics, of good quality to choose from.

265
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But Ling Long has changed its owner now.

266
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,200
Even though Ling Long has changed its owner

267
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,800
the skills and workers are still the same.

268
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
We are just as good as in the past.

269
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,900
Furthermore, if Boss Jiang had no skills,

270
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,800
how could he sit in the most exquisite position in Ling Ling?

271
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
Based on what Cai Hong said,

272
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,800
I think that I don't have to worry anymore.

273
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:38,740
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

274
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,500
Boss Wang.

275
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,000
Let's have a good collaboration.

276
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,200
Okay, I will be a bit long winded. <i>(repetitive)</i>

277
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,800
As Master Wang,

278
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,000
we put importance on quality goods.

279
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,600
Between time and quality, there is no room for mistakes.

280
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,710
- Don't worry. <br>- Don't worry.

281
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,000
Boss Wang, don't worry.

282
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,400
I promise this afternoon, we will prepare the dye without delay.

283
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,700
Where is your rickshaw? I will escort you there.

284
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,700
It's over there.

285
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,300
Take care, Uncle Wang.

286
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,100
You can be considered as being a bit useful.

287
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,600
That is

288
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,800
because I'm Wu Hong Da's daughter.

289
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,500
No one should look down on me.

290
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,400
It's very easy for you to fall to your death,

291
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,200
Wu Hong Da's daughter.

292
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,000
Don't forget that you still need to work.

293
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,600
Brother. This woman, Wu Cai Hong, is not that simple as you think.

294
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,400
Think about it. She's Wu Hong Da's daughter.

295
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
She's scheming to get close to you.

296
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,000
When you were not in, she overturned your office.

297
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,120
She even had the capability to secure a big order.

298
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,150
If you keep her with you, it's like rearing a tigress.

299
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,600
I know.

300
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,400
You knew and you still...

301
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,600
Brother.

302
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Cai Hong. How were the negotiations today?

303
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,900
It was successful. You know Uncle Wang too.

304
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,000
He was my father's friend. It was fortunate that he put in a few good words about us.

305
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,400
The way he treated you, do you still need to help him make profits?

306
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,500
I'm not helping him.

307
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,800
I'm doing this to help Ling Long.

308
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,480
My father was a good man.

309
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,200
I don't want the business to be ruined.

310
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,000
I also don't want the workers to lose their jobs.

311
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,400
Furthermore, if I'm of use,

312
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,600
Jiang Yu won't be in such a hurry to kick me out.

313
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
If I'm with him, I will be able to find evidence.

314
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,400
How do you plan

315
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
to investigate Jiang Yu's crime?

316
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,800
I checked Ling Long's account records

317
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,270
and pieced together that large sums of money are missing.

318
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,400
In any case, Old Cai has already run away.

319
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,700
I think there is something odd about it.

320
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,200
But Old Cai's whereabouts are unknown.

321
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,000
It won't be that easy to find him.

322
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,800
Why don't we do this?

323
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,790
Let's find out why Jiang Yu wanted to kill your father.

324
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,600
Once we find out the reason, we will know where to get the evidence.

325
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,200
What do you think?

326
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,300
Perhaps, this is not a bad method.

327
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,830
Let's go.

328
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,070
Brother, something bad has happened.

329
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,380
The dye in the workshop is contaminated.

330
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,080
It's Marshall Zhang's batch order.

331
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,050
All dyes are scrapped.

332
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,050
<i>Look. How could this happen?</i>

333
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,120
<i>Why is it like this?</i>

334
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,620
<i>I don't know. Come and take a look.</i>

335
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,330
<i>What should we do?</i>

336
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,350
<i>Boss Jiang, look.</i>

337
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,900
How could this happen?

338
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,070
We don't know how to revert it back.

339
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:31,510
The dye was good before we went out to smoke.

340
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,510
When we came back, the dye...

341
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,530
became like this.

342
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,970
Is there any way to salvage this?

343
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,510
-We are missing key ingredients.<br>-It takes a lot of preparation.

344
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,880
These dyes need to be exquisite so the ingredients are very precious.

345
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,920
Madder, bluegrass and saffron are commonly used here.

346
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,820
We also need a lot of fresh roses.

347
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,720
Even if we order the raw materials right now

348
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,410
it will take at least ten days. I'm afraid it will affect the delivery of our goods.

349
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,580
<i>How could this happen?</i>

350
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,080
Check if there are any big rose gardens around here.

351
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,430
And also,

352
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:06,080
in the end, we will find who deliberately contaminated the dye.

353
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,590
<i>Yes, who could do such a thing.</i>

354
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,160
<i>We can't make anything from this.</i>

355
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,920
<i>How could this happen?</i>

356
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,770
Looks like you are bored.

357
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,430
You don't have anything to do but clean my office.

358
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,160
There is not a speck of dust around.

359
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,950
These days a lot of dust is collecting.

360
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,390
Dye material was intentionally contaminated.

361
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,130
There must be a staff member who intentionally sabotaged it.

362
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,580
What makes you so sure that it was done by a human?

363
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,690
Furthermore, it was done by a staff member at the factory?

364
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,710
It can't be because it has been very windy for the past two days that

365
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,940
dust contaminated the dye.

366
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,980
The Ling Long workshop...

367
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,680
only our workers can get in.

368
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,450
Thus, there is definitely something fishy about this.

369
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,090
But it's very strange.

370
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,820
It doesn't benefit them to do something like this.

371
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,160
What do they gain to accomplish?

372
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,640
By the way,

373
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,840
you know the staff better than me. <br>Investigate this for me before you report for work tomorrow morning.

374
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,000
If you can't find out anything, you can leave immediately tomorrow.

375
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,880
Brother, I already asked around.

376
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,490
Only along the river of Huzhou is where the roses grows,

377
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:09,530
but no matter what, this Old Madam refuses to sell them.

378
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,310
With good business, secrets are kept but

379
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,590
as long as the price is right, the negotiation can be done.

380
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,210
Leave now.

381
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,090
Aunt. We are tripling our price offer.

382
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,930
- Please reconsider. <br>- No, the price is non-negotiable.

383
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,720
Why aren't you listening to me? Leave now.

384
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,280
- Mrs Jiang. <br>- Aunt.

385
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,930
Sell the flowers to us. It will be of benefit for you.

386
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,390
This will not only be beneficial to us. Let's be honest.

387
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,800
Your flowers are growing in the wild. There is no one to appreciate them, right?

388
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,870
What? Are you saying that no one appreciates my flowers?

389
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,360
Let me tell you. Even if no one appreciates my flowers, I won't sell them to you.

390
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,550
Just because you have an urgent need, you don't need to rip the head off an old woman.

391
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,910
- What do you mean by that? Leave now. <br>- Sorry.

392
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,070
- It's only just the problem with the price. <br>- You!

393
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,480
I'm not going to sell to you. Get lost.

394
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,210
- Aunt... <br> - Get lost.

395
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,730
Okay, Madam. Don't be rash.

396
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,190
We will leave.

397
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,670
Seriously.

398
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,170
Fighting over flowers!

399
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,950
What are you thinking of?

400
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,080
I'm really furious.

401
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,630
Let's go back first.

402
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:31,890
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

403
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,070
Brother. What should we do now?

404
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,700
Looks like we really need to give up on this woman and find another solution.

405
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,020
Of course, we must not give up.

406
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,700
Fei Fei. Get someone to run checks on her.

407
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,380
Everyone has their weaknesses.

408
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,360
She is no exception.

409
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,190
I'm afraid that she really has no weaknesses.

410
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,440
I already asked her neighbours.

411
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,550
Her flowers are in memory of her deceased daughter.

412
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,920
All she has left of her daughter are these flowers.

413
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:16,130
Furthermore, she doesn't have any needs. If we want to talk terms with her,

414
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,230
I'm afraid it will be impossible.

415
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,120
Wu Cai Hong.

416
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,220
Did you find out who sabotaged the dye?

417
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,370
Who did it?

418
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,920
I don't know.

419
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,960
I couldn't find out anything.

420
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,930
You can get lost then.

421
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,870
I still have something to say.

422
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,030
Speak.

423
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,040
Everyone here are long time staff members of Ling Long.

424
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,170
Many people work hard.

425
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,750
They have been with Ling Long all this while

426
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,750
and have been with my father since it was established.

427
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,290
I'm really very grateful to everyone

428
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:36,870
for your love for my father and Ling Long.

429
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:42,430
I am also grateful to everyone for your years of loyalty.

430
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,100
Today, Ling Long,

431
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,420
even though it's now under Jiang,

432
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,380
but no matter how they changed the name,

433
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,860
it's still Ling Long.

434
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,530
It belongs to everyone of you.

435
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,860
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

436
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,480
We are all really close.

437
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,610
We received an order from Mister Chang,

438
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,390
because of our high quality.

439
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:15,800
Without a doubt, because of our years of expertise.

440
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,630
But with some careless words

441
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,810
this all can be destroyed.

442
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,710
In order for it not to be ready on time,

443
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,080
someone deliberately contaminated the dye in the workshop.

444
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,450
<i>Who would do such a thing?</i>

445
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,890
Perhaps, this person wants to take revenge for my father.

446
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:36,120
In doing so, they didn't think things through.

447
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,130
By this all workers will be affected.

448
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,500
Ling Long may go bankrupt.

449
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,940
You will be unemployed.

450
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,130
How many families will lack food and clothing then?

451
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:56,010
<i>Miss is right. It always has been. </i>

452
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,170
<i>They have wives and children too.</i>

453
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,290
<i>What should we do?</i>

454
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,170
Frankly,

455
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,950
it doesn't matter if I leave Ling Long.

456
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,840
It's just that I want to tell everyone that

457
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:17,990
Ling Long belongs to each and every one of you.

458
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,680
You must do a good job.

459
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,420
Don't do any foolish things again.

460
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,540
<i>That's right.</i>

461
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,420
<i>Who did this? Why doesn't he stand up for this?</i>

462
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:35,080
<i>- He's dragging us down. <br>- He's harming all of us.</i>

463
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,470
<i>Who did it?</i>

464
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,960
Miss, don't leave.

465
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,150
I did it. Don't kick Miss Wu out.

466
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,460
<i>He did it.</i>

467
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,020
Miss, I'm sorry.

468
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,880
The hostile takeover

469
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,470
and boss's death

470
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:55,210
must have something to do with him.

471
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,070
I wanted to take revenge for Old Master.

472
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,560
Hence, that's why...

473
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,450
Okay.

474
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,540
Wu Cai Hong can stay but Zhang Fu needs to leave.

475
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:09,640
Furthermore, he must compensate for the loss of the dyes.

476
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,720
How could you do that? You clearly know that

477
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,330
Uncle Fu will never be able to get hold of such a large sum of money.

478
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:19,150
Cut the crap. End of meeting. Go back to work.

479
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,930
Let's go.

480
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,280
Uncle Fu.

481
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,410
Jiang Yu.

482
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,100
Do you know that his family depends on him?

483
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,230
His child has a disability.

484
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,300
In that case he should have not been so impulsive and reckless.

485
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,820
Jiang Yu.

486
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,700
I'm begging you.

487
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,150
Spare him.

488
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,060
Let him off.

489
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,560
You can't even protect your own position.

490
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,840
What right do you have to beg on his behalf?

491
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,680
Yes.

492
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,650
I don't have the right.

493
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,060
I can only beg you.

494
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,890
If you don't agree to let Uncle Fu off,

495
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,120
I will kneel down here.

496
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,440
Do whatever you want.

497
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,580
Get up, Cai Hong.

498
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,770
- Get up. <br>- Don't persuade me, Shao Tian.

499
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,180
If Jiang Yu doesn't accept this,

500
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,390
I will keep kneeling here.

501
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,800
Boss Jiang. I hope that you will accede to her request,

502
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,750
or I will leave Ling Long

503
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,020
and take all the workers along with me.

504
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,110
Are you threatening me?

505
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,880
No matter what you think,

506
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,180
I hope that you will agree to our term.

507
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,250
Do you think that the workers are loyal and will leave with you?

508
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,220
They are staying because of Ling Ling's reputation and their salaries.

509
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,470
If you want to leave, it's up to you

510
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:57,130
but I want to see

511
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,540
how many workers at Ling Long will leave with you.

512
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,950
Jiang Yu.

513
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,020
You will regret this.

514
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,970
Miss has been kneeling for a long time.

515
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,860
Yes. How could she endure this?

516
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,750
- It has been too long. <br>- That's right.

517
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,350
The colour of her face has changed.

518
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,350
Cai Hong, get up.

519
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,040
Get up.

520
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,540
That rascal, Jiang Yu, will never agree to your term.

521
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,570
Can't you tell that his heart is made of steel and stone?

522
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:54,260
Don't be naive anymore. Get up now.

523
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,680
Cai Hong.

524
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,860
Take her away.

525
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,980
Do not go against what I say again.

526
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,780
Cai Hong. You are awake.

527
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,640
Brother Shao Tian.

528
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:06,230
You fainted from heat stroke. Your body is still weak.

529
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,140
You must rest today.

530
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,070
Sorry, I gave you troubles again.

531
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,400
Don't say that.

532
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,800
Cai Hong, leave Ling Long.

533
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,990
I will help you to find the evidence of your father's killer.

534
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:28,260
I promised my father that I will find his killer.

535
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,730
Jiang You wanted to get rid of me due to the recent problems.

536
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,580
I definitely won't back down.

537
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,700
But, Brother Shao Tian,

538
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,700
you shouldn't remain at Ling Long.

539
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,900
Jiang Yu doesn't trust you anymore.

540
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,780
It is impossible for you to do this task.

541
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:51,170
Take your talents to another place.

542
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,940
You can do well.

543
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,080
Cai Hong. You are right

544
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,250
But I want to tell you this.

545
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:06,870
Regardless if whether you are a heiress or a poor man's daughter,

546
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:09,220
I will always be with you.

547
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:13,100
My heart will always be with you.

548
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,780
Thus, I will only leave if you leave.

549
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,990
If you stay, I will stay too.
