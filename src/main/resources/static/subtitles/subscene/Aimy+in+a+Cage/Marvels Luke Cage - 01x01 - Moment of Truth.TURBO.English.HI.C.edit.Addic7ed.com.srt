3
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:25,985
[Pop] They lose 65 games only to end
up with the fourth pick in the draft.

4
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:28,112
Did they tank that shit on purpose?

5
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:30,782
Read the words, Pop. Right
there on the wall.

6
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:33,743
Brother's got a point, Henry,
much as I hate to admit that.

7
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,369
That's right. Pay up.

8
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:37,496
You're right, you're
right. I shouldn't have cursed.

9
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,167
- My bad, Lonnie.
- It's okay, Pop.

10
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,251
[Pop chuckles] All right.

11
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,545
What's their record this
year, anyway, like?

12
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:46,089
[Pop] 17 and 65.

13
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,676
You know that Russian kid they
drafted? He better be good.

14
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,010
He's Latvian.

15
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:53,387
What they need to do
is fire Phil Jackson.

16
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:55,908
[Pop] Wait a minute, Phil Jackson
ain't out there playing no more.

17
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:57,684
Phil Jackson overrated, B.

18
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,811
Anybody can win with Jordan and Kobe.

19
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:02,563
Phil ain't no Pat Riley.

20
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:04,733
- [all groaning]
- Aw, Riley, again?

21
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:05,859
- [Pop] Yeah.
- Here we go.

22
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,485
[Chico] I mean, Pacino...

23
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:09,946
Now, I get why that white
boy makes your free haircut list.

24
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:15,618
The Godfather and Scarface guaranteed
that man an eternal ghetto pass.

25
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:16,804
- Carlito's Way, too.
- [Shameek] Mmm-hmm.

26
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,537
- [Chico] But Pat Riley?
- [Pop] Yeah.

27
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:20,640
[Chico] Why does Pat Riley get
so much love in this shop?

28
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:24,460
Right. Even punk-ass Derek
Fisher got more rings than Pat Riley.

29
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:25,628
Uh-uh.

30
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,838
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:30,091
'Cause the Knicks played like
men when Pat Riley was head coach.

32
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:32,343
Oakley and Ewing went hard in the paint.

33
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:34,846
Plus Anthony Mason and John Starks?

34
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:37,556
Drive the lane, you might
go home in a body bag.

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,183
All right, now I heard that.

36
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:40,935
Later with all that Instagramming,

37
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:43,396
"let's all max contract on the
same team together" bullcrap

38
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,374
- passing as competition nowadays.
- [all laughing]

39
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,066
[Pop laughs] Mmm. Yeah.

40
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,236
[scoffs] Didn't Pat Riley sign those
Instagram dudes down in Miami

41
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,071
when he became the GM?

42
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:53,697
[scoffs] Maybe.

43
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:57,911
But King James is the
truth. LeBron can ball.

44
00:02:57,994 --> 00:02:59,788
[Pop chuckles] Yeah.

45
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:02,123
Now pay up, Luke. You said "bullcrap."

46
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:04,625
"Bullcrap" ain't a
curse, man. I don't curse.

47
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,878
- [imitating Luke] "I don't curse."
- [laughs]

48
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:08,504
You don't cut hair either, negro.

49
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:11,674
Like, really, what do
you do up in here, bruh?

50
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:14,052
I sweep hair, Shameek.

51
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:16,971
I also mop, I wash the towels,

52
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:19,849
and I make sure that plate
glass window stays spotless.

53
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,102
It's called work. Something
you would never understand.

54
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:24,270
[scoffs]

55
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:28,524
Slam Magazine... Hmm?

56
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:31,945
Coaches used to live
up in this piece, son.

57
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:35,323
Kevin Ollie got a
shape-up right there from Pop's.

58
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:36,615
Pitino, too.

59
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,370
Stylin' and profilin', that's my work.

60
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,372
- See what I'm sayin'? Yeah?
- Yeah. Tell him.

61
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,916
For real?

62
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,336
Doc Rivers, uh, call you yet, Shameek?

63
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:50,338
[chuckling] Whoa, all right. Play nice.

64
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:53,299
- You can't even afford a haircut.
- [Shameek] Hey, you know what?

65
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:55,259
- I'm about sick and tired of...
- [Luke] What?

66
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:58,972
Hmm?

67
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:00,681
You sick and tired of what?

68
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:07,313
About sick and tired of the
Knicks losin' all the time, man!

69
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:09,523
- [Shameek sighs]
- [chuckles]

70
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:11,025
[chuckling]

71
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:13,736
You got some hair, too, right there.

72
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,239
- I'm not finished.
- Yes, you are.

73
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,448
[door opens and bell dings]

74
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:21,327
- Hey, Counselor.
- Aw, don't jinx me, Pop.

75
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,621
I haven't even passed the bar yet.

76
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:26,290
- Oh, you will.
- [chuckles]

77
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:29,002
Lonnie, you got Kumon tonight. Let's go.

78
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:31,379
Come on, boy, you heard your mama.

79
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:32,546
Let's get moving.

80
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,798
Don't make me repeat myself.

81
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:36,843
[chuckles]

82
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:41,389
Hey, Luke.

83
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,975
What time you get off?

84
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,605
I got another job I go to
right after I leave this one.

85
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:53,609
[sighs] Black man working. Ain't
nothing wrong with that.

86
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:57,738
[inhales] Well, we should at least
try to get some coffee some time.

87
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,920
Maybe you'll need a lawyer one day.

88
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,506
Hopefully, you'll have
some cards by then.

89
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:16,883
[chuckles]

90
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:19,969
[Pop chuckles] Hey.

91
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,180
Be sure and tell Bessie I said hey.

92
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:24,015
- I will.
- Mmm-hmm.

93
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:35,068
How's a woman that fine with a briefcase

94
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:37,361
gonna throw it at a
brother with a broom?

95
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:39,405
That's what you don't get, youngin.

96
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:41,282
Either you have it or you don't.

97
00:05:41,365 --> 00:05:43,409
- [chuckling]
- Oh, I know I got it.

98
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:45,703
Shit. [indistinct muttering]

99
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:48,664
[Pop] Whoa, whoa. See the
words... right there on the wall.

100
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:51,167
- [scoffs]
- Hmm?

101
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,003
- [Pop] Pay up.
- Come on, Pop.

102
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,964
[dryer whirring]

103
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,522
[Pop] Huh, there you go again.

104
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:17,818
I shook everything else after I got out.

105
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:20,404
Cigarettes, paranoia...

106
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:22,198
But the pacing?

107
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,576
I do it, too. [grunts softly]

108
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:28,204
Reva again?

109
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:30,456
Reva always.

110
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,837
Look, it's been long enough.

111
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,548
Give Patty a call. She's a good woman.

112
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,716
[scoffs]

113
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,261
I don't drink coffee much.

114
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:45,929
I don't think she does either.

115
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:49,058
[chuckles] Like she said, "Ain't
nothing wrong with that."

116
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:52,561
When I'm ready, I'm ready.

117
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:57,441
But you'll want a cup of something
hot and dark sooner or later...

118
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:59,402
Mr. Bulletproof.

119
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,321
- [chuckling]
- There you go with the nicknames, Pop.

120
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:06,784
You said your rebound chick took
a shotgun at point-blank range...

121
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,537
pointed it under your chin,

122
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,372
and pulled the trigger.

123
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:13,249
I still get the occasional headache.

124
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,043
Not a problem for you, Power Man.

125
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:16,669
[chuckling]

126
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:19,380
[Luke grunts]

127
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,593
Mmm-mmm. [chuckles]

128
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:28,681
I love it when you do
stuff like that. [chuckling]

129
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:31,100
You should be out there helping
people, that's all,

130
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,102
like them other fellas downtown.

131
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,687
Reva used to say the same thing.

132
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,855
Yeah, well, she was right.

133
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:39,775
You don't ever think about all
the people you could help?

134
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,195
You should be more ambitious.

135
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:47,116
What if my ambition is to sweep hair...

136
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,534
wash dishes...

137
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:51,245
and be left the hell alone?

138
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:53,414
Well, that would be a waste.

139
00:07:53,497 --> 00:07:55,291
You think I asked for any of this?

140
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,378
I was framed, beaten...

141
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:02,340
and put in some tank
like an exotic fish.

142
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:07,261
Came out with...

143
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:08,679
abilities.

144
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:10,264
Saved your life.

145
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:12,100
More like ruined it.

146
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:15,978
Reva's dead. [exhales]

147
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:18,564
I'm a fugitive.

148
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:20,316
So?

149
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,943
Take my advice, brother.

150
00:08:23,777 --> 00:08:26,322
The past is the past.

151
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,367
And the only direction in
life that matters is forward.

152
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,868
Never backwards.

153
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:34,205
I'm just living my life...

154
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:36,707
day to day.

155
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,917
[hip-hop music playing over speakers]

156
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,926
Why don't you watch
where you going, man?

157
00:08:58,812 --> 00:09:00,189
What's the gun for, Chico?

158
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:04,110
[scoffs] Is your name Wilfredo Diaz?

159
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,571
'Cause he walked out on me
and moms when I was nine.

160
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:10,533
I ain't need a daddy
then and I don't need one now.

161
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,661
[car engine starts]

162
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,918
- Let's get this money.
- Yeah.

163
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,757
Tsk.

164
00:09:30,594 --> 00:09:32,596
Hey, Pop, I gotta go. I'm runnin' late.

165
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,850
Hey. Look, if I wasn't paying you
in cash, I could be paying you more.

166
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:39,312
You wouldn't have to
be workin' two jobs.

167
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,231
I gotta do what I gotta do.

168
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:45,025
Always forward.

169
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:47,110
Forward. Always.

170
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:49,613
[sighs]

171
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:53,367
[indistinct chatter]

172
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:09,842
[vendor] Hey, yo, my man, my man.

173
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:13,136
All HD. Got it right here. Blu-ray,
too, 'cause I'm nice like that.

174
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:16,682
Tony Stark, the big blonde
dude with the hammer,

175
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:17,933
the old dude with the shield,

176
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:20,561
the green monster, and I
don't mean Fenway.

177
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:22,813
You can't get better raw
footage of the incident

178
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:24,773
anywhere else than right here.

179
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:35,075
- Hey, Luke.
- [Luke chuckles]

180
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:36,452
Every time.

181
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,580
It's the bleach. I can smell
it from around the corner.

182
00:10:39,663 --> 00:10:42,541
Pop has got you washing
towels again, huh?

183
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:47,838
Yeah, I took a New
Yorker off the top for you.

184
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:50,466
Can't tell you what's
on the cover, though.

185
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,886
Hey, I hope you got Connie's rent money.

186
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:55,304
She's on the warpath.

187
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,722
- [chuckles]
- Thanks, Ollie.

188
00:10:57,598 --> 00:10:59,141
[Ollie] Mmm-hmm.

189
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:16,742
Ten days late, Mr.
Cage. I need my rent money.

190
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,288
[sighs]

191
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:28,086
Here.

192
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:31,131
I count $300. Not enough.

193
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:33,884
Let me go to work and get the rest.

194
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,344
Tonight.

195
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:46,855
[audience applauding and cheering]

198
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:59,618
- [music continues playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

199
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:15,486
I need a favor. Short one
bartender. Dante's sick.

200
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:17,029
You got the cash you promised me?

201
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:19,698
- End of the week.
- Come on, Nate.

202
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:21,463
You can keep all your
tips out there, okay?

203
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:22,927
When was the last time you made drinks?

204
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:24,412
I know the drill.

205
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:25,913
Okay, okay. Clean up.

206
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:28,248
Put a shirt and jacket
on. Mr. Stokes has standards.

207
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:29,917
Though you can't tell by what he pays.

208
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,168
Excuse me?

209
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:50,729
Raphael Saadiq.

210
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:53,816
- He's as good live as you said he was.
- Even better.

211
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:58,468
So you're not impressed by all this?

212
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:00,906
I've always been proud of you.

213
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:04,785
[Stokes] This place was a roach
trap by the time Mama Mabel died.

214
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:06,244
Now look at it.

215
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:11,625
Harlem's Paradise. May as
well be the new Cotton Club.

216
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,627
Then I shouldn't be up in here tonight.

217
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:17,005
Well...

218
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,716
Madam Councilwoman...

219
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,303
Colon's Gym is ready to make a
sizable donation to my pocket...

220
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:25,639
and your real estate project.

221
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:27,766
Sometimes you need a face-to-face.

222
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,602
"Colon's Gym"?

223
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,856
Is that what that two-bit drug
dealer is puttin' on his tax returns?

224
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,524
[laughs]

225
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,192
Why do you even waste time with him?

226
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:42,030
Politics is where the power is, Cornell.

227
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,950
Forget about all this other noise.

228
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:46,910
My noise keeps you flush.

229
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:52,374
All that "keep Harlem black" rack-a-bully-ack
might get you re-elected.

230
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,544
- Damn skippy.
- But when the smoke clears...

231
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,005
it's niggas like me that let
you hold on to what you got.

232
00:14:58,088 --> 00:15:00,048
You know I despise that word.

233
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,509
I know.

234
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:04,762
It's easy to underestimate a nigga.

235
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:08,015
They never see you coming.

236
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,067
- What's that?
- It's a cosmo.

237
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:25,908
[chuckles] Your jacket's a little small.

238
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,911
So is your dress.

239
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:33,123
Touché.

240
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:40,964
- Cornell, my man.
- Champagne.

241
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:42,943
- [Stokes] All right.
- Councilwoman.

242
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:45,969
- What are you two celebrating?
- Success.

243
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:49,723
Partnership that should have
happened a long time ago, had...

244
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:52,643
my uncle and your brother had their way.

245
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:54,394
Uncle Pete was good people.

246
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:56,814
Salvador really liked Pete.

247
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,525
Anytime.

248
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:09,409
- [Luke] Lookin' for somethin'?
- No.

249
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:13,956
Saadiq's still got it. [chuckles]

250
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,457
Stone Rollin' was a dope album.

251
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,794
[chuckling] "Album"? Now
I know you're an old head.

252
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,090
You ain't no spring
chicken neither, sucker.

253
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:25,676
Touché.

254
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:31,014
[chuckling]

255
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:33,350
[man] All right. So let
me get this straight.

256
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:35,477
I give your cousin a contribution

257
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,938
and it's like a get out of
jail free card for me, right?

258
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:39,522
That's something to celebrate.

259
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,984
No, I don't do that.

260
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,569
[chuckles]

261
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:45,403
[inhales] See, me...

262
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:49,157
I celebrate when things are
finished. Not when it's just starting.

263
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,243
[woman] Listen to him.

264
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:54,162
This is nothing to celebrate.

265
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,998
You saw what happened to Fisk.

266
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,792
You two shouldn't even
be seen together...

267
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:01,086
let alone having me all
up in the Kool-Aid.

268
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:05,674
But you're here anyway. Something
must be right about it.

269
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,886
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
fronted me if you didn't agree.

270
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:11,639
I have no illusions about
our family's legacy.

271
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:16,977
But you are now turning legitimate
money illegal all over again.

272
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,939
[chuckles] What's illegal about it?

273
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:24,026
Our product is protected
by the Constitution.

274
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,154
But you came to me because
you trust me, Domingo.

275
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:29,447
[R&B music playing]

276
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,291
In your business, people need my
product like a fish needs water.

277
00:17:39,374 --> 00:17:41,877
- He can buy his water anywhere.
- Nah.

278
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,504
What I sell is pure.

<i>This the kind of shit that
could blow a hole in a battleship.</i>

280

<i>But it's light enough
to hold in your hand.</i>

281
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:52,846
<i>Trust me, Domingo.</i>

282
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,974
<i>You can brighten someone's
day permanently with this shit.</i>

<i>The crème de la crème.</i>

285

<i>This that grade A, military,
Justin Hammer-level shit.</i>

286
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,778
A hundred large per
case. Ten cases, a cool mil.

287
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:10,656
<i>Wholesale. Brand spanking new.</i>

288
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:15,243
<i>No serial numbers... because
my connect is nice like that.</i>

289
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,487
[Domingo] <i>Who's your connect?</i>

290
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:19,039
[Stokes] <i>He's real and
his inventory runs deep.</i>

291
00:18:19,122 --> 00:18:21,333
- So that's it.
- That's it.

292
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,837
- Easy-peasy.
- Nothing's ever that easy.

293
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,339
So what happens after
they call to confirm?

294
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:29,549
Everyone walks away happy.

295
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,386
UPS ain't the only brown that delivers.

00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:57,410

[Shameek] Yeah, kid. That's
what I'm talkin' about.

00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:04,978
Yeah.

Yo, you see this? Damn!

[man] Yo! You wasn't
supposed to kill nobody, man!

I had to make a move,
Dante. Shit went left. My bad.

[gasping] Oh, my God. Oh, fuck. God.

gag you with your panties.

Yo, this shit is like
some Hollywood shit for real.

309
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:25,308
[Dante] Shameek, what am I gonna
do? They're gonna know it was me.

310
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,143
B, there's, like, a
million dollars right here.

311
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,544
Cottonmouth always lookin'
down at me at the bar.

312
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:32,547
He's gonna know I'm gone. They
gonna know it was a inside job.

313
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,008
- You right.
- [gunshot]

314
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:38,095
What'd you do?

315
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:39,721
- [breathing heavily]
- Yo, shit works.

316
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,598
Yo, this shit works, Chico.

317
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:43,725
Dante would have snitched.

318
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,978
You see... you see how shook he was?

319
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:47,520
Come on, man. I ain't...

320
00:20:47,604 --> 00:20:50,523
Ain't no way I'm splitting that
shit three ways no how, man.

Dante was crew, B. That's Dante!

00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:56,363
Yo, I made a
decision. I'm gonna be rich.

- [Chico breathing heavily]
- Let's go.

[R&B music playing]

326
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:34,609
So you're a bench-warmer?
Or did you miss the cut?

327
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:35,777
Excuse me?

328
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:38,780
I just figured you were... one of his.

329
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:41,616
One of Cottonmouth's?

330
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:43,743
[chuckles] I hear he hates that name.

331
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:46,788
- Mr. Stokes'...
- Cottonmouth's...

332
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,041
Models.

333
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:51,919
What makes you assume that?

334
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,380
You're beautiful. But...

335
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:57,049
But what?

336
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,887
You're a little older than
he usually likes them.

337
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,889
[chuckles]

338
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:07,142
Yeah, you're definitely not
getting a tip tonight.

339

But I'm not finished.

00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,188
Mmm.

Dumb men like little girls.

Me?

00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,861
I ponder a woman.

344
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:23,241
Why don't you...

345
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:28,956
ponder me another cosmo?

00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,084
[both chuckle]

347
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:34,377
[Candace] Luke.

348
00:22:35,545 --> 00:22:36,671
Hey, Candace.

349
00:22:37,714 --> 00:22:39,007
You got promoted?

350
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,468
Dante's out sick.

351
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:44,012
You okay?

352
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:47,724
Table seven wants six
bottles of Ace of Spades.

353
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:49,267
I need you to help me carry them up.

354
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:57,109
I don't like being up there by myself.

355
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,612
I'm right behind you. Give me a second.

356
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:18,380
Why don't you... ponder
that 'til I get back.

357
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:41,944
You're a big one, eh?

358
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,946
He's wearing a little jacket.

359
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:46,033
[Stokes laughs]

360
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,952
Haven't seen you behind the bar.

361
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:51,704
Where's Dante?

362
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:54,666
Called in sick, I guess.

363
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,419
You want a job?

364
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:02,799
I can find something more
suitable for a man your size.

365
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:05,177
Better paying, too.

366
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:08,513
You ever carried a gun?

367
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:10,557
No.

368
00:24:11,808 --> 00:24:14,102
I'm good. Thanks.

369
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,445
[Dante groaning]

370
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:32,870
[cell phone ringing]

371
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:38,835
Yeah?

372
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:45,217
Shit. Fuck.

373
00:24:50,763 --> 00:24:52,432
[speaking indistinctly]

374
00:25:03,443 --> 00:25:05,320
[typing]

375
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:13,721
You got to walk over
to Adam Clayton Powell

376
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,288
if you wanna catch the bus.

377
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,835
Uber?

378
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,631
- That's what you were gonna press, right?
- What are you?

379
00:25:24,714 --> 00:25:27,634
- A cop?
- [chuckles] No.

380
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,762
You just look cold.

381
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:39,937
If you're looking for
Mr. Stokes, he just left.

382
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:42,565
Who?

383
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:44,859
Black Escalade.

384
00:25:45,902 --> 00:25:47,445
Tinted windows.

385
00:25:50,114 --> 00:25:53,701
Don't you have... somewhere
you need to be?

386
00:25:56,078 --> 00:25:57,372
Yeah.

387
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,416
Home.

388
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,709
Just got off.

389
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,878
Congratulations.

390
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,387
You wanna go grab a coffee?

391
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:22,939
I don't like coffee.

392
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:25,233
Neither do I.

393
00:26:29,612 --> 00:26:30,863
[keys clatter]

394
00:26:45,462 --> 00:26:47,129
[Luke exhales]

395
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:50,091
[moans]

396
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:07,024
[both breathing heavily]

397
00:27:31,508 --> 00:27:32,634
[Luke grunts]

398
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:43,102
[Luke exhales]

399
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:51,027
[men grunting]

400
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,446
[cell phone ringing]

401
00:27:56,115 --> 00:27:57,742
- [gasps]
- [woman] When?

402
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:00,662
I'm on my way in.

403
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:03,915
[sighs]

404
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,462
You talk in your sleep.

405
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:12,465
What was I saying?

406
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:16,553
Shades? Comanche?

407
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:17,845
[Luke sighs]

408
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,436
The job is calling me in.

409
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:26,187
Can I call you later?

410
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:30,107
[sighs] You'd need my
phone number for that.

411
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,615
I know where you work.

412
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:39,534
I'll find you.

413
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,287
What is it you do again?

414
00:28:48,835 --> 00:28:50,044
[zipping]

415
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:51,963
I'm an auditor.

416
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:55,967
What's that?

417
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,222
Basically, I look at
the financial books.

418
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,600
Make sure everything's on the up and up.

419
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,144
And you need a short dress for that?

420
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:14,110
Sometimes you got to blend in.

421
00:29:14,193 --> 00:29:15,695
Impossible.

422
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:18,990
You stand out in any room you're in.

423
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,640
[machinery whirring]

424
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:28,476
[camera shutters clicking]

425
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:40,405
Dominicans? Cubans?

426
00:30:40,488 --> 00:30:41,698
Puerto Ricans.

427
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:44,366
[Scarfe] Thought that
parade was last week.

428
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,118
- Who can keep track?
- [both chuckling]

429
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:51,499
Who do you think this
guy was trying to call?

430
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:54,168
- Ghostbusters.
- [chuckles]

431
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:55,837
He can laugh. You can't.

432
00:30:57,129 --> 00:30:59,632
Hey, Bailey. How you doing?

433
00:30:59,716 --> 00:31:02,427
It's another beautiful day at
the office. What's not to love?

434
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,096
Don't you start
singing show tunes on me.

435
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,851
Oh, shit.

436
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,269
Dante Chapman.

437
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:13,646
You know him?

438
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:16,899
I know his mama.

439
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:23,114
[Stokes] Of course it
wasn't a inside job.

440
00:31:24,031 --> 00:31:25,658
We had people die, too.

441
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:29,704
Look... I don't have the stuff.

442
00:31:30,997 --> 00:31:34,125
Hmm. We need to talk
about this in person.

443
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,168
My word is still my bond.

444
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:40,047
Hello?

445
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:44,511
That's Domingo?

446
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:47,972
Yo, what's up?

447
00:31:48,055 --> 00:31:49,181
[sighs]

448
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,727
It's above your pay grade.

449
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,936
What?

450
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,981
[man] Tell your man what's
going on, Cornell.

451
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:02,069
Nice digs.

452
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,114
Even nicer than when Mama Mabel ran it.

453
00:32:05,197 --> 00:32:06,658
Shades.

454
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:10,036
When'd you come home?

455
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,789
[takes deep breath] Ooh, a while ago.

456
00:32:12,872 --> 00:32:14,582
Seagate wasn't shit.

457
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,083
Hmm.

458
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:21,923
[clears throat]
So... what can I do for you?

459
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,133
It's the other way around.

460
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:26,886
Y'all got hit last night.

461
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:29,847
That expensive, exclusive,

462
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:32,517
hard-to-get hardware that
Diamondback gave you

463
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,435
is in a police evidence lockup.

464
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:39,941
And the money... that Domingo and
his crew were supposed to give you...

465
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,400
is gone.

466
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:45,655
I'm with Diamondback now.
You knew that, right?

467
00:32:46,322 --> 00:32:47,963
Well, tell
Diamondback, it's about time...

468
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,702
Uh-uh... Diamondback tells you.

469
00:32:52,244 --> 00:32:54,371
[laughs]

470
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:56,165
I'm his number one seller.

471
00:32:56,248 --> 00:32:57,875
I ain't here to spank you.

472
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,171
But I do need to look
you in your eyes...

473
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,884
Was it an inside job?

474
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,386
No.

475
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,222
Hell no.

476
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:12,849
I needed that money, too.

477
00:33:12,932 --> 00:33:14,391
[sighs]

478
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,519
It took forever to build
up that kind of trust.

479
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:19,772
We're here to get you back on your feet.

480
00:33:19,856 --> 00:33:20,898
Whatever you need.

481
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:23,776
Who is "we," you fake-ass Ray Charles?

482
00:33:25,194 --> 00:33:26,571
[chuckles]

483
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:31,701
I got your back, B.

484
00:33:32,785 --> 00:33:34,328
Just like back in the day.

485
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:36,497
Forget about back in the day.

486
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,959
Why is this feeling like a takeover?

487
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:41,460
[chuckling softly] It's not.

488
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:44,505
If it was...

489
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,133
you would never even
see Diamondback comin'.

490
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:48,885
He wants you to win.

491
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:52,221
How can I help?

492
00:34:01,563 --> 00:34:03,733
[indistinct chatter]

493
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:17,664
[Pop] <i>Dante was one of
my kids. So was Chico.</i>

494
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:19,624
And Shameek, too.

495
00:34:19,707 --> 00:34:22,293
Just like those kids playing over there.

496
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:26,297
[scoffs] You know, that's
how you get 'em on your side.

497
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,300
Sweepin' up hair. Runnin'
errands. [chuckling]

498
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:34,221
Lettin' 'em hang out, play video games.

499
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:38,017
Anything is better than what's waiting
for them out there on the street.

500
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,647
They want a way out...

501
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:48,778
but they have too much
pride to ask for help.

502
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:52,782
So you gotta Jedi mind-trick
them into something. [chuckles]

503
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:56,160
Everyone has a gun.
[sighs] No one has a father.

504
00:34:56,243 --> 00:34:58,370
Ain't that the truth.

505
00:34:58,454 --> 00:34:59,872
You sure they did it?

506
00:34:59,956 --> 00:35:03,960
People started callin' me half
an hour after it happened.

507
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:07,922
Shameek has always been the spark plug.

508
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,592
And Chico... a follower.

509
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,764
I just can't believe that
either one of them...

510
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,225
would just turn around...

511
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,438
and kill... Dante.

512
00:35:26,983 --> 00:35:30,778
You didn't see anything going
on with either one of 'em, did you?

513
00:35:34,991 --> 00:35:36,283
No.

514
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,666
You live and die by your choices.

515
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:47,628
This is Harlem's garden. That's
what's happening here.

516
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,923
You are the ones that are
gonna keep this community...

517
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:52,842
[chuckles and gasps]

518
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:55,845
Where have... Oh, God.
This is Marisol. Baby...

519
00:35:55,928 --> 00:35:58,723
Oh, my God, known her
since she was first born.

520
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:01,642
And here you are
upturnin' Harlem around.

521
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,144
I'm so proud of you.

522
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:06,230
Ah! I saw you running
for the bus this mornin'.

523
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,066
All right, darling.

524
00:36:12,194 --> 00:36:13,821
I'm happy you made it, darling.

525
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,157
Uh-uh, uh-uh, cut him off at three.

526
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,785
I know this young brother.
He'll eat five hamburgers.

527
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:20,702
I've seen you do it.

528
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:30,963
Now, Harlem is a community that
welcomes everyone. All people.

529
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:33,382
But at the same time,

530
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:35,885
since the days of Langston Hughes,

531
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:40,347
Malcolm X, Zora Neale
Hurston, Duke Ellington,

532
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,893
Harlem has been the
jewel of black America.

533
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:49,774
It's a perpetual symbol of... of
hope and prosperity and excellence.

534
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:51,442
For black lives to matter,

535
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:54,862
black history and black
ownership must also matter.

536
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:59,700
Now, my multifaceted plan for
the Crispus Attucks Complex

537
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,995
is just yet another way to
bring hope to a new generation,

538
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:06,833
to incubate the kind of
innovation and creativity

539
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:09,668
and progress that Harlem's famous for.

540
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:13,505
Thank you again for your
time, Madam Councilwoman.

541
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:15,466
Oh, Megan, you're
always welcome in Harlem.

542
00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:16,884
- All right.
- All right, darling.

543
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:21,931
Y'all need to fall the hell back.

544
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:24,225
Zip, give her some space.

545
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,185
I don't like the thugs.

546
00:37:26,268 --> 00:37:28,687
- You need them for security.
- Mmm, they scare people.

547
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,941
They pass out flyers, get
contributions, tributes.

548
00:37:32,024 --> 00:37:34,610
[in Jamaican accent] Just
like in Jamaica, you know?

549
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:38,322
- Yeah, well, we ain't Jamaican, Cornell.
- [chuckling]

550
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:42,076
You shouldn't be here. We don't
need to be photographed together.

551
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,120
Why?

552
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:45,830
You ashamed of me?

553
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:49,959
That hurts, Mariah.

554
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:51,543
- Tony.
- Hmm?

555
00:37:51,627 --> 00:37:53,212
Will you give us a moment?

556
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,014
I need the money you promised me ASAP.

557
00:38:03,097 --> 00:38:04,849
Now you want the money?

558
00:38:06,142 --> 00:38:09,270
I used federal grant and
tax-deductible donation money

559
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,605
to complete construction on your club

560
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:15,442
and to facilitate that meticulous
deal that just fell apart.

561
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:19,196
I don't get the money,
I'm facing an audit.

562
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,656
We all go to jail.

563
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,867
It'll be there.

564
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:28,372
What happened at the
junkyard last night?

565
00:38:28,455 --> 00:38:31,167
And who's the dude in
the sunglasses behind you?

566
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,794
Is he after the money, too?

567
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:37,381
Either you want the
details, cuz, or you don't.

568
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:43,888
That's what I thought.

569
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:47,934
What's the word?

570
00:38:48,017 --> 00:38:51,896
Confirmation of what Dante
told us while he was dying.

571
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:54,273
His friends, the one that
play on your summer league team

572
00:38:54,356 --> 00:38:55,942
at the Rucker, jacked your shit.

573
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:58,527
Shameek and Chico.

574
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,821
Any bites yet?

575
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,200
No.

576
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:07,786
Double down.

577
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,332
Twenty large to find those fools.

578
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,377
[hip-hop music playing]

579
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,153
Tone, Passion is
twerking for him right now.

580
00:39:41,237 --> 00:39:44,573
He ain't going nowhere soon. Not
with all that ass in his face.

581
00:39:45,907 --> 00:39:48,953
You want me to keep him
here, you need to pay me.

582
00:39:56,668 --> 00:40:00,214
Hey, yo, my man. You
know what time it is?

583
00:40:06,387 --> 00:40:07,388
8:15.

584
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,473
[men laughing]

585
00:40:13,227 --> 00:40:15,146
Stay Harlem.

586
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:19,191
Stay black.

587
00:40:28,742 --> 00:40:30,786
[playing jazz music]

588
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,376
[cutlery clattering]

589
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:22,338
- Hey, man.
- Watch your hands.

590
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:23,422
You need to pay me.

591
00:41:23,505 --> 00:41:24,566
I'm paying you under the table,

592
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,343
which means I'll pay you whenever
I goddamn feel like it.

593
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:34,183
What you worried about?

594
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:36,306
[Shameek] I'm not worried.

595
00:41:36,307 --> 00:41:37,995
I just never met Cottonmouth
before, that's all.

596
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:40,064
[Tone] Mr. Stokes.

597
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:43,984
Mr. Stokes. That's
important. Never Cottonmouth.

598
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,153
All right, okay, my bad.

599
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:49,781
After what happened with
Dante, we circling the wagons.

600
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:51,575
They after us, B.

601
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:54,078
Who?

602
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:55,954
Nigga, it don't matter who.

603
00:41:57,123 --> 00:42:01,710
Mr. Stokes wanted me to
check on you... personally.

604
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,888
[Tone] Yo, what you doin'? Come on.

605
00:42:43,877 --> 00:42:45,086
Shades.

606
00:42:59,017 --> 00:43:01,145
You like my Biggie photo?

607
00:43:02,938 --> 00:43:04,190
Me, too.

608
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:08,735
You know what draws your
eye when you look at that?

609
00:43:10,404 --> 00:43:11,780
The crown.

610
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,617
Wanna know why?

611
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:19,205
Huh?

612
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,170
'Cause everybody wants to be the king.

613
00:43:29,381 --> 00:43:31,550
- [grunts and sighs heavily]
- [Shameek groans]

614
00:43:33,093 --> 00:43:34,761
[chuckles]

615
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:39,475
I slapped you like a little bitch.

616
00:43:39,558 --> 00:43:41,643
[breathes deeply]

617
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:44,771
I'm not the kind of man to
use a closed fist on a woman.

618
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,567
Where's my money?

619
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,737
[Shameek] I... I didn't...

620
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,113
Uh-uh.

621
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:58,994
Only thing worse than
a thief is a damn liar.

622
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,457
[grunting] Where's... my...

623
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,958
- money?
- [Shameek groans]

624
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:06,793
[Stokes breathing heavily] Hmm?

625
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,003
[coughs]

626
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:13,049
You left Dante alive. He called Tone.

627
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:17,137
And with his dying words, gave
up you and your homeboy.

628
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:18,889
We got your money.

629
00:44:18,972 --> 00:44:20,766
[breathing heavily]

630
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:25,354
Now you're gonna tell us where
Chico is so we can get the rest.

631
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,858
[spits]

632
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:32,944
[laughing]

633
00:44:34,946 --> 00:44:37,408
Yeah. Thank you.

634
00:44:38,284 --> 00:44:40,952
Now I can hit you like a man.

635
00:44:41,036 --> 00:44:42,996
[mumbles] No...

636
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,748

[panting]

644
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:30,043
Get his ass out of here.

[breathing heavily]

646
00:45:32,713 --> 00:45:34,423
And go fetch my money.

647
00:45:41,555 --> 00:45:43,349
[breathing heavily]

648
00:45:50,439 --> 00:45:51,732
He didn't recognize you.

649
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,108
[breathing heavily]

650
00:46:14,713 --> 00:46:16,798

[cell door buzzing faintly]

652
00:46:21,094 --> 00:46:26,224
Loneliness never goes away,
especially in places like Seagate.

653
00:46:26,307 --> 00:46:29,895
If you don't make
attempts to befriend someone...

654
00:46:31,104 --> 00:46:34,900
loneliness is guaranteed
to... eat you alive.

655

- [cell door buzzing faintly]
- [men shouting indistinctly]

[exhales]

658
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:07,849
I'm clear. [sighs]

659
00:47:09,392 --> 00:47:10,936
I'm focused.

660
00:47:12,688 --> 00:47:14,440
I promise, baby...

661
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:16,942
I'm ready.

662
00:47:24,491 --> 00:47:25,992
[siren wails]

663
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,331
- [female detective sighing]
- Shameek Smith...

664
00:47:31,414 --> 00:47:35,210
based on what they found in his pockets.
We'll need dental to confirm ID.

665
00:47:35,293 --> 00:47:37,295
[chuckles] His face is jacked.

666
00:47:37,378 --> 00:47:41,592
Mmm. They definitely dumped him
here. They got him somewhere else.

667
00:47:41,675 --> 00:47:44,553
Mmm. Looks like he got hit by a truck.

668
00:47:44,636 --> 00:47:45,887
Yeah.

669
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:49,558
- A truck with two fists.
- [Scarfe chuckles]

670
00:47:49,641 --> 00:47:51,560
You know, Benjamin Franklin said,

671
00:47:51,643 --> 00:47:56,147
"The only way that three people can
keep a secret is if two of 'em are dead."

672
00:47:56,231 --> 00:48:00,026
First Dante, now Shameek. Chico's
the last man standing.

673
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,695
Benjamin Franklin...

674
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,865
Didn't he electrocute
himself flying a kite in a rainstorm?

675
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,629
I wouldn't base any
theories on that fool.

676
00:48:06,658 --> 00:48:09,620
Benjamin Franklin is on
the $100 bill, Scarfe.

677
00:48:09,703 --> 00:48:12,288
[scoffs] So? He wasn't a president.

678
00:48:12,372 --> 00:48:16,042
That's even more impressive. Come
on, give the man some credit.

679
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:20,421
Well... So you think
Chico did this to Shameek?

680
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:25,761
Chico is what? A buck 50 soaking wet?

681
00:48:25,844 --> 00:48:28,263
But we won't know for
sure until we find him.

682
00:48:28,346 --> 00:48:31,808
You said Dante wasn't bartendin'
the night you were at the club.

683
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:33,018
No.

684
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:35,162
Well, did you talk to the
guy that replaced him that night?

685
00:48:35,186 --> 00:48:37,731
[scoffs] I barely talked to the guy.

686
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:40,233
I mean... [inhales] all
I did was order drinks.

687
00:48:40,316 --> 00:48:43,403
Well, maybe there's some
pattern, somethin' we're missin'.

688
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:45,446
We need to go talk to that guy.

689
00:48:45,531 --> 00:48:48,033
That sounds like a
complete waste of time.

690
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,786
That's entirely possible.

691
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:53,454
But it's worth a shot.

692
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:55,498
[scoffs] All right.

693
00:49:30,576 --> 00:49:33,119
You've been in this
country for how long?

694
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:37,624
And you still... can't speak English?

695
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,210
My English is just fine.

696
00:49:40,293 --> 00:49:42,170
Show Mariah Dillard some love.

697
00:49:42,253 --> 00:49:45,340
Contribute and we'll go away.

698
00:49:45,423 --> 00:49:46,549
It's a family thing.

699
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:48,677
I own this restaurant.

700
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,179
My father owned this building.

701
00:49:51,262 --> 00:49:55,516
Tell Mariah Dillard I am
not contributing to her complex.

702
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:58,812
We voted for her and
