The Cage of Love

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,000
<i>Episode 33</i>

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,790
Mom. Cai Hong is here.

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,740
Don't let her come in.

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,750
Madam. I only want to visit you.

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,850
During the fire,

7
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,060
you risked your life to save me.

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,610
I should thank you,

9
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,760
but I really can't face you.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,260
When I look at him, I think of my husband's

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,740
miserable death caused by your dad

12
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,900
Thus,

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,620
I'm requesting of you,

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,090
don't let me see you again.

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,690
I know. My dad had done something unforgivable.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,350
I can't do anything about what happened.

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,580
Thus, I would like to beg for your forgiveness.

18
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,330
Madam. As long as you are willing to forgive me,

19
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,160
I'm willing to do anything.

20
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,640
I'm willing to pay any price.

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,520
Mom. Cai Hong is already kneeling down.

22
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,000
Let her kneel down.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,310
I will never dote on her.

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,540
Fei Fei, shut the door.

25
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:17,410
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

26
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,410
It's useless for you to wait here. Looking at the scenery?

27
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,380
Not only will I admit that you treat Cai Hong very well.

28
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:54,410
When I look at you sometimes, I also think that if I let Cai Hong go, it's for her own good.

29
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,910
Letting you be with her is the best choice.

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,390
But sometimes, I also feel that

31
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,420
only I would be able to give up everything in order to protect her.

32
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,380
Regardless of who she is, why don't I let her stay with me?

33
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,450
I will feel assured this way.

34
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,410
I have thought about the same thing as you.

35
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,960
Too bad I am not you.

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,970
My companion and care

37
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,480
may not make her happy.

38
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,290
The one is Cai Hong's heart is you.

39
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,830
I could do more for Cai Hong than you.

40
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,190
It was the best for Cai Hong to be with me

41
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,680
but later, I realised that

42
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,350
no matter what I do, it won't be what she wants.

43
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,380
What she wants is you.

44
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,230
If you and Cai Hong get together, the path will be tough

45
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,450
but if you retreat because of these hardships,

46
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,290
that means I would have misjudged you.

47
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,330
I know that you are not that kind of person.

48
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,280
It's because I know that even if I'm not happy with it,

49
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,620
I'm willing to hand Cai Hong over to you.

50
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,300
You must protect her and give her happiness.

51
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,230
Aren't you going to see her now?

52
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,990
Cai Hong, are you okay?

53
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,170
- Stop kneeling. Get up.
- Don't bother about me.

54
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,450
It's my father's mistakes. As his daughter,

55
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,070
I must pay the debts on behalf of my father.

56
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,640
Jiang Yu.

57
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,170
Mom. I'm taking Cai Hong back first.

58
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,430
Have a good rest.

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,930
Karma.

60
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,040
Mom, have some tea.

61
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,290
Frankly, Cai Hong is very pitiful.

62
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,420
She hasn't recovered from her injuries and she kneeled down on the cold floor.

63
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,230
Even more so even though she got injured because of others,

64
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,880
she needs to shoulder the consequences of her father's mistakes.

65
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,730
This is not fair either.

66
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,910
It would have been great if the fire would have burned away the grudges between the two families.

67
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,020
The most pitiful one is brother. He's caught in the middle.

68
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,430
Like a saw that

69
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,950
has pierced his heart.

70
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,200
Why are you looking at me?

71
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,860
Do you know that

72
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,200
by doing this, I will misunderstand.

73
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,860
I don't think you will misunderstand.

74
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,540
In any case, it's not a misunderstanding.

75
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,260
Cai Hong. I was wrong in the past.

76
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,080
I didn't treasure you well.

77
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
Sorry.

78
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,820
But if

79
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,090
we were together,

80
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,650
your mom will be hurt.

81
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,210
You told me that

82
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,820
hatred can be resolved.

83
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,480
You have always been working hard

84
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,120
and paying for it.

85
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,780
Starting from today, I won't let you fight the battle alone.

86
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,100
I will stay with you. Let's work hard together.

87
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,860
We have the biggest problem between us.

88
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,690
It's the grudge between the Wu and Jiang families.

89
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,710
Cai Hong.

90
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,900
Life is short and life is fragile.

91
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,670
Anything can happen in any day.

92
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,700
Just like two days ago. I almost lost you in the fire.

93
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,780
I don't want to wait till I have lost it before I try to get it back.

94
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,630
We should treasure them when we can enjoy them.

95
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,710
As for the grudge between our families,

96
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,700
let's face it together.

97
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,630
But Madam...

98
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,690
I believe that as long as we work hard together,

99
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,600
we can move her heart.

100
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,580
She will definitely accept us.

101
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,670
Are you willing to face it together with me

102
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,620
and face the trials together?

103
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,500
I'm willing.

104
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,620
Miss.

105
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,480
Uncle Lai.

106
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,850
All these materials don't have the right feel.

107
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,550
When we get the Jiang's secret formula, then Miss will be able to dye the way you want.

108
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,400
I don't want to wait anymore.

109
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,170
When are we going to start to kidnap Madam Jiang?

110
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,040
These few days, our people have been spying at the hospital.

111
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,450
There are many eyes at the hospital. Jiang Yu is always at the hospital too.

112
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,870
We can't take action.

113
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,450
Why don't we wait?

114
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,730
I don't want to wait anymore.

115
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,080
If I continue to wait, I'm afraid that I will go crazy one day.

116
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,900
If they collect evidence against me,

117
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,300
the Military Governor will shoot me.

118
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,790
In the eyes of these men,

119
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,560
I'm not worth anything.

120
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,120
I will send men to take action now.

121
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,600
Uncle Lai.

122
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,530
Once we have gotten the secret formula,

123
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,490
let's leave this place.

124
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,480
I don't want this kind of life anymore.

125
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,680
Doctor, is the medical examination over?

126
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
Yes.

127
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,030
Don't worry, Miss Wu.

128
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,190
Your injuries are recovering well.

129
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,550
Will they leave any scars?

130
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,380
Even if there are scars, you will be just as beautiful. Everything's fine.

131
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,260
Don't talk nonsense.

132
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,890
Don't worry. As long as she takes her medicines on time,

133
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,970
and she doesn't get injured again in the future,

134
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,490
I guarantee that there won't be any scars.

135
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,260
But there may be a mark on your forehead.

136
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,240
Okay, have a good rest. Call me if there is anything.

137
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,230
Doctor, I will see you out.

138
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,960
- Okay, go back.
- Take care.

139
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,840
What's wrong?

140
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,320
Nothing.

141
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,440
The weather is nice today. Go out for a walk with me.

142
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,220
The doctor already told you to rest well. Don't wander anywhere.

143
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,390
I have some matters to attend to. I'm going out for a while.

144
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,090
Where are you going?

145
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,180
I'm not telling you. I will be back soon.

146
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,060
You are already keeping secrets from me so soon?

147
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,270
Are you regretting now?

148
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,970
It's too late.

149
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,430
Boss Jiang.

150
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,690
Let's go.

151
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:08,380
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

152
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,730
- Hello, Sir.
- Hello.

153
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,850
May I ask what you need?

154
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,230
I would like to customise a necklace.

155
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,150
Please enter.

156
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,750
Hello, Madam Jiang.

157
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,400
We are here to examine you.

158
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,520
Please come with us to the medical room.

159
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,040
I don't have a medical examination today.

160
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,090
To add further. I'm recovering well.

161
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,650
Look. I'm going to be discharged soon.

162
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,440
It's like this, Madam Jiang. This will be the last medical examination

163
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,420
to make sure that you can recover completely and get discharged.

164
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,160
Where is my previous doctor?

165
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,980
I'm very familiar with the doctors here. Why haven't I seen you before?

166
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,850
These few are not bad.

167
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,280
Yes, and this too.

168
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,810
Many rich housewives have seen these.

169
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,980
How about this?

170
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,920
Sir. You have really good taste.

171
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,430
This is our shop's treasure.

172
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,240
This necklace picks people to wear

173
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,850
to be their Miss.

174
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,680
Madam Jiang, are you there?

175
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,060
Who... who is it?

176
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,500
It's Cai Hong. Can I come in to see you?

177
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,130
Get lost. I already told you many times that I don't want to see you.

178
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,070
Make the person outside leave

179
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,900
- I didn't.
- If you try it, I will shoot you.

180
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,030
I'm not feeling very well.

181
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,790
I don't want to see any guests.

182
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:40,080
Madam. Your voice doesn't sound normal. Where are you unwell?

183
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,840
Don't bother me. Just leave.

184
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,050
Why don't I call the doctor to see you?

185
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,610
No need. Just leave.

186
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,450
Madam. I'm really worried about your health.

187
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,510
I'm coming in now.

188
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,610
Don't bother me. Leave now.

189
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,620
Even if you don't want to see me, I can't just ignore that.

190
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,690
I'm really coming in now.

191
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,700
Why didn't you listen to me?

192
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,480
Don't move.

193
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,500
You better be sensible.

194
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,560
Let's go.

195
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,160
Don't be rash.

196
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,910
I'm telling you, this is the hospital. If there is a gunshot sound, you wont be able to escape.

197
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,010
As long as you listen to me, I won't kill you.

198
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,910
We only want Madam Jiang.

199
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,510
Are you using her to threaten Jiang Yu?

200
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,410
This is none of your business.

201
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,410
If you are smart, don't foil our plan. Don't waste time. Take her away.

202
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,440
Don't capture Madam. Exchange her life for mine.

203
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,280
No. Let her go.

204
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,910
Madam Jiang.

205
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,830
All of you better stay still.

206
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,670
Don't try to play any tricks.

207
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,680
I know. You are trying to stall for time, right?

208
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,880
Believe me or not, I will kill her.

209
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,670
I know who you are.

210
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,560
Lu Man must have sent you here.

211
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,090
Miss Lu doesn't want you to come here and kill anyone.

212
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,280
She wants you to come here

213
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,040
because she knows that Madam Jiang is very important.

214
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,650
She sent to you do her bad things. <i>dirty work. </i>

215
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,290
When the time comes, even if she lets you off,

216
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,890
the police won't let you go.

217
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,130
Rotten wench. Shut up.

218
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,610
If you speak again, I will kill you.

219
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,650
Jiang Yu. He treats me well.

220
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,240
I'm very important to him.

221
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,270
Believe me. Use me to help hand over the secret formula.

222
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,160
Don't listen to her nonsense.

223
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,960
No. She's lying.

224
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,450
Take me away and you will achieve your goal.

225
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,930
Don't do this.

226
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,840
If you make noise again, I will kill you.

227
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,930
Cut the crap. Take them both along.

228
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,010
No It's too dangerous for you to do this.

229
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,320
Many doctors and nurses in the hospital recognise Madam Jiang. I don't know anyone here. I'm the safest.

230
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,610
Trust me. Jiang Yu will use all means to help me.

231
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,830
Okay, just take her along.

232
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,580
- Let's go.
- No, don't take her away.

233
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,240
Madam.

234
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,740
Shut up. Let's go.

235
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,510
Madam.

236
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,210
Cai Hong.

237
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,410
Cai Hong.

238
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,320
Mom.

239
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,400
Mom.

240
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,410
Mom!

241
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,200
Mom. Doctor!

242
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,320
- Is anyone there?
- What's wrong?

243
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,310
Something has happened to my mother.

244
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,160
What's wrong with Mom?

245
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,550
I don't know either.

246
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,180
When I just came in, she was already in this state.

247
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,840
Madam Jiang's head suffered a powerful blow.

248
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,390
Fortunately, it's not serious. She will be when she wakes up.J

249
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,760
She was in her room. How did she get hurt?

250
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,550
Er... this we cannot conclude why either.

251
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,190
- I'm going to prescribe some medicines for Madam Jiang.
- Thanks, Doctor.

252
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,500
Fei Fei, keep watch on Mom. Take good care of her. I'm going out for a while and will be back soon.

253
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,150
Brother!

254
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,140
Cai Hong!

255
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,640
- Did you see Miss Wu?
- No.

256
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,320
- Did you see Miss Wu? - No

257
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,410
Cai Hong!

258
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,920
Cai Hong!

259
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,200
Mr Jiang. Madam Jiang is awake. She keeps crying.

260
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,490
Go there now.

261
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,780
Fei Fei. What should we do?

262
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,890
Mom.

263
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,850
- Yu Er.
- You are awake. Are you okay?

264
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,500
Cai Hong has been taken away by the bad people.

265
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,630
What should we do?

266
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,580
- You must think of a way to save her?
- Cai Hong has been taken away?

267
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,480
I don't know.

268
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,710
Two fake doctors came in

269
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,740
and wanted to take me away. Cai Hong, that foolish girl,

270
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,720
to save me, she...

271
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,750
Do you know those two doctors?

272
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,080
No.

273
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,930
Cai Hong seemed to know those two bad people.

274
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,680
It seems like they are employees of Miss Lu.

275
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,070
Yu Er.

276
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,580
Save her now.

277
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,940
Yu Er. You must think of a way to save her.

278
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,140
Cai Hong.

279
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,110
Cai Hong.

280
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,210
- Cai Hong.
- Cai Hong is missing. Where did she go?

281
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,170
- Cai Hong was kidnapped by someone.
- Kidnapped?

282
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,560
Who kidnapped her?

283
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,920
Lu Man's men.

284
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,890
Jiang Yu. It's always you! Every time when something happens to Cai Hong, it's always because of you.

285
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,410
Why weren't you with her? Where did you go?

286
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,160
Do you think I wanted it to be like this? I don't want it either.

287
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,810
Where did she go?

288
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,270
Where did she go? Say something!

289
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,480
I'm going to find Lu Man. I'm going alone.

290
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,920
What's the use of finding Lu Man?

291
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,140
If she took Cai Hong away, why wouldn't she run away? Use your brain!

292
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,980
What you can only do now is to wait. Wait till she states her terms.

293
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,070
Lu Man, I won't let you off.

294
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,230
Miss Lu.

295
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,890
Please.

296
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:36,020
Miss Wu. We meet again.

297
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,330
So, it's you.

298
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,260
You kidnapped me just for the Jiang family's secret formula, right?

299
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,660
Miss Wu is smart. You are right on the mark.

300
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,180
If I didn't guess wrongly,

301
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:55,800
I'm guessing that you killed my father too.

302
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,040
<i>Boss Wu. I was here early by a few minutes.</i>

303
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,890
<i>I didn't see anyone on the way here.</i>

304
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,370
<i>I even thought I got the time wrong.</i>

305
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:41,280
<i>Today is my birthday. I let the staff off.</i>

306
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,670
<i>Old Master Wu, you are hurt.</i>

307
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,090
<i>So how? Do you want to go to the hospital?</i>

308
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:49,740
<i>I'm fine. It's just a small injury.</i>

309
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,810
<i>Boss Wu. I'm here to help Ling Long get through the hard times.</i>

310
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:04,100
<i>Okay then. Let's discuss real business.</i>

311
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,350
<i>Okay then. I will get to the point then.</i>

312
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:13,800
<i>I am aware of Ling Long's situation.
I am willing to help.</i>

313
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,200
<i>but...</i>

314
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,120
<i>But what. As long as I can do it,</i>

315
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,220
<i>I will definitely do my best.</i>

316
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,360
<i>I am someone that doesn't like to force people.</i>

317
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,210
<i>The request that I want, as long as you are willing,</i>

318
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,000
<i> you can definitely do it.</i>

319
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,030
<i>Please speak.</i>

320
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:42,710
<i>I want the Jiang family's secret formula. The price is negotiable.</i>

321
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,910
<i>I already told you that</i>

322
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,550
<i>I don't have the secret formula.</i>

323
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,850
<i>A straightforward person does not resort to insinuations.</i>

324
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,590
<i>I know that the Jiang family's secret formula is with you.</i>

325
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:14,160
<i>Moreover, Ling Long and the secret formula don't belong to you either.</i>

326
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:20,630
<i>Hand over the secret formula in exchange for cash to save Ling Long. Think about it.</i>

327
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,440
<i>This transaction will be worth it.</i>

328
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,800
<i>You are thinking too much.</i>

329
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,150
<i>I will repeat myself. I don't have any secret formulas.</i>

330
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,060
<i>You should think carefully.</i>

331
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,890
<i>This is your last lifeline.</i>

332
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,490
<i>I don't need to think anymore then.</i>

333
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:50,440
<i>I'm telling you. If you don't hand over the secret formula today, don't think of leaving here alive.</i>

334
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,910
<i>Shoot then.</i>

335
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,850
<i>Fire the gun!</i>

336
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,240
<i>Let me tell you. Even if I have it,</i>

337
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,710
<i>I won't give it to you.</i>

338
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,410
<i>Do you want to fire the gun? Fire then!</i>

339
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,360
<i>Go away.</i>

340
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,200
<i>- Give it to me.
- Let go.</i>

341
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,570
<i>Give me the secret formula now.</i>

342
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,110
<i>I'm telling you. Even if I die,</i>

343
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,710
<i>I will never give it to you.</i>

344
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,300
<i>Give it to me.</i>

345
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,380
<i>Dad!</i>

346
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,200
<i>Dad!</i>

347
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,790
It was me

348
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,880
who killed him.

349
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,320
ut you don't have the evidence.

350
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,390
Without any evidence, what can you do?

351
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,130
I will have the evidence sooner or later.

352
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,030
By doing this,

353
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,290
you are not afraid that God will punish you?

354
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,520
Don't talk to me about God.

355
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,950
I don't believe in this.

356
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,730
God will never come.

357
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:02,850
If you are that worried, why didn't God open his eyes

358
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,380
and deliver you to me instead?

359
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:12,300
By the way, you seems to be Jiang Yu's girlfriend.

360
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,180
Frankly, I planned to kidnap Madam Jiang

361
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,260
and use her to threaten Jiang Yu to trade her for the secret formula.

362
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,300
But little did i know, you would fall into my trap.

363
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,640
I will use you then to trade with Jiang Yu.

364
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,170
You are wrong then. I'm not Jiang Yu's girlfriend.

365
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,350
I lied to you.

366
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:41,410
Jiang Yu will never come.

367
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,130
My father harmed his father.

368
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:48,300
Wu's family and Jiang's family have death feud

369
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:52,350
Consider your plan as a having failed.

370
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:01,110
Do you know what kind of people I hate the most?

371
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,500
Those who lie to me.

372
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,930
If you are not Jiang Yu's girlfriend, you better pray to God to help you.

373
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:13,170
If not, you have only one life.

374
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,410
You will not succeed!

375
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,450
Is it? That might not be the case.

376
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,270
I can tell that

377
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,350
Jiang Yu doesn't treat you like anyone else.

378
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,740
He will definitely come to save you.

379
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,800
I almost forgot. Zhou Shao Tian too.

380
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,930
Why don't we do this? Let's play a game and bet on

381
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,960
which of these two men will save your first?

382
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,400
If they are late,

383
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,060
I will kill them for you.

384
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,760
Okay?

385
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,770
You are a lunatic.

386
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,790
<i>Jiang Yu, don't come.</i>

387
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,010
<i>Don't ever come.</i>

388
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,760
<i>Brother Shao Tian.</i>

389
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,170
<i>Don't come either.</i>

390
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,090
<i>You must not come either.</i>

391
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,920
Mr Jiang. Someone delivered a letter for you.

392
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,410
Who?
- I'm not very sure. He gave it and left.

393
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,000
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

394
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:02,400
<i>Jiang Yu, bring the Jiang's family secret formula alone
and meet me at the street tonight. </i>

395
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,120
<i>Don't be late. Don't report this to the police.</i>

396
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,720
<i>Otherwise Cai Hong will die.</i>

397
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,910
<i>Good luck</i>

398
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,690
What do you plan to do?

399
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,970
Why aren't you saying anything?

400
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,510
Is it because you can't bear to part with your family's secret formula?

401
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,070
How could I do that?

402
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,230
I know that the secret formula is priceless to you.

403
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,930
In the past, no matter how I forced you, you wouldn't hand over.

404
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:40,080
This secret formula is precious to Jiang's house.

405
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,410
Are you willing to take it out in exchange for Cai Hong's life?

406
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,520
Don't even talk about the secret formula. Even if it's my life, I would use it to trade for her.

407
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,810
It is no expense.

408
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,830
I know Lu Man very well.

409
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,640
I'm worried that once you hand over the secret formula to her,

410
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,160
she won't let you and Cai Hong come out alive.

411
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,120
This is what I'm most worried about.

412
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,980
We must think of a flawless plan.

413
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,920
Why don't we do this? It's still better that I go to Lu Man's place alone.

414
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,740
Go and seek Director Chen's help. We will meet again later.

415
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,940
But Lu Man has a spy within the police force. You must be extra careful.

416
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,980
Miss.

417
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,790
Come in.

418
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,810
Miss. Everything has been arranged. We are only just waiting for Jiang Yu.

419
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,970
This is...

420
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,970
the pin that your mom left.

421
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,500
Yes.

422
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,450
This is the only thing my Mom left me.

423
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,620
I'm going to wear this today

424
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:48,620
and prove to her that I will definitely get the secret formula.

425
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,560
I want to create her favourite gown again.

426
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,680
I want to prove to her that

427
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,810
I will bring back Wang's house glory.

428
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,760
Ke Ke.

429
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,590
I am sure your mom will understand your kindness.

430
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,050
Your wish...

431
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,360
your mom in heaven,

432
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,610
will protect you and make it come true.

433
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,760
Uncle Lai.

434
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,840
All these years,

435
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,120
I have been around those wealthy and powerful men everyday,

436
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,630
drinking with them, serving them.

437
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,270
I had enough.

438
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,500
Starting from today,

439
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,600
I am going to end that kind of dirty life.

440
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,920
Once I get the secret formula,

441
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,120
I want to start a new life.

442
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,930
Then I won't need to waste my energy serving those people.

443
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,720
Those disgusting people.

444
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,540
There will come a day,

445
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,250
I will get those who took advantage of me

446
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,480
and cut off their limbs.

447
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,370
Ke Ke. Don't worry. Even if I sacrifice my life today,

448
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,510
I will help you to fulfill your wish.

449
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,900
Are all the men ready?

450
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,610
Yes.

451
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:34,300
Don't even talk about Jiang Yu. Even a fly wouldn't be able to escape.

452
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,770
Don't be too complacent.

453
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,680
Jiang Yu is very sly.

454
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,520
Zhou Shao Tian is very toxic.

455
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,530
Tell our people to be on high alert.

456
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:50,650
Once we get the secret formula, all will get rewarded.

457
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,440
Yes.

458
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,010
Miss. Why are we preparing these?

459
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,540
Jiang Yu is very sly.

460
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,820
I won't know whether he will bring the real or fake secret formula.

461
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,640
Thus, I want to personally see him dye the cloth

462
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,040
and make sure that the secret formula is real.

463
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,360
But this secret formula is from Jiang ancestors,

464
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,770
Would Jiang Yu bring it? th

465
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,290
I can only take a gamble.

466
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,290
I want to see

467
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,840
in Jiang Yu's heart whether the secret formula is important or

468
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,310
if Wu Cai Hong is more important.

469
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,590
What about Zhou Shao Tian?

470
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:58,010
He will never let this rest.

471
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,490
Zhou Shao Tian.

472
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:08,670
When you meet Jiang Yu later, don't bring him straight here first.

473
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,760
Take him for a few rounds.

474
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,330
If you find that there are people following him, get rid of them.

475
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,900
Yes.

476
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,540
Wu Cai Hong.

477
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,610
I almost forgot.

478
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,560
You are Wu Hong Da's daughter.

479
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,670
You definitely know about the secret formula.

480
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,920
So what if I do?

481
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,240
Even if I know, I won't tell you.

482
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,150
You have such a tight mouth.

483
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,220
Tell me then.

484
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:04,150
What should I use to make you talk?

485
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,930
Why don't we try this needle

486
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,820
and see if it will make you talk?

487
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,370
If you hand over the secret formula to me now,

488
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,930
I won't let you die.

489
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,750
Dream on.

490
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,700
If it doesn't belongs to you, it won't.

491
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,540
You will never obtain the secret formula.
