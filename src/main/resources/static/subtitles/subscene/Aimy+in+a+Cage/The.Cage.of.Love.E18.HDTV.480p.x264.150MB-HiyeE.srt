The Cage of Love

00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,870
<i>Episode 18</i>

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,190
Miss, you told me to pay more attention to Wu Hong Da's case.

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,960
The police have re-opened the case for investigation now.

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,090
Wasn't this case already closed? Why are they investigating it again?

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,760
Rumor has it that there is new evidence

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,160
that can prove that Zhou Shao Tian has the same pen as Wu Hong Da.

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,040
I know.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,350
Make a point of keeping an eye on it. Do not go wrong.

10
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,900
By the way,

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,700
Zhou Shao Tian should be back today, right?

12
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,930
Call that whatever Ma Li here

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,590
and let him bring this news to Zhou Shao Tian.

14
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,550
Ask Zhou Shao Tian what he should do.

15
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,460
Miss. Why are you thinking on his behalf?

16
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,380
Thinking about him is also for our own good.

17
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,870
Miss Lu. Two policemen are here to find Zhao Shao Tian.

18
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,910
Okay, you may leave.

19
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,240
Dear Sirs. Why are you here?

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,480
Miss Lu. The Director asked us to invite Zhou Shao Tian to the police station.

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,140
It's a grave matter and we have offended you but please cooperate.

22
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,840
Tell us where he went and when he's coming back.

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,080
You sirs looking for Zhou Shao Tian, I don't dare interfere.

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,790
However, Mister Zhou went out of town.

25
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,460
Regarding when he's returning, I really don't know.

26
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,270
- This...
- Then you should at least know where he went?

27
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,320
Mister Zhou was sick and rested for half a month.

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,380
So he has a lot of things to do and hasn't seen a lot of people.

29
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,280
This time, I'm sure he has to go a lot of places

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,530
and meet a lot of clients.

31
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,190
As for where he is right now,

32
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,670
I really don't know.

33
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,390
Miss Lu, we are only following orders. Just be honest with us.

34
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,650
If not, others will think that you are an accomplice.

35
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,850
What do you mean? Is Miss Lu someone who would be an accomplice?

36
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,380
Miss Lu, please forgive us.

37
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,280
But if you put it this way,

38
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,100
you are making it hard to do our work.

39
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,360
By saying this,

40
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,350
you are saying that I'm delaying your investigation?

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,310
You are implicating me. I'm a weak woman. I really can't handle this.

42
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,260
It's like this. Mr Zhou

43
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,540
will only be back on the following day.

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,790
You should also know that there is chaos in the military now.

45
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,330
What if there is no peace?

46
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,510
Of course, I wish for peace too.

47
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,700
Even if everything was peaceful and things were well,

48
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,070
weather can be unpredictable.

49
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,510
Strong winds and rain could delay him two days.

50
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,820
Okay then. We will go back first and report to our Director first.

51
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,010
We can only do this.

52
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,620
Miss Lu, if Mr Zhou returns,

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,820
please let us know immediately.

54
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,260
But of course. Take care, I won't be seeing you off.

55
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,400
We are leaving.

56
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,970
Giddy up.

57
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,470
Giddy up.

58
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,570
Brother!

59
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,910
Ah Li, why are you here?

60
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,640
- Brother, you can't go into the city now.
- Why? What's going on?

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,580
This is a letter from Miss Lu. She insisted that I must stop you.

62
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,820
You must not go into the city.

63
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,940
Ah Li. I won't be going into the city for the time being.

64
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,840
I'll go to the lake for the next two days.

65
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,570
Relay this message to Miss Lu.

66
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,220
- Okay, Brother.
- Thank her on my behalf.

67
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,020
Okay.

68
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,190
Cai Hong.

69
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,140
Wu Cai Hong.

70
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,540
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

71
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,720
I... would like to take leave.

72
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,200
I would like to go home for a while.

73
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,020
Even though Brother Shao Tiao bought my famiy home for us

74
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,490
before there is any conclusion in the investigation,

75
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,890
I would like Cai Yun and my stepmom to move out.

76
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,170
I will go with you.

77
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,820
Master, you died wrongly.

78
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,750
Zhou Shao Tian, you ungrateful (person)!

79
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,410
You said you would be promoted and not be poor. You wanted to be betrothed.

80
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,910
You did such a toxic thing and even tricked Cai Hong's feelings.

81
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,040
What is our family to do now?

82
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,980
Stepmom, stop crying. There is no evidence now that Brother Shao Tian is the killer.

83
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,440
Before the conclusion of the investigation, I think we should leave here.

84
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,020
Cai Yu and I are going to pack our stuff.

85
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,820
Stop crying, Stepmom.

86
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,540
This is the Wu's family home. I moved in when I married your father.

87
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,200
I have already been kicked out once and I have to leave again.

88
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,520
I'm not moving out.

89
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,350
If Zhou Shao Tian is really the killer, then the money used to buy the house

90
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,890
will be stained with father's blood. Mom, do you still want to live here?

91
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,580
The money didn't belong to your father.

92
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,270
This is the Wu's family home.

93
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,710
I want to protect this place. I want to help him to safeguard it.

94
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:24,360
Even if you tell me to die, I won't move out. I want to live here until I die.

95
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,500
Cai Yun, what do you think?

96
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,700
If Mom doesn't want to move out, I won't either. I already don't have a father.

97
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,820
I want to be with Mom.

98
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,720
That's right. Cai Yun will follow me.

99
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,110
We are not moving out.

100
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,310
We will live here till we die.

101
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:02,530
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

102
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,320
It's normal that they can't accept the truth.

103
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,930
It's even hard for me to accept it too. It's hard to accept the result.

104
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,670
It's even more so for my stepmom and sister.

105
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,930
When Zhou Shao Tian returns in two days,

106
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,400
everything will become clear.

107
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:43,080
But, us three, already moved out of the house once.

108
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,580
If this time, I let Cai Yun

109
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,830
and my stepmom move out again, my stepmom definitely won't be able to take it.

110
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,850
Don't worry about this. I can buy over the house.

111
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,530
I will deduct the money from the sale of the house from your salary.

112
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,980
Miss. Ma Li is back.

113
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,560
Miss Lu.

114
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,860
So what? You met Zhou Shao Tian? What did he say?

115
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,050
My brother would like to thank you for this news.

116
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,950
He is temporarily living in Chang Xing.

117
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,280
Could Miss Lu do another favour for my brother?

118
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,780
Why does he need me to help him with his problems again?

119
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,110
My brother said that you have a wide connection.

120
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,330
He requested that you get him a similar Parker pen as Jiang Yu's as soon as possible.

121
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,200
Otherwise my brother will jump into the Yellow River

122
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,010
instead of being a fugitive.

123
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,050
Don't think that highly of me. Do I have that wide of a connection?

124
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,430
A 18K Parker fountain pen? That is not a toy.

125
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,850
Even more so, he wants me to find the exact same model.

126
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,920
Miss Lu, I'm begging you. You must help my brother.

127
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,330
My brother has been framed. He can't bear the title of murderer.

128
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,380
I can guarantee that he didn't kill Mr. Wu.

129
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,090
Whether your brother has been framed or not, it's the police's job to investigate.

130
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,600
My words don't count.

131
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,650
Miss Lu, please. I'm bowing to you.

132
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,210
Enough. Go back first and wait.

133
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,890
If I have any news, Uncle Lai will contact you.

134
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,640
Thank you, Miss Lu.

135
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,730
Thank you.

136
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,210
Uncle Lai.

137
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,200
I remember that he seemed to have a confidant.

138
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,390
He liked to receive expensive fountain pens.

139
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,830
Go and find him

140
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,630
and see if he can find a solution.

141
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,330
Yes, I will do it now.

142
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,700
<i>This is not an expensive gift</i>

143
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,200
<i>but I personally dyed it and</i>

144
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,300
<i>weaved it.</i>

145
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,660
<i>Also, you two are alike.</i>

146
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,670
<i>Its name is the same as yours.</i>

147
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,270
<i>It's just like a little rainbow.</i>

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,520
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

149
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,640
<i>Let's be together.</i>

150
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,510
<i>Let me take care of you.</i>

151
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,070
Instead of working, why are you dreaming early in the morning?

152
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,810
Hey.

153
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,670
I only knocked into you lightly

154
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,700
and you are on the ground and can't get up.

155
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,100
Stop pretending.

156
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,900
Fei Fei, what are you doing?

157
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,990
She was slacking off.

158
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,050
I only said a few words to her.

159
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,460
Are you okay?

160
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,790
Brother, where are you going?

161
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,740
We still have important business to discuss in the afternoon.

162
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,540
I already discussed about that business.

163
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,270
You can just greet Boss He and it will be fine

164
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,230
Why did you take my water bucket? I still need to get water for Granny Gu.

165
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,200
Where is the water?

166
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,180
Don't drag me.

167
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,000
Let go.

168
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,220
Jiang Yu. Where are you taking me?

169
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,610
Slow down. Be careful.

170
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,430
Why did you bring me here?

171
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,350
Boatman.

172
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,560
I want to rent your boat.

173
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,540
-How much?
-One silver dollar.

174
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,490
This is for you

175
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,870
but I only want your boat. You can take a rest.

176
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,360
Okay.

177
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,640
This way, please.

178
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,650
Get on.

179
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,740
Do you know to row the boat?

180
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,350
I don't want to fall into the water.

181
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,230
Get in when I tell you to.

182
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,590
Cut the nonsense.

183
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,460
Don't be afraid.

184
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,830
I have also gone through supporting a family of three

185
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,070
by being a ferry boatman.

186
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,460
I think that after have you found out about Zhou Shao Tian,

187
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,570
you haven't been happy.

188
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,340
My dad is dead.

189
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,970
It's very possible that he was the most trusted person

190
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,260
who killed him.

191
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,260
How could I be happy about this?

192
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,320
I understand.

193
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,590
You won't be able to understand.

194
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:04,110
That kind of hurt was inflicted by someone whom you regarded as family.

195
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,740
You will never understand it.

196
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,140
By the way,

197
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,020
you said that, in the past, you rowed boats

198
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,340
to support your family of three.

199
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,250
But looking at Madam Jiang,

200
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,630
her decent and generous behavior,

201
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,560
as if she came from a scholarly family.

202
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,990
How could it be possible that you worked

203
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,710
as a boatman?

204
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,690
The Jiang home, at that time, had only a little money.

205
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,640
Before that my father was a supporter of the foreign efforts movement.

206
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,720
He was a rich businessman

207
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,900
but he was sabotaged by someone later

208
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,950
and framed for housing opiates.

209
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,780
This resulted in my father's death.

210
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,970
The reason that the court officials gave us was that

211
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,860
my father committed suicide.

212
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,690
Something like this happened to your family.

213
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,080
No wonder you look this way - a face filled with depression.

214
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,060
Furthermore, you have a cold attitude.

215
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,780
When my father passed away, the factory was confiscated.

216
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,420
My house was occupied.

217
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,990
You could say that we went bankrupt overnight.

218
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:44,020
My mother couldn't face the situation and attempted suicide.

219
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,140
Fortunately, I was there and discovered it.

220
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,590
<i>Mom!</i>

221
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,090
It was really hard for us at that time.

222
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,290
To feed my family, I took on all kinds of jobs.

223
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,880
I would do them. When I was working as a boatman,

224
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,910
I had other jobs too.

225
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,240
I really didn't imagine that you had gone through such an experience.

226
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,730
Those days were really tough

227
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,840
but I continued to hang on

228
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,290
just to take revenge.

229
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,940
I can't let my father

230
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,350
wrongfully die.

231
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,660
I must punish those bad people severely.

232
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,870
Did you find those people who harmed your father?

233
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,500
Did you seek revenge already?

234
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,330
Before I could take revenge, that person died.

235
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,840
It was too easy for that bad guy then.

236
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,360
I had the same thought too

237
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,680
but I later found out that

238
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,940
perhaps God

239
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,950
- had arranged something else for me.
- What was it?

240
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,470
Perhaps, grudges and revenge should end in grudges and revenge.

241
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,340
Just like in this dirty pond,

242
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,470
such clean and pure flowers would even grow here.

243
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,730
It allows us to forget the unhappy things first.

244
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:28,870
Can you forget about the grudge towards the person who killed your father?

245
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,120
But thank you for bringing me to such a beautiful place.

246
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,170
After seeing such beautiful things,

247
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,610
I forgot about many unhappy things.

248
00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:04,500
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

249
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,010
Boss Ke, take a look.

250
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,380
This is the product we created based on your request.

251
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,890
If there is no problem, we will start production at the factory.

252
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,530
-Of course.
-Also, if you have any suggestions, we can cater to that.

253
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,730
Not bad. It totally met my request.

254
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,470
Not even a small amount off.

255
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,220
It's good that you are satisfied.

256
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm assured of Ling Long's products.

257
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,590
Why isn't Mr Jiang in the company today?

258
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,220
My brother was actually here waiting for your arrival but

259
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,910
he had an urgent matter and had no choice but to take care of it.

260
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,970
But he told me that

261
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,610
you are our valued client.

262
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,310
that I shouldn't carelessly treat you.

263
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,890
Mr Jiang is too formal. We have been friends for many years.

264
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,850
Don't mind this. To add further,

265
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:02,150
Miss Fang is Mr Jiang's most trusted person.

266
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,980
Furthermore, you are family.

267
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,820
Isn't it the same that you are here with me to see the product?

268
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,240
Boss Ke. Thank you for your compliment.

269
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,180
Not bad.

270
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,480
Brother. Where has you been for the whole day?

271
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,600
Did you go to the pond to appreciate the flowers?

272
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,550
Brother. You ignored such an important client like Boss Ke.

273
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:07,130
I represented you today. Can't you just answer me?

274
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,950
You are very smart.

275
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,150
With you taking care of Boss Ke, I don't have to worry.

276
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,420
But, don't you feel that

277
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,880
taking a woman to appreciate the flowers

278
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,840
would invite gossip?

279
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,630
Who would be such a busybody?

280
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,790
- Brother.
- Cai Hong.

281
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,000
Deliver these flowers to my mom.

282
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,940
Okay.

283
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,250
Brother.

284
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,600
Why is it so hard to see you lately?

285
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,710
I couldn't see you the whole day and I wondered what you are busy with.

286
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,210
I had some matters to settle.

287
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,530
Don't bother about what it is.

288
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,500
Does it concern Wu Cai Hong?

289
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,350
Brother. In your heart,

290
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,630
is Wu Cai Hong more important than the rest?

291
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,210
Ridiculous.

292
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,640
Miss, What you wanted is here.

293
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,680
So fast?

294
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,630
The head of the military said that

295
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,900
it's such a difficult task but you could do it so easily.

296
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,020
Uncle Lai.

297
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,760
Prepare a gift for me.

298
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,460
I'm going to visit Zhou Shao Tian's mother.

299
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,340
But the Zhou family has been watching you.

300
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,930
It's okay.

301
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,460
Don't worry. I know.

302
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,250
Miss, we are here.

303
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,270
Here.

304
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,200
Take your time.

305
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,550
Aunt Zhou, how are you? I'm Lu Man.

306
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,360
Did Mr Zhou mention me?

307
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,690
Hello.

308
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,940
Then...

309
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,230
Please come in.

Please have some tea, Miss Lu.

312
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,820
Aunt Zhou. You really don't need to go through all this trouble.

313
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,650
Shao Tian is not at home. You...

314
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,910
I know that he's not home, I came especially to visit you.

315
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:19,460
Shao Tian went on business because of work.

316
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,330
Thus, I brought you a gift. I hope you like it.

317
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,580
Shao Tian is not at home. If you need anything,

318
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,850
just let me know and I will help you.

319
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,570
You have been taking care of Shao Tian.

320
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,070
Well, for sharing your kind heart with me,

321
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,210
thank you very much, Miss Lu.

322
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,670
Aunt Zhou, you are being too formal.

323
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,220
Just call me Lu Man.

324
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,510
Please have your tea.

325
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,840
- Did you get scalded?
- I'm fine.

326
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,740
Aunt. Could I borrow a place

327
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,280
to clean my clothes?

328
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,350
Please come with me.

329
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,120
Miss Lu. This way, please.

330
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,870
This is Shao Tian's room. No one is here.

331
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:33,270
It's fairly clean, so please use it to clean yourself up.

332
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,510
I will have to trouble you then.

333
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,320
Please make yourself at home.

334
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,040
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

335
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,510
Aunt. Frankly, I'm here today

336
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,620
because I have something else to tell you.

337
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,990
Two days ago, the police came to find me.

338
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:02,690
They suspect Shao Tian of harming the boss of Ling Long.

339
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,230
Aunt, please don't worry.

340
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,510
I was afraid that you would be worried. Thus, I'm telling you in advance.

341
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,880
If the police were to come in a few days time to make inquiries,

342
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,000
please watch what you say.

343
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,450
Aunt, don't panic. I believe Shao Tian is not that kind of person.

344
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,320
There is no conclusion to the investigation now but after it's done, everything will be fine.

345
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,850
Aunt. If there is nothing else, I am leaving first.

346
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,420
<i>Man Mansion.</i>

347
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,840
Miss. You are back. Did it go smoothly?

348
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,570
With me taking care of it, is there anything I can't do?

349
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,940
Uncle Lai.

350
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,810
I came to warn you. Get him out of the city before the gates close.

351
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,630
Tell him to tell Zhou Shao Tian that I have done what he requested.

352
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,170
He can come back without any worries.

353
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,820
Yes, I will do it now.

354
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,220
Giddy up.

355
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,840
Stay here and don't go anywhere else.

356
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,800
- I'm going to tell Director Chen.
- Okay, go now.

357
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,570
I will keep watch here.

358
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,520
Shao Tian, you are back.

359
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,120
It's good that you are here. Your boss came.

360
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,940
It's Miss Lu.

361
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,840
She said that you are being investigated regarding Wu Hong Da's case. What's going on?

362
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,110
Did you kill someone?

363
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:08,120
Do you really hope to see your son as a killer? You are already finding me guilty.

364
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,690
No, I'm just asking you. Tell me.

365
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,800
Is it because of your father's death that

366
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,520
you blame Master Wu.

367
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,350
Thus, you killed him

368
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,300
to take revenge for your father?

369
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,080
<i>Mom.</i>

370
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,990
Why would I vent my anger on Master Wu when he wasn't the one who killed my father.

371
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,790
The one who killed my father

372
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,890
was you.

373
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,930
Let's not talk about this first. Did you kill Wu Da Hong?

374
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:58,990
Let me tell you. The killer is you. You are the one who killed that person.

375
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,380
Don't forget.

376
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,690
When I saw you take my dad's last breath,

377
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,680
that many years, have you been sleeping well at night?

378
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,890
When you are having dreams, did you dream that my father came to look for you?

379
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,750
You are the killer.

380
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,640
Don't say anymore. I'm not.

381
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,870
At that time, I didn't have a choice. Your father was very sick.

382
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,370
I couldn't get any money to cure him and raise you.

383
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,140
Who didn't know that it was better for him to die then suffer?

384
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,870
But your dad was tortured by his illness,

385
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,780
he was good as dead.

386
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:41,000
It was him that begged me to end it for him.

387
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,660
I couldn't do it

388
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,040
but if I didn't do it,

389
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,910
would I have let you do it instead?

390
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,520
I didn't have any choice.

391
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,940
Didn't have any choice?

392
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,130
Talking about it,

393
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,030
we are poor people.

394
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,230
We don't have any money.

395
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,630
I will always remember in my heart

396
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,890
that I will tell you that I hate you.

397
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:25,230
Thus, I didn't kill Cai Hong's father.

398
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,420
I swear on my dad's name that...

399
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,150
if I wanted to kill someone,

400
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,420
he wouldn't rest in peace even in hell.

401
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:55,700
Young Master. Zhao Shao Tian is back.

402
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,370
Brother.

403
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,700
Zhou Shao Tian is back.

404
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,930
Come with me.

405
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:37,470
Mr Zhou. We are here to ask you to help us in the investigation regarding Mr Wu's case.

406
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,510
Has there been progress in Boss Wu's case?

407
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,770
It's convenient for us to talk here. We should go in.

408
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,400
Director Chen Suo, what exactly happened

409
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,490
to cause such a ruckus?

410
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,970
Brother Shao Tian

411
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:11,080
Cai Hong. Why do you look so bad today?

412
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,870
Tell me.

413
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,170
After my father passed away,

414
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:21,140
did you buy a Parker fountain pen?

415
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,210
It's exactly the same as Jiang Yu.

416
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,810
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

417
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,720
Tell me if you bought it.

418
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,830
You are all here today just because of this?

419
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,990
Okay.

420
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,150
I did buy the same model of the fountain pen.

421
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,500
Did you kill my father?

422
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:14,440
<i>You ungrateful thing. Why did you do it?</i>

423
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,300
<i>Why? I was forced by you.</i>

424
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,620
I didn't.

425
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,090
This is the pen.

426
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,250
Brother Shao Tian. What is going on?

427
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,490
Cai Hong.

428
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,480
In the past, you said that you wanted to buy this fountain pen as a gift for your father's birthday.

429
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,250
Subsequently, you fought with someone over this and didn't manage to buy it.

430
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,270
I wanted to make you happy by getting the same pen.

431
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,740
But, in the past,

432
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,270
why didn't you tell me about it?

433
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,490
I ordered this pen from overseas.

434
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,710
It took a bit of time.

435
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,460
Before I could give it to you, your father had that accident.

436
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,300
I was afraid that you would get sad again.

437
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,020
Thus, I didn't use this as the birthday present.

438
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,300
Later, I knew about the report on Boss Wu.

439
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,410
There was a fountain pen on his dead body.

440
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,060
I was afraid that it would cause a misunderstanding.

441
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,550
I didn't take out this fountain pen then.

442
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,110
Cai Hong.

443
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,720
If this is the weapon which killed your father,

444
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,990
why would I still keep this at home?

445
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,130
Think about it. If this fountain pen

446
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:14,070
injured someone, the tip wouldn't be like this.

447
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,580
Director Chen Suo.

448
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,460
You are in this line.

449
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,250
Take a look. If there is a need,

450
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,900
you can go back and run tests on it.

451
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,660
I took the pen back to run some tests

452
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,310
but it looks new.

453
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,750
It probably didn't injure anyone.

454
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,000
Director Chen Suo.

455
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,850
Cai Hong. I went out of the city to conduct some business.

456
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:47,130
I came home. Look, I didn't even change my clothes yet.

457
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,670
And I heard about this.

458
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,660
I know that

459
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,390
you said that you would trust me.

460
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:04,570
I don't blame you. You must been instigated by someone.

461
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,070
Jiang Yu.

462
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,540
I don't want you to lie to Cai Hong again

463
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,540
and sabotage our relationship.

464
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,230
Okay?

465
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,190
Perhaps, Brother Shao Tian is really innocent.

466
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:44,640
He is so good to us. How could he have killed my father?

467
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,980
I know your heart is contradicting itself right now,

468
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,850
but if you keep everyone out, it will become empty.

469
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,350
There must be an answer.

470
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,790
I'm at odds now to find out who contacted him about this

471
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,550
and allowed him time to make the preparations.

472
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,870
You are only guessing now.

473
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,740
Perhaps, you are thinking too much.

474
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,610
Once a person lies,

475
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,270
he needs countless lies to redeem himself.

476
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,120
It's a pity that

477
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,910
it was simple to do.

478
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:27,020
Don't talk to me about this.

479
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,570
I don't want to listen.

480
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,860
<i>I'm here today to take Cai Hong away with me.</i>

481
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,430
<i>Name your price.</i>

482
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,590
<i>It can be double, triple or whatever, it's not a problem.</i>

483
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,810
<i>He brought that much money to take you back.</i>

484
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,710
<i>Don't you find it strange?</i>

485
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,700
<i>I'm the General Manager of Rong Da.</i>

486
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,980
<i>Is the salary of the General Manager of Rong Da that high?</i>

487
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,540
<i>I hold thirty percent shares in Rong Da.</i>

488
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,740
<i>You got a bonus already?</i>

489
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,870
<i>I loaned money from a bank.</i>

490
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,060
Ms. Lu

491
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,980
Word has it that today, you, Wu Cai Hong, and Jiang Yu

492
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,860
in front of a bunch of police

493
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,180
had a special encounter.

494
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,320
Well, it's all thanks to Ms. Lu.

495
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,270
If it wasn't for your help, I wouldn't be able to leave unscathed.

496
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,190
Am I that great?
