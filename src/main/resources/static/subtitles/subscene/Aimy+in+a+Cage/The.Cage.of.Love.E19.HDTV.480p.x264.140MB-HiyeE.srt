The Cage of Love

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,110
<i>Episode 19</i>

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:12,250
If it wasn't for your help, I wouldn't have been able to leave unscathed.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,920
Am I that great? I'm only just your subordinate who runs around doing errands.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,000
I just act according to you instructions.

6
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,020
But

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,680
did you really kill Wu Hong Da?

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,250
Of course not.

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,680
Why are you so nervous then?

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,600
Don't worry. Even if you killed someone,

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,420
I wouldn't tell anyone.

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,370
I really didn't kill anyone.

13
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,080
I still suspect that Jiang Yu killed Wu Hong Da.

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,110
He had the motive to kill, intent to commit the crime, and owns an identical pen.

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,200
In order to mask the truth, he has done some dirty deeds against me.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,920
By doing that, he sabotaged my love with Cai Hong.

17
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,700
Forget it. If you are fighting in the business arena,

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,670
one can lose their head and commit murder.

19
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,960
This is too scary.

20
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,390
You are too ethical.

21
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,720
How could you let Jiang Yu bully you again?

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,390
If this drags on, there will come a day when you will suffer.

23
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,090
I'm waiting for the opportunity now.

24
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,900
When the opportunity is here,

25
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,190
he won't be able to get away.

26
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,020
From what I can see, Jiang Yu and you are playing games with each other.

27
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,370
Can't even help oneself.

28
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,250
Okay.

29
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,090
Don't be too harsh on yourself.

30
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,950
Cai Hong. You haven't eaten anything for the whole day. Eat something.

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,150
Mrs Li. I'm really not hungry.

32
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,130
Eat something.

33
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,270
Young Master already said that if you don't eat anything, I'm not doing a good job.

34
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,190
I have to change and redo things until you eat.

35
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,500
Help me please.

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,550
I will eat then, Mrs Li.

37
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,760
Frankly, Young Master is doing this for your own good.

38
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,170
I don't know what the others think but I can

39
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,320
see clearly.

40
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,610
You don't need to twist it. Just eat it.

41
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,920
This is right.

42
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,030
Brother.

43
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,980
What do you take Wu Cai Hong as?

44
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,890
What do you mean? Of course, she is a servant.

45
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,580
But your attitude to her, is that of a servant?

46
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,280
I treat all my servants equally.

47
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,240
You are lying.

48
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,150
Would you take a servant to view the lotus pond?

49
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,570
Would you be concerned that your servant is not eating?

50
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,240
Brother, don't forget, she is Wu Hong Da's daughter.

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,190
I'm not a three year old kid. I don't need you to tell me what to do.

52
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,440
You know that I didn't say anything wrong.

53
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,650
You are angry because you have a guilty conscious.

54
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,700
What I said was right.

55
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,900
Your feelings towards Wu Cai Hong already surpasses that of an ordinary person.

56
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,920
Leave.

57
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,090
I can leave

58
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,520
but I would still like to advise you.

59
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,380
Don't let your personal feelings get in the way.

60
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,660
Did you see how Young Master treats Wu Cai Hong better than anyone?

61
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,880
Based on what you said, Wu Cai Hong is the young mistress.

62
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,920
We should treat her better in the future then.

63
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,360
If Wu Cai Hong becomes his wife, what will happen to us?

64
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,450
They may be childhood friends

65
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,640
but Miss has feelings for Young Master who is not interested.

66
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,900
But Miss's affections towards Master are unintentional. She lights up every time she see's him.

67
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,440
No wonder Miss hates Wu Cai Hong so much.

68
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,580
Even though they address her as the mistress of the house, her family name is Fang not Jiang.

69
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,570
She is also an outsider.

70
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:26,930
If she can't be the Young Master's wife, she will have to marry someone and leave the house sooner or later.

71
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,750
If a girl wants to marry, she should marry an authentic Young Master.

72
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,330
Look. Miss has placed so many thoughts on Young Master.

73
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,140
It was really rotten and a waste of time.

74
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,400
That's right.

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,380
<i>I will never leave this family.</i>

76
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,530
<i>I will also never leave Mom and Brother.</i>

77
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,430
<i>Wu Cai Hong. I won't let you and Brother be together.</i>

78
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,570
Miss Fang. Are you really inviting me out for tea? It can't be that simple.

79
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,810
I have already thought it through. I can help you.

80
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,030
You are not only helping me but yourself too.

81
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,760
Say whatever you want but let me state this first. I can help you

82
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,100
but you must never harm my brother.

83
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,320
I must not harm your brother?

84
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,450
But you have harmed Cai Hong a couple of times. What does this count?

85
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,910
Looks like you are not sincere in collaborating with me.

86
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,410
Miss Fang, let me advise you. You don't have much time.

87
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,380
If you don't manage it, I'm afraid that when Cai Hong enters the Jiang family

88
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,480
and becomes your sister-in-law,

89
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,030
what I would lose is just Cai Hong.

90
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,630
What you will lose is not only Jiang Yu.

91
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,900
Are you threatening me now?

92
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,370
Why would I collaborate with a menacing person?

93
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,730
Once a friend becomes an enemy, he becomes more dangerous than the enemy.

94
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,380
Yet once an enemy becomes a friend, he will be more reliable than a friend.

95
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,040
By helping me, you are helping yourself too.

96
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,620
Fine. How can I help you then?

97
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,110
Get the slave contract for me as soon as possible.

98
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,280
If I could do this, would I still be here?

99
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,570
I believe you will find the way.

100
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,440
I will wait for your news.

101
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,060
How was the investigation regarding the opium case at Ling Long?

102
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:53,320
There was a lead but the investigation midway, stopped.

103
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,420
We found the court official who handled this case twelve years ago but when we went to visit him,

104
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,360
he refused to reveal anything about that night.

105
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,020
He refused to talk? This means there was a major problem in the case.

106
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,820
Yes, I find it strange too. This court official is on extremely good terms with Jiang Wen Yuan.

107
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,530
Since Master Jiang's death, the top investigators have all left.

108
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,920
Thus, I feel that he knows some insider's information.

109
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,560
Please.

110
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,230
Please wait.

111
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,760
Old Master. Boss Zhou is here.

112
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,170
Leave.

113
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,820
If you are here to find out about the Ling Long case,

114
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,030
sorry, please go back.

115
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:09,810
Uncle Gao. I'm here to seek advice regarding the Ling Long case from twelve years ago.

116
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,730
At the same time, I'm also here to visit my mother's foe.

117
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,890
Do you still remember, three years ago, the aunt from the weaving and dyeing factory.

118
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,770
Are you referring to her husband, Zhou Da Liang who had lung disease?

119
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,330
I'm his son, Zhou Shao Tian.

120
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,680
Talking about this, you look exactly like your mother.

121
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,510
Uncle Gao. I visited you without advance notice today.

122
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,000
You definitely must have a request.

123
00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:01,690
I know that you don't want to talk about it but I still would like to find out about the opium case at Ling Long.

124
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,720
Please do me a small favour.

125
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,360
Wasn't the case settled then?

126
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,180
It has been such a long time and that person has already died.

127
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,970
Why do you still want to talk about it?

128
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,430
If it weren't for my mother's wish, I wouldn't want to talk about this either.

129
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,180
Your mother's wish?

130
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,380
When my father got sick and was lying in bed,

131
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,870
Old Master Jiang took care of my mother.

132
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,810
He gave her some of Ling Long's business. Old Master Jiang knew about my family's hardship.

133
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:34,010
He gave wage advances to try to solve the urgent needs of my family.

134
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,120
If it weren't for Old Master Jiang's kindness,

135
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,980
I'm afraid that my mom wouldn't have been able to support me and her sick husband.

136
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,520
Boss Jiang was really a good person.

137
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,910
When Boss Jiang passed away, my mother has never talked bad about him.

138
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:57,950
She said that someone like Old Master Jiang would never use opium to frame anyone.

139
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,730
Unfortunately with our family situation the way it was, Jiang was unable to be compensated.

140
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,860
Only during the Winter Solstice Festival, his burning point for money was all for nothing.

141
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:13,760
Now with mixed effort, Old Jiang can rest in peace.

142
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,160
I couldn't pay him for his kindness to my family.

143
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,990
The only thing I can do is to prove Boss Jiang's innocence.

144
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,410
He will then rest in peace in heaven.

145
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,580
Your mother has such a son who is willing to redeem himself for the family,

146
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,440
that is her good fortune.

147
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,770
But the case happened twelve years ago, it won't be easy to turn around the case.

148
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:49,390
I have no choice but to seek your help now.

149
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,580
I won't be able to help you

150
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,910
but there are some matters that I can tell you.

151
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:05,500
Old Master Jiang and I were on very good terms. I know how he was too.

152
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,720
Just like what you said,

153
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,940
he would never do anything like that.

154
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:20,550
The years following the wrongful death of Boss Jiang, there were a lot of people who could have cried foul.

155
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:27,010
The strange thing is that he payed for other's grievances but everyone suffered in the end.

156
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,680
I'm ashamed for not speaking sooner but now I can help prove Jiang's innocence.

157
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,510
But I think when he was implicated and everyone was tight-lipped.

158
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:46,840
I wanted to find a home for windows and orphans and find a solution

159
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:53,340
but when I heard that they were kicked out by the tribe, they have been hiding in their hometown.

160
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:59,400
I sent men to find out about their whereabouts but there was no news.

161
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,330
I heard that Jiang Yu is very capable now and he has gotten back Ling Long.

162
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:10,070
At that time, I was a coward and didn't dare to speak up on his father's behalf.

163
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,990
I don't have the face to see him. Thus, I have never visited him.

164
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:21,050
If you are sure that Old Master Jiang was duped, where is the evidence?

165
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,100
The incident happened a long time ago. If there are any evidence, it would already have been burnt.

166
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,670
Boss Jiang was wronged and not only be my side of the story.

167
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:40,310
I think if you could find the case file from that year, perhaps you could read through the documents.

168
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:40,990
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

169
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,790
- Miss Lu.
- You are looking for me?

170
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,550
I'm here to ask for your help to investigate a case.

171
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,540
You are really insincere.

172
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,160
When you look for me, it's either to help you find a fountain pen or to investigate a case.

173
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,380
Can't you treat me to a meal or go to the movies?

174
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,380
As for dinner and movie thing, how could I dare to cross warlord Lu?

175
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,990
We are discussing business and nothing else.

176
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,550
Speak. What help do you need?

177
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:40,550
During the Xuantong years is when the opium trafficking case took place.

178
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,160
We are a republic country now and you want me to help you investigate an official court case?

179
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,540
On what ground do you think I am able to do that?

180
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,750
If you cannot do it, Miss Lu, no one can.

181
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,940
I would like to see the records of the case. You are the only one who can help me with this.

182
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,130
Fine.

183
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:04,990
Since you said that we are presently discussing business now and nothing else,

184
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,830
if I can help you with this difficult request,

185
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,190
how are you going to thank me?

186
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,590
Tell me.

187
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,280
I want Ling Long's secret formula.

188
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,080
I think you are mistaken. I was with Ling Long for many years and have never heard about this.

189
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,320
I know that you don't have it. Anyway, it's not that urgent just as long as you will help me.

190
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,710
When doing business, it's for mutual benefits. Please do something for me.

191
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,950
If you think that you can't do it, let's not transact this business then.

192
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,780
I agree.

193
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,440
Don't play me. I know many secrets about you.

194
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,020
I'm leaving.

195
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,870
<i>Cai Hong, be patient. I will come and get you soon.</i>

196
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:30,140
<i>I will be able to show Jiang Yu's true colour soon and reveal the truth for you.</i>

197
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,470
Is everyone here?

198
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,400
Yes.

199
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:47,470
Today is the 15th of July, Ghost Festival, and the day for us to remember Old Master.

200
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:53,350
Mom. I have already prepared everything.

201
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:03,320
Every year, we have prepared for this festival. There was no other exception.

202
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,950
Especially when Old Master will be back today. Everyone, don't delay it.

203
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,860
Yes.

204
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,720
Go and do whatever you are assigned to do.

205
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,230
Yes.

206
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,670
Have you heated up the buns?

207
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,490
Yes, it should be ready soon.

208
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,490
Let me take a look.

209
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,200
Let me take a look. Are you okay?

210
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,750
Let me see.

211
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,600
Move aside.

212
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,030
What's wrong?

213
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,800
Did you scald yourself? Are you okay?

214
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,240
Let me take a look.

215
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,860
It's not me.

216
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,600
It's Miss.

217
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,980
Brother, you still don't admit that you treat Wu Cai Hong differently?

218
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,670
I was flustered just now and didn't check who was hurt.

219
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,720
That's because the problem is you didn't see who was hurt.

220
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,160
Your subconscious behavior is being driven by your inner thoughts.

221
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,450
Brother, I'm your sister.

222
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,730
We went through hard times for twelve years.

223
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,090
We got back Ling Long together to take revenge for father.

224
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:34,520
Other than your mother, I'm your closest relative in this world.

225
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,370
But why was

226
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,010
the first person that you were concerned about today was Wu Cai Hong and not me?

227
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,490
In your heart, Wu Cai Hong is more valuable than me.

228
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,510
You are still not going to admit it?

229
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,910
I have matters to attend to. I'm leaving first.

230
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,700
What you are feeling inside?

231
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,080
Why must you force me to talk about this?

232
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,560
Fei Fei. What exactly do you want?

233
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,030
I want Wu Cai Hong to leave this house.

234
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,210
Since you can't control your own feelings,

235
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,420
don't let your emotions bring you down.

236
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,010
Brother. You won't let me and Mom

237
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,790
and also our father who is in heaven be disappointed with you, right?

238
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:31,820
I will repeat myself. I will decide my own affairs.

239
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,080
Brother, you are really foolish.

240
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,910
Do you think you can run away from this problem?

241
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,150
Come back, dear.

242
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:01,210
It has been many years. How are you doing in that world?

243
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,940
Shao Tian has the ability now.

244
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,490
We are doing better than before.

245
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,500
If you need anything there,

246
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,070
just appear in Shao Tian and my dreams.

247
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,570
I know what you are worried about.

248
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:32,120
Don't worry. I don't have any grudges now.

249
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,070
He will understand me one day.

250
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,440
What you do mean by saying all that?

251
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,740
If there is anything on your mind, just tell me directly.

252
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,060
You don't need to complain in front of dad.

253
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,660
Shao Tian. You have misunderstood me.

254
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,950
I don't have any misunderstandings with you.

255
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,940
Father.

256
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,940
If you didn't pass away early,

257
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,010
you could be enjoying this.

258
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,920
I know that because our family was poor, you didn't have the will to live.

259
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,910
I have my own factor now. I can make big bucks.

260
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Everything that I have done

261
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,110
was for you.

262
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:05,500
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

263
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,340
How could you be just like a ghost?

264
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,210
Would be there be such a beautiful female ghost just like me?

265
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,940
Or one that would also be this thoughtful?

266
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,330
Guess what this is.

267
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,540
This is the opium case regarding the Jiang family.

268
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,110
Don't forget what you promised me.

269
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,060
Of course, I will find Ling Long's secret formula as soon as possible.

270
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,890
This is the way.

271
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,770
I already read this report.

272
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:14,570
According to what is written in the report, Jiang Family should have transported 100 tons of opium before.

273
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,690
Only for this amount,

274
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:22,730
the owed tax amount and the fine could bankrupt Jiang Family.

275
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,760
But, most of the drug smugglers had an accomplice.

276
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,340
In this report, Jiang Wen Yuan was the only one found guilty.

277
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,590
This point doesn't add up.

278
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,020
Think about it. It's such a big amount. Where did it come from?

279
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,900
How was it transported? Where was it stored?

280
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,290
If it was really stored in Ling Long, 100 ton

281
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,520
they wouldn't be able to hide it. I find this rather amusing.

282
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,760
Perhaps, all these weren't recorded here.

283
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,940
Because it could not be explained clearly, why try to make it worse?

284
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,900
Even more strange, I searched the records of Huzhou regarding the past 12 years,

285
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:12,090
on it, there is no mention of the opium case 12 years ago.

286
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,120
To put on a show, why was it recorded?

287
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,110
So, twelve years ago, Jiang Wen Yuan's case

288
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:28,380
was a case of mis-identity.

289
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,130
Exactly. Also the true criminal was the police chief at the time.

290
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:42,070
And the ultimate victor was Wu Hong Da.

291
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:49,160
<i>Cai Hong. I can finally get you out from there.</i>

292
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,900
However, according to the predictions,

293
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,670
could it be that the Jiang family in this case is Jiang Yu's family?

294
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,510
Of course.

295
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:05,540
Wu Cai Hong's father is Wu Hong Da. Jiang Yu's father is Jiang Wen Yuan.

296
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,720
Wu Hong Da, as the Police Chief, killed Jiang Wen Yuan because of money.

297
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,090
He took their family business, Ling Long Fabric Plant.

298
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:25,030
Tell me what is Jiang Yu's motive for getting close to Cia Hong.

299
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,430
Revenge

300
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:33,220
but if Jiang Yu really falls in love with Cai Hong now...

301
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,510
Who cares whether it's real love or not.

302
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:46,930
If Cai Hong were to find out that he got close to her just to take revenge for his father, what do you think she will think?

303
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,180
If I were Wu Cai Hong, I would definitely hate him to death.

304
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:59,630
The acquisition went well yet I am afraid of hurting Cai Hong.

305
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:03,900
It is the result of revenge and Wu Hong Da's death.

306
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:10,390
Then, Ms. Wu will naturally come back into your arms.

307
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:15,060
You exerted that much effort just to win a woman.

308
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,150
You are really passionate.

309
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,330
Thanks.

310
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,920
Old Master, you can rest in peace now.

311
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,320
The children have already grown up to be adults.

312
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,390
Your son has done well. He has taken revenge for you.

313
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:34,900
I will never be able to repay the kindness of the Jiang family.

314
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:42,540
I will always take care of the Jiang family and repay you back for your kindness. Mom is getting old

315
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,230
and brother has grown up.

316
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:51,250
Don't worry. I will take good care of Mom for you

317
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:56,010
and I will also take good care of brother too.

318
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,020
It's getting late.

319
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,970
Son. Go with Fei Fei to release the water lantern.

320
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,410
Madam.

321
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,910
Cai Hong, what is it?

322
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:27,910
Today is the Ghost Festival. Could you let me take time off?

323
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,360
I will like to release a water lantern for my father.

324
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,780
It's rare for someone to be this filial. Go now.

325
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,010
Thank you, Madam.

326
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,070
Quick.

327
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,120
Why are you keeping a close watch on my brother?

328
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:41,500
I know what you are thinking in your heart but it's just your fantasy.

329
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:47,370
This is just a dream. The deeper you get involved, you will only get hurt more.

330
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:51,340
Because my brother will never really like you.

331
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,420
I don't know what you are talking about.

332
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,510
I want to hide it so it is not exposed.

333
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:04,040
Ask yourself then what exactly you are thinking of.

334
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,990
Cai Hong.

335
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,050
Brother Shao Tian.

336
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,090
What are you doing here?

337
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:33,960
I'm here to tell a story to Cai Hong about what happened between the Jiang and Wu families twelve years ago.

338
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:41,410
Cai Hong. Jiang Yu is a consummate liar.

339
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,630
You have been tricked.

340
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,060
Brother Shao Tian. What are you talking about?

341
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,500
You are only just a tool for his revenge. Everything that he has done,

342
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,550
it was because of the opium case at Ling Long twelve years ago.

343
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,500
Your dad's death, Ling Long's confiscation,

344
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,340
it was all part of his plan.

345
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,750
Cai Hong, come over here.

346
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,940
- Stay far away from that liar.
- Zhou Shao Tian, what are you doing?

347
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,260
I want you to see his true colour.

348
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,520
Brother Shao Tian, don't do this.

349
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,860
Cai Hong!

350
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,630
Cai Hong.

351
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,850
Brother, don't you want your life?

352
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,750
Move aside.

353
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,690
Brother.

354
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,910
Brother.

- Move aside.
- Coming.

368
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,990
- Is she okay?
- Get the doctor now.

369
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,400
- Cai Hong.
- Move aside.

370
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,160
- Cai Hong.
- Brother, are you okay?

371
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,000
- Are you okay?
- Wake up.

372
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,350
- Brother.
- Cai Hong.
- Do you know what you are doing now?

373
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,820
You risked your own life for Wu Hong Da's daughter.

374
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,010
Did you think about Mom and me? Have you gone crazy?

375
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,560
What she and Brother Shao Tian said,

376
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,890
is it true?

377
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,370
Cai Hong.

378
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,710
Take your hands away from her.

379
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,500
Cai Hong. Are you okay?

380
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,920
I'm taking you to the hospital.

381
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,590
Brother, come to your senses.

382
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,700
Don't keep making this mistake.

383
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,050
It's a dead end ahead. Give up.

384
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:19,940
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

385
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,330
Doctor, how is she?

386
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,760
I have already done tests on Miss Wu.

387
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,370
Her injury is not grave. She only has some superficial wounds. She was only shocked.

388
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:50,640
it took a toll on her physical strnght, so she is very weak now.

389
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,780
When she wakes up and feels much better, she can be discharged then.

390
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,940
Thank you.

391
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,520
No.

392
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,530
This can't be true.

393
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,200
No.

394
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,900
This is not true.

395
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,760
Cai Hong.

396
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,050
What's wrong with you?

397
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,920
Brother Shao Tian, what's going on?

398
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:44,260
Did I have a nightmare last night?

399
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:50,610
Cai Hong. Everything that happened last night

400
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,960
was real.

401
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,430
Are you saying that

402
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,940
my father

403
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,030
was Jiang family's enemy?

404
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,000
Is this true too?

405
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,860
Twelve years ago, your father was innocent.

406
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,300
Jiang Yu's father, Jiang Wen Yuan, was the owner of Ling Long.

407
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,010
He was charged with possession of opium. Jiang Wen Yuan condemned him

408
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:28,960
and seized his home. Later Jiang Wen Yuan died

409
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,130
and your father became the new owner of Ling Long.

410
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,410
I found someone to investigate this case.

411
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:42,620
This is indeed a messed up case.

412
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,980
It was your father, Wu Hong Da.

413
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,940
It can't be.

414
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,490
My father would never do something harmful like this.

415
00:39:55,710 --> 00:40:02,450
Cai Hong. I'm telling you this not for you to keep go after your father's mistake.

416
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,870
That happened in that era.

417
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:11,240
This incident happened twelve years ago. Your father is no longer here. He's already dead.

418
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,940
I wanted you to learn so that you can see Jiang Yu's true colour.

419
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,640
He is only using revenge to take back what he has lost.

420
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,310
Come to your senses. Don't be tricked by that rascal.
