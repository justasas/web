The Cage of Love

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,730
<i>Episode 10</i>

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,940
I promise, after this,

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,740
you will have no regrets.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,130
Boss Jiang, you also offer a final inspection of the product.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,380
That's right.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,970
I heard that Boss Zhou of Fu Sheng

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,300
orders are intended to be made of this.

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,830
Let's go to visit the Miss of former Mr. Wu of Ling Long.

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,080
- There are some things that will fly.
- Yes, yes.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,700
Prices are good also.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,050
They even will allow us to do the water test. Let's go over to their shop.

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,540
Okay, everyone.

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,610
Let's go over to Fu Sheng to take a look again. After all, we are businessmen.

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,280
It makes sense to go where there is stability.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
Let's go.

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,150
-Boss Luo, wait. There are other styles in our store...
-Fei Fei.

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,120
Don't stop them from leaving.

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,370
Boss Jiang. Apologies, we are taking our leave.

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,020
Dear everyone. I won't be seeing you off. Take care.

21
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,580
This way, please.

22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,970
Take care, everyone.

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,600
The colours are nice here.

24
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,810
Brother Shao Tian, the dye orders today compared to the original are bigger.

25
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,170
We are working overtime to rush out the orders.

26
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,420
Jiang Yu's face must be black.

27
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,190
Brother.

28
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,190
Miss. We have another client. I heard that they came over from Ling Long.

29
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,930
Their prices are too expensive. Thus, they came here.

30
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,140
Let's go.

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,800
Let's go out and take a look.

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,980
Since Zhou Shao Tian joined together with the business federation,

33
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,780
they lowered their prices. We lost quite a number of clients to them.

34
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,770
They abandoned orders which are filled up in our warehouse.

35
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,000
- What should we do, Brother?
- Don't worry.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,850
Everything will come to light soon.

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,480
Don't bother about the issue regarding Fu Sheng.

38
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,490
They are at an advantage now.

39
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,390
Isn't there someone?
What someone?

40
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,140
Send men over there to tell their staff that we will offer them a high salary.

41
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,360
We are still increasing our staff. We are already having problems selling our products.

42
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,540
I get it. As long as we can lure their staff here

43
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,570
they won't have anyone to produce their goods.

44
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,650
Brother, great move.

45
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,540
If Zhou Shao Tian wants to save Fu Sheng,

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,960
he will need a big sum of cash.

47
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,510
I understand now. I will get this done immediately.

48
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,970
Okay.

49
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,000
-Grab your Rose Candy.
- Thank you.

50
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,190
Rose Candy.

51
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,340
Hold this carefully.

52
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,770
-I'll have Rose...
Rose Candy please.

53
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,900
Okay. Are you together?

54
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,710
We are not together. Split the purchases.

55
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,530
Take care.

56
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,120
My mom has already been discharged from the hospital.

57
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,220
If you want to see her, I can take you there.

58
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,180
Please hand this to Madam Jiang.

59
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,590
You haven't come to your senses yet?

60
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,640
I should be the one saying this.

61
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,470
You always saw Fu Sheng's capability.

62
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,660
So what? Are you afraid?

63
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,320
You will see the true face of that person next to you in Fu Sheng soon.

64
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,190
I already see it very clearly.

65
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,160
You appear as a Yiguanqinshou.
<i>immoral person</i>

66
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,510
A peer pressure to dominate the market

67
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,610
You even used disgusting tactics to frame my sister.

68
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,600
<i>What is this? There are so many words here. What does it say?</i>

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,350
<i>It's a recruitment notice. What is it for?</i>

70
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,620
What is written there?

71
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,360
- What's wrong?
- It's a recruitment notice.

72
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,080
Because of vacancies, there are several openings, especially for Journeymen,

73
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,140
Monthly payment of salaries. Between the two companies, the pay is higher. There are bonuses.

74
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,770
The conditions aren't bad!

75
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,450
They're just saying that.

76
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,870
How could it be? Ling Long is a big company!

77
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,150
If they said it, it must be true!

78
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,610
Then what are we still doing here? Let's go work at Ling Long!

79
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,540
- Let's go.
- But Boss Zhou treats us pretty well.

80
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,970
Money is more important. We'll be satisfied once we have it in our hands.

81
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,050
Regarding this, both of the companies are doing the same thing.

82
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,670
I say that we should go to whichever one pays higher and has better conditions.

83
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,230
Yes, exactly. Are you coming or not?

84
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,690
Let's go!

85
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,180
Wait for me! I'm here to sign up.

86
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,610
<i>I'm here to register!</i>

87
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,480
<i>Line up!</i>

88
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,150
Where are the others?

89
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,110
They all went to Ling Long.

90
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,240
I couldn't stop them.

91
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry, owner.

92
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:04,710
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

93
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,600
Jiang Yu, you despicable person! To use such means to get rid of all our business!

94
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,010
Let go.

95
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,050
Don't worry, let him go.

96
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,610
All I did was mention a higher salary.

97
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,810
As long as you offer a higher salary, all your workers will come back to you.

98
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,950
If you're capable, then do it. Doing it like this doesn't prove anything!

99
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,080
In business, strength is one thing, strategy is another.

100
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,880
If you have the courage to open a shop, you have the courage to lose.

101
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,860
I won't lose to you.

102
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,670
I also don't want you to give up so soon.

103
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,490
It'll be resolved once you show the money.

104
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,640
What money?

105
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,930
Let me remind you,

106
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,440
the Ling Long that I acquired was just a shell.

107
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,560
The money on the ledgers disappeared.

108
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,570
Where could such a large sum of money have gone?

109
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,230
Think carefully about how you're going to keep Fu Sheng.

110
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,150
Please go carefully.

111
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,170
Hello, who are you looking for?

112
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,340
Boss, Fu Sheng's owner has already

113
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,210
been waiting for you for a long time.

114
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,070
He hasn't left yet?

115
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,670
Boss, there's a call for you.

116
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,730
I know, it's okay.

117
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,380
Hello?

118
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,510
Boss Jiang, hello!

119
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,710
What do you need, just tell me!

120
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,060
You want to deposit some money? Of course!

121
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,540
That's great, thank you so much!

122
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,720
Don't disturb your workers, I'll go there personally to collect it.

123
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,840
What?

124
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,840
Zhou Shao Tian?

125
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,800
He's not a big client of mine.

126
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,540
I already knew that he couldn't do business, so I shouldn't have lent him money!

127
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,100
I'm making many mistakes.

128
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,260
Okay, wait for me.

129
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,960
I'm coming right now.

130
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,580
Boss Qian!

131
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,320
Boss Qian, I had something to discuss with you.

132
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,630
Boss Zhou, I have to leave for some business.

133
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,310
It's like this, can you lend me some more money so I can turn around my situation?

134
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,660
As long as it turns my situation around, I will definitely pay you back with interest.

135
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:59,400
I can lend you money, but what can you pawn?

136
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,700
It's true that I don't have anything to pawn right now.

137
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,240
However, you know my skills and personality.

138
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,710
In the future, I will invest all of Fu Sheng's earnings here.

139
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,940
Boss Zhou, look here. I'm also a businessman.

140
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,010
You didn't even return all the money you borrowed last time, how do you expect me to lend you more?

141
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,670
Also, who doesn't know about Fu Sheng's current situation?

142
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,610
Boss Qian, help me one last time. Give me one last chance.

143
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,420
I have urgent needs to attend to.

144
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,140
How about this, Boss Zhou.

145
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,050
Let's have a cigarette.

146
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,610
Take Boss Zhou to talk in the back.

147
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,040
- Hurry up!
- Okay, okay.

148
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,600
Let's go. Boss Zhou, welcome.

149
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,800
Get out!

150
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,720
Boss Qian, what's the meaning of this?

151
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,270
The meaning?

152
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,560
Zhou Shao Tian.

153
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,560
If you stand there not moving, how am I supposed to continue my business?

154
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,280
Let me tell you,

155
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,900
people are from different classes.

156
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,380
A pheasant will never become a phoenix.

157
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,450
You are not fit to be a businessman.

158
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,880
There's no way I'm lending you money.

159
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,910
Let me also remind you that you have to return the money that you borrowed,

160
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,500
or else

161
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,480
don't blame me for not being polite.

162

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

163
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,810
Stop! You can't go in.

164
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,380
I'm looking for your boss, Jiang Yu.

165
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,350
Please move aside.

166
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,020
These are the factory's newest dyes, look over it.

167
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,390
Okay.

168
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,670
I have something important to discuss with him.

169
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,640
- Miss!
- Move aside!

170
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,280
Miss!

171

Fei Fei.

173
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,000
You can go outside.

174
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,150
Jiang Yu.

175
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:20,340
Fu Sheng is a very small shop. There's no way it can compare with Ling Long.

176
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,290
Why are you so bitter? Why do you have to make it hard for him?

177
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,890
Every time you appear, it's to argue with me.

178
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,670
Before, I did treat you like this. I did a lot of things that made you angry.

179
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:46,300
But you can't direct your anger towards Shao Tian. He's him and I'm me.

180
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,520
Jiang Yu, I'm begging you.

181
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,200
Can you let Fu Sheng go?

182
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,290
This is the first time you begged me for Zhou Shao Tian.

183
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,150
Does Zhou Shao Tian support you

184
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,220
coming to beg me?

185
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,090
Then what do you want?

186
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,690
Sorry.

187
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,920
I will definitely force Fu Sheng out of business.

188
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,320
Why can't you let Fu Sheng go?

189
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Let Brother Shao Tian go?

190
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,430
In your eyes, I'm cold-blooded.

191
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,080
So I can only resort to the facts in order for you to see the truth.

192
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,510
I will only accept what I see right now.

193
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,520
I can see clearly what kind of person you really are.

194
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,560
Then we don't have anything more to discuss.

195
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,620
What can I do so that you will let Fu Sheng go?

196
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,080
And let Brother Shao Tian go?

197
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,840
I am not an immoral person.

198
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,660
However I am not lenient and won't show mercy.

199
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,760
You will get your retribution.

200
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,000
Did you hear?

201
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,300
Zhou Shao Tian is asking for a loan for more money.

202
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,980
This is a way for them to feed their families.

203
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,460
Is Zhou Shao Tian going to force us to death?

204
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,490
Yes. He's going to force us to death.

205
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:42,820
Who will lend him the money now? If he doesn't get a loan, our money will be in hot soup.

206
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,430
That's right.

207
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,590
Aren't there goods in his shop now?

208
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,610
Take his goods as collateral. It's better than nothing.

209
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,150
Yes. Let's take his goods as collateral.

210
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,510
Let's go.

211
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,730
Let's go in. Take these away.

212
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,140
Take them away.

213
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,800
Put down my goods.

214
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,740
Put them down.

215
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,180
The deadline is not due yet.

216
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,200
Confiscate them.

217
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,610
You are stealing my goods.

218
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,370
- Sis, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

219
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,590
Brother Shao Tian. I was just about to look for you.

220
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,400
Will this help you?

221
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,700
No need.

222
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,560
I don't mind. It's only this.

223
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,380
Brother Shao Tian, take this. This is my mom's personal...

224
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,650
You are giving out your mother's funeral money.

225
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,530
- What are you trying to do?
- Stop hitting her.

226
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,540
I will remember what you have done.

227
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,480
But for the rich, they are utterly inadequate.

228
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,930
Thank you, everyone.

229
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,450
Who is it that failed to give you light <i>direction</i>?

230
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,340
Why don't you let Cai Yun buy French perfumes instead?

231
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,250
Mom.

232
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,590
Kneel down.

233
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,000
Zhou Shao Tian, return our money immediately.

234
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,570
If not, it won't be that simple next time.

235
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,370
Let's go.

236
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,950
Let's go.

237
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,870
Brother. I have been thinking about this for the past two days.

238
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,350
What do you know?

239
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,500
So what if you have lost once? This is all crap.

240
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,300
You are just going to give it up like that?

241
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,660
Let's start anew.

242
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,500
Brother.

243
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,070
I'm not good with words.

244
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,190
Brother, you really have the talent.

245
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,550
I believe that you can make a comeback.

246
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,690
Cheers.

247
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,150
Trust me, Ah Li.

248
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,390
I will definitely make a comeback.

249
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,330
I believe you, Brother.

250
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,310
My great worry now is that when I don't have any money,

251
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,080
it's frustrating.

252
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,950
When I have money,

253
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,860
it's even more so.

254
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,960
Money?

255
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,820
Brother, you are saying that there is no way to gain power.

256
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,850
It's not power.

257
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,120
It's money.

258
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,250
Is there something like this in the world?

259
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,260
You have money and you can't spend it.

260
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,940
This is impossible.

261
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,650
Yes.

262
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,780
This is the situation.

263
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,110
Brother. You really know how to joke. I know that in this world, there are things that money can't buy.

264
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,110
-The perfect color is not created with money.
-Be quiet.

265
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,600
If you have money and you don't spend it, it will force one to die.

266
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,430
If you want to spend the money, you will cause someone to die.

267
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,860
What do you mean?

268
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,010
All I know is that one can not live without money. On the other hand,

269
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,660
this person will suffocate by money.

270
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,130
I also want to walk away

271
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:28,670
but in my heart, I can't let this go.

272
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,280
Brother, how much is something worth

273
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,300
when it begins to be taken away.

274
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,490
Brother, where are you going?

275
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,570
Brother, be careful.

276
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,900
Brother Shao Tian. You have drank too much.

277
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,940
This is bad for your health.

278
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,240
I'm fine. I've only been drunk a few times in my lifetime.

279
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,860
I like that you are finding it hard to accept

280
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:33,050
but when a person is facing hardship, you must bring your spirit up.

281
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,950
Don't you think so?

282
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,320
Don't worry. I won't do this again.

283
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:46,200
By the way, I went to visit a few of my father's friends...

284
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,480
- Hence...
- Cai Hong,

285
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,530
I have already thought it through.

286
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,440
I will take you away from Huzhou. Let's move far away.

287
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,560
What about Fu Sheng then?

288
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,310
Anywhere where you are at, Fu Sheng will be there.

289
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,990
Fu Sheng is not important. You are important.

290
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,820
But we still owe a lot of debts.

291
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,390
We will pay them back gradually.

292
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,150
However much profits we made, we will pay them back.

293
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,520
Is this okay?

294
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,560
Let's go to Tianjin. No one knows us there. We can start anew.

295
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:42,560
But I haven't taken revenge for Ling Long and my father yet.

296
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,290
We can't leave at a time like this.

297
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,300
Cai Hong. The situation now

298
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,940
is that Jiang Yu has forced us into at tight corner.

299
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,760
If this continues, our business will really go down.

300
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,060
Why don't we find a hideaway first

301
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,620
and wait for this to die down before we come back for revenge?

302
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,650
Brother Shao Tian.

303
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,740
Your decision is too sudden.

304
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,620
Let me think about it again.

305
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,630
Brother.

306
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,940
Zhou Shao left today.

307
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,530
Has he started his move?

308
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,130
No. But the situation is already like this,

309
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,510
he still haven't got the cash for Fu Sheng.

310
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,870
He quite tolerant about it

311
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,800
Brother. Perhaps, you have guessed wrongly.

312
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,380
Maybe it wasn't Zhou Shao Tian who teamed up with Lao Cai to empty Ling Long.

313
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,530
If it wasn't him, who else would it be?

314
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:51,200
Brother. I'm a bit suspicious now.

315
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,610
If you go against Zhou Shao Tian this way,

316
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,480
you will need an elixir.

317
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,560
What do you mean?

318
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,550
You don't understand what I mean?

319
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,520
I really hope that you don't understand what I'm saying.

320
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,120
Brother, don't be sad. Where there is life there is hope.

321
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,650
I would like to add fire to the flame. I know the boss would not give me this opportunity again.

322
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:51,580
Miss Lu. Are you making a joke out of this?

323
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:57,820
It's common for soldiers to fail. Mr Zhou, it's you who are taking this too hard.

324
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,250
When you fall, you can still get up and start anew again.

325
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,980
Look at the state I am in now.

326
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,710
I don't have any money left.

327
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,910
I am making a point

328
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,300
and thinking of a way to reverse this.

329
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,480
I can help you.

330
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,640
Really? That's great.

331
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,690
Miss Lu hasn't finished talking yet.

332
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,640
Yes.

333
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,450
Boss Zhou knows me very well.

334
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,310
What can I do for Miss Lu then?

335
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,620
The secret formula.

336
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,550
What secret formula?

337
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,430
The secret formula of Wu Hong Da.

338
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,470
I don't have the secret formula.

339
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,690
I don't know what the secret formula is. It doesn't concern Ling Long.

340
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,450
Fu Sheng started a business for only a few days and it was brought down by Ling Long.

341
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,230
Are you really going to swallow this?

342
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,010
That's right, Brother.

343
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,540
Let's do this, Boss Zhou. Think about this

344
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,100
but don't let me wait for too long.

345
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,490
A woman doesn't like to be kept waiting.

346
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,530
I won't be seeing you off.

347
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,590
Brother. Why didn't you take up her offer? It's a great opportunity.

348
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,540
I really don't have the secret formula.

349
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,840
Yesterday stepmother did tofu. She especially liked it.

350
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,460
This child of mine doesn't like to eat greasy and oily food.

351
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,700
She doesn't like to eat fish. She said that they have a fishy smell.

352
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,080
That's right. We still have half a fish left from yesterday.

353
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,150
Go and buy some vegetables.

354
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,410
Remember to bargain with them.

355
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,250
Stepmom, don't worry. Deliver the food to Cai Yun now.

356
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,310
Candied fruits on sticks.

357
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,940
Candied fruits on sticks.

358
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,880
Candied fruits on sticks.

359
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,240
What are you going? What's going on?

360
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,830
- Don't you look where you are going? This dress is very expensive.
- Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose.

361
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:20,430
- It's so dirty.
- Let me wipe it off for you.

362
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,740
She is from a dye factory. Her husband committed suicide by jumping down. Look at her, she's still wearing such bright and floral clothes.

363
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,720
- Seriously.
- Stop wiping, it's so dirty.

364
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,270
Stop wiping. Don't touch me. Go away.

365
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:35,690
What are you doing? Why are you bullying him?

366
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,190
Who says I'm bullying him? Look at my dress. It's very expensive.

367
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,760
So what if it's dirty? Just go back and wash it. Why are you creating a ruckus here?

368
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,350
Seriously.

369
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,540
She broke my eggs. Compensate me for these.

370
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,940
- Compensate me for the eggs.
- Why should I pay for them?

371
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,270
She pushed me and made me fell.

372
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,290
Look at my dress.

373
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,200
The eggs have broken shells.

374
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,860
- Do you know how expensive it is?
- Don't leave. You must pay for it.

375
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,230
- Stepmom.
- What are you doing?

376
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,050
- What are you doing?
- She broke my eggs.

377
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,540
-How much are they?
- Take a look. Pay for them.

378
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,340
Just this sum of money? It's not enough. Look at the amount of eggs.

379
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,110
In any case, it's not enough.

380
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,980
This should be enough, right?

381
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,910
Consider that I'm unlucky.

382
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,240
Seriously. Why did you pay her?

383
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,100
Stepmom, don't be angry.

384
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,480
What are you looking at? Go away.

385
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,840
Leave now.

386
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,000
Let's go.

387
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,770
I will deliver this to Cai Yun.

388
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,770
Go back home and wash up now.

389
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,670
I'm so unlucky

390
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,710
to encounter such an unlucky incident.

391
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,160
I'm leaving first.

392
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,310
- Wu Cai Yun. You are a thief.
- I'm not a thief.

393
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,470
What are you still doing here? We don't welcome thieves here.

394
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,130
- I didn't steal.
- What are you doing? Stop it.

395
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,860
-She stole and has a criminal record.
-That was an injustice.

396
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,020
Ah Xue, say something.

397
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,070
- What right do you have to say that she is at thief?
- Wu Cai Yun is the poorest student in the class.

398
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,890
Isn't it common for her to steal?

399
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,150
How could you just simply say this? I'm going to sue you for defamation.

400
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:38,660
You are going to sue me for defamation? My mom also heard that Wu Cai Hong stole something.

401
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,300
She has even planned to petition the students to kick her out of school.

402
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,550
My mom said that she doesn't want me to be in the same school as a thief.

403
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,240
You have gone overboard.

404
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,560
- Cai Yun.
- We should have kicked her out a long time ago.

405
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,420
That's right. Let's kick her out.

406
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,170
Cai Yun.

407
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,330
Wait for me. Just ignore them.

408
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,920
Sis, Why was I framed?

409
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,630
Why am I being misunderstood by them?

410
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,760
Why must I live such a life?

411
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,330
I don't want to study anymore.

412
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,910
What's the status of the task?

413
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,950
Don't worry about Zhou Shao Tian.

414
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,350
I'm keeping a close watch on him.

415
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,390
But Miss Wu has been asking for help from her father's business friends for the past two days.

416
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,070
That Miss Wu, this kid is really not bad

417
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,560
I heard that she's swearing on her dad's reputation.

418
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,210
Do it as soon as possible. Close it.

419
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,440
Okay. I will acquire Fu Sheng tomorrow.

420
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,770
Boss Jiang.

421
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,700
Boss Jiang.

422
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,940
Okay, let's do this. I still have some matters to attend to.

423
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,670
Okay.

424
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:39,570
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

425
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,740
Now the only thing left is to hand him over.

426
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,570
Why did you come here?

427
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,210
Why aren't you saying anything?

428
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:28,150
Jiang Yu. You are here every day.

429
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:32,740
Don't you feel my father's soul has been following you?

430
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,870
What are you trying to say?

431
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,440
What I'm trying to say?

432
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,120
You forced Brother Shao Tian into a dead end and caused my sister to be unable to continue her studies.

433
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,880
What else are you still thinking of?

434
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,970
Let me tell you.

435
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:53,820
You harbour grudges about my family. You will never change.

436
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,450
I never planned to be the saviour of the Wu family.

437
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,310
Even if Wu Hong Da didn't pass away, I would still have acquired Ling Long.

438
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,510
Why should I bother. Give yourself the trouble of it.

439
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,540
Devil's words.

440
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:16,870
There will come a day when you will regret everything that you have said today.

441
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,770
What I regret is meeting such an evil man like you.

442
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,110
You should go back and keep calm first before you talk again.

443
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,310
I'm very calm now.

444
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,340
Don't be full of yourself.

445
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,130
Look, it's such a beautiful day but you can't appreciate it.

446
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:37,460
It's because people like you have a dark heart.

447
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:42,610
Even now if you have an exquisite life, you are not kind.

448
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,610
I don't want to see you again.

449
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,640
I'm not going. I don't want to go to Tianjin.

450
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,500
It's so far away. I like living here.

451
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Stepmom. It's a dead end for us here.

452
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,350
When you go there, you can start anew.

453
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,810
No one is forcing you. You are only forcing yourselves.

454
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:30,820
You didn't stay at the great Ling Long. You quit such a great job. You didn't choose the great Jiang Yu.

455
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,620
Jiang Yu acquired Ling Long and now, Fu Sheng has been brought down by him.

456
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,210
If we continue to stay here, we might be his next target.

457
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,870
Why would he target us?

458
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,320
Fine. Even if Ling Long was acquired by him,

459
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,520
that's business. Kiddo, what do you know?

460
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,630
The words you've spoken, aren't you afraid that dad would be disappointed?

461
00:34:55,140 --> 00:35:00,390
I heard that it's winter six months of the year in Tianjin.

462
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,990
I'm afraid of the cold. Moreover,

463
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,740
I won't be able to drink longjing tea

464
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,960
or eat Rose flower candy.

465
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,060
I don't understand the way the people talk that too. How could I live there?

466
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,340
Mom. I believe that Brother Shao Tian will let us live well there.

467
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:21,660
What do you mean? When he started Fu Sheng, he said that he would make the business expand.

468
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,990
(Where are) The results?
The situation we're in was caused by Jiang Yu.

469
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,910
Don't tell me you still want to be laughing stock here?

470
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:35,480
Cai Yun's schoolmates look down on her. Since this is the case, why don't we start anew there?

471
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,390
That's right, Mom. Just agree.

472
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,810
Give me a few days

473
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,000
to prepare.

474
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,900
To buy longjing tea and Rose flower candy.

475
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,550
Stepmom. I will get all these for you.

476
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,850
Once I have gotten them, we will set off tomorrow.

477
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,490
That fast?

478
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:05,820
Heavens, I have so much clothes. Let me go and pack first.

479
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,160
It's okay. She will pack for you.

480
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,720
Mom.

481
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,640
Shao Tian, you are back.

482
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,330
Pack your stuff and get ready to leave.

483
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,500
- What's wrong?
- We are going to Tianjin tomorrow.

484
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:35,290
- We won't return again.
- What happened that we must relocate?

485
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,100
- Did you...
- It's Jiang Yu.

486
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,500
Jiang Yu?

487
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,220
Jiang Yu forced me into a dead end.

488
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,310
I have no choice except to leave.

489
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,560
Is Jiang Yu that bad?

490
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,700
He is not bad? Is it me then?

491
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,090
I don't mean that. I'm just saying if it was an misunderstanding.

492
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:07,540
- Shao Tian. Even though you didn't tell me about Fu Sheng...
- Fu Sheng doesn't concern you.

493
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,690
Does Jiang Yu have anything to do with it?

494
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,570
I don't want to talk about this. Pack up.

495
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,400
Big Brother.

496
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,700
This way.

497
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,120
It's her, Miss Wu.

498
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,530
I heard that you want to borrow money from me.

499
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,300
Yes.

500
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,610
Do you know what this place is?

501
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,700
Yes.
- You know and you still dare to come here?

502
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,470
- I will definitely return the loan.
- Let me tell you.

503
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,120
My interest is very high.

504
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,900
Your Wu family has gone bankrupt and Fu Sheng is also in dire straits.

505
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,490
How do you plan to return my loan?

506
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,760
I will definitely pay back the loan.

507
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:24,130
You need collateral to take a loan.

508
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,170
What do you plan to use as the collateral?

509
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,710
I will use myself as the collateral.

510
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,930
You are a smart person. When you take my loan and can't return it when it's due,

511
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:44,030
don't blame me for not being polite to you.

512
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,080
Since I'm already here, I won't have any regrets.

513
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,070
Whether you lend or not, you should give it to one's heart's content.

514
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,340
Happy.

515
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,430
You do realize what you would be giving up.

516
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:02,920
Your sister and you are renowned beauties in Huzhou.

517
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,350
If you can't return the loan,

518
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,370
I may sell you to the brothels.

519
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:11,830
Did you think it over carefully?

520
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,580
Are you going to take the loan or not?

521
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,060
I will take the loan.

522
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,680
Fine.

523
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,690
Wait here.
