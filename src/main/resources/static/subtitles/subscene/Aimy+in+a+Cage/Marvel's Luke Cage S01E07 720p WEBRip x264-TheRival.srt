00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:23,651
-[gun cocking]
-[Zip] Got that John Blaze shit.

2
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:26,195
Forget about making somebody's day.

3
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:28,113
These two Desert Eagles here?

4
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:32,785
Fly, pelican, fly.

5
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,795
Do I even need to say it?

6
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:47,424
[chuckles]

7
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:53,681
[sighs] Come on, Zip.

8
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:56,100
You should find a new profession.

9
00:00:56,183 --> 00:00:57,768
Cottonmouth is done.

10
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:00,062
You ain't heard?

11
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:04,399
Cottonmouth's getting out,
so you ain't done shit.

12
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:05,776
Boom!

13
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:33,846
[inaudible]

14
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:42,021
[Audrey] Detective.

15
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:44,857
Remember who you are.

16
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,779
Next time, it would behoove you
to have actual evidence.

17
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:51,321
You know, something besides

18
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:53,741
the dogged harassment
of a misguided beat cop.

19
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:55,284
You calling me a dog?

20
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:58,412
No, I believe the brother said "dogged,"

21
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:00,330
as in determined.

22
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:02,499
Although, true...

23
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:06,586
the word is derived from the description
of a dog's persistence.

24
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:10,841
See, that's the problem with a bitch.

25
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:15,262
Once they get their mouth on a bone...

26
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:16,722
they can't let go.

27
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:22,269
We'll see who's somebody's bitch

28
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,897
when your ass is in prison...

29
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:27,607
Cornell.

30
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:30,695
[chuckles]

31
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:34,573
[Stokes chuckling]

32
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:40,412
[woman] There he is!

33
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:42,707
[reporters clamoring]

34
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:32,047
[theme music playing]

35
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:43,786
[newscaster] <i>Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes'</i>
<i>release this morning</i>

36
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:45,454
<i>was a blow to local law enforcement--</i>

37
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:47,622
[Stokes laughing]

38
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,418
Mariah ain't gonna like that shit.

39
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:52,920
Neither should you.

40
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:55,630
I just shot a cop
and walked away free.

41
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:58,092
What's there not to like?

42
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:01,720
Zip and Amos picked up the truck
from the docks right after I shot Scarfe.

43
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:05,765
Domingo got his guns back last night.

44
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,726
Everyone else will fall in line.

45
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:11,313
Jamaicans, Haitians, Dominicans.

46
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:12,481
Hell...

47
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:14,859
even the Koreans.

48
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:16,861
All loyal.

49
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:19,654
We're all good.

50
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:24,159
So...

51
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:28,038
when do I get my Judas?

52
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,124
You don't.

53
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,334
You're too hot right now.

54
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:35,129
Luke Cage is a luxury, Cornell.

55
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,008
He's, uh... he's ice cream.

56
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:42,011
And you need to keep steak on the table.

57
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:45,514
And how do I do that
with Luke Cage around?

58
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:49,851
All he has to do is
[shouting] show up

59
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:53,147
and hoods scatter
like roaches with the lights on!

60
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,068
Guns, drugs, all street traffic
is a mess right now because of him!

61
00:05:58,152 --> 00:05:59,987
[breathing heavily]

62
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,575
Niggas act like he can walk on water.

63
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,619
Can he?

64
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,125
I'm done talking, Shades.

65
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:19,131
Tell Diamondback I need
to holler at him.

66
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,801
You sure that's the way
you want to play this?

67
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:26,931
Okay.

68
00:06:44,364 --> 00:06:45,699
[door closes]

69
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:36,083
So what about all that evidence?

70
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,794
Without Scarfe to corroborate,
that ledger is useless.

71
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:41,796
Even the whole thing with Spurlock

72
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,341
and the bodies Cottonmouth
burned there won't stick.

73
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:47,719
Spurlock is going to eat the charge
and take the years.

74
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,430
He won't testify.

75
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:53,350
He'd be his own client. [sighs]

76
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:56,311
[Claire] So that's it?

77
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:00,149
Setbacks happen all the time.

78
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:02,651
You can still do something about this.

79
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,111
Why me?

80
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:08,157
Because you're not afraid of Cottonmouth,
and he's obviously afraid of you.

81
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:10,284
What do you expect me to do?

82
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:13,203
I tried to do things the right way.
Cops let him go.

83
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:16,081
Cops can only do so much.

84
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:18,083
You have the power to do more.

85
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,793
Look at what's happening
in Hell's Kitchen.

86
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,837
You mean that cat running
around beating people up?

87
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:24,131
That's what you want me to be?

88
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:27,884
Sometimes, if you want justice...

89
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,469
you have to get it yourself.

90
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:35,767
If Hell's Kitchen's so great,
why'd you run uptown?

91
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,228
Why did you?

92
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:41,315
There is nothing that can hurt you.

93
00:08:41,398 --> 00:08:43,858
So what the hell are you afraid of?

94
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,570
[phone ringing]

95
00:08:57,831 --> 00:08:59,333
[Fish] Pop's Barber Shop.

96
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,379
It's for you.

97
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:06,923
[Stokes on phone] <i>Let's parley.</i>

98
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,469
Either we can be gentlemen about this...

99
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:13,222
or we can get into some gangster shit.

100
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:15,890
Parley's just fine.

101
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:19,894
Your gangster shit hasn't worked out
so well for you recently.

102
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:21,563
[chuckles]

103
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:23,022
Harlem's Paradise.

104
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:25,317
Bring your apron.

105
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:28,403
[laughing]

106
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:32,324
[hangs up phone]

107
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:35,535
What'd he say?

108
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:40,915
Enough.

109
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:51,176
Might as well take all that down now.

110
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:54,888
No. There's still plenty of work
to be done.

111
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:57,391
Not for me.

112
00:09:58,308 --> 00:10:00,185
They just made it official an hour ago.

113
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,771
But you had nothing to do with Scarfe.

114
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:05,524
My shop, my watch.

115
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,694
[inaudible]

116
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:11,821
All right, here we go.

117
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:14,199
You've got to play this smart, Detective.

118
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:16,410
IA's gonna be up your ass
with a flashlight.

119
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,537
I can handle Ridley.

120
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,123
She was my lieutenant at the 31st.

121
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:23,875
Listen, you still have
a future here, Misty.

122
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,919
My advice to you
is to let go of this board

123
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,837
and everyone you have pinned on it.

124
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:30,882
Cottonmouth needs to be in handcuffs.

125
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:34,636
Don't let this twist you to the point
where you can't see which way is up.

126
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,279
[exhales]

127
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:55,324
Mercedes?

128
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,285
Priscilla.

129
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:02,664
I prefer Inspector Ridley.

130
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:05,792
Priscilla, I heard they started
calling you Inspector Gadget

131
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,920
-behind your back once you got promoted.
-[chuckles]

132
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:12,757
This is gonna be fun.

133
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,386
[reporters clamoring]

134
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:21,600
Councilwoman Dillard and I
don't agree on much.

135
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:23,268
But she's a good woman
who loves Harlem,

136
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:26,480
and I'm a strong believer in party first,
no matter what.

137
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:28,440
I came as a friend in her time of need.

138
00:11:28,523 --> 00:11:31,318
Mr. Boone, is it true you're here
to ask the councilwoman to resign?

139
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:33,862
He's here because I asked him here.
Damon.

140
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:35,905
[all clamoring]

141
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:37,115
[Mariah] Let him through.

142
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,825
[clamoring continues]

143
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:41,370
Wait, wait, wait.
First question, go.

144
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:44,080
Was your affordable housing initiative
funded by drug money?

145
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:48,126
My cousin has never been
accused of selling drugs.

146
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,629
I thought you all said
he was running guns.

147
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:52,464
-Will you please make up your mind?
-[chuckles]

148
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:55,759
Councilwoman, have you been questioned
by the NYPD about your cousin?

149
00:11:57,844 --> 00:11:59,429
Family first, Robin.

150
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:02,557
I love my cousin Cornell Stokes.

151
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:05,852
The charges against him
are categorically false,

152
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,896
which is why they let him go.

153
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:11,232
He is an integral part
of my New Harlem Renaissance

154
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:15,362
and our movement to rebuild
Harlem for our Harlemites.

155
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:16,446
Okay? That's it.

156
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,116
-Get out of the rain. Go, go!
-[all clamoring]

157
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:23,537
[clamoring continues]

158
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,416
[Mariah] Ah! This is low...
even for you.

159
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:30,043
[Boone] I wasn't lying.
I'm here as your friend.

160
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:33,422
[Mariah] Pretty boy Stanford Carpetbagger.

161
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:36,508
You've been trying to knock me
off my spot for years.

162
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:39,260
How much of what they're saying is true?

163
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:42,806
Damn.

164
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:44,641
That bad?

165
00:12:46,518 --> 00:12:47,727
You're...

166
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:50,146
tainted.

167
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:53,400
And the infection is contagious.

168
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,111
So what do you recommend,
Dr. Boone?

169
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:01,325
You step aside
and let me take your seat.

170
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:04,243
Then I can support your initiatives
on the inside.

171
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:05,995
And push your permits through.

172
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,747
A year from now,

173
00:13:07,831 --> 00:13:11,042
all four of your complexes
could be up and running.

174
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,627
That's cute.

175
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,800
You've been trying to knock me
out of my spot for six years, Damon.

176
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:22,887
It didn't work then.
It's not working now.

177
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:25,014
Find a new hobby.

178
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:27,183
You can't stay on top forever, Mariah.

179
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:29,436
You're gonna fall.

180
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:33,064
And I'll enjoy every second when you do.

181
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,066
You need to leave now.

182
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:39,278
Show your Marigny ass out.

183
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:57,381
[indistinct clamoring]

184
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:00,258
Do you need anything?

185
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,677
Scotch. Neat.

186
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,309
[Alex] Mariah?

187
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,356
How the hell did you get in here?

188
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,900
We need to talk.

189
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:24,073
Alone.

190
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:30,121
So, this Luke Cage
was a bartender at Harlem's Paradise?

191
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:33,124
Actually, I believe he was the dishwasher.

192
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:35,043
<i>He was filling in for Dante that night.</i>

193
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:36,753
[Ridley] <i>One man is linked</i>
<i>to a criminal,</i>

194
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:39,464
the death of four people,
the destruction of a restaurant,

195
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:41,007
and you don't find him suspicious?

196
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,009
Of course I do.

197
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:45,845
[Ridley] <i>Step back.</i>
<i>Take a look at your board.</i>

198
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:50,892
Who is the one person that is linked
to every single location up there?

199
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:53,395
It's not just this case
that depends upon on it.

200
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,855
Your career is also in the balance.

201
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,861
[breathing heavily]

202
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,031
Shit.

203
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:06,115
[bangs]

204
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:10,244
[Stokes playing keyboard]

205
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:25,927
[indistinct chatter]

206
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:41,234
[playing keyboard]

207
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:44,028
Damn, Cornell, you just playing that,
like, out of thin air like that?

208
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:45,864
You don't need to, uh,
write it down?

209
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:47,532
I just see it in my head.

210
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:50,994
[laughing] This boy
is a damn prodigy, Mabel.

211
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:54,623
That prodigy needs to keep it down.

212
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:56,415
Mariah's trying to study.

213
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,542
[scoffs] Like a little music

214
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,794
is gonna disturb all that hoein'
you got goin' on over there.

215
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:02,213
That hoein' is what keeps the lights on.

216
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,422
Look, all I'm saying is that

217
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:07,844
Cornell should be in one of them schools
like, um... Juilliard.

218
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:10,805
[Mabel] There's only
one school that matters.

219
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:13,141
-Cornell is really good.
-[Uncle Pete] Mmm.

220
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:15,519
[smacks lips]
Did I ask you anything, Little May?

221
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:16,770
[Uncle Pete] The girl's got a point.

222
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:19,856
-[Mabel] She don't need you to defend her.
-I know she don't.

223
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:21,775
Because she's gonna be a lawyer,

224
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:23,943
and she's gonna be able
to defend her damn self.

225
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:25,779
Ain't that right, baby?

226
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:29,824
-Hey, Mariah.
-Snap, crackle, pop!

227
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:32,451
-How you doing, Henry?
-[young Pop] Good, ma'am.

228
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,622
Hey, yo, Cottonmouth.

229
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:37,331
-You coming?
-[stops playing]

230
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:39,125
You know I hate that name.

231
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,419
Well, I could just called you Corny.

232
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:44,673
-Is that better?
-Hey! He's practicing.

233
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:46,966
All right?
He needs to stay right here.

234
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,635
He needs to get a little dirt on him.

235
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:50,344
[chuckling]

236
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,058
Actually, Pete's right.

237
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:56,685
You stay here, Cornell.

238
00:16:57,602 --> 00:16:58,978
You can go.

239
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:01,648
You stand right here with me.

240
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,991
My husband, his brother, and me...

241
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:16,495
built this here Harlem game
brick by brick.

242
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,123
Numbers, pussy, guns.

243
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:24,546
But you know good and goddamn well
the one thing I never sell is drugs.

244
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:27,966
So what the hell made you go
and do something so stupid?

245
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:31,510
-I thought I was helping your ass.
-Helping me?

246
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:35,807
Man, this crack game is blowin' up.

247
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,476
Salvador Colon and all them,
they making mad loot,

248
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,895
and your old ass is getting left--
[yelps]

249
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:42,355
[screaming]

250
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:45,775
[wailing]

251
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,948
Finish your studies upstairs, baby girl.

252
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:56,369
Uh-uh, not you.
You stay right there, Cornell.

253
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:59,080
[Donnie wails and whimpers]

254
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:02,917
And your dumb ass ain't inventive enough
to think of some shit like this.

255
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,254
Who gave you this idea, huh?

256
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:08,047
[Uncle Pete] Who the hell
are you looking at?

257
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:09,215
Hmm?

258
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:12,010
[Mabel] Take out this trash, Cornell.

259
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:13,595
No.

260
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:16,180
Cornell ain't ready
for nothing like this, Maybelline.

261
00:18:16,264 --> 00:18:19,643
Well, he need to learn
how to piss standing up.

262
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,812
[sighs]

263
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:26,107
[panting]

264
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,612
-[Uncle Pete] Come on, nigga!
-[Donnie yelling]

265
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:32,321
Cornell, you go with your Uncle Pete.

266
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:33,657
[Uncle Pete] Stand up!

267
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,659
-And keep it down.
-[Donnie whimpering]

268
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:38,620
I got white folks in the front room.
I don't want to scare 'em off.

269
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,246
[door closing]

270
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,165
-[blows landing]
-[Uncle Pete grunting]

271
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:44,083
[muffled yells and screams]

272
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:53,384
[Donnie] Please! Please! I'm sorry!

273
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,552
[Donnie screaming]

274
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,652
[Stokes playing keyboard]

275
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:14,698
[breath trembling]

276
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:22,121
[inhales deeply]

277
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:38,805
[knuckles cracking]

278
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:42,892
[Luke] Even though I hate your ass...

279
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:46,187
I gotta admit...

280
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:48,940
you got talent.

281
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:52,443
You could have been somebody.

282
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,783
This is the first time I've ever seen
you flunky-free.

283
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:03,496
I guess now that you're untouchable...
you don't need them.

284
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:07,125
So, what?

285
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,211
You here to take me in or take me out?

286
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,379
Hey.

287
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:13,715
You called me.

288
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,635
And unlike you, I'm not a murderer.

289
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:20,013
I'm taking you in.

290
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:23,349
You're gonna sit down with Misty Knight
and you're going to confess...

291
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,059
to everything.

292
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:27,686
That's what you think's about to happen?

293
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,900
'Cause last time I checked...

294
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,444
you were no longer a sheriff...

295
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:39,407
Carl.

296
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:41,117
Hmm.

297
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:43,828
You ain't doing much of anything.

298
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:46,039
Carl Lucas.

299
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:50,001
[laughing] That's a square-ass name, man.

300
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:54,422
Oh, if my mama named me that,
I'd change my name to Luke Cage, too.

301
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:55,757
[chuckles]

302
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:00,428
See...

303
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:04,390
I don't know shit about going to prison.

304
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:07,601
But I figure if you escaped,

305
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:10,188
faked your death,
and all that other slick shit,

306
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,315
eventually it's bound
to catch up with you.

307
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,359
And you gotta go back.

308
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,238
You're not turning me in.

309
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,241
You wouldn't snitch.

310
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:23,451
Well...

311
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:26,955
there is honor amongst thieves.

312
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,584
But you ain't no thief.

313
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,046
Gave a speech at a church,

314
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:38,382
knocked down a few doors
in the projects and now...

315
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:41,010
you Harlem's Captain America.

316
00:21:41,928 --> 00:21:43,429
Nigga, please.

317
00:21:45,056 --> 00:21:46,640
How they gonna feel
about their folk hero

318
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:50,019
when they find out he ain't nothing more
than a goddamn criminal?

319
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,107
And you act like you better than me.

320
00:21:57,193 --> 00:21:58,527
You ain't better than me.

321
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:04,283
You got caught.

322
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,661
I was framed.
I'm innocent.

323
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:10,539
[chuckles] Aren't we all?

324
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:12,917
[laughing]

325
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:14,252
Hmm.

326
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:18,882
I'mma keep your little secret.

327
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:23,386
I've got use for bulletproof niggas.

328
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:27,806
I own you now.

329
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:32,145
And if you refuse...
then back to Seagate you go.

330
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:36,065
I'll charter the yacht my damn self.

331
00:22:38,234 --> 00:22:42,906
See, you thought I only had
a hand in one of the pies.

332
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:45,992
But I own the whole goddamn bakery, son.

333
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,505
[Stokes laughing]

334
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,573
Do you remember me...

335
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:27,616
from when I was a kid?

336
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:29,535
No.

337
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:33,789
Are you one of those that used to
follow Cornell around like a puppy?

338
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:34,915
Hmm.

339
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:37,793
I didn't have shit.

340
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:40,338
I grew up in the street.

341
00:23:41,422 --> 00:23:44,592
But the one name that always rang out...

342
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:46,970
was "Stokes."

343
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:49,930
You needed a Thanksgiving turkey?

344
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:53,101
Go see Mama Mabel Stokes.

345
00:23:53,184 --> 00:23:54,393
School clothes?

346
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:57,063
Mama Mabel Stokes.

347
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:00,483
Your old man put his hands on you?

348
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,776
See Mama Mabel Stokes...

349
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,073
and it would never, ever happen again.

350
00:24:07,156 --> 00:24:09,908
-Your point?
-Your family name meant something.

351
00:24:09,993 --> 00:24:13,829
Harlem's Paradise meant something.

352
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:18,751
Everyone from David Dinkins to Pappy Mason
showed that woman love.

353
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:22,130
But what does that family represent now?

354
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,259
A washed-up gangsterland?

355
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:31,305
An empty politician
who'll be lucky...

356
00:24:32,223 --> 00:24:34,100
at this time next year...

357
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:37,603
to be a greeter at the Harlem Hair Expo?

358
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,106
You don't talk to me like that.

359
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:43,067
I can talk to you any way I want.

360
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:47,363
Because you got no power to shut me up.

361
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:49,157
Do you like how it feels?

362
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:52,618
Being so powerless?

363
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,704
Being pushed around by other people?

364
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:01,044
What do you think?

365
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:02,920
I think...

366
00:25:04,797 --> 00:25:06,340
that when you get the nerve...

367
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:10,469
you're gonna be surprised...

368
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:13,013
at just what you're capable of.

369
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:38,789
[Claire] So that's how
you're gonna play this? You're running?

370
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:42,210
There's nothing I can do.

371
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:45,003
Enough with this defeatist bullshit.

372
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:46,589
What the hell is going on?

373
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,259
Cottonmouth knows about my past, Claire.

374
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:53,846
If I don't work for him,
he's gonna out me.

375
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,224
I'll go back to prison.

376
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,728
I've been through too much hell
to let that happen.

377
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:04,022
Yeah, I... I sympathize.
I really do.

378
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:05,816
But if you run...

379
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,985
you'll be running
for the rest of your life.

380
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:11,530
You think you're the first person
to tell me that?

381
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:13,991
I told Pop I was done running.

382
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:16,369
I stayed and he died.

383
00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:20,581
I didn't run when they came after Connie,
and they lost everything because of me.

384
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:21,832
Who's next?

385
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,751
I'm no good for anyone.

386
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:27,255
You can't take the blame
for everything that happened.

387
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:29,507
People need you.

388
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,551
Yeah, well,
sometimes I'm no good for people.

389
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:36,264
If people see that you're one of them,
that's good.

390
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:38,974
If you stand and fight,
they'll follow you.

391
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:42,019
If I go to prison,
who's gonna wanna follow me?

392
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:47,983
Half the people uptown have fathers,
cousins, uncles, brothers in prison.

393
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,569
You're no different than anybody else.

394
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:53,447
You get your wish.
You're not special.

395
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,410
Instead of running,
if you make a move

396
00:26:57,493 --> 00:27:00,120
and you take him down
once and for all?

397
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:02,331
You stop him,
you save this community,

398
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:04,124
and you free yourself.

399
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:06,877
Or...

400
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:16,970
[hip-hop music playing]

401
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:18,597
[Stokes] Turn up the bass.

402
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:32,110
I ain't one to apologize.

403
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,197
Then don't.

404
00:27:35,448 --> 00:27:37,366
But I was feeling myself a little earlier.

405
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,826
My bad.

406
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,745
I ain't mean to come at you like that.

407
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:46,334
You're under a lot of stress.

408
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,086
It's that nigga, Luke Cage.

409
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:51,922
I invited him over.

410
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,132
Had to let him know.

411
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,136
What'd you do?

412
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,556
I gave him the business.

413
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,933
All that Seagate shit you told me about.

414
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:05,644
What?

415
00:28:05,728 --> 00:28:09,732
Diamondback didn't want you to do that.
He's got plans for him.

416
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:12,360
Well, Diamondback ain't my daddy.

417
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:13,736
What's he know about Cage?

418
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,572
Did you spook him?
Is he gonna run?

419
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,741
He will fall in line.

420
00:28:21,327 --> 00:28:22,536
No doubt.

421
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:31,795
[winces] Sometimes pain is the only thing
that gets 'em going.

422
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:34,798
They can't do that to their wife
so they take it out on you.

423
00:28:36,634 --> 00:28:38,927
Where the hell have you been?

424
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,888
We needed you an hour ago.

425
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:45,226
Look at what happened.
Sister Boy didn't have any protection.

426
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:49,522
At least the bastard had enough sense
not to hit him in the face.

427
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:52,691
Maybe Sister needs to learn
how to throw her hands up like a brother.

428
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:54,610
[breathing heavily]

429
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:57,154
While you out there in the street
running around with your friends,

430
00:28:57,238 --> 00:28:59,365
my people in here getting hurt.

431
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:02,410
You better have a damn good reason
for not being here when I needed you.

432
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:04,537
Pete took me to an audition.

433
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,790
You expect me to believe
that an audition took six hours?

434
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,125
He stopped in Spanish Harlem.

435
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,921
Puerto Ricans?

436
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:19,092
Like that... Tato Lopez and Sal--

437
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,305
I heard Salvador.
That's who Pete talked to.

438
00:29:22,388 --> 00:29:23,639
Where were you?

439
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:27,768
[sighs] I kicked it
with Salvador's little brother, Domingo.

440
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,603
We watched <i>Video Music Box.</i>

441
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:31,021
What'd they talk about?

442
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,648
They were in the back room.

443
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:35,150
They were gone for a while.

444
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:39,322
You done good.

445
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:45,453
[sighs] You done good.

446
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,458
Hey. HD, Blu-ray,
I got all the best angles of the incident.

447
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,960
I got everybody in here.
You know you want to see it.

448
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:55,588
-People actually pay money for that?
-Yo.

449
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:58,674
-Yo. It's you! You one of them!
-No.

450
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:00,801
Come on, let's talk.
My man's got a RED,

451
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,387
next time you do something,
I could film you.

452
00:30:03,471 --> 00:30:04,680
We could both get paid.

453
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:06,849
For real. 4K for four K,
you know what I'm sayin'?

454
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:08,309
Hey, hey. I know you hear things.

455
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:13,897
Look, I hear and see everything.

456
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:17,234
The streets know what you've been up to.
Everyone's talking about it.

457
00:30:17,318 --> 00:30:19,027
But I ain't no snitch.

458
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:20,779
Not everyone deserves discretion.

459
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:22,781
I'm not asking you to get involved.

460
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:24,575
I'm not even asking you to speak.

461
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:27,328
I just need to borrow your eyes.

462
00:30:29,622 --> 00:30:30,748
All right.

463
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,376
Who you looking for?

464
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:36,712
Domingo Colon.

465
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,255
[speaking Spanish]

466
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:41,425
[groans]

467
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:47,431
[Luke] Domingo Colon!

468
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,268
I'm guessing that's you.

469
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:54,647
-[man grunting]

-[guns cocking]

471
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:09,453
I guess you guys
haven't heard about me, have you?

472
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:11,539
-Take him out.
-[guns firing]

473
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:12,831
[bullets ricocheting]

474
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:28,972
I'm about sick
of always having to buy new clothes.

475
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:34,061
[man screams]

476
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:44,738
[Luke] Where are the guns?

477
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:46,198
I don't know what you're talking about.

478
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,742
The ones you got back from Cottonmouth.

479
00:31:48,826 --> 00:31:50,327
The ones my friends died over.

480
00:31:51,412 --> 00:31:53,330
What, you think you can go after everyone?

481
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:54,957
I kinda do.

482
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,462
I can pick you up...

483
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:01,589
walk you over to the bridge...

484
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:04,382
and throw your ass in the Hudson.

485
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,389
And here's the thing.
It's not the fall that kills you.

486
00:32:11,474 --> 00:32:13,517
It's the impact against the water.

487
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:17,480
And when the water fills your lungs,
right before you black out,

488
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:19,022
you'll ask yourself...

489
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,818
"Why didn't I just give Luke Cage
what he wanted?"

490
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,196
The guns are downstairs.

491
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,159
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

492
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:47,551
You got this one in a double XL?

493
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:50,137
You'll like this.

494
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,017
I already know what he looks like, Bailey.

495
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,685
But aside from your board...

496
00:32:57,603 --> 00:33:00,856
this is the only photo of him.
Anywhere.

497
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,358
-Nothing else?
-Nope.

498
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,529
Why do you seem so excited by that?

499
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:10,323
[chuckles] 'Cause he is too damn clean.

500
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,118
You know, he's so clean, it's...
it's freaky.

501
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:14,286
In what way?

502
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:17,623
He has, uh, no credit cards.
No email address.

503
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:20,000
But he has a social security number.

504
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:23,796
Yeah, but no bank account.
No Facebook. No porn.

505
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:26,464
Why do you find no porn
so disturbing?

506
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:28,050
[scoffs]

507
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,803
This guy, he doesn't exist.

508
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,638
He was created.

509
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,932
He's the figment
of someone's imagination.

510
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:38,393
Who the hell is this guy?
And... and who made him?

511
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:40,813
Yeah. Who you telling?

512
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,816
But he's innocent.

513
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,693
-I give you my word.
-[woman on phone] <i>That may be.</i>

514
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,736
<i>But all this tension</i>
<i>is hurting the council</i>

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,780
<i>-and it's harming the party.</i>
-Yeah.

516
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:53,033
When will you make the announcement?

517
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:56,453
<i>Charlene will send a press release</i>
<i>at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.</i>

518
00:33:56,537 --> 00:34:00,082
<i>I'm going to have to ask you to resign,</i>
<i>effective immediately.</i>

519
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:01,542
I hear you.

520
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,800
You realize that I will fight this
with every ounce of my energy, right?

521
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:11,051
Right?

522
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,511
<i>It's painful for all of us,</i>
<i>but it's necessary.</i>

523
00:34:13,596 --> 00:34:14,638
<i>We have no other choice.</i>

524
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:16,056
-Okay.
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>

-Bring the car around.
<i>-Right away.</i>

531
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:50,423
[sniffles and exhales]

532
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,550
[Stokes playing keyboard]

533
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,728
On his deathbed...

534
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:48,231
what did you promise Buggy?

535
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,699
That you'd take care of me and...
our business.

536
00:35:57,825 --> 00:36:00,035
What the hell
are you talking about, Mabel?

537
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:03,538
I've always put this shit
before anything else.

538
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:11,004
You were my woman before you was his.

539
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,715
But I let that go.

540
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,843
You always protect your family.

541
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,054
No matter what.

542
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:21,098
So you betrayed me?

543
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,642
To some goddamn Puerto Ricans?

544
00:36:24,727 --> 00:36:25,978
This... [grunts]

545
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:34,236
This shit... should have been mine.

546
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,865
And you know it.

547
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:40,658
[sighs]

548
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,829
Now, Salvador and his brothers

549
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:46,498
have agreed to let us come in
on the ground floor.

550
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,252
We can own this whole goddamn city.

551
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:53,756
I already have everything I need.

552
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:58,093
Pigs get fat...

553
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,221
but hogs...

554
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:04,099
get slaughtered.

555
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:09,772
This was all about you.

556
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,109
You know what?

557
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:16,694
You always stay ready with a plan, bitch.

558
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:20,657
[smacks lips] So what is it?

559
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:32,961
[breath shuddering]

560
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:35,505
[gun cocks]

561
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,726
You don't have to do this, Cornell.

562
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:52,856
And all that talent you have?

563
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:03,033
What are you doing?

564
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,120
You're not built for this.

565
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:11,458
Why do you think
I pay for all those lessons, man?

566
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,838
You can be something
better than all of us.

567
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:21,759
You deserve this
for what you did to our family.

568
00:38:22,677 --> 00:38:24,512
What you did to me!

569
00:38:25,263 --> 00:38:26,723
Hey, Little May, don't...

570
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,893
What are you talking about?
[stutters] You laughed with me.

571
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,187
It was... it was a game.
[chuckles nervously]

572
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,396
Cornell.

573
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:37,192
I told you what to do.

574
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:40,988
Stand up straight.

575
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:44,449
And do it.

576
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:47,452
-[gun cocks]
-[Uncle Pete] Look at me.

577
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:50,998
[shouts] Look at me!

578
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:54,918
-Every time--
-[gun firing]

579
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:12,936
You know the rule, baby.
Family first.

580
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,188
Always.

581
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:19,817
Yes, ma'am.

582
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,413
You could have called first.

583
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:34,082
Oh, now I need an invite.

584
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,962
Can't imagine the kind of pressure
you're under.

585
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,008
Especially after that shit-show
of an interview.

586
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:45,843
You need to drop this Luke Cage shit.

587
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:48,680
Shut it down.
Get your head back in the game.

588
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:51,474
Don't lecture me about the game.
I was born to this shit.

589
00:39:53,226 --> 00:39:55,312
I finally got his bitch-ass in my pocket.

590
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:58,190
My party chairwoman called me tonight

591
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:00,483
to tell me I had to step down
from the council.

592
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:05,655
The fundraising for my complexes dried up
since you got arrested.

593
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:07,950
My reputation is in the shithole!

594
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:10,660
Maybe Madam Councilwoman
need to step off her high horse

595
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:11,869
and get her hands dirty.

596
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:13,705
We family, Cornell.

597
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:16,166
-Mama Mabel taught us that--
-Mama Mabel, Mama Mabel!

598
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:17,500
Go on with that shit.

599
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:22,965
All the things
I could've did with my life...

600
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:25,425
my music...

601
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:31,223
But who does she send
to that uppity-ass boarding school? You.

602
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:34,767
She put you in school
and forced me to run the streets.

603
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:36,394
You idiot.

604
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:40,023
She sent me away
to keep me away from Pete!

605
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:43,526
You know damn well
what that woman made me do.

606
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:46,113
I was 14 years old.

607
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,948
Uncle Pete betrayed us.

608
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:51,076
Uncle Pete was the only one
who ever had my back.

609
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:57,290
Mama Mabel was always
sheltering you, protecting you.

610
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:58,375
And for what?

611
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:01,836
All that education,
and you just as shady as me.

612
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:04,047
Me protected?

613
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:08,926
All I did your whole life was protect you!

614
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:13,056
Your junkie mama dropped you off
at Mabel's and never looked back!

615
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,849
Your daddy didn't want you!

616
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:19,104
Who was there changing your diapers?
Tending your needs?

617
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:20,522
Dealing with your whining?

618
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:24,026
I saw the way you used to flirt
with Uncle Pete when I was little.

619
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:26,194
[laughs]

620
00:41:27,195 --> 00:41:30,198
Running around half-naked all the time.

621
00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:31,992
You wanted it, Mariah.

622
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:34,661
You wanted it and you know it.

623
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,831
[Mariah screams] No!

624
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:41,418
[screaming] No!

625
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:48,466
-I did not want it!
-[groaning]

626
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,551
No!

627
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,762
You shut up!

628
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:56,933
-No, I didn't want it!
-[breathing heavily]

629
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:01,188
[grunting]

630
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:04,982
[bones crunching]

631
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:07,360
I didn't want it!

632
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:12,074
[gasps]

633
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:16,203
[Shades] Look at you.

634
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:25,503
You got the nerve...

635
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:30,967
and you stepped up.

636
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:33,470
I didn't... I didn't want this.

637
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:35,555
[Shades sighs]

638
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:36,848
[Mariah shudders]

639
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:38,891
Deep down...

640
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:43,313
[whispers] I think you did.

641
00:42:46,691 --> 00:42:47,900
First time...

642
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,321
is always the hardest.

643
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:01,206
Do you think...

644
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:03,583
they have rubber gloves in the kitchen?

645
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:08,004
Next to the dishwashing station.

646
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:12,092
[chuckles] That's a great idea.

647
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:19,807
Look what Luke Cage did to your cousin.

648
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:32,445
[Misty] Nice sweatshirt.

649
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,071
You box now?

650
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:37,367
What I do is more like CrossFit.

651
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,288
Always full of surprises.

652
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:45,500
And I hate that.

653
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,877
I don't know shit about you.

654
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:52,299
Nobody does.
And that's the problem.

655
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:58,930
But out of all the people in the world,
Scarfe went to you for protection.

656
00:43:59,013 --> 00:44:02,142
-Why?
-You'd have to ask him that.

657
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:05,187
How convenient for you that I can't.

658
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:08,105
Look, you texted me.
What do you want?

659
00:44:09,023 --> 00:44:10,983
You see that van parked over there?

660
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:13,069
I bet if you looked inside,

661
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:15,905
it's filled with all of those
Justin Hammer guns from the heist.

662
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:19,576
You think being a vigilante
makes this all right?

663
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:23,413
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you've caused?

664
00:44:23,496 --> 00:44:26,123
Misty, I know what you're going through.

665
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,292
[scoffs]

666
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:31,045
Finding out your partner was corrupt,
losing him...

667
00:44:31,128 --> 00:44:33,590
-It's messin' with your head--
-Do not talk to me

668
00:44:33,673 --> 00:44:35,925
[voice breaking]
like you know what I'm going through.

669
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,554
I'm gonna take care of Cottonmouth.

670
00:44:39,637 --> 00:44:42,056
You need to be ready
to move on him when I do.

671
00:44:44,267 --> 00:44:47,562
What's your big plan? Huh?

672
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:49,439
You gonna take over Harlem?

673
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:51,358
-I don't want Harlem.
-Then what do you want?

674
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:52,442
To be left alone.

675
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:54,319
If that's what you truly want...

676
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:58,990
then you will give me
all the information you have right now.

677
00:44:59,073 --> 00:45:00,157
On the record.

678
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:03,661
Tell me everything you have and end it.
Right here.

679
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:05,037
I'm not going to do that, Misty.

680
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:08,333
-Then that makes you an accessory.
-To what?

681
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:11,085
After what happened this morning,
you expect me to trust the system?

682
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:14,464
-The system is not your enemy.
-Really?

683
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:17,259
How's the system
been treating you lately?

684
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,677
I should kill Cottonmouth.

685
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,221
But I won't.

686
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:25,057
I want him to suffer.

687
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:28,728
He should know what it feels like
when your life is over,

688
00:45:28,811 --> 00:45:31,981
while everyone else's life goes on
as if you don't exist.

689
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:35,277
You sound like you're speaking
from experience.

690
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,070
You should trust me, Misty.

691
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:40,114
Like Pop did.

692
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,287
If you gave me one good reason why...
[scoffs]

693
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,538
I would.

694
00:46:00,176 --> 00:46:01,969
Anonymous tip?

695
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:06,140
Every cop needs a good snitch.

696
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,144
You're not out of the doghouse.

697
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:12,980
Not by a long shot.

698
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:23,908
-[sighs]
-[phone ringing]

699
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:31,499
Detective Knight.

700
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:35,587
What?

701
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:39,173
Oh, shit!

702
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:42,427
[Claire] Okay, so I'm just trying
to picture it in my head.

703
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:45,763
Was it mustard yellow?
Or canary yellow?

704
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:49,183
[Luke chuckles] It was all I could grab.

705
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:52,395
I couldn't go running around Georgia
looking like a runaway slave.

706
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:53,771
[Claire clicks tongue]

707
00:46:53,855 --> 00:46:56,190
[laughing] Oh, God.

708
00:46:57,108 --> 00:46:59,110
What did your father say
when he saw you?

709
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:02,739
Nothing.

710
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:06,493
He doesn't know I'm alive.

711
00:47:09,704 --> 00:47:11,330
He wouldn't want to see me anyway.

712
00:47:12,248 --> 00:47:13,583
I'm his...

713
00:47:14,751 --> 00:47:16,002
shame.

714
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:22,675
The last thing my father wanted to do
was to raise a black criminal.

715
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,637
He did everything in his power
to give me the kind of life

716
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,263
so that wouldn't happen.

717
00:47:28,305 --> 00:47:29,474
And yet...

718
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:31,809
I still went to jail.

719
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:35,062
That wasn't your fault.

720
00:47:35,146 --> 00:47:37,106
He didn't see it that way.

721
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:39,734
I tried to explain.

722
00:47:39,817 --> 00:47:42,987
I made calls.
I sent letters...

723
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:45,072
and he returned every last one of them.

724
00:47:45,156 --> 00:47:49,577
Then why let your father's last memory
of you be as a criminal?

725
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:51,287
A dead criminal.

726
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:54,331
I think he'd be very proud
to know who you are now.

727
00:47:58,335 --> 00:47:59,629
Anyway, thank you.

728
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:01,589
For what?

729
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:06,719
I can't imagine there are that many people
who know the saga of Luke Cage.

730
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:09,556
It means a lot that you trust me.

731
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:14,060
I didn't come to Harlem
to be a hero, Claire.

732
00:48:14,143 --> 00:48:16,270
I came because I needed time
to figure shit out.

733
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:17,522
So did I.

734
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:20,733
You're right.

735
00:48:21,651 --> 00:48:22,944
I can't keep running.

736
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:27,156
But I want you to know
what you're getting into.

737
00:48:28,866 --> 00:48:30,618
If Cottonmouth talks,

738
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:35,122
or if anybody connects the dots
that Luke Cage is Carl Lucas...

739
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:36,666
I go back to Seagate.

740
00:48:36,749 --> 00:48:39,293
You knew the risks
and you did it anyway.

741
00:48:39,376 --> 00:48:41,253
That's what makes you a hero.

742
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:44,674
Maybe I should get a mask after all.

743
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:46,551
[groaning] No.

744
00:48:48,385 --> 00:48:51,055
Too much in Harlem
happens in the shadows.

745
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:54,851
People fear what they can't see.

746
00:48:54,934 --> 00:48:57,770
And that's what makes you different.
They see you.

747
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,732
It makes them trust you.

748
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:12,785
Hey, Carl.

749
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:15,329
One Judas for another.

750
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:22,378
I may have a lawyer friend who can help.

751
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:23,880
Oh, really?

752
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:27,592
[gunshot]

753
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:33,765
Luke?

754
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:43,816
-Luke?
-[groans]

755
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,359
-[gunshot]
-Luke?

756
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:46,528
[Luke groans]

757
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:54,827
[yelling]

758
00:49:58,164 --> 00:50:00,207
[funk music playing]
