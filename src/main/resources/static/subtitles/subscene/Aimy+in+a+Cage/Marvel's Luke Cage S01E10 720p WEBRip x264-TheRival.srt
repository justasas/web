[Claire breathes deeply]

00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:28,007
-Do you have defib paddles?
-No.

5
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,675
Shit!

6
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,136
-What are you looking for?
-[panting]

7
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,805
Claire, what the hell are you doing?

8
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:37,057
Stand back!

00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:42,813

13
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:58,203
-That was reckless.
-Yeah.

14
00:01:58,287 --> 00:01:59,413
Sometimes you gotta
throw the science out

15
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:00,623
and go with what you know.

16
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:05,085
Okay, let's take this step by step
and think this through.

17
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:06,671
Once we get the shrapnel removed,

18
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:09,506
his healing factor and cell regeneration
should take care of everything else.

19
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:12,092
But what's next?
Temperature is right.

20
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:14,679
Uh, we have to raise the pH levels
so his skin reacts.

21
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:17,514
So what else will break down
abalone shell?

22
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:18,598
Salt water!

23
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:20,600
-Yeah. Yeah. Saline!
-Salt water.

24
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:23,062
Where do you have it?
Is that it?

25
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:26,523
[bubbling]

26
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,203
[grunts]

27
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:42,289
Let's get him out.
He has chills. That won't help him.

28
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:43,833
[Burstein] His temperature's
dropping quickly.

29
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:46,376
That's it.

30
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:48,838
It's not the pH mixture
that's the problem.

31
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,464
It's the temperature.

32
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:52,591
We need to turn it up.
All the way up!

33
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:54,384
[Burstein] No, no!
You don't know what you're doing.

34
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:56,470
Did you bring him all this way
just to kill him?

35
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:58,097
Think about what happened last time.

36
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,057
The temperature was the only thing
that you couldn't control.

37
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,141
-That's what you said.
-Yes.

38
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:03,602
But Albert Rackham was a racist asshole.
He was trying to kill Carl.

39
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,354
Okay. Well, maybe that redneck
was onto something.

40
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:07,439
Maybe the explosion is what did it.

41
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,775
We don't just need to heat up that soup.
We need to boil it!

42
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:12,402
You are about to do something
completely stupid.

43
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:13,988
[breathes deeply]

44
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:16,490
I wouldn't be a good scientist
if I let you do it alone.

-[valve opening]
-[air hissing]

46
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,456
All right.

47
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:26,625
More.

48
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,211
All the way up.

49
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:33,090
-[steam hissing]
-It's really heating up.

50
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,677
It's climbing.

[loud thud]

52
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:49,106
This is good.
This is very good.

53
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:56,446
[Burstein] You see?
[Claire] Yeah.

54
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,531
[steam hissing]

55
00:03:58,657 --> 00:03:59,950
I need a scalpel.

56
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:02,119
-Scalpel.
-Okay.

57
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,623
I'm seeing something.
This is really deep.

58
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:11,586
[alarm blaring]

59
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:14,589

Forceps.

61
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:26,268
Okay.

62
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,730
-How many more left?
-Two more pieces.

-[Luke breathing heavily]
-[Claire] Hey, got you.

00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,477
-We got it all.
-[breathing heavily]

71
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,271
We got it all.
You're gonna be okay.

72
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:12,815
[breathing heavily] We did it.

73
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:15,484
We did it.
You're gonna be fine.

74
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,121
[sighs]

75
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,082
Who the hell are you?

76
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:43,387
You took your sweet time,
Madam Councilwoman.

77
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,639
Why didn't you just come to me?

78
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:47,807
Power doesn't travel.

79
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:49,309
First rule of business...

80
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:50,936
and war.

81
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:54,439
You have no real power without me.

82
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,192
You could at least let Tony bring me.

83
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:59,819
I got lost three times
trying to find this damn place.

84
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:03,490
Sure, but then I would've had
to put a bullet in the back of his head.

85
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,077
No one comes here.
Period.

86
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,550
[Mariah] So this is the cure?

87
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:25,429
[Stryker] That's medicinal-grade,
heavy-duty RX stacked up right there.

88
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:26,972
Most definitely.

89
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:30,267
You wouldn't believe
how expensive these things are.

90
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,896
Untraceable, alien metal...
explosive.

91
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:37,983
You hit Luke Cage with one of these.

92
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,944
He's still alive.

93
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:42,737
If it didn't work,
what's the big deal?

94
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:47,076
Well, you don't need to kill God
with one shot to sell a weapon.

95
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,036
You just need to make him bleed.

96
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:52,831
That's all well and good,
but who's gonna be able to afford it?

97
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:55,917
What price can you put on peace of mind?

98
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,336
Don't sweat it.

99
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:02,466
The same Judas metal
can be broken down for mass production.

100
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:05,427
Each single bullet is less powerful,

101
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,307
but now you can put 'em in a machine gun
and let off a hundred of those bitches.

102
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,810
Mass production is where it's at.

103
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:17,064
I'm a politician.
I'm not a gun dealer.

104
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:19,483
Well...

105
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:22,111
what's the difference?

106
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,155
[blows]

107
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,075
Sell the fear.

108
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:30,702
Those people need to look
at that dashcam footage

109
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:33,663
and ask themselves if the world is ready

110
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:36,791
for bulletproof niggas
that eat cops for breakfast.

111
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,461
Black fear.

112
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:44,133
After abolition, it's how gun laws
got enacted in the first place.

113
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:48,678
[Mariah] You talk of laws.
Laws are bureaucracy.

114
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:52,141
The mayor can't even wipe his ass
without three different committees

115
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:55,477
to argue about the texture of the paper
and to pick the brand.

116
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,439
I'm gonna need time
to sell the cops on this,

117
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:00,857
even with the fear.

118
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,818
[chuckles] Ooh.
Well, you're out of time.

119
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:05,529
This shit starts right now.

120
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:07,990
What?

121
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:16,956
I hate to interrupt
your Isotoner moment, but...

122
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,542
this is serious.

123
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:22,087
I'm out of time and then?

124
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:24,589
A few illmatic deaths.

125
00:08:24,673 --> 00:08:26,383
Word of mouth spreads like wildfire.

126
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:27,926
No!

127
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,470
Luke Cage must be the focus.

128
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:33,140
Oh, he is my focus.

129
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:35,267
Always.

130
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:43,900
I've never seen anything like it.

131
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,111
-[Burstein] No one has.
-[sighs]

132
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,989
A man whose cells can regenerate
is a man who doesn't age.

133
00:08:51,158 --> 00:08:52,909
Do you know how valuable that is?

134
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:55,954
Luke's the only one?

135
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:57,997
Yes.

136
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:01,043
All the other subjects failed.

137
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,963
[sighs] There's a lot of work to be done.

138
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:07,632
A lot of good work.

139
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:09,718
How many more people will have to die?

140
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:13,638
They volunteered in exchange
for time off their sentences.

141
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,266
They knew the risks.

142
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:19,061
[sighs] I... I'm not a monster.

143
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:20,562
I never said you were.

144
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:23,440
[Luke sighs]

145
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,693
Hey.

146
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:29,028
Who are you?

147
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,909
Just kidding, Claire.

148
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:37,162
[Luke chuckling]

149
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:41,583
[child] I've got you!

150
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,168

151
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:48,548
-Hi, Ann. How are you?
-Morning, Officer.

152
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:56,890
[vendor] Hey, Officer Albini.
Got those socks your wife wanted.

153
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:57,974
Pink or red?

154
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,519
One set or more?

155
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:02,771
Yeah.

156
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:05,232
All right. Okay.

157
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:09,278
[glove powering up]

158
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:10,570
I'll be right back.

159
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:16,910
Can I help you?

160
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:19,496
My name is Luke Cage.

161
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,123
[grunts]

162
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:31,258
I'm Luke Cage!

163
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:32,551
<i>Luke Cage!</i>

164
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:34,803
[Chang] So that's what you saw?
[vendor] Yeah, that's what I saw.

165
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:36,513
Exactly like that.

166
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:39,224
That cat with the hoodie
punched that cop

167
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:40,975
and he flew back, like, 20 feet,

168
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,728
like he was shot from a cannon
or some shit.

169
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:46,731
So, uh, this was the guy you saw?

170
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:49,651
I didn't see his face.
But he laid him out.

171
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:52,028
-Then he said, "Luke."
-[Chang] Cage?

172
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:54,281
[vendor] Oh, I just heard "Luke."
Or maybe "Duke" or...

173
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,366
-Hey.
-[Misty] Hey, Bailey.

174
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,451
What do you think?

175
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:01,496
[sighs] Well, let's eliminate
the other possibilities.

176
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,499
We know Jackie wasn't hit by a car
or anything like that,

177
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,959
and this guy over here talking to Chang

178
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,126
isn't just making stuff up,

179
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:09,963
'cause that Luke Cage
dashcam video went viral.

180
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:13,383
Well, there are no impact wounds.

181
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:15,093
No glass, metal flakes or nothing.

182
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:17,429
The impact is localized and focused.

183
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:19,556
-I mean, he was hit--
-Punched.

184
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,765
He was punched...

185
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:23,518
and he flew back over 20 feet.

186
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:26,938
And the size of the hole
and the punch is consistent

187
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,565
with that of a human fist.

188
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:30,942
And the punch was so hard,
it bent back the shock plate

189
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,277
of his Kevlar vest.

190
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:36,865
Nanny said Cage?

191
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:40,201
The nanny is saying
she heard the suspect say "Cage."

192
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:42,078
But let's think about this.

193
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:46,791
A guy in a hoodie, punching a cop
and then saying his name?

194
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,711
If it was one of the goons
connected to Cottonmouth,

195
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:52,881
I could halfway see it, but...
a cop?

196
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:54,799
Don't forget, you know,
he's on the run.

197
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:58,094
You saw him fighting with us
on that dashcam vid.

198
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,973
Albini, he must've just spotted him
and he tried to take him down himself.

199
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:05,769
Jackie was never a hard charger.
I don't see it.

200
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,438
Who else has that kind of strength?

201
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:12,734
Look, in Harlem, black,
wearing a hoodie...

202
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:13,818
It's not rocket science.

203
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,571
What about the backpack
they said he was wearing, huh?

204
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,197
What about it?
Luke doesn't wear one?

205
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:20,033
Not usually, no.

206
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:22,911
So he switched it up that day.
And what's the big deal?

207
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:24,288
How does that eliminate him?

208
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:26,915
-The whole thing just doesn't smell right.
-I don't smell anything.

209
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:29,167
[indistinct arguing]

210
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,836
Right now, I smell rage.

211
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,756
Wait. Smith, Smith, Smith.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Smith.

212
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:37,926
This is Harlem.

213
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:41,388
And when a cop gets killed, heads roll.
That's just how we do.

214
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:43,264
You killed a cop!

215
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:45,559
I know you did it.

216
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:48,144
Now kids are getting jacked up
by the police.

217
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,021
What are you doing to my city?

218
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,732
It's not yours.
Never was.

219
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:56,445
Harlem is my birthright.
It's mine!

220
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:58,029
City council or not.

221
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:01,325
"When justice is done...

222
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:03,493
it is a joy to the righteous...

223
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:06,621
but terror to evildoers."

224
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:10,584
You quote the Bible
like you actually believe in God.

225
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:11,960
And you speak to me

226
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:14,838
as if you're not actually
in the presence of death.

227
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,132
Your way was taking too long.

228
00:13:18,216 --> 00:13:23,347
I killed two birds with one stone
by sticking a body on Luke Cage.

229
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,726
He's hiding somewhere
in the blessed aquarium,

230
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,686
so I turned the heat up.

231
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:32,814
Old Carl...

232
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:37,193
he's either gonna stand up
and defend his name...

233
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:41,072
or he's gonna run and hide,
like a bitch.

234
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:44,534
Either way, it doesn't matter.

235
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:47,412
I've got the gun to take him out.

236
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,248
You're completely out of control.

237
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:55,629
And you're not a real politician,
because if you were,

238
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:57,589
you'd flip this.

239
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:01,175
Get your Sharpton on.

240
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:05,472
Make this moment all about you.

241
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:10,101
-[Smith] I know the job, Inspector.
-Watch your tone, Jake.

242
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,686
That's not what I'm saying.

243
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,187
People are pissed.
I'm pissed.

244
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:15,690
-But we can't let this get out of hand.
-Goddamn right.

245
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:16,941
One of our own is dead.

246
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:20,362
<i>Cage is gonna pay for what he did.</i>
<i>We're gonna hit the streets hard.</i>

247
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:22,155
<i>We're gonna shake the ground.</i>
<i>Smoke him out.</i>

248
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:23,865
<i>That's how you find a roach.</i>
<i>You fumigate.</i>

249
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:25,950
[officer 1] Hold up!
[officer 2] Get him down.

250
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:29,245
[Ridley] <i>You're talking about</i>
<i>a community of people, not pests.</i>

251
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,123
Oh, come on, Inspector.
I'm from the South Bronx.

252
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,708
<i>I'm 28 years on the job.</i>

253
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:36,753
<i>I'm not some idiot who's afraid</i>
<i>of blacks and Hispanics.</i>

254
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:40,173
I said "police."
Where's Luke Cage?

255
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:41,758
Who? Wisdom is locked up.

256
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:43,927
He in C-74.
This is not his corner no more!

257
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:48,014
Not Wiz, fool! Cage, Luke Cage.
Where is Luke Cage?

258
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:50,767
-This is all about Luke Cage.
-Look, I want Cage as badly as you do.

259
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,769
He's at the center
of three active investigations.

260
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:54,604
But we need to be careful
about how we pursue this.

261
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:56,981
[Smith] <i>Caution is in the wind,</i>
<i>just like he is.</i>

262
00:14:57,065 --> 00:14:59,484
<i>-Our guys need results.</i>
-[Ridley] <i>Remember who you serve.</i>

263
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:01,235
All right, all right.

264
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:03,863
-I know one kid who knows Luke Cage.
-Who?

265
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:05,239
What's his name?

266
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:06,700
Do not light up Harlem behind this.

267
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:09,368
The good people in Harlem
have no problem with me.

268
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:10,620
Just the assholes.

269
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:12,288
[Ridley] You need to be responsible.

270
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:14,165
-Methodical.
-[Smith] That, we are.

271
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,585
[Ridley] Okay. Do it right.
No bullshit, no headlines.

272
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:18,252
You find him,
you take him down.

273
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:21,339
Anything on your boy?

274
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:23,425
Chang's taking the lead on that one.

275
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:27,762
I don't care.
Luke is your guy.

276
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:30,724
Look, I'm trying to figure out
who attacked me.

277
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,809
[Lonnie] I know where I'm goin'.
Why you gotta be so tight...

278
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:35,854
Why is you holding onto me like that?
Get up off me, man.

279
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:39,608
Until Luke Cage is in cuffs,
he's your priority, not your attacker.

280
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:40,817
Thanks.

281
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:50,535
Do you have a lotto winner yet?

282
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,789
We have the majority of the face.

283
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:58,292
Lot of angles,
but not a full composite.

284
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:02,255
[Bailey] I have a friend down in intel
on the task force.

285
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:05,424
-Maybe she could help.
-Ooh! "She"?

286
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:08,928
-I wanna talk to my mother.
-Your mother? [chuckles]

287
00:16:09,012 --> 00:16:11,389
You definitely ain't no hard rock.

288
00:16:11,473 --> 00:16:14,225
She's a lawyer.
Or she about to be.

289
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:19,939
Well, if you haven't done anything wrong,
you don't have any problem.

290
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:21,566
I don't.

291
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,486
But you've got about five problems,
far as I can tell.

292
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:26,655
-Like what?
-[scoffs]

293
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:28,615
I was on my way home from school.

294
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:30,784
Y'all picked me up with no PC.

295
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:33,161
I just got back from school.
Chess club.

296
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:35,163
Fifteen people can place me there.

297
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:37,749
And all I have in my bag
is a half-eaten Snickers bar.

298
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:41,252
-I want my phone call.
-Sure. After you answer some questions.

299
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,880
[scoffs] About what?
I don't bang and I don't hang.

300
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,257
I'm looking for Luke Cage.

301
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,842
-What about Luke?
-You seen him?

302
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:49,553
That's my man.

303
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:51,470
-He's a good dude.
-That "good dude" killed a cop.

304
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:52,847
There's no way he killed a cop.

305
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,724
-You're lying.
-You calling me a liar?

306
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:56,643
Luke Cage ain't kill no cop.
No way.

307
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:58,853
Look, unless you charging me
with something...

308
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:01,940
I ain't gotta say squat.
I'm leaving.

309
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:04,317
You better sit your ass down!

310
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,445
Luke Cage killed my training officer.

311
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:10,657
He had a wife, twins your age.

312
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,409
-Luke Cage ain't kill no cop.
-Look...

313
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,620
you better start talking.

314
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,376
Your hands are cold.

315
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:29,425
All you had to do
was take the shrapnel out?

316
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,511
It's like replacing
a burnt-out Christmas bulb.

317
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:36,933
You repair the circuit,
the whole thing lights up again.

318
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:38,267
It's miraculous.

319
00:17:39,185 --> 00:17:40,478
[sighs] It's no miracle.

320
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,731
Wouldn't you say so?

321
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:45,358
Miracles are good things.

322
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:47,861
What's good about me being here, huh?

323
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:50,905
All those prisoners who died.

324
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:52,574
Reva's murder.
For what?

325
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,450
Immortality.

326
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:00,665
What about those people you work for?

327
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,792
Do they know I'm here?

328
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,795
No. They barely keep tabs
on me anymore.

329
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:07,756
I don't believe that.

330
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,800
You're too valuable not to keep tabs on.

331
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:12,135
And you're not?

332
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:17,766
Wounds healed instantaneously
on the battlefield.

333
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:22,186
Concussions, major head trauma,
healed within hours.

334
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:24,856
You're at the center of that.

335
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:31,320
Cancer and HIV are next.

336
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,367
[sighs] That's a lot
for me to think about.

337
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,330
Right now, I just want my life back.

338
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:44,208
Well, take your time.

339
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:47,086
I'll be back.

340
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,255
Help yourselves
to anything you like in the fridge.

341
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:52,717
I don't trust him.

342
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,803
Me neither.

343
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:56,971
Reva's files.

344
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:01,267
It's unlocked and unencrypted.

345
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,727
What do you wanna know?

346
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:05,396
[sighs] Reva.

347
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,440
What she wouldn't tell me.

348
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:13,071
Maybe we should just take the zip drive
and be on our way before he gets back.

349
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:15,782
It might never be unlocked again.

350
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:18,242
I gotta know.

351
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:21,620
Which one?

352
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,915
[Luke] That one.

353
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:26,334
Tiara?
That's a weird name.

354
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:29,462
It's that thing I took off my head
after I escaped from the tank.

355
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:33,299
That's my prison number.

356
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:37,679
<i>Regarding subject Lucas, Carl...</i>

357
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:40,473
<i>He's interesting.</i>

358
00:19:41,182 --> 00:19:44,310
<i>He's intelligent.</i>
<i>There's a fire that burns within.</i>

359
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,521
<i>Even when he's not engaged,</i>
<i>you can always tell he's thinking.</i>

360
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:48,982
<i>He's educated.</i>

361
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:52,819
<i>He's not used to being incarcerated,</i>
<i>but he always carries himself with pride.</i>

362
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:53,987
<i>I think he's one to watch.</i>

363
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:56,072
Click seven.

364
00:19:57,699 --> 00:20:01,369
<i>Lucas' increasing loyalty</i>
<i>to Squabbles is an asset.</i>

365
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:05,790
<i>I think Rackham's assertion</i>
<i>that Carl wanting to protect his friend</i>

366
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:10,211
<i>will make him more willing to take part</i>
<i>in the fight trials is accurate.</i>

367
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,796
[Luke breathes heavily]

368
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,673
-Click 40.
-You sure, Luke?

369
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:19,888
<i>Subject Lucas is beginning to unravel.</i>

370
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:24,267
<i>He doesn't shave, he doesn't groom</i>
<i>and he lives to fight.</i>

371
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,895
<i>He's actually beginning to hurt people.</i>

372
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:29,397
<i>Physically, by far,</i>
<i>he's the best subject we've had.</i>

373
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,734
<i>But it remains to be seen</i>
<i>if he'll be cleared for stage three.</i>

374
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:36,905
<i>Every single subject</i>
<i>has died approaching that stage.</i>

375
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:39,157
<i>If anyone can do it, he can.</i>

376
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,366
[Luke sighs]

377
00:20:40,992 --> 00:20:42,535
[Burstein] You weren't supposed
to see that.

378
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,664
-So what you got?
-They all said the same thing.

379
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:48,917
Hoodie, Cage,
and they saw Jackie go flying.

380
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,502
No other leads?
We need something.

381
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:55,589
Chief is up my ass.
Social media is blowin' up.

382
00:20:55,673 --> 00:20:57,050
This whole job has gone tactical.

383
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:59,552
I don't want anyone from the Two-Nine
getting caught up in any bullshit.

384
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,429
Everyone in Harlem has a camera.

385
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:03,681
-Guess what? I got something.
-What?

386
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:06,392
Willis Stryker.
Facial recognition just made a match.

387
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,144
There's also a sealed juvenile record.

388
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:11,105
That's it?
Why is it sealed?

389
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:12,899
[Bailey] It's past
the statute of limitations.

390
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:14,901
Okay. So how can I get into it?

391
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:17,195
Well, if you find a date
and a courthouse,

392
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:19,322
and there was some press,
you might get lucky.

393
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:21,407
[Lonnie] Hey! Stop!
Hey! Stop, stop!

394
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,575
-[man grunting]
-What in the hell is that?

395
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,786
[officer 1] Hands off! Get him off!
[officer 2] Dorsey! Dorsey!

396
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:26,745
[Dorsey] Where is he, huh?
[officer 2] Get off him, Dorsey!

397
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,247
Where is he, punk? Huh?

398
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:30,499
Why are you protecting him, huh?
Just tell me where he is.

399
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,418
[Ridley shouting]
What the hell is going on?

400
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,050
What the hell did you just do?

401
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:41,803
[Luke breathing heavily]

402
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:45,431
We were trash.

403
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,516
You knew no one would care
if we were gone.

404
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,186
That was the whole point
of Reva's therapy sessions.

405
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:53,231
To separate the trash from the triumphant.

406
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:57,735
[stutters] To pick out those subjects
that were most psychologically ready

407
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:00,571
-to survive the process, Carl.
-Stop calling me that!

408
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,281
I'm Luke.

409
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:03,950
Carl died at Seagate.

410
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:06,202
[Burstein scoffs]

411
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:10,456
What, you're still pining
like a lovesick puppy for Reva?

412
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:11,540
Please.

413
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,542
She lied to everybody.

414
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,129
That was her job.

415
00:22:16,212 --> 00:22:18,172
She lied to you about her involvement.

416
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:20,133
I promise I'll explain it all.

417
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:23,844
She lied again when she erased
both of you from existence.

418
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:26,055
Thank you for saving my life.

419
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:28,432
Thank you for changing mine.

420
00:22:29,392 --> 00:22:30,643
She knew the stakes.

421
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,938
[sighs]

422
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:35,023
You're...

423
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:38,526
You're the future, Carl.

424
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,445
You're a walking fountain of youth.

425
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:53,207
My name is not Carl.

426
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,793
I'm Luke Cage!

427
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,086
[grunting]

428
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,550
[yelling]

429
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:29,618
You're never gonna do this
to anyone else ever again.

430
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,246
How's that for stakes?

431
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,168
-[sighs]
-Claire.

432
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,212
Claire, you're brilliant.

433
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:42,966
You're not even trained.
Imagine the things I could teach you.

434
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:47,220
Talk to Luke.
Tell him what he's throwing away.

435
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:48,972
He's my friend.

436
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:52,558
And that's why you'll never see him again.

437
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:54,810
Or this.

438
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,398
You didn't say
I would never see you again.

439
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:03,861
Be thankful I'm not the one
with the powers...

440
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:08,907
because I'd kill you if you did
half the shit that you did to him to me.

441
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:11,494
Not just ruin your barn.

442
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:14,955
[breathing heavily]

443
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:51,200
Carl Lucas is Luke Cage.

444
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,579
-Hey. I found out that Willis--
-It's gonna have to wait.

445
00:24:55,663 --> 00:24:57,040
Officers.

446
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:59,917
I am releasing these to the media

447
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,796
in the next 15 minutes
so they can see the contrast.

448
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:06,465
Don't make a bad situation even worse,
Councilwoman.

449
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:08,301
You'd think a sister in charge
would change things.

450
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:09,427
But you're blue,

451
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,679
which makes you just as white
as anybody else!

452
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:13,639
Luke Cage is a suspect
at large for murder,

453
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:14,890
a number of other crimes.

454
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,643
Luke Cage may be bulletproof,
but my boy isn't.

455
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,270
Can't y'all understand that?

456
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:21,314
Patty, Patty, save your words.

457
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:24,024
-The only thing they understand is action.
-[Ridley] Mariah.

458
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:26,819
Detective Dorsey has been arrested,
suspended without pay.

459
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,112
We are taking formal steps to charge--

460
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:30,989
No! Not enough, Priscilla.
Not today.

461
00:25:32,075 --> 00:25:35,536
The death of that officer at the hand
of that super-freak was bad enough.

462
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,621
But to beat down a child?

463
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,999
Means you're not doing your job.
Come on.

464
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:42,668
Patricia.

465
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:47,590
-How's Lonnie?
-Keep my son's name out of your mouth.

466
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:57,600
He's at Frederick Douglass Hospital
right now, getting checked out.

467
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,018
Y'all gonna pay for this shit.

468
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:02,355
Until you capture Luke Cage,

469
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:05,483
and apologize to the people of Harlem,
we will...

470
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:08,861
-bring this city to its knees.
-[crowd agreeing]

471
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:15,075
All over Harlem, young black and brown men
are being slapped around by an NYPD

472
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,162
too scared to do something
about Luke Cage.

473
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:20,331
-[crowd agreeing]
-And because young Lonnie Wilson,

474
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:21,874
our brother...

475
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:24,502
just had the misfortune of knowing this...

476
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:27,380
supposed superhero turned super-menace...

477
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:31,634
[on TV] <i>he was beaten in custody</i>
<i>like it's 1956.</i>

478
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:36,555
<i>Any time one of Harlem's finest is killed,</i>
<i>we all suffer.</i>

479
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:40,643
But let's make sure that that outrage
is pointed in the right direction.

480
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:45,689
I encourage the NYPD
to effectively arm themselves

481
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:48,609
to protect the public, not to harass

482
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:51,820
young brothers and sisters,
<i>hermanas y hermanos,</i>

483
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:54,907
who are the lifeblood and the future
of our community.

484
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,328
And I encourage that community
to rally with me at Harlem's Paradise.

485
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:03,081
We will discuss our next plan
of non-violent action.

486
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,833
Luke Cage must be found.

487
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,419
-He must be stopped.
-[crowd agreeing]

488
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:10,714
-This must never happen again.
-[crowd agreeing]

489
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,177
[Ridley] Yes, Chief.

490
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:20,808
Yes, sir.

491
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,729
-[Ridley sighs]
-Do you have time to talk now?

492
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:28,399
About what? About Mariah's little
"I Have a Dream" moment outside?

493
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:31,485
About all the kids getting beaten up
by cops and the videos going viral?

494
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:33,904
Something's off about this
and you know it.

495
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,950
Why the hell would she hold that rally
at Harlem's Paradise?

496
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:41,245
Shouldn't she be too spooked to even go
inside after what happened to her cousin?

497
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:45,999
Cage did not kill Officer Albini.

498
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,794
Nothing settles down until Cage
is in the box. We need to talk to him.

499
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:51,672
-And I need to talk to Willis Stryker.
-Who is Stryker?

500
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:55,426
I get the feeling that he is connected
to everything that's been going on.

501
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:58,679
Cage, Cottonmouth, all of it.

502
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:00,723
You'll need proof.

503
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:02,933
I'm on it.

504
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,319
[exhales] You swam that whole way?

505
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,738
Doesn't seem as far away now.

506
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,282
Hmm.

507
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:21,910
[Luke] You ever hold
someone in your arms,

508
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:24,247
hear them breathing against your chest,

509
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,206
and you're in one emotional place...

510
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,084
and they're in another?

511
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,507
And you have absolutely no idea
what they're thinking.

512
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,925
It's called having a boyfriend.

513
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:38,302
[Luke chuckles softly]

514
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:47,102
Reva lied to me.

515
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:49,813
She helped you to disappear...

516
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,525
because she was protecting you.

517
00:28:53,526 --> 00:28:56,612
-It couldn't have all been a lie.
-You don't understand.

518
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:58,406
That woman?

519
00:28:58,489 --> 00:28:59,740
The idea of her...

520
00:29:00,783 --> 00:29:01,867
her smell...

521
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,495
That was the only thing
that kept me sane at Seagate.

522
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:06,789
That's what's eating me up inside.

523
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:10,042
I don't think I really knew her at all.

524
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:13,421
You still love her.

525
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:15,339
I love...

526
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:18,717
the idea of Reva.

527
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:22,930
But not her, specifically.

528
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,766
Not anymore.

529
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:30,396
[sighs]
I should just go, you know?

530
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:34,066
I should just turn around
and walk away from all this shit.

531
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,651
[scoffs]

532
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:39,488
I wish you would've told me that,
what, 800 miles and 28 hours ago?

533
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:43,033
I could have got some sleep.

534
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,496
We've come too far.

535
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,624
We're both in this now.

536
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:52,668
Together.

537
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:56,254
Look, it's...
It's a lot for me to take in all at once.

538
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:58,674
[Claire sighs]

539
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:00,926
I just need a plan, that's all.

540
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:06,390
Willis hates me,
and I just need to figure out why.

541
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,560
This was all so long ago.

542
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,106
Savannah's the place
where all those answers are.

543
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:16,525
The past is present for him.

544
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:21,614
Whatever wounded him
has not cooled off at all.

545
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:24,325
I trusted Reva...

546
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,244
and I was wrong.

547
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:30,789
How can I trust you?

548
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,001
I never back down from a fight.

549
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:37,212
Even if you don't trust me...

550
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:40,424
trust the fighter in me.

551
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:45,095
Fair enough.

552
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,155
I'm driving.

553
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,079
About time.

554
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,934
-[switch clicks]
-Ah.

555
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:33,226
[whirring]

556
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,462
-[boxers grunting]
-Domingo.

557
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:05,509
-Do I know you?
-No... but I know you.

558
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:08,178
I've seen your rap sheet.

559
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:11,014
How do you have time to commit crimes
and train boxers?

560
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:14,477
I guess you must have to be
good at multitasking.

561
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,186
-[chuckles]
-Yeah.

562
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:21,399
I like boxing.

563
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:23,068
You know what Mike Tyson once said?

564
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:26,530
Uh, Mike Tyson mumbles too much
to say much of anything.

565
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:28,198
No, Mike is great.

566
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:33,454
He said, "Everyone has a plan...

567
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:34,872
until they get hit."

568
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:37,500
Well, sometimes you have to take a hit...

569
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,210
before you can punch back.

570
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:44,297
-And I know how to counterpunch.
-Mmm.

571
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,137
Who's this?

572
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:52,848
You tell me.

573
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:55,643
Look, I saw you with Cottonmouth.

574
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,269
I heard about your little beef.

575
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,855
Beef? No beef.

576
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:02,900
All I know is, Cottonmouth dies,
this guy shows up,

577
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:05,443
and suddenly everything changes
all over again.

578
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:07,655
Who is he?

579
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:11,575
You come alone?

580
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:13,577
Why are you asking me all this?

581
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:17,372
Because everybody
is so focused on Luke Cage,

582
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:21,669
nobody's talking about the fact
that the heads of the Jamaican, Haitian,

583
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:24,462
and Cuban crime families
have all gone missing.

584
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:27,382
I'd go to Harlem's Paradise.

585
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:30,343
It's under new management.

586
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,475
[speaking Spanish]

587
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:41,229
[boxer grunts]

588
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,697
[Claire] So this is it?

589
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,114
It used to be.

590
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:54,117
My grandfather built that sign.

591
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:57,204
He founded this church
after he came home from World War II.

592
00:33:58,539 --> 00:33:59,873
He was a Red Tail.

593
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:03,669
-Tuskegee Airman.
-Nice.

594
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:07,881
He wanted a sign that was bold...
just like the tail of his plane.

595
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:12,052
So what happened here?

596
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,387
Why is everyone gone?

597
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:16,640
I don't know.

598
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,326
[Etta] James...

599
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:39,204
Carl needs you now more than ever.

600
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:40,998
How can you be here for your community

601
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:43,834
and every other family
in the congregation,

602
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,543
but you're never here for us?

603
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:49,172
Stay out of grown folks' business.

604
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:50,591
[young Luke] Yes, ma'am.

605
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:53,927
Mama?

606
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:56,429
Carl, come on.
I'm taking you to practice.

607
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:58,682
[young Luke] All right.
Let me say goodbye to Daddy.

608
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:00,183
I'll be waiting in the car.

609
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:03,687
-Mrs. Lucas.
-Ms. Stryker.

610
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:38,305
[man laughing in distance]

611
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:42,017
[people conversing in distance]

612
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,733
[books clatter]

613
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,115
Carl.

614
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,953
[Etta] Look, heffa.
You're not fooling nobody.

615
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:03,121
You're little more than his hoe,
and we both know it.

616
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:05,666
He lied to me too, Etta.
You think we're the only ones?

617
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:07,209
You're through.
And you're done.

618
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:10,503
Are you kidding me?
Come at me again, bitch,

619
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,297
and I won't hold my tongue
about Willie anymore.

620
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,092
You say a word,
and the checks stop coming.

621
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,635
He'll get pulled from Lieber Academy
so quick, your head--

622
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,804
[Claire] Luke?

623
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:27,395
Luke, are you all right?

624
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:29,606
[breathing heavily]

625
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,237
Willis Stryker...

626
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,529
is my brother.

627
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,248
I never wanted to accept it, but...

628
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,541
it's real.

629
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,669
-They never told you?
-No, no.

630
00:36:51,754 --> 00:36:53,130
No, no one dared.

631
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:55,465
[breathing heavily]
It was all the little things.

632
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,926
All the sideways glances during service.

633
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,263
My mother hating on Willis,
even after he won the city championship.

634
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:03,974
All my dad's convention trips with Dana.

635
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:06,268
He was always so protective of her.

636
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:08,395
Who's Dana?

637
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:12,149
His secretary.
Willis's mother.

638
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:15,318
He was two years older than me.

639
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:18,947
For years, my mother couldn't conceive,
and then one day, I...

640
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:20,490
I came along.

641
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:24,119
That's why everybody called me
the miracle baby.

642
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,080
I hated that spotlight.

643
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:29,416
They should have told you.

644
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:32,585
Had Willis not framed me,
I wouldn't have gone to Seagate.

645
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:34,587
No Seagate, no powers.

646
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:36,965
Reva would still be alive.

647
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,717
How is that your fault?

648
00:37:39,802 --> 00:37:43,430
It's not my fault.
My father started this whole thing.

649
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:48,811
Willis hates me because
my father hates the idea of him.

650
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:51,438
[chuckles]

651
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:54,524
What he doesn't realize is that my father
never really liked me very much either.

652
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:58,278
So where is this grand Reverend Lucas?
Why does he get a pass?

653
00:37:58,361 --> 00:37:59,696
Doesn't matter.

654
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:03,951
Diamondback is after everything
and everyone that I've ever cared about.

655
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:06,203
So it stops with me.

656
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:10,082
I am my brother's keeper...

657
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,335
whether I like it or not.

658
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,047
It's on me.

659
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,513
[indistinct chatter]

660
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:31,854
[crowd chanting] This stops now!
This stops now!

661
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:35,357
This stops now!
This stops now!

662
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,900
This stops now!

663
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:40,028
Yes, it does.
Yes, it does.

664
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:43,073
Oh, it warms my heart
to see you here this evening.

665
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:44,574
[man] Good to see you, too.

666
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:48,578
My cousin, Cornell Stokes...

667
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:52,207
was murdered right where you're standing,

668
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,877
and it pains me to even be here.

669
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,545
-But it's necessary.
-[crowd agreeing]

670
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,009
Luke Cage murdered my cousin,

671
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,887
and I am not afraid to speak out about it.

672
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,931
The man is a liar,
he is a menace,

673
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:13,270
and as long as he is running around loose,
hiding amongst us, no one is safe.

674
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:14,396
-[crowd murmurs]
-[man] Ain't none of us safe!

675
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:17,900
Now, I know what brought us
here tonight.

676
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:22,905
The police putting their hands
on yet another young black man.

677
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,072
It's wrong.

678
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:26,283
-It is wrong.
-[crowd agreeing]

679
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:29,036
No doubt about that.
But...

680
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:32,622
we cannot lose focus here.

681
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:37,920
A cop was killed
by this super-powered menace.

682
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:42,424
And our young brother was hurt
during their witch-hunt.

683
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,717
Brothers and sisters...

684
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:47,679
our world has changed.

685
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:52,935
-We have new threats, new terrorists.
-[man] Yeah.

686
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:56,146
That woman over in Hell's Kitchen
snapped a man's neck

687
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:58,773
because he was mind-controlling her.

688
00:39:58,856 --> 00:39:59,857
[crowd murmuring]

689
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:03,987
We got a bulletproof murderer
on the loose in Harlem

690
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:08,909
with his own twisted sense of justice,
putting us all in harm's way.

691
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:10,160
[crowd murmuring]

692
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:11,578
Do I trust the cops?

693
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:15,165
-[man] No. Hell no.
-Not blindly.

694
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:19,920
-[crowd agreeing]
-We need protection from Luke Cage.

695
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:24,716
We need protection from
the other powered people like Luke Cage.

696
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:26,884
He is the real threat!

697
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,553
[crowd agreeing]

698
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,810
We need to arm our men and women in blue

699
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:38,355
so that they can protect us.

700
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:39,856
Truly protect us

701
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,569
and never confuse us
with those who are the real threat.

702
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,363
-[crowd cheering]
-You stay strong!

703
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:54,746
I know you will stay strong

704
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:57,457
and I know you will welcome
to this mike right now,

705
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,960
-Reverend John Pope!
-[crowd cheering]

706
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:07,884
Emails. Make sure you get emails
and a head count.

707
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:11,138
-[man] Consider it done, ma'am.
-Oh! I didn't know you got off work.

708
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:13,431
-Hey. How you doing?
-[laughs]

709
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:15,392
-[John] Because you are here.
-Excuse me.

710
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:16,977
[John] That means that you care.

711
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,520
Are you that desperate?

712
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:20,230
What do you mean?

713
00:41:20,313 --> 00:41:22,690
You're just using that kid
to stay politically viable

714
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:26,319
even though Brenda's still gonna force
your crooked ass off the city council.

715
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,446
I don't know what you're talking about.

716
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,824
You know damn well Luke Cage
didn't kill that poor cop.

717
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:34,702
Everyone knows he's the one
who busted up Cottonmouth's--

718
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:36,913
-Cornell.
-Cottonmouth's operation

719
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,373
at Crispus Attucks

720
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:42,710
and that $7 million in blood money
that came out of your office.

721
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:48,258
Cornell dies,
Brenda and the rest of the party back off

722
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:50,302
and your popularity surges.

723
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:53,888
But I see right through you, Mariah.

724
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:56,558
How dare you.

725
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:58,851
You can't be trusted.

726
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:03,023
Who needs trust when you have power?

727
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:04,774
[crowd cheering and applauding]

728
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:20,290
Yo, Luke.

729
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,796
{\an8}I won't say nothing.

730
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:33,678
You're not going, are you?

731
00:42:36,514 --> 00:42:38,141
Why not?

732
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:41,103
Nothing like a warm welcome
from Mariah Dillard.

733
00:42:45,982 --> 00:42:47,900
[crowd cheering and applauding]

734
00:42:47,984 --> 00:42:51,196
Now, he calls himself a friend.

735
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:54,241
-[woman] He ain't my friend!
-But by his actions...

736
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:57,034
we know that this is false.

737
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,995
-[crowd agreeing]
-Now, can you say "false"?

738
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,455
[crowd] False!
[John] Say it again.

739
00:43:00,538 --> 00:43:02,039
[crowd] False!
[John] Mean it this time!

740
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:03,416
[crowd] False!
[John] Yes!

741
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,752
-False! Yeah.
-[crowd applauding]

742
00:43:05,835 --> 00:43:07,295
Now...

743
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:11,341
Luke Cage has a lot to prove to us.

744
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:15,720
What is he?
Where does he come from?

745
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:17,972
And will more come like him?

746
00:43:19,056 --> 00:43:24,271
And does his presence here mean
that we will be endangered? Endangered...

747
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:25,938
by superhuman threats?

748
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:28,525
Now, I want you...

749
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,527
to follow me this evenin'.

750
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:32,779
From the bottom of your heart.

751
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:34,864
No, no, no, not from the top,
or the middle.

752
00:43:34,947 --> 00:43:36,283
From the bottom of your heart.

753
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:38,285
-This...
-[crowd] This...

754
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:39,411
-I'm gonna go upstairs.
-[John] Stops!

755
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:41,078
[crowd] Stops!
[John] Now!

756
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:43,248
-You sure that's a good idea?
-[John] This stops now!

757
00:43:43,331 --> 00:43:44,874
Misty's gonna need backup.

758
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:46,918
[crowd chanting] This stops now!

759
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:48,920
This stops now!

760
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:50,422
Be careful.

761
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:52,549
[crowd continues chanting]

762
00:43:52,632 --> 00:43:54,259
Always.

763
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:55,552
You're so corny.

764
00:43:55,635 --> 00:43:58,721
[crowd chanting] This stops now!
This stops now!

765
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:01,933
This stops now!
This stops now!

766
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:03,601
[chanting continues]

767
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:21,619
[chanting continues]

768
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:47,854
[Stryker] Hey, baby.

769
00:44:47,937 --> 00:44:50,147
-You miss me?
-Put your hands where I can see 'em!

770
00:44:50,232 --> 00:44:51,274
You're under arrest.

771
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,735
Nah. Not today.

772
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:56,279
-[grunts]
-[crowd screaming]

773
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:01,409
[grunting]

774
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:05,247
That's Luke Cage!
He's here!

775
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:14,714
[man] There he is.
Get him!

776
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,187
-[grunts]
-[Misty breathing heavily]

777
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:32,231
[crowd screaming]

778
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,902
[rapid gunfire]

779
00:46:00,176 --> 00:46:01,386
[softly] I got you.

780
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:03,305
You hear me?

781
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:05,307
I got you.

782
