00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:14,017
[theme music playing]

2
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:37,433
[Pop] They lose 65 games only to end up
with the fourth pick in the draft.

3
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:39,560
Did they tank that shit on purpose?

4
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:42,230
Read the words, Pop.
Right there on the wall.

5
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:45,191
Brother's got a point, Henry,
much as I hate to admit that.

6
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:46,817
That's right.
Pay up.

7
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,944
You're right, you're right.
I shouldn't have cursed.

8
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:52,615
-My bad, Lonnie.
-It's okay, Pop.

9
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:53,699
[Pop chuckles] All right.

10
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:55,993
What's their record
this year, anyway, like?

11
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:57,537
[Pop] 17 and 65.

12
00:01:58,288 --> 00:02:01,124
You know that Russian kid they drafted?
He better be good.

13
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:02,458
He's Latvian.

14
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:04,835
What they need to do
is fire Phil Jackson.

15
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:07,297
[Pop] Wait a minute, Phil Jackson
ain't out there playing no more.

16
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,132
Phil Jackson overrated, B.

17
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:11,259
Anybody can win with Jordan and Kobe.

18
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:14,011
Phil ain't no Pat Riley.

19
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:16,181
-[all groaning]
-Aw, Riley, again?

20
00:02:16,264 --> 00:02:17,307
-[Pop] Yeah.
-Here we go.

21
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,933
[Chico] I mean, Pacino...

22
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:21,394
Now, I get why that white boy
makes your free haircut list.

23
00:02:21,477 --> 00:02:27,066
<i>The Godfather</i> and <i>Scarface</i> guaranteed
that man an eternal ghetto pass.

24
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,193
<i>-Carlito's Way,</i> too.
-[Shameek] Mmm-hmm.

25
00:02:28,276 --> 00:02:29,985
[Chico] But Pat Riley?
[Pop] Yeah.

26
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,029
[Chico] Why does Pat Riley
get so much love in this shop?

27
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:35,908
Right. Even punk-ass Derek Fisher
got more rings than Pat Riley.

28
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:37,076
Uh-uh.

29
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,286
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:41,539
'Cause the Knicks played like men
when Pat Riley was head coach.

31
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:43,791
Oakley and Ewing went hard in the paint.

32
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:46,294
Plus Anthony Mason and John Starks?

33
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:49,004
Drive the lane,
you might go home in a body bag.

34
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:50,631
All right, now I heard that.

35
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:52,383
Later with all that Instagramming,

36
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,844
"let's all max contract
on the same team together" bullcrap

37
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:56,762
-passing as competition nowadays.
-[all laughing]

38
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:58,514
[Pop laughs] Mmm. Yeah.

39
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:01,684
[scoffs] Didn't Pat Riley sign
those Instagram dudes down in Miami

40
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:03,519
when he became the GM?

41
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:05,145
[scoffs] Maybe.

42
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:09,359
But King James is the truth.
LeBron can ball.

43
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:11,236
[Pop chuckles] Yeah.

44
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,571
Now pay up, Luke.
You said "bullcrap."

45
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:16,073
"Bullcrap" ain't a curse, man.
I don't curse.

46
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:18,326
-[imitating Luke] "I don't curse."
-[laughs]

47
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:19,952
You don't cut hair either, negro.

48
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:23,122
Like, really,
what do you do up in here, bruh?

49
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:25,500
I sweep hair, Shameek.

50
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,419
I also mop, I wash the towels,

51
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:31,297
and I make sure that plate glass window
stays spotless.

52
00:03:31,381 --> 00:03:34,550
It's called work.
Something you would never understand.

53
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:35,718
[scoffs]

54
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:39,972
<i>Slam Magazine...</i> Hmm?

55
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,393
Coaches used to live up
in this piece, son.

56
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,771
Kevin Ollie got a shape-up
right there from Pop's.

57
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:48,063
Pitino, too.

58
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:52,818
Stylin' and profilin',
that's my work.

59
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:54,820
-See what I'm sayin'? Yeah?
-Yeah. Tell him.

60
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:56,364
For real?

61
00:03:58,073 --> 00:03:59,784
Doc Rivers, uh,
call you yet, Shameek?

62
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:01,786
[chuckling]
Whoa, all right. Play nice.

63
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:04,747
-You can't even afford a haircut.
-[Shameek] Hey, you know what?

64
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,707
-I'm about sick and tired of...
-[Luke] What?

65
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:10,420
Hmm?

66
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:12,129
You sick and tired of what?

67
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:18,761
About sick and tired of the Knicks
losin' all the time, man!

68
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,971
-[Shameek sighs]
-[chuckles]

69
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:22,473
[chuckling]

70
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:25,184
You got some hair, too, right there.

71
00:04:25,268 --> 00:04:27,687
-I'm not finished.
-Yes, you are.

72
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,896
[door opens and bell dings]

73
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:32,775
-Hey, Counselor.
-Aw, don't jinx me, Pop.

74
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:35,069
I haven't even passed the bar yet.

75
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,738
-Oh, you will.
-[chuckles]

76
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:40,450
Lonnie, you got Kumon tonight.
Let's go.

77
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,827
Come on, boy, you heard your mama.

78
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,994
Let's get moving.

79
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:46,246
Don't make me repeat myself.

80
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:48,291
[chuckles]

81
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:52,837
Hey, Luke.

82
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:55,423
What time you get off?

83
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:01,053
I got another job
I go to right after I leave this one.

84
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:05,057
[sighs] Black man working.
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

85
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,186
[inhales] Well, we should at least
try to get some coffee some time.

86
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,368
Maybe you'll need a lawyer one day.

87
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:26,954
Hopefully, you'll have some cards by then.

88
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:28,331
[chuckles]

89
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,417
[Pop chuckles] Hey.

90
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:33,628
Be sure and tell Bessie I said hey.

91
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:35,463
-I will.
-Mmm-hmm.

92
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:46,516
How's a woman that fine
with a briefcase

93
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:48,809
gonna throw it at a brother with a broom?

94
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:50,853
That's what you don't get, youngin.

95
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:52,730
Either you have it or you don't.

96
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:54,857
-[chuckling]
-Oh, I know I got it.

97
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,151
Shit. [indistinct muttering]

98
00:05:57,234 --> 00:06:00,112
[Pop] Whoa, whoa. See the words...
right there on the wall.

99
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:02,615
-[scoffs]
-Hmm?

100
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:05,451
-[Pop] Pay up.
-Come on, Pop.

101
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:07,412
[dryer whirring]

102
00:06:22,552 --> 00:06:24,970
[Pop] Huh, there you go again.

103
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,266
I shook everything else
after I got out.

104
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:31,852
Cigarettes, paranoia...

105
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:33,646
But the pacing?

106
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:37,024
I do it, too. [grunts softly]

107
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:39,652
Reva again?

108
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,904
Reva always.

109
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:48,285
Look, it's been long enough.

110
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:50,996
Give Patty a call.
She's a good woman.

111
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,164
[scoffs]

112
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:54,709
I don't drink coffee much.

113
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:57,377
I don't think she does either.

114
00:06:57,462 --> 00:07:00,506
[chuckles] Like she said,
"Ain't nothing wrong with that."

115
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:04,009
When I'm ready, I'm ready.

116
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:08,889
But you'll want a cup of something
hot and dark sooner or later...

117
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:10,850
Mr. Bulletproof.

118
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:13,769
-[chuckling]
-There you go with the nicknames, Pop.

119
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:18,232
You said your rebound chick
took a shotgun at point-blank range...

120
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:20,985
pointed it under your chin,

121
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:22,820
and pulled the trigger.

122
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:24,697
I still get the occasional headache.

123
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,491
Not a problem for you, Power Man.

124
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:28,117
[chuckling]

125
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:30,828
[Luke grunts]

126
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,041
Mmm-mmm. [chuckles]

127
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:40,129
I love it when you do stuff like that.
[chuckling]

128
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:42,548
You should be out there
helping people, that's all,

129
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:44,550
like them other fellas downtown.

130
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:46,135
Reva used to say the same thing.

131
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:48,303
Yeah, well, she was right.

132
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:51,223
You don't ever think about
all the people you could help?

133
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:53,643
You should be more ambitious.

134
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:58,564
What if my ambition is to sweep hair...

135
00:07:58,648 --> 00:07:59,982
wash dishes...

136
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,693
and be left the hell alone?

137
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,862
Well, that would be a waste.

138
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:06,739
You think I asked for any of this?

139
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,826
I was framed, beaten...

140
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,788
and put in some tank like an exotic fish.

141
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:18,709
Came out with...

142
00:08:18,793 --> 00:08:20,127
abilities.

143
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,712
Saved your life.

144
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:23,548
More like ruined it.

145
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,426
Reva's dead. [exhales]

146
00:08:28,553 --> 00:08:30,012
I'm a fugitive.

147
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:31,764
So?

148
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:34,391
Take my advice, brother.

149
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:37,770
The past is the past.

150
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:40,815
And the only direction in life
that matters is forward.

151
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:42,316
Never backwards.

152
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:45,653
I'm just living my life...

153
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:48,155
day to day.

154
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:50,365
[hip-hop music playing over speakers]

155
00:08:56,872 --> 00:08:59,374
Why don't you watch
where you going, man?

156
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,637
What's the gun for, Chico?

157
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:15,558
[scoffs]
Is your name Wilfredo Diaz?

158
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,019
'Cause he walked out on me and moms
when I was nine.

159
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,981
I ain't need a daddy then
and I don't need one now.

160
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:25,109
[car engine starts]

161
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,366
-Let's get this money.
-Yeah.

162
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:38,205
Tsk.

163
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:44,044
Hey, Pop, I gotta go.
I'm runnin' late.

164
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:48,298
Hey. Look, if I wasn't paying you in cash,
I could be paying you more.

165
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:50,760
You wouldn't have to be workin' two jobs.

166
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:53,679
I gotta do what I gotta do.

167
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:56,473
Always forward.

168
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:58,558
Forward. Always.

169
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,061
[sighs]

170
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:04,815
[indistinct chatter]

171
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,290
[vendor] Hey, yo, my man, my man.

172
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:24,584
All HD. Got it right here.
Blu-ray, too, 'cause I'm nice like that.

173
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:28,130
{\an8}Tony Stark,
the big blonde dude with the hammer,

It's the bleach.
I can smell it from around the corner.

Yeah, I took a <i>New Yorker</i>
off the top for you.

Okay, okay. Clean up.

Put a shirt and jacket on.
Mr. Stokes has standards.

206

Though you can't tell by what he pays.

So you're not impressed by all this?

-But when the smoke clears...

hold on to what you got.

-Success.

my uncle and your brother
had their way.

Uncle Pete was good people.

245
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,262
Salvador really liked Pete.

246
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:10,973
Anytime.

-[Luke] Lookin' for somethin'?
-No.

248
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:25,404
Saadiq's still got it. [chuckles]

249
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:26,905

Now I know you're an old head.

[chuckling]

254
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:44,798
[man] All right.
So let me get this straight.

255
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,925
I give your cousin a contribution

256
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,386
and it's like a get out of jail free card
for me, right?

257
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:50,970
That's something to celebrate.

258
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:53,432
No, I don't do that.

Not when it's just starting.

263
00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:05,610
This is nothing to celebrate.

264
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:07,446
You saw what happened to Fisk.

265
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:10,240
You two shouldn't even be seen together...

266
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:12,534
let alone having me
all up in the Kool-Aid.

267
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:17,122
But you're here anyway.
Something must be right about it.

268
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:20,334
Otherwise, you wouldn't have fronted me
if you didn't agree.

269
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:23,087
I have no illusions
about our family's legacy.

270

But you are now turning legitimate money
illegal all over again.

[Candace] Luke.

347
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:48,119
Hey, Candace.

348
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:50,455
You got promoted?

349
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:52,916
Dante's out sick.

350
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:55,460
You okay?

351
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:59,172
Table seven wants six bottles
of Ace of Spades.

352
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:00,715
I need you to help me carry them up.

353
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,557
I don't like being up there by myself.

354
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:12,060
I'm right behind you.
Give me a second.

355
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:29,828
Why don't you...
ponder that 'til I get back.

356
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:53,392
You're a big one, eh?

357
00:23:53,477 --> 00:23:55,394
He's wearing a little jacket.

358
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:57,481
[Stokes laughs]

359
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:01,400
Haven't seen you behind the bar.

360
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:03,152
Where's Dante?

361
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:06,114
Called in sick, I guess.

362
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:08,867
You want a job?

363
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:14,247
I can find something more suitable
for a man your size.

364
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:16,625
Better paying, too.

365
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:19,961
You ever carried a gun?

366
00:24:20,754 --> 00:24:22,005
No.

367
00:24:23,256 --> 00:24:25,550
I'm good. Thanks.

368
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:34,893
[Dante groaning]

369
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:44,318
[cell phone ringing]

370
00:24:48,865 --> 00:24:50,283
Yeah?

371
00:24:54,746 --> 00:24:56,665
Shit. Fuck.

372
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,880
[speaking indistinctly]

373
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:16,768
[typing]

374
00:25:23,775 --> 00:25:25,109
You got to walk over
to Adam Clayton Powell

375
00:25:25,193 --> 00:25:26,736
if you wanna catch the bus.

376
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,283
Uber?

377
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,079
-That's what you were gonna press, right?
-What are you?

378
00:25:36,162 --> 00:25:39,082
-A cop?
-[chuckles] No.

379
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:42,210
You just look cold.

380
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:51,385
If you're looking for Mr. Stokes,
he just left.

381
00:25:52,804 --> 00:25:54,013
Who?

382
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:56,307
Black Escalade.

383
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,893
Tinted windows.

384
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:05,149
Don't you have...
somewhere you need to be?

385
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:08,820
Yeah.

386
00:26:09,738 --> 00:26:10,864
Home.

387
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:13,157
Just got off.

388
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:15,326
Congratulations.

389
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,835
You wanna go grab a coffee?

390
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:34,387
I don't like coffee.

391
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:36,681
Neither do I.

392
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,311
[keys clatter]

393
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,577
[Luke exhales]

394
00:26:59,537 --> 00:27:01,539
[moans]

395
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,472
[both breathing heavily]

396
00:27:42,956 --> 00:27:44,082
[Luke grunts]

397
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:54,550
[Luke exhales]

398
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:02,475
[men grunting]

399
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:04,894
[cell phone ringing]

400
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:09,190
-[gasps]
-[woman] When?

401
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:12,110
I'm on my way in.

402
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:15,363
[sighs]

403
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:20,910
You talk in your sleep.

404
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:23,913
What was I saying?

405
00:28:25,123 --> 00:28:28,001
Shades? Comanche?

406
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:29,293
[Luke sighs]

407
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:35,884
The job is calling me in.

408
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:37,635
Can I call you later?

409
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:41,555
[sighs] You'd need my phone number
for that.

410
00:28:47,478 --> 00:28:49,063
I know where you work.

411
00:28:49,147 --> 00:28:50,982
I'll find you.

412
00:28:52,358 --> 00:28:53,735
What is it you do again?

413
00:29:00,283 --> 00:29:01,492
[zipping]

414
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:03,411
I'm an auditor.

415
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:07,415
What's that?

416
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:12,670
Basically, I look at the financial books.

417
00:29:12,754 --> 00:29:15,048
Make sure everything's
on the up and up.

418
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:18,592
And you need a short dress for that?

419
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:25,558
Sometimes you got to blend in.

420
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,143
Impossible.

421
00:29:28,311 --> 00:29:30,438
You stand out in any room you're in.

422
00:30:35,128 --> 00:30:37,088
[machinery whirring]

423
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:39,924
[camera shutters clicking]

424
00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:51,853
Dominicans? Cubans?

425
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:53,146
Puerto Ricans.

426
00:30:54,063 --> 00:30:55,814
[Scarfe] Thought that parade
was last week.

427
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:57,566
-Who can keep track?
-[both chuckling]

428
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:02,947
Who do you think
this guy was trying to call?

429
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,616
-Ghostbusters.
-[chuckles]

430
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:07,285
He can laugh.
You can't.

431
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:11,080
Hey, Bailey.
How you doing?

432
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:13,875
It's another beautiful day at the office.
What's not to love?

433
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:16,544
Don't you start singing
show tunes on me.

434
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:21,299
Oh, shit.

435
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:23,717
Dante Chapman.

436
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:25,094
You know him?

437
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:28,347
I know his mama.

438
00:31:31,935 --> 00:31:34,562
[Stokes] Of course it wasn't a inside job.

439
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,106
We had people die, too.

440
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:41,152
Look... I don't have the stuff.

441
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:45,573
Hmm. We need to talk about this
in person.

442
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:47,616
My word is still my bond.

443
00:31:49,994 --> 00:31:51,495
Hello?

444
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:55,959
That's Domingo?

445
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,420
Yo, what's up?

446
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:00,629
[sighs]

447
00:32:01,923 --> 00:32:04,175
It's above your pay grade.

448
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:05,384
What?

449
00:32:06,427 --> 00:32:08,429
[man] Tell your man
what's going on, Cornell.

450
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:13,517
Nice digs.

451
00:32:14,102 --> 00:32:16,562
Even nicer than when Mama Mabel ran it.

452
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:18,106
Shades.

453
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:21,484
When'd you come home?

454
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:24,237
[takes deep breath]
Ooh, a while ago.

455
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,030
Seagate wasn't shit.

456
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:27,531
Hmm.

457
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:33,371
[clears throat] So...
what can I do for you?

458
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:35,581
It's the other way around.

459
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,334
Y'all got hit last night.

460
00:32:39,335 --> 00:32:41,295
That expensive, exclusive,

461
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:43,965
hard-to-get hardware
that Diamondback gave you

462
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:45,883
is in a police evidence lockup.

463
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,389
And the money... that Domingo and his crew
were supposed to give you...

464
00:32:51,472 --> 00:32:52,848
is gone.

465
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:57,103
I'm with Diamondback now.
You knew that, right?

466
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,397
Well, tell Diamondback,
it's about time--

467
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,150
Uh-uh... Diamondback tells you.

468
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,819
[laughs]

469
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:07,613
I'm his number one seller.

470
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,323
I ain't here to spank you.

471
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,619
But I do need to look you in your eyes...

472
00:33:16,998 --> 00:33:18,332
Was it an inside job?

473
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,834
No.

474
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:22,670
Hell no.

475
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:24,297
I needed that money, too.

476
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,839
[sighs]

477
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:28,967
It took forever to build up
that kind of trust.

478
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:31,220
We're here to get you back on your feet.

479
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:32,346
Whatever you need.

480
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:35,224
Who is "we," you fake-ass Ray Charles?

481
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:38,019
[chuckles]

482
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:43,149
I got your back, B.

483
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:45,776
Just like back in the day.

484
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,945
Forget about back in the day.

485
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,407
Why is this feeling like a takeover?

486
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,908
[chuckling softly] It's not.

487
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,953
If it was...

488
00:33:56,037 --> 00:33:58,581
you would never even see
Diamondback comin'.

489
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:00,333
He wants you to win.

490
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:03,669
How can I help?

491
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:15,181
[indistinct chatter]

492
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:29,112
[Pop] <i>Dante was one of my kids.</i>
<i>So was Chico.</i>

493
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:31,072
And Shameek, too.

494
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:33,741
Just like those kids
playing over there.

495
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:37,745
[scoffs] You know, that's how you
get 'em on your side.

496
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:40,748
Sweepin' up hair.
Runnin' errands. [chuckling]

497
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:45,669
Lettin' 'em hang out, play video games.

498
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:49,465
Anything is better than what's
waiting for them out there on the street.

499
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:54,095
They want a way out...

500
00:34:55,304 --> 00:35:00,226
but they have too much pride
to ask for help.

501
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:04,230
So you gotta Jedi mind-trick them
into something. [chuckles]

502
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:07,608
Everyone has a gun. [sighs]
No one has a father.

503
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:09,818
Ain't that the truth.

504
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:11,320
You sure they did it?

505
00:35:11,404 --> 00:35:15,408
People started callin' me
half an hour after it happened.

506
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:19,370
Shameek has always been the spark plug.

507
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:23,040
And Chico... a follower.

508
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:28,212
I just can't believe
that either one of them...

509
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:30,673
would just turn around...

510
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:35,886
and kill... Dante.

511
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:42,226
You didn't see anything going on
with either one of 'em, did you?

512
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:47,731
No.

513
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:56,114
You live and die by your choices.

514
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:59,076
This is Harlem's garden.
That's what's happening here.

515
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,371
You are the ones that are gonna
keep this community--

516
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:04,290
[chuckles and gasps]

517
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:07,293
Where have-- Oh, God.
This is Marisol. Baby--

518
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:10,171
Oh, my God,
known her since she was first born.

519
00:36:10,254 --> 00:36:13,090
And here you are upturnin' Harlem around.

520
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:14,592
I'm so proud of you.

521
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:17,678
Ah! I saw you
running for the bus this mornin'.

522
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,514
All right, darling.

523
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:25,269
I'm happy you made it, darling.

524
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:27,605
Uh-uh, uh-uh,
cut him off at three.

525
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:30,233
I know this young brother.
He'll eat five hamburgers.

526
00:36:30,316 --> 00:36:32,150
I've seen you do it.

527
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:42,411
Now, Harlem is a community
that welcomes everyone. All people.

528
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:44,830
But at the same time,

529
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:47,333
since the days of Langston Hughes,

530
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:51,795
Malcolm X, Zora Neale Hurston,
Duke Ellington,

531
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:55,341
Harlem has been
the jewel of black America.

532
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:01,222
It's a perpetual symbol of...
of hope and prosperity and excellence.

533
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:02,890
For black lives to matter,

534
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:06,310
black history and black ownership
must also matter.

535
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:11,148
Now, my multifaceted plan
for the Crispus Attucks Complex

536
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:14,443
is just yet another way
to bring hope to a new generation,

537
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:18,281
to incubate the kind of innovation
and creativity

538
00:37:18,364 --> 00:37:21,116
and progress that Harlem's famous for.

539
00:37:22,285 --> 00:37:24,953
Thank you again for your time,
Madam Councilwoman.

540
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:26,914
Oh, Megan,
you're always welcome in Harlem.

541
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:28,332
-All right.
-All right, darling.

542
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:33,379
Y'all need to fall the hell back.

543
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:35,673
Zip, give her some space.

544
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:37,633
I don't like the thugs.

545
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:40,135
-You need them for security.
-Mmm, they scare people.

546
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:43,389
They pass out flyers,
get contributions, tributes.

547
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:46,058
[in Jamaican accent]
Just like in Jamaica, you know?

548
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:49,770
-Yeah, well, we ain't Jamaican, Cornell.
-[chuckling]

549
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:53,524
You shouldn't be here.
We don't need to be photographed together.

550
00:37:54,275 --> 00:37:55,568
Why?

551
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:57,278
You ashamed of me?

552
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:01,407
That hurts, Mariah.

553
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,991
-Tony.
-Hmm?

554
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:04,660
Will you give us a moment?

555
00:38:12,418 --> 00:38:14,462
I need the money you promised me ASAP.

556
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:16,297
Now you want the money?

557
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,718
I used federal grant
and tax-deductible donation money

558
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:23,053
to complete construction on your club

559
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:26,890
and to facilitate that meticulous deal
that just fell apart.

560
00:38:27,475 --> 00:38:30,644
I don't get the money,
I'm facing an audit.

561
00:38:30,728 --> 00:38:32,104
We all go to jail.

562
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,315
It'll be there.

563
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:39,820
What happened at the junkyard last night?

564
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:42,615
And who's the dude
in the sunglasses behind you?

565
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:45,242
Is he after the money, too?

566
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:48,829
Either you want the details, cuz,
or you don't.

567
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:55,336
That's what I thought.

568
00:38:58,339 --> 00:38:59,382
What's the word?

569
00:38:59,465 --> 00:39:03,344
Confirmation of what Dante told us
while he was dying.

570
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:05,721
His friends, the one that play
on your summer league team

571
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:07,390
at the Rucker,
jacked your shit.

572
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:09,975
Shameek and Chico.

573
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,269
Any bites yet?

574
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:15,648
No.

575
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:19,234
Double down.

576
00:39:20,778 --> 00:39:22,780
Twenty large to find those fools.

577
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:26,825
[hip-hop music playing]

578
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:52,601
Tone, Passion is twerking
for him right now.

579
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:56,021
He ain't going nowhere soon.
Not with all that ass in his face.

580
00:39:57,355 --> 00:40:00,401
You want me to keep him here,
you need to pay me.

581
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:11,662
Hey, yo, my man.
You know what time it is?

582
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:18,836
8:15.

583
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:20,921
[men laughing]

584
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:26,594
Stay Harlem.

585
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:30,639
Stay black.

[cutlery clattering]

588
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:33,786
-Hey, man.
-Watch your hands.

589
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:34,870
You need to pay me.

590
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:35,954
I'm paying you under the table,

591
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:38,791
which means I'll pay you
whenever I goddamn feel like it.

592
00:41:43,546 --> 00:41:45,631
What you worried about?

593
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:49,384
[Shameek] I'm not worried. I just never
met Cottonmouth before, that's all.

594
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:51,512
[Tone] Mr. Stokes.

595
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:55,432
Mr. Stokes. That's important.
Never Cottonmouth.

596
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:57,601
All right, okay, my bad.

597
00:41:57,685 --> 00:42:01,229
After what happened with Dante,
we circling the wagons.

598

They after us, B.

599
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:05,526
Who?

600
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,402
Nigga, it don't matter who.

601
00:42:08,571 --> 00:42:13,158
Mr. Stokes wanted me
to check on you... personally.

602
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:24,336
[Tone] Yo, what you doin'?
Come on.

603
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:56,534
Shades.

604
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:12,593
You like my Biggie photo?

605
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:15,638
Me, too.

606
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:20,183
You know what draws your eye
when you look at that?

607
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,228
The crown.

608
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:27,065

609
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:30,653
Huh?

610
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:37,618

I slapped you like a little bitch.

[breathes deeply]

615
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:56,219
I'm not the kind of man to use
a closed fist on a woman.

616

Where's my money?

[coughs]

624
00:44:20,618 --> 00:44:24,497
You left Dante alive.
He called Tone.

625
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:28,585
And with his dying words,
gave up you and your homeboy.

626

We got your money.

00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:36,802
Now you're gonna tell us where Chico is
so we can get the rest.

Loneliness never goes away,

to befriend someone...

I promise, baby...

00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,390

[chuckles] His face is jacked.

664
00:47:48,826 --> 00:47:53,040
Mmm. They definitely dumped him here.
They got him somewhere else.

665
00:47:53,123 --> 00:47:56,001
Mmm. Looks like he got hit by a truck.

666

a secret is if two of 'em are dead."

Benjamin Franklin...

672
00:48:13,226 --> 00:48:16,313
Didn't he electrocute himself
flying a kite in a rainstorm?

673
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:18,023
I wouldn't base any theories on that fool.

674

Benjamin Franklin
is on the $100 bill, Scarfe.

675

[scoffs] So? He wasn't a president.

676
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:27,490
That's even more impressive.
Come on, give the man some credit.

677
00:48:28,658 --> 00:48:31,869
Well... So you think Chico
did this to Shameek?

678
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:37,209
Chico is what?
A buck 50 soaking wet?

679
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,711
But we won't know for sure
until we find him.

680
00:48:39,794 --> 00:48:43,256
You said Dante wasn't bartendin'
the night you were at the club.

681
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,466
No.

682
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:46,551
Well, did you talk to the guy
that replaced him that night?

683
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:49,179
[scoffs] I barely talked to the guy.

684
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:51,681
I mean... [inhales]
all I did was order drinks.

685
00:48:51,764 --> 00:48:54,851
Well, maybe there's some pattern,
somethin' we're missin'.

686
00:48:54,934 --> 00:48:56,894
We need to go talk to that guy.

687
00:48:56,979 --> 00:48:59,481
That sounds like a complete waste of time.

688
00:49:00,607 --> 00:49:02,234
That's entirely possible.

689
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:04,902
But it's worth a shot.

690
00:49:04,987 --> 00:49:06,946
[scoffs] All right.

691
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:44,567
You've been in this country for how long?

692
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:49,072
And you still... can't speak English?

693
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:51,658
My English is just fine.

694
00:49:51,741 --> 00:49:53,618
Show Mariah Dillard some love.

695
00:49:53,701 --> 00:49:56,788
Contribute and we'll go away.

696
00:49:56,871 --> 00:49:57,997
It's a family thing.

697
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:00,125
I own this restaurant.

698
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:02,627
My father owned this building.

699
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,964
Tell Mariah Dillard I am not
contributing to her complex.

700
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:10,260
We voted for her
and gave her money before.

701
00:50:10,343 --> 00:50:13,055
And I respect Mr. Stokes.

702
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:15,890
