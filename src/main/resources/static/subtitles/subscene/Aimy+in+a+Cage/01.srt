<i>Episode 1</i>

20
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,900
Madam. <br> Yu has grown so big.

21
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,730
Congratulations!

22
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,660
Thank you. Thank you.

23
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,330
Wishing our Brother Jiang (Jiang Yu's dad) <br> good fortune and longevity.

24
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,400
-Thank you. <br>-Wishing the Ling Long Dye Factory a thriving

25
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,770
and prosperous business. <br> - Thank you.

26
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,990
- Thank you. <br>- Don't mention it.

27
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,820
-Congratulations, Young Master <br> -Mr. Ma Ke (Mark),

28
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,470
Mr. Wei Lian (William), please go inside.

29
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,250
Okay.

30
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,900
Big Brother. Why are all of their names so strange?

31
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,290
Dad says China will need to open its doors to do business in the future.

32
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,380
Everyone will need to collaborate with foreigners<br> so that's why they changed their names to something foreign.

33
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,260
It will make it easier to do business with foreigners in the future. <br>Do you understand?

34
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,530
Your big brother knows so much.

35
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,570
Yu Er, all of the guests are almost here. <br>Why has your dad not returned yet?

36
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,880
The workers developed a new dye. <br> Dad has been at the dyehouse for the past few days,

37
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,170
waiting for the dye to come out of the vat. <br> He doesn't have time to care about celebrating his birthday.

38
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,410
Mom, don't worry. <br> I'll go look for him right now.

39
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,980
Okay. Okay. Okay. Go quickly and hurry back.

40
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,690
Master, look! <br> Success! It's all a success!

41
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,650
Rich in colour and soft to the touch. <br> Looks like this dye is really good.

42
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,870
-Agreed. <br> -We're successful.

43
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,970
Everyone, you've all worked hard.

44
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,410
<i>Master, you've worked hard.</i>

45
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,730
Mrs. Zhou

46
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,310
Master.

47
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,550
How is the head of your family (husband)?

48
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,220
Thank you Master for your concern. <br>The doctor said that he has a chronic disease.

49
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,320
He has to be healed slowly.

50
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,050
Right. Right. Has to be treated slowly and slowly cured.

51
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,450
If you need money urgently, remember to tell me.

52
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,950
We can give you an advance on your wages.

53
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,720
-Thank you, Master. <br>-Master! Master!

54
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,000
Master! Master!

55
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,430
Master, shouldn't we be heading back?

56
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,370
It's your birthday today. <br> They'll be starting the banquet soon.

57
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,530
Oh. Right. Right. Right.

58
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,710
Then I'll leave the rest to you guys. <br> Tonight, give everyone additional portions of dinner.

59
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,930
<i>Congrats, Master.</i>

60
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,010
<i>-Get up! <br> -Congrats, Master.</i>

61
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,990
Excuse me, Officer. May I ask, what are you doing?

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:06,440
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

63
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,970
Chief Wu, you honour us with your presence.

64
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,030
This is...

65
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,720
I received a secret report.

66
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,910
It said that Ling Long Dye Factory was selling dog meat as mutton. <br> (to assume a false identity to conceal one's true purpose)

67
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,570
On the surface, it looks like a dye business.

68
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,900
But privately, it is dealing opium.

69
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,750
-Search this place! <br> -Wait!

70
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,680
-Chief Wu. <br> -Let's not let personal interests interfere with public duties.

71
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,620
-Search! <br> -Yes, Sir!

72
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,970
<i>-Go there. Quick. <br> -Follow me. <br> -Yes.</i>

73
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,960
<i>This way.</i>

74
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,600
<i>Search carefully. Quick. </i>

75
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,630
<i>Get out of the way. Get out of the way. <br> Search carefully.</i>

76
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:34,160
Chief Wu. For generations while in Huzhou, <br>Ling Long has always been a legitimate business.

77
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,350
This is a well-known fact.

78
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,760
<i>You two go to that side!</i>

79
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,730
<i>Sir.</i>

80
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,650
Sir.

81
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,000
The quality is superior.

82
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,750
Let's talk.

83
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,010
Chief Wu, I repeat, I'm innocent.

84
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,640
This must be someone's plan to frame me.

85
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,170
Please, Chief Wu. I implore you to distinguish right and wrong.

86
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:19,390
-Help me seek justice. <br> -In this world, in fact, there's no justice.

87
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,040
If you want justice, it's really simple.

88
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,990
I'll let you use your Jiang family's most important item in exchange (for it).

89
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,980
Alright.

90
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,990
In this room, what do you fancy?

91
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,030
Take your pick.

92
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,960
I want your Jiang family's secret formula for dyeing.

93
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,970
Wu Hong Da,

94
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,950
as a dignified Chief,

95
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,980
you came here to Ling Long to put on such a show.

96
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,970
Just for this?

97
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,670
If you're willing to give me the secret formula,

98
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,470
I can save you from prison.

99
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,780
But if you refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit, <br> (refuse to do something, but in the end, was forced to do it)

100
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,210
I will make you lose both honour and fortune, confiscate your property, and execute your family.

101
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,890
This trafficking opium issue, if I say it's big, it's big.

102
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,080
If I say it's small, it'll be small.

103
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,030
You're a smart man. <br> You should know which to choose.

104
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,110
Dream on!

105
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,450
<i>-Get out! Get out! <br> -My things are still inside.</i>

106
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,290
Let me through. Let me through.

107
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,230
Let me through. <br> Aunt, what's going on? Where's my dad?

108
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,990
He's still inside.

109
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,750
<i>Let me in.</i>

110
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,550
Dad!

111
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,350
Dad!

112
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,360
Dad! Wake up, Dad!

113
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,390
Dad!

114
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,450
Dad!

115
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,480
Dad, wake up!

116
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,590
Dad!

117
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,830
Opium

118
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,700
is a very strong drug.

119
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,430
It brings people to bad thoughts and evil deeds.

120
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:12,030
Smoking opium turns a most benevolent person into a monster.

121
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,570
Because Jiang Wen Yuan was using his company to smuggle opium,

122
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,980
he must be severely punished.

123
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,810
According to the law, he must be executed.

124
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,190
Jiang Wen Yuan, fearing punishment for his crimes, committed suicide.

125
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,730
Therefore, the Ling Long Dye Factory <br>and the Jiang family's fortune must all be forfeited.

126
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,650
The dye factory will be closed immediately. <br> All workers will be dismissed at once.

127
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,490
<i>Quick. Let's go. Let's go.</i>

128
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,890
<i>-Remove everything. <br> -Yes, sir! Removing them.</i>

129
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,650
<i>-Hurry up. Hurry up. <br> -What are you doing? Stop!</i>

130
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,100
Stop!

131
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,440
You can't do this.

132
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,450
-Get out! <br> -Yu! <br> -Get out! Get out!

133
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,560
Mom! Mom!

134
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,420
<i>-Old Master (Husband). <br> -Let go of us!</i>

135
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,030
<i>I can't leave!</i>

136
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,950
Get out! Get out!

137
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,830
-Get out. <br> -Mom!

138
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,860
Old Master! Old Master!

139
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,570
Mom!

140
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,860
This is my house. What right do you have to chase us out?

141
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,010
This is Jiang's household!

142
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:20,030
Jiang Wen Yuan committed a deadly sin, causing us to lose our Jiang's reputation

143
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,540
Now the Clan Leader is driving you out of the family tree!

144
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,590
You have no right to live here anymore.

145
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,950
-That's right. Go. Get out. <br> -My dad was framed.

146
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,790
I beg every Uncle to speak justice for us.

147
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,030
<i>Get out. Go.</i>

148
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,810
<i>-Why waste your breath on them? </i><br> -Mom! <br> -Go!

149
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,400
<i>Go away. Nothing to see here.</i>

150
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,330
<i>They broke the clan rules.</i>

151
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,090
Dad, hang on for a few more days.

152
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,190
Once Mom gets this month's pay, she'll be able to buy your medicine.

153
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,480
Once you take the medicine, you'll slowly get better.

154
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,930
Dad. Are you alright, Dad? <br> Dad, hang on.

155
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,960
Just hang on, Dad.

156
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,000
Mom! <br> Mom, Dad's medicine has run out.

157
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,830
There's no medicine.

158
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,580
There's no wages.

159
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,180
Ling Long's gone too.

160
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,060
What?

161
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,050
Dad.

162
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,770
Dad. Endure it.

163
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,410
Mom, I'm going out to earn some money.

164
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,370
Shao Tian!

165
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,570
-Mom. <br> -Fei Fei.

166
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,450
You these black-hearted people. My only son, due to inhaling the smoke,

167
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,540
became someone that is not like a human or a ghost!

168
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,590
- You- <br>-Yu

169
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,000
What's wrong, Yu?

170
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,030
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

171
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,160
I'll bring you to see a doctor. Otherwise, it'll leave a scar.

172
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,130
No need, Mom. I'm fine.

173
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,510
This scar, is a scar caused by Wu Hong Da destroying our family.

174
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:06,040
Let it be. <br> It'll be a reminder for me of how Dad died.

175
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,910
Mom, I'm fine.

176
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,610
Let's go.

177
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,590
Let's go.

178
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,710
Young Master Ma! Young Master Ma!

179
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,970
-Young Master Ma. <br> -I told you I don't have any money to lend you, Zhou Shao Tian.

180
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,950
Everybody knows your family is poor. <br> Moreover, you have a sickly father.

181
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,680
Lending you money would be like hitting a dog with a meat bun, never to return.

182
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,390
Young Master Ma, I'll just borrow one silver dollar

183
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,060
to buy medicine for my dad. <br> I'll definitely think of a way to pay it back.

184
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,560
Young Master Ma, I'm begging you. <br> I just need one silver dollar.

185
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,440
Money... I do have it.

186
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,830
However, only if you are willing to crawl between my legs

187
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,970
and bark like a dog. If you please me, <br> then I'll lend you the money.

188
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,070
You...

189
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,980
<i>Crawl! Crawl! Hurry up!</i>

190
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,950
<i>Crawl! Crawl! Hurry up and crawl!</i>

191
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,580
<i>Crawl! Crawl! <br> He's crawling. Good.</i>

192
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,160
<i>Crawl! Hurry up!</i>

193
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,930
<i>Hurry up! What're you doing? Quick!</i>

194
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,500
<i>Hurry up and crawl. Go faster.</i>

195
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,130
<i>Good. That was good.</i>

196
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,410
<i>-This is so fun. <br> -Alright. Bark like a dog. Bark like a dog.</i>

197
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,970
<i>Bark like a dog.</i>

198
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,940
<i>Good. That was good.</i>

199
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,550
-This is too much fun. <br> -Come here and see. There's actually someone who, for a silver dollar,

200
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,990
is willing to be a dog.

201
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,880
Young Master Ma, my money.

202
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,450
If you want money, there's none. <br> But I can reward you with something else.

203
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,470
Come. Give this fall-in-water-dog a good thrashing. <br> (someone who is down on their luck)

204
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,630
Take this, fall-in-water-dog. <br> Hit him. Harder.

205
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,550
Hit him. Harder.

206
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,190
We'll beat you up, fall-in-water-dog.

207
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,160
Young Master Ma. <br> Young Master Ma, I just need one silver dollar

208
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,990
to buy medicine for my dad. <br> Just one silver dollar can save my dad's life.

209
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,690
I just need one silver dollar. <br> I'll definitely pay it back, Young Master Ma.

210
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,190
Let's go.

211
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,270
Young Master Ma. Young Master Ma. <br> Please lend me one silver dollar.

212
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,730
I wish to save my dad's life.

213
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,730
Screw you.

214
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,090
I'm begging you, Young Master Ma.

215
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,430
Please give me one silver dollar.

216
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,930
I wish to save my dad's life.

217
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:40,390
I'm begging you. I just need one silver dollar.

218
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,940
One silver dollar will be able to save my dad's life.

219
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,960
Here, for you.

220
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:12,710
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

221
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,430
Endure it. Just endure it a little longer.

222
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,840
Just hang on for a bit. <br> Shao Tian went out to get your medicine.

223
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,730
He'll be back in a bit.

224
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,270
I'm... I'm sorry.

225
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,890
All these years, to cure this sickness,

226
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,400
not only did we spend all our money,

227
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,010
we also owe a debt.

228
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,690
I beg you to help me do something.

229
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,990
Give me relief.

230
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,930
Let me go.

231
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,970
What are you saying?

232
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,230
Instead of a living dead,

233
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,130
it would be better to have an earlier release.

234
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,120
No, you can't!

235
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,090
Dad.

236
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:05,570
Not like a person yet not like a ghost, living like this,

237
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,970
I'm really suffering.

238
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,990
Help me find relief. I'm begging you.

239
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,800
Mom!

240
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,870
<i>They dared to move here. I say...</i>

241
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,780
<i>Quickly go away.</i>

242
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,710
<i>Go away! Go away!</i>

243
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,250
Get lost! <br> If you dare talk nonsense again,

244
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,140
I won't hold back.

245
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,010
Go away! Scram!

246
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,950
Mom!

247
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,930
By the grace of Heaven

248
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,990
and His Majesty, the Emperor

249
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,070
Huzhou Supervisor Wu Hong Da

250
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:47,090
has positively solved the case of the opium smugglers.

251
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:53,440
In regard to his outstanding dilligent compliance

252
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,500
and his extraordinary productivity,

253
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,000
he is being elevated to the court official of the 6th rank

254
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,270
and given the reward of five hundred and twenty silvers.

255
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,010
Admire heaven's will ( hear hear).

256
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,970
<i>Great.</i>

257
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:16,740
<i>Twelve Years Later </i>

258
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,270
Cai Hong, if anything catches your eye, just buy it.

259
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,630
In the afternoon, I'll have Shao Tian pick you up.

260
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,500
Dad, I'm not a kid anymore. <br> Why do you always ask people to follow me?

261
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,530
Okay. Okay. Anything you say. <br> Once you're home, give me a call.

262
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:48,070
I got it.

263
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,380
-Go. <br> -Dad, take care.

264
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,190
To Ling Long.

265
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,160
Let's go.

266
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:04,010
Wu Long, what should we get for Dad's birthday?

267
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,910
<i>-Hello, Boss. <br> -Hello, Boss.</i>

268
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,500
Slow down.

269
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,620
<i>-Please. <br> -Hello, Boss.</i>

270
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,750
Sir, you've got a great eye. <br> This Parker Pen

271
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,230
is the only one in Huzhou. Even Shanghai doesn't have one.

272
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,950
Look at this pen tip. It is made with special materials.

273
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,770
The tip is sharp and silky smooth, with gilding on the outside.

274
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,320
If you use it with the Lei De ink, it will write smoothly and legibly.

275
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,380
It's not only just functional, it will also show your status.

276
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,440
This fountain pen is perfect for father's birthday present.

277
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,150
I don't want anything else. I want this fountain pen.

278
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,930
But this gentleman saw it first.

279
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,120
Sir. Could you let me have this pen

280
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,060
because it's very important to me?

281
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,970
If you are willing, I can pay you double.

282
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,940
Here.

283
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:08,050
You are too generous. We only just met and you are giving me such an expensive gift.

284
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,230
Thank you. I will treat you to a meal on another day.

285
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,600
What do you like to eat? I can treat you to anything.

286
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,820
Where should I find you? Where do you live? What is your name?

287
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,320
I paid for this pen.

288
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,830
If you dare to take this pen and step out from the shop,

289
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,070
I can immediately sue you for theft.

290
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,140
Thanks.

291
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,510
Sir, take care.

292
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,480
Wait!

293
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,160
Come back. What is your name?

294
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,310
Are you going to offer again to buy my name?

295
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,620
But it's a pity that you can't just buy my name.

296
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,860
I have never seen such a rude, stingly and mannerless man like you!

297
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:03,430
I also have never seen such a willful and unreasonable lady like you.

298
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,260
And you are a blockhead!

299
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,600
You are smelly and stubborn. Do you believe that I can do anything

300
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,240
to find out your name.

301
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,440
I don't believe you.

302
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,560
Let's make a bet then. <br>If I don't spend a single cent to find out your name, the pen is mine.

303
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,920
Let's talk again when you find me.

304
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,050
Just you wait. I will definitely be able to find you.

305
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,960
I'm so furious.

306
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,960
-Rotten Stone Head, you finally found your conscience? <br>-What's wrong?

307
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,390
-Brother Shao Tian <br>-Rotten Stone Head?

308
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,980
It's that guy who fought with me over the pen.

309
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,970
Get up and talk.

310
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,690
Brother Shao Tian. How did you know I'm here?

311
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,520
Because we are able to read each other's mind.

312
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:12,560
Brother Shao Tian, did you know? I was really unlucky just now.

313
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,030
I actually saw a unique and beautiful Parker pen.

314
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,950
But I just had to meet a person who had to fight with me for that pen. <br>He didn't have any generosity.

315
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,430
This matter is easy to deal with. Leave it to me, I will send

316
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,830
exactly the same Parker pen on your father's birthday.

317
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,200
No need. That pen is very expensive.

318
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,030
It will cost half of your annual salary.

319
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:46,220
I didn't mean that, Brother Shao Tian. Please don't blame me.

320
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,930
As long as it is something you like, I will definitely fulfill your wish.

321
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,970
Leave this to me.

322
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,500
<i>Good morning, Boss.</i>

323
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
<i>Good morning, Boss.</i>

324
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,730
<i>Morning, Boss.</i>

325
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,010
Morning, Boss Jiang.

326
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,070
Morning.

327
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,210
Miss. This is what you asked for.

328
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,960
I know. You can leave first.

329
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,130
-Fei Fei<br>-Brother, you came at the right time.

330
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,150
Look at this.

331
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,460
This is from Ling Long.

332
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,620
Our worker used the newest material to create this.

333
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,030
Using dyes from France to dye the materials,

334
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,850
it has such vibrant colours and is soft to the touch,

335
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,030
and there is no traditional smell that hurts the nose.

336
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,620
All our workers started work today.

337
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,930
The five tons of French dyes that we ordered have already arrived at the Shanghai dock.

338
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,750
That time, all the workers would put in their best to work.

339
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,510
That way, our production will surpass Ling Long,

340
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,220
to become the greatest Dyeing Factory in Jiang Hu.<br>-Great.

341
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,770
This is Ling Long's list of customers.

342
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,610
All our fabrics would be sold at a lower price than Ling Long.

343
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,950
Steal all their customers away to our shop.

344
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,020
Brother, everything is prepared.

345
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,630
Everything Wu Hong Da stole from us in the past,

346
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,970
we will get it back.

347
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:50,520
Wu Hong Da, it already has been 12 years.

348
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,050
I'm back.

349
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:06,750
- Boss. <br>- Shao Tian, come and sit here.

350
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,170
So how?

351
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,970
Did you profess your love for Cai Hong yet?

352
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:18,290
Shao Tian is useless. I have yet to find an appropriate time.

353
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,990
You are capable in business but when it comes to women, you are not.

354
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,960
Put in more effort. You have my support.

355
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,040
This is the new generation now.

356
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,450
Cai Hong must agree.

357
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,080
Here, have your tea.

358
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,410
Boss thinks too highly of me. I am not worth it.

359
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,930
Thinks too highly of you? I understand you.

360
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:48,910
You were born of a poor family but I happen to think of it as your good point.

361
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,990
That way, you are able to withstand hardship and work honestly.

362
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:58,000
You are also meticulous. I won't get the wrong guy. Drink tea.

363
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:13,330
Thank you for your trust. I would definitely take good care of Cai Hong.

364
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,950
I will give you another chance then.

365
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,370
Come for dinner tonight at my home.

366
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,570
Thank you, Boss.

367
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,030
Shao Tian, your acting is not bad.

368
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:40,640
Put in more effort. <br>You will be on the way to become the son-in-law of the Wu Household.

369
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,710
Dad, mom. Please have tea.

370
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,040
Cai Hong. How old are you this year?

371
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,050
Dad. Don't you know that

372
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:07,470
to ask a Lady's age in the West is considered rude?

373
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,970
Don't you know your father? He's doing this on purpose. <br>How could he not know your age?

374
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,000
Cai Hong. It is that I have seen ladies of your age

375
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,370
already get married, so...

376
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,770
So, you think that I'm unable to get married, right?

377
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,370
Don't tell me that all the good men in Huzhou are already married.

378
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:30,670
Not all the good men are already married. <br> I have found one for you.

379
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,940
I think he wouldn't dare to escape.

380
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:40,540
I think I can still stay

381
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,960
with you for a few more years. I don't want to marry anyone.

382
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,350
Lord, see how sensible Cai Hong is.

383
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,310
- What do you know? <br>- You should learn more.

384
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,940
Mom. Why did you hit me?

385
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:58,380
For Cai Hong to have a good spouse is the best way to be filial to me.

386
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,470
Okay, I know that you hate me. You don't want me to stay with you.

387
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,670
I'm going to find Wu Long who doesn't hate me.

388
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,390
Look at her. She is blushing.

389
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:11,030
Shao Tian.

390
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,260
Go.

391
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,050
Okay.

392
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:33,960
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

393
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:49,130
See how Wu Long is able to understand us,

394
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,290
he left such a big courtyard to ourselves.

395
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,030
Do you know that you didn't scare Wu Long away?

396
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,720
Why are you looking at me?

397
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,930
You are pretty.

398
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,790
Cai Hong. We have known each other for a long time.

399
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,910
I would like to ask you a question.

400
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,960
What is my place in your heart?

401
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,970
You are fine.

402
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,910
I regard you as my older brother.

403
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,250
Older brother?

404
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,890
But I don't want to be your older brother.

405
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,610
Every day, I would like

406
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,990
to eat and chat with you.

407
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:44,310
- That would be great. <br>- It's not that difficult to do this.

408
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:49,980
You can visit me often. We can have meals and chat together.

409
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,960
- I'm saying, the both of us... <br>- You are even eavesdropping?

410
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,670
Dad.

411
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,220
This wench. I caught her eavesdropping.

412
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,610
Don't let her disturb you. Continue with where you were going.

413
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:06,070
Hateful.

414
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,010
Cai Hong.

415
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,510
Shao Tian.

416
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,130
I will help you find the opportunity next time.

417
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,390
There is a big difference between an older brother and a husband.

418
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,000
That year, Cai Hong's mother also said that I was her older brother.

419
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,670
You still said I eavesdropped. What about you?

420
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,950
Why are you not going back?

421
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,020
Shao Tian.

422
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,590
Work hard.

423
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,990
I already prepared the hot water for your bath.

424
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,960
I don't need it. <br> Just continue to recite your scriptures.

425
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,560
Everyday abstaining from eating meat and chanting prayers not because you are afraid my dad won't ascend to heaven.

426
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,570
It's because you're afraid you'll receive retribution.

427
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,400
<i>We, Mei Fu, wants to order a hundred fabrics!</i>

428
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,990
<i>-Don't squeeze! <br>-Boss.</i>

429
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,450
- Hello. <br>- Brother.

430
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,480
Fei Fei. What's wrong?

431
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,910
Bad news. She has gone missing from the hospital.

432
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,970
Don't panic. I will be there soon.

433
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,650
Sorry.

434
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,590
Fei Fei, where is mom?

435
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:33,930
Brother. Mom is missing. I went out to buy some snacks and she went missing.

436
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,470
Brother, do you think anything would happen to mom? <br>Could it be that she is trying to commit suicide again?

437
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,990
- Brother... <br>- Don't let your imagination run wild. Mom will be fine.

438
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,900
Don't cry first. Let's split up and find her.

439
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,010
Okay.

440
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,410
<i>Thank you.</i>

441
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,370
Stinky Rock, I don't believe that I cannot find you.

442
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,070
Mom.

443
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,120
- May I ask if you have seen this person? <br>- No.

444
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,050
Thanks.

445
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,520
Have you seen anywho who looks like him?

446
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,950
No.

447
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,100
Hello.

448
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,410
Aunt. May I ask if you have seen him?

449
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,890
This person?

450
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,990
- I saw him. <br> You saw him?

451
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,390
Who is he and what is his name?

452
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,770
Do you think he's good looking?

453
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,590
What has being good looking got to do with this?

454
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,030
If he's not handsome, why are you looking for him then?

455
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,620
I...

456
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:57,170
<i>I can only follow her wishes to let her tell me his name.</i>

457
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,440
Yes, I find him very good looking.

458
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,040
You see, he has a strikingly handsome face.

459
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,660
He has a Grecian nose, strong brows and is bright-eyed, with an uncommon demeanor.

460
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,800
No matter how you look at him, he is smoothing to look at, a handsome man.

461
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,930
Do you like him?

462
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,500
Aunt, I'm a girl.

463
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,950
How could I tell you?

464
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,090
Why don't you tell me his name?

465
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,020
Why don't you ask him yourself?

466
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,960
I'm so embarrassed.

467
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,290
How did you get here?

468
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,440
Of course, I have my own ways.

469
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,240
Give me the fountain pen.

470
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,550
Yes, you found me

471
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,900
but what is my name?

472
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,010
Mom, let's go.

473
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,250
This girl is looking for you.

474
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,850
I know.

475
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,890
