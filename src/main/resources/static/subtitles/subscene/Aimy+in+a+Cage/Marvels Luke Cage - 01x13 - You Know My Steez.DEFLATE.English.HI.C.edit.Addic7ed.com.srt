Of course Luke can win.

180
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:53,236
[panting] I'm done, Willis.
I'm not doing this anymore.

181
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,989
You ain't done. Not
till one of us is dead.

182
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,991
You're more like Dad than you think.

183
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,037
When I got shipped to Seagate...

184
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,831
he called me a mistake, too.

185
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,709
I'm not paying for his sins anymore.

186
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,586
And neither should you.

187
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,464
You want me dead?

188
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,466
Then kill me.

189
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,634
Do it!

190
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,722
You ain't ready.

191
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,659
- [bell dings]
- [Stryker grunting]

192
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,976
[crowd shouting]

193
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,645
Throw in the jab! Move!
Keep moving, keep moving!

194
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,606
- [grunting]
- [crowd exclaims]

195
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,880
[young Stryker] Take
the hits! Take the hits!

196
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,698
- Let him get tired!
- [crowd shouting]

197
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,825
- Save him.
- [both grunting]

198
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:43,703
No.

199
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,851
You can take it. Keep
breathing, keep breathing!

200
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,835
[Stryker grunting]

201
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,754
[crowd cheering]

202
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,693
[young Stryker] Let him get tired.
He ain't got shit to come back with.

203
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,010
[Luke groaning]

204
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,474
[wheezing]

205
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,354
[man] Come on, son! You can do it!

206
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,855
[grunting]

207
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,315
[crowd exclaims]

208
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,026
- [woman 1] Come on, Luke.
- [man 1] Don't give up, Luke!

209
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,570
[woman 2] Luke, come on, man!

210
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,408
[woman 3] You got it, Luke!

211
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,500
Remember who you are.

212
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,712
[Stryker panting]

213
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,426
[chanting] Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke!

214
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:40,802
[spits]

215
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,305
[crowd shouting]

216
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,974
[crowd continues chanting]

217
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,021
[chanting] Luke! Luke! Luke!

218
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,065
[chanting continues]

219
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,317
You're right.

220
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,902
You reap what you sow.

221
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,863
Let's go! Put it on him! Put it on him!

222
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,657
- [crowd continues chanting]
- [grunting]

223
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,287
Am I my brother's keeper?

224
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,625
[crowd exclaiming]

225
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,462
No, I'm not.

226
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,964
- [bell ringing]
- [young Stryker] Yeah!

227
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,049
[crowd cheering]

228
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,175
[young Stryker] Yeah!

229
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,719
[crowd cheering]

230
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,137
[chanting] Luke! Luke! Luke!

231
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:34,188
On the ground, now! We
got Judas bullets, Cage.

232
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,193
Lieutenant, stand down.

233
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,780
I got you.

234
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,033
Councilwoman Dillard...

235
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,160
What?

236
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,956
You are under arrest for
the murder of Cornell Stokes.

237
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,799
- You goin' down.
- [Misty] Do the perp walk.

238
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,669
- You are going down.
- Take her out of here.

239
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,547
[indistinct chatter on radio]

240
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:08,055
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

241
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,142
Oh, come on. You're not
even gonna try to move?

242
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,478
Not even a lil' bit?

243
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,314
Take his tired...

244
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,859
broken...

245
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,362
false-preachin' ass on out of here.

246
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,749
[breathing heavily]

247
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,797
I should be healed up in
a couple of hours, right?

248
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,008
Sooner than that, Power Man.

249
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,390
Nah, B.

250
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,435
Brother deserves discretion.

251
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,489
How did you know...

252
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,784
that you could do that?

253
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,079
The more I hit him...

254
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,415
the more he dished out.

255
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,084
So I stopped feeding him hate.

256
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,547
What if it didn't work?

257
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,176
Well, sometimes you gotta
throw out the science and...

258
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,137
go for what you know.

259
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,889
You heard me say that?

260
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,767
I hear everything you say.

261
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,937
Even when you don't speak...

262
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,440
Still hear it.

263
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,066
[man] Luke Cage!

264
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,069
Thanks for keeping Harlem safe, baby.

265
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,367
[sighs]

266
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,166
I'm sorry, Luke. I'm
gonna need to bring you in.

267
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,335
I need a statement.

268
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,046
I'm done running.

269
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,132
How many of these you own, brother?

270
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,474
Looks like this place don't
wanna be a barber shop anymore.

271
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,434
[sighs]

272
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,021
Maybe not.

273
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,608
But whatever it is,
it's gonna be famous.

274
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:28,029
People are gonna be talking about
what went down here for years.

275
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,033
You ready?

276
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,829
You know how I feel about cop shops.

277
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,206
Well...

278
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,792
if it's any comfort,

279
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,086
you'll have a front-row seat when
I nail Mariah's ass to the wall.

280
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,425
How's Candace?

281
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,970
Safe and secure at my mom's place.

282
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,015
- Promise.
- Good.

283
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,601
<i>All these people were
talking bad about Luke Cage.</i>

284
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,437
<i>But they didn't stop for one minute
to look at the good he had done.</i>

285
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:05,692
<i>Cleaning up Crispus Attucks by
himself, lookin' out for people...</i>

286
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,110
<i>Most of these guys wear spandex.</i>

287
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,322
<i>Who would have thought a black
man in a hoodie would be a hero?</i>

288
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,742
<i>It's been an extraordinary
night here in Harlem.</i>

289
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,620
See? I'm not the type of person

290
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,207
who wants always to say, "I am right."

291
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,959
- But...
- I'm glad you're right.

292
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,418
[cell phone chimes]

293
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,922
[sighs]

294
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,101
[man] There he is. There's Luke.

295
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,478
- [all clamoring]
- [camera shutters clicking]

296
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,272
Hey, back it off. Back!

297
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,650
[reporter 1] Mr. Cage, how
does it feel to be a hero?

298
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,318
I'm no hero. I'm a regular guy,

299
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,155
just trying to live life on his
own terms, one day at a time.

300
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,406
Are you single?

301
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,635
[reporter 2] Do you have anything
to say to Councilwoman Dillard?

302
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,494
[all clamoring]

303
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,347
[reporter 2] Have you
received any medical treatment?

304
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,211
[reporter 3] How does
it feel to be vindicated?

305
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,418
[scoffs]

306
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,837
[chuckles]

307
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,882
You can take a seat.

308
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,385
Mr. Cage.

309
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,139
My name is Inspector Priscilla Ridley.

310
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,058
You realize there is a warrant
still out for your arrest.

311
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:25,062
I do. I came here to clear things up.

312
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,983
I haven't done any of the things
that I've been charged with.

313
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,443
Even the dash cam video that
everyone's talking about?

314
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,821
I'd like to provide some context.

315
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,699
Would you like an attorney?

316
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,076
I know a really good one.

317
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,620
I'm not guilty of anything.

318
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,247
I'll speak for myself.

319
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,888
- Interrogation One?
- No.

320
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,599
As far as I'm concerned,
he's no longer a suspect.

321
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,936
And we both know if he
doesn't wanna be, he'll walk.

322
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,104
Procedure says he should be in a room.

323
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,691
He won't go for a room.

324
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,484
Look, we can do it right
here, right now. It's fine.

325
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,195
What about your sororal?

326
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,573
You gonna let her just
skee-wee on out of here again?

327
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,450
Actually, it's "ooh-woop..."

328
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,453
and no, she's not going anywhere, but...

329
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,874
we are showing her every
courtesy the NYPD extends...

330
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,375
very slowly.

331
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,925
[Mariah] I want my goddamn phone call!

332
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,136
Okay, Mama. All right.

333
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,598
Hmm. [sniffles]

334
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,144
This ends here.

335
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,566
You got it?

336
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,821
I already said you
don't need to be here.

337
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,489
I'm fine where I am.

338
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,533
If Claire leaves, I leave.

339
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,287
So be it. I'm not being
redundant. I'm just being thorough.

340
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,623
Luke is innocent.

341
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,418
Claire, I got this. I'm good.

342
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,129
I know you do. It's just frustrating.

343
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,632
Officer Albini in the park?

344
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,218
[Luke] I wasn't even in the state.

345
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,762
Claire and I went to Georgia.

346
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,554
What were you doing in Georgia?

347
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,807
Unfinished business.

348
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,642
You said no more secrets.

349
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,067
You don't have any scars.

350
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,986
The doctor who did this to me...

351
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:41,866
with Claire's help, did
it again, and I got better.

352
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,661
The officer in the park? Damon Boone?

353
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,207
Just match the fist prints from the
suit and gloves that Stryker was wearing.

354
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,625
All of that was Stryker.

355
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,669
Why didn't you just come to me?

356
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,962
I didn't know you.

357
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,256
I stayed out of it.

358
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,425
Until you were right
in the center of it.

359
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,885
They killed Pop.

360
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,262
They did.

361
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:08,017
I couldn't just lay in the cut anymore.

362
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,812
Pop knew about my abilities.

363
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,355
So I put them to good use.

364
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,067
<i>I shut down Crispus Attucks personally.</i>

365
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,029
That wasn't your job.

366
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:26,577
People needed someone that didn't require
a warrant or shield to get things done.

367
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,622
Call it a vigilante, or a superhero...

368
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,041
Call it what you will, but...

369
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,376
[sighs] like it or not,

370
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,881
<i>I finally accepted that
that someone had to be me.</i>

371
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,549
Maybe I could've helped you.

372
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,969
This burden is bigger than you.

373
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,262
Or me.

374
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,014
People are scared...

375
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:51,143
but they can't be
paralyzed by that fear.

376
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,771
You have to fight for what's
right every single day,

377
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,816
bulletproof skin or not.

378
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:01,070
You can't just not snitch, or turn
away or take money under the table

379
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,114
because life has turned you sour.

380
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,991
When did people stop caring?

381
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:10,704
Harlem is supposed to
represent our hopes and dreams.

382
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,290
<i>It's the pinnacle of black art...</i>

383
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,876
<i>politics...</i>

384
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,460
<i>innovation.</i>

385
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,631
It's supposed to be a
shining light to the world.

386
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:25,677
It's our responsibility to push forward,

387
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,515
so that the next generation
will be further along than us.

388
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,727
Pop said his mantra aloud twice a day.

389
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,938
The kids in the shop were pissed...

390
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,941
but they could never unhear it.

391
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,817
"Never backwards..."

392
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,194
Always...

393
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,530
forward.

394
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,697
"Forward..."

395
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,074
"Always."

396
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,413
You forget I grew up around the man.

397
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,206
I wish I could've met him.

398
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,458
In a way, you have.

399
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,339
Well, hello!

400
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,133
Doesn't everybody have work to do?

401
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,429
Is Mariah still in there?

402
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,597
Yeah.

403
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,809
Well, now that I'm
no longer a suspect...

404
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,187
you guys got any take-out menus?

405
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,940
I'm starving.

406
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,901
You know, I kept telling
Cornell it was enough.

407
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:28,615
He had enough money to keep
Harlem's Paradise flush.

408
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,661
Even for opening
another club downtown...

409
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,248
like our grandmother
always talked about.

410
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,001
[takes deep breath]

411
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,047
He had the talent to make it big.

412
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:50,054
But there was always another
deal, another detail. [sniffles]

413
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,182
And then this... this guy, Diamond Jim.

414
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,641
Diamondback.

415
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,561
Yes, Diamondback.

416
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,399
Cornell said that he
was his direct contact,

417
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,900
[stammering] whatever that means.

418
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:07,613
And he was pissed off when
those guns were stolen.

419
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:12,284
You know, in that... that thing that
your Detective Scarfe got caught up in?

420
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,870
There were a lot of dirty hands.

421
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,913
Not Cornell's.

422
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,708
- He didn't have the guns.
- Oh, yes, he did.

423
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,045
That's why Detective Scarfe got shot.

424
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,965
Detective Scarfe stole
them from evidence

425
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,343
and then gave them back to Cornell.

426
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,054
[stammers] I don't know any details.

427
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:36,683
I just know that Cornell
was scared and he wanted out.

428
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,936
And the night when I came into the club,

429
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:44,025
that big brother that was fighting
Luke Cage up on Malcolm X...

430
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:48,320
"Hey," I screamed, and he... he
pulled a gun on me and said that...

431
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:52,616
if I didn't say it was Luke
Cage, he was gonna kill me.

432
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,119
He said Luke Cage?

433
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,289
- That it had to be Luke Cage?
- Yes.

434
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,792
He was firm about that. Luke Cage. Yes!

435
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,297
- And Candace Miller?
- Oh, God. Candace. [inhales deeply]

436
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,717
She tried to protect me,
but she didn't have to.

437
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,512
[stammers]

438
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,389
I feel terrible...

439
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,891
that a decent man's
name has been maligned,

440
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:22,604
but I will do whatever I need
to to rectify that. I will.

441
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,362
You are absolutely
goddamn right you will.

442
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,114
[door closes]

443
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,283
Start by telling the truth.

444
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,747
I am not a liar, Detective.

445
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:41,998
[Misty] Mmm.

446
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,000
According to the lab...

447
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,338
Cottonmouth was struck
in the back of the head

448
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,548
by a heavy, circular object...

449
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,636
probably consistent with a
bottle, before he was pushed.

450
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,306
[Ridley] How do we know
he was pushed, Detective?

451
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,724
The angle.

452
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:03,104
[Mariah screaming] No! No! No!

453
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,440
I did not want it!

454
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,608
[Stokes groans]

455
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,692
No!

456
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,903
[Misty] Cottonmouth landed on his back,

457
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,657
- turned over, and then crawled.
- [Stokes groaning]

458
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,285
[Mariah] You shut up!

459
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,621
No!

460
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:24,082
- No, I didn't want it!
- [breathing heavily]

461
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,543
[Misty] Judging by the
wounds on his hands,

462
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:29,421
he probably was pleading for his life

463
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:33,884
when he was smashed by
a heavy, circular base.

464
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:38,680
Now, the coroner thought it
was maybe a heavy waste basket.

465
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,141
But my vote...

466
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,851
it was a mic stand.

467
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,855
I went through Harlem's Paradise
inventory records with the stage manager,

468
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,690
and it turns out...

469
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:52,528
there was a mic stand
that was unaccounted for.

470
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,157
I've been around the music
business my whole life.

471
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,992
Equipment goes missing.

472
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,995
You can't trust niggas around equipment.

473
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:05,832
- Cottonmouth was weakened.
- [Ridley clears throat]

474
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,960
It wouldn't take a man
to kill him in that state,

475
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,630
just somebody who was angry...

476
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,091
and passionate about seeing him dead.

477
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,094
And...

478
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,556
someone who was sloppy...

479
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,016
in the cover-up.

480
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,357
[Candace] <i>Mariah killed him.</i>

481
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,234
[Misty] <i>What?</i>
<i>How do you know this?</i>

482
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,152
[Candace] <i>I heard them talking about it.</i>

483
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,363
<i>The guy who always wears sunglasses...</i>

484
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,990
<i>he was there, trying
to calm Mariah down.</i>

485
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,495
And that's just a taste.

486
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,373
I got plenty more where that came from.

487
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,419
I...

488
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,298
- I'm...
- [Misty] You don't have to say anything.

489
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,091
Just tell the truth.

490
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,177
We are right here.

491
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,138
Make a deal.

492
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:05,517
If you can help us nail
Shades and Diamondback,

493
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,936
and maybe confirm some
of Cornell's contacts,

494
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,605
we can make your stay...

495
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,190
a little bit easier.

496
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,569
That's all you got.

497
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:21,032
Cornell liked fooling around
with them nasty-ass bitches.

498
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,244
I... I had no use for chickenheads.

499
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,953
You are going down.

500
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,331
Go to trial with that flimsy-ass shit.

501
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,959
I dare you. I double
damn dare you, trick!

502
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,669
Oh! Trick?

503
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,132
Whatever... Madam Inmate.

504
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,137
- Misty.
- Not right now.

505
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,305
Now.

506
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:59,195
- Don't you ever, and I mean, ever...
- Misty.

507
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,740
Interrupt an interrogation.

508
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,908
What is it?

509
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,826
Detective Chang just caught a body.

510
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,247
An African-American woman,
mid-twenties, in front of a bodega.

511
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,459
The victim had a pay-as-you-go
phone in her pocket.

512
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,586
<i>I traced the phone's credit card.</i>

513
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,589
It belongs to you.

514
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,927
<i>Chang thought you might've gotten
cloned, but you bought the phone...</i>

515
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,179
and you activated it.

516
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,932
And the victim...

517
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,061
had numerous text exchanges
with an NYPD cell phone number.

518
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,146
It's yours.

519
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:36,400
Come on. Where are you, Misty?

520
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,859
I'm right here.

521
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,284
How recent were the texts?

522
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,120
I lost my phone...

523
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,917
at the barber shop.

524
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,922
Show me the picture, Bailey.

525
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,635
- We should verify with the family first.
- Show me the goddamn picture, Bailey.

526
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,095
Please.

527
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,893
[Bailey] The victim appears
to be Candace Miller.

528
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,449
Was that an important call, my dear?

529
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,992
- You murdered her!
- Hey, hey, hey!

530
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,595
- You murdered her!
- You are out of control.

531
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:29,819
- Misty, stop!
- Get off of me!

532
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,806
- You're hysterical. She's being...
- You murdered her!

533
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,391
- She's being hysterical.
- You murdered Candace

534
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,125
and you murdered Cornell.

535
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,793
- Enough is enough!
- What?

536
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,855
- What are you talking about?
- [Ridley] What is going on?

537
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,797
Candace is dead.

538
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,215
What?

539
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,594
You stole my phone. I know it was you!

540
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,514
You will say anything
about me, won't you?

541
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,432
Where's your proof?

542
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,393
I loved my cousin.

543
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:53,810
[scoffs]

544
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,312
And I would test that love

545
00:30:56,397 --> 00:31:00,401
against the recorded voice
of a dead whore any day.

546
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:04,363
Am I still being charged with anything?

547
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,202
- [clattering]
- No.

548
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,288
Not at this time.

549
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,499
[Mariah inhales deeply]

550
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,212
You have the man who killed Cornell,

551
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,383
Diamondback, in custody, Priscilla.

552
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,051
Do the right thing.

553
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,930
Keep him there. He is dangerous.

554
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,192
That is the second time you
have attacked a civilian in here.

555
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,528
This shield...

556
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,572
ain't worth the tin it's printed on

557
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:51,493
if Mariah Dillard can just walk
out of here after what she's done.

558
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,288
- This system is broken, Priscilla.
- Mercedes...

559
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,541
you are one of the finest
detectives I have ever seen,

560
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,543
but you have got to learn...

561
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,587
that there is no getting
around the system.

562
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,088
You must work within it.

563
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,632
Candace should have been
in protective custody.

564
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,885
She should have been here and
I should have known about it.

565
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,806
Mariah Dillard walked out
of here today because of you.

566
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,101
Because you didn't trust our system.

567
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,440
Because you didn't trust me.

568
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,284
[sobs]

569
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,163
[Claire sighs]

570
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,627
Misty's been gone a long time. [sighs]

571
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:43,962
That's never good.

572
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:46,840
No.

573
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,137
We have a lot to talk about, though.

574
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,516
Like what?

575
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,267
Your future.

576
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,311
Your next moves.

577
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,065
[sighs] Well, I don't wanna
talk about that right now.

578
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,692
[inhales deeply]

579
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,736
I just wanna chill.

580
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,446
It's been a long day.

581
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,831
You're right. It can wait.

582
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,751
You wanna get coffee
when we get out of here?

583
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,755
You accused me of not liking coffee.

584
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,090
That's not true.

585
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,301
Just depends on the blend.

586
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:37,808
I hear that Cuban coffee
is particularly robust.

587
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,813
[dishes clattering]

588
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,029
That might be the corniest
thing you've said yet.

589
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,202
It also happens to be true.

590
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,347
Oh, thank you.

591
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,641
Helping a sister out.

592
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:21,810
[chuckles]

593
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,021
The hero of Harlem.

594
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,065
Congratulations!

595
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,651
You are good for the neighborhood.

596
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,402
[Luke] You're not.

597
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,154
What about our deal?

598
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,449
- Where's the file?
- What file?

599
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,577
Buh-bye!

600
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,341
What the hell happened?

601
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,926
They killed Candace.

602
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,763
What? My mom...

603
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:01,182
Not your mom. She's
fine. We checked on her.

604
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,146
Shades or somebody used my phone

605
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,607
to lure Candace out of the apartment.

606
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,734
But I can't prove it yet.

607
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,152
What about her confession?

608
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,070
- It's worthless.
- Why?

609
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,490
If she were still alive,
that would be one thing.

610
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:21,620
But she admitted to
taking money from Mariah,

611
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,580
she changed her statement,
and now she's dead.

612
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,625
The definition of reasonable doubt.

613
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:30,170
And the woman she's accusing
is politically connected.

614
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:34,049
It's unwinnable. There's no
way the DA will take that case.

615
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,301
That's why Ridley just kicked her.

616
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,514
Mariah and Shades will talk. Trust me.

617
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,517
I told her not to leave.

618
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,146
I know.

619
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,195
[man] Carl Lucas,

620
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,906
I'm Marshal Franco.
This is Marshal Johnson.

621
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,039
You're under arrest for your
unlawful escape from Seagate Prison.

622
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,248
What are you doing?

623
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,667
You won't need those.

624
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,919
- Says who?
- [Luke] Says me.

625
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:12,838
I'm done running.

626
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,089
I'm sorry, Mr. Cage.

627
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,342
I'm gonna recommend the New York City
DA's office drop all charges against you.

628
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,760
I have done all I can.

629
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,804
Thank you for all you've done for us.

630
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,513
Luke is innocent.

631
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,809
They're not arresting Luke Cage.
They're arresting Carl Lucas.

632
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,311
Who called you?

633
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:32,691
Once a city councilwoman identified
Luke Cage as Carl Lucas on television,

634
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,735
our office received numerous calls.

635
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,527
The information's pertinent and valid.

636
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,072
Mariah, again.

637
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,242
I'm innocent, and I can prove it.

638
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,995
It doesn't matter what you can prove.

639
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,247
You still owe the state of Georgia time.

640
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,417
[sighs] Okay.

641
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,090
Sorry.

642
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,217
Coffee's gonna have to wait, babe.

643
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,810
[Claire] Luke.

644
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:41,509
Like I said, I know a
really great lawyer in town.

645
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,886
I'll call him.

646
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,305
[sighs] Okay.

647
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,893
- Be careful.
- Always.

648
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:51,978
[chuckles softly]

649
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,605
You're so corny.

650
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,963
[Mariah] One of the things
that was happening was...

651
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,714
[continues speaking indistinctly]

652
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,610

653
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,200
[sighs]

654
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,120
Alex, you're the man.

655
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,123
Anything you need, Madam
Councilwoman, let me know.

656
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:58,003
It's old school. But
it's got a nice feel.

657
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,380
Belonged to Cornell.

658
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,382
It suits you.

659
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,469
[chuckles softly]

660
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,181
Yeah, it does.

661

[sighs]

664
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,404
It's a long trip. You
want something to drink?

665
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,366
I was set up for something hot and
dark before y'all messed that up.

666
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,784
[scoffs]

667
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,661
Sweet Christmas.

668
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:35,123
Well, we can stop for coffee at
Dunkin' Donuts before we hit the bridge.

669
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,918
Ain't the same.

670
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,544
Let's just get this over with.

671
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,301
Oh. I like Chester
Himes. This is a good one.

672
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,468
It's actually mine.

673
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,888
What were you reading before?

674
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,973
- [sighs]
- Some West Coast shit.

675
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,099
Michael Connelly.

676
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,643
- You ever read Harry Bosch?
- Nah.

677
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,812
Well, you'll have some time to read now.

678
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,149
No, I won't.

679
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,318
I don't plan on hibernating.

680
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,861
I was innocent before
and I'm innocent now.

681
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,489
I've got work to do.

682

688
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,792
Always.
