<i>Episode 20</i>

20
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,410
Brother, you caught a cold last night.

21
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,130
I cooked some ginger soup to toxify your body.

22
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,970
Drink more of this.

23
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,180
I don't want to drink it.

24
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,290
I already said that I don't want it.

25
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,710
I know that you find it hard to accept in your heart.

26
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,290
Letting go of your beloved one is very painful.

27
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,540
But if you fall in love with someone whom you shouldn't love, it will only bring more pain.

28
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,370
You need to balance things out.

29
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,130
As the head of the Jiang family, I would like to request that

30
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,800
for the sake of the Jiang family, for mother and my sake,

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,010
you must choose the right decision.

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

This is Wu Cai Hong's slave contract.

34
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,780
Brother. I am doing this for your own good.

<i>Jiang's Mansion</i>

36
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,490
Young Master.

37
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,190
Come in.

38
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,340
Young Master... Miss, Mr Zhou and Miss Wu are waiting for you.

39
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,680
I get it.

40
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,030
Brother.

41
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,010
I know what I should do.

42
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,550
What's wrong?

43
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,770
Did my father

44
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,900
really do something wrong to the Jiang family?

45
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:06,280
What your father did to the Jiang family, it's not something that could be forgiven with a mere apology.

46
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,730
Everything you encountered now, compared to during that time,

47
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,860
is considered as a minor crime.

48
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,450
Wu Cai Hong, listen carefully.

49
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:22,500
Your father caused all the past hardships to the Jiang family.

50
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,760
Every dress that you wore, every meal that you had,

51
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:32,160
- everything that you used are stained with the blood of the Jiang family. <br>- My father is not that kind of man.

52
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,710
Jiang Yu, tell me.

53
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,110
- Is what she said is true? <br>- Everything that I have said is true.

54
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,180
The grudge that we had for your father started twelve years ago,

55
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,060
the need to support widows and children of Jiang family and to live under Lu's only power.

56
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,670
For twelve years we have thought about only one thing in the time of hardships.

57
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,650
Revenge.

58
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,650
Do you still need me to explain this further?

59
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,560
Acquiring Ling Long. Torturing you...

60
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,070
this was part of my brother and my plan.

61
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,740
We planned this for twelve years.

62
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,570
Swallowing Linglong and always finding a way to torture me...

63
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,340
Was it all for revenge?

64
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,060
Why did you help me to find out who the killer of my father was?

65
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,570
When I was depressed,

66
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:34,070
why did you take me to the pond to appreciate the lotus flowers?

67
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,230
You even risked your life to save me from the pond.

68
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,900
Was all that done for revenge?

69
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,620
What's wrong? You are still not giving up?

70
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,960
Do you think that by my brother did all this because his heart was moved by you?

71
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,550
Stop dreaming.

72
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,630
How could my brother have feelings for someone whom he holds a grudge against?

73
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,550
Brother, she wants to listen from you personally.

74
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,090
Tell her and let her give up now.

75
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,160
Listen carefully.

76
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,970
Everything that I had done was for revenge.

77
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,940
I caused you to misunderstand and you thought too much about it. Sorry.

78
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,760
Cai Hong.

79
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,230
Did you listen well?

80
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:40,170
If you did, get lost. Don't let us see you again.

81
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,580
Don't go overboard when you speak.

82
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,980
Cai Hong didn't do anything to harm your family.

83
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,200
I'm here today to let Cai Hong know about the truth.

84
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,140
In the future, if you do anything to harm Cai Hong again, I will never let you off.

85
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,600
Are you done talking?

86
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,790
If you are done, get lost.

87
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,350
Jiang Yu.

88
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,590
If you were doing this for revenge,

89
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,890
your tactics

90
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,420
were really excellent.

91
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,900
Cai Hong.

92
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,710
Everything is clear now. Let's go.

93
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,710
Brother.

94
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,490
Our grudges between the Jiang and Wu families are now in the past.

95
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,080
So, my father

96
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,430
was really the killer of Jiang Yu's father.

97
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,620
Cai Hong. It was a grudge during that era. It has nothing to do with you.

98
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,560
I'm my father's daughter.

99
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,460
I should pay his debts.

100
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,540
Cai Hong.

101
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,140
I let you know this not to cause you pain.

102
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,010
I deserved everything that Jiang Yu did to me.

103
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,270
Cai Hong. Regardless of whether you are Wu Hong Da's daughter or not,

104
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,330
what I did was to protect you.

105
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,790
Starting from today,

106
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,960
I won't let the Jiang family harm you again.

107
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,910
Let's go back.

108
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,660
Jiang Yu is really despicable.

109
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,270
Even if he has complaints against our family and we did something wrong to him,

110
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,900
he should state it clearly. How could he bully such a young girl?

111
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,680
He is not a man at all.

112
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
Don't you think so?

113
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,330
What Brother Shao Tian said were lies. I don't believe that father was a bad man.

114
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,930
Sis. Brother Shao Tian is joking with us, right?

115
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,700
Mom. Tell Brother Shao Tian that father was not that kind of man.

116
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,060
Stepmom.

117
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,700
Did you know about the incident twelve years ago?

118
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,610
Child.

119
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,320
How could I know about his work?

120
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,740
Regarding the opium investigation, it was a widely known incident.

121
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,960
Furthermore, Father was the main person in charge. How could you not know?

122
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,450
By the way, that's right...

123
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,550
talking about this, at that time, it seems like...

124
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,740
there was really opium.

125
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,900
At that time,

126
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,290
it was a hot topic in the streets.

127
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,800
What happened to the suspect?

128
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,750
I heard that he committed suicide.

129
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,960
What was his name?

130
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,740
It has been so many years. How could I still remember?

131
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,760
How did my father become the boss of Ling Long?

132
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,240
From that time onwards,

133
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,600
his luck turned around and our family became better.

134
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,160
it did not turned around. He became a ruthless predator.

135
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,130
Sis. How could this be possible? Was father really such a bad person?

136
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:17,430
You already read it. Dad wronged the Jiang family.

137
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,670
I don't believe it. Father was not a bad person.

138
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,630
He helped some orphans with their education and hospitalisation.

139
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,680
Everyone respected him.

140
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,690
You can't accuse him falsely.

141
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,270
If not, he won't die peacefully in...

142
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,600
Sorry. Cai Yun. I didn't do this on purpose.

143
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,910
I only wanted you to see the truth.

144
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,050
This is not the truth. Father was a good man.

145
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,180
- Listen to my explanation. <br>- I don't want to. You are all talking nonsense.

146
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,190
Cai Yun!

147
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,630
I don't want to listen.

148
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,180
Cai Yun is still young.

149
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,410
She will be fine after a period of time.

150
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,050
<i>My father was a supporter of the foreign efforts movement. He was a rich businessman. </i>

151
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,350
<i>but he was sabotaged by someone later and framed for</i>

152
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,160
<i>for housing opiates. This resulted in my father's death.</i>

153
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,580
<i>The reason that the court officials gave us was that he committed suicide.</i>

154
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,950
<i>When my father passed away,</i>

155
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,370
<i>the factory was confiscated. My house was occupied.</i>

156
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,340
<i>You could say that we went bankrupt overnight.</i>

157
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,140
<i>I kept asking God why he did this to me?</i>

158
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,000
<i>My parents are the nicest people in the world.</i>

159
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,750
<i>Why did they have to suffer all that?</i>

160
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,670
<i>Furthermore, those bad people could escape the law.</i>

161
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,370
<i>It was really a difficult period at that time</i>

162
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,280
<i>but I continue to hang on</i>

163
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,550
<i>because of revenge.</i>

164
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,790
<i>Listen carefully. Everything that I have done was for revenge.</i>

165
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,970
<i>I caused you to misunderstand and imagine too much. Sorry.</i>

166
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,630
I finally understand

167
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,430
why Jiang Ju treated me that way.

168
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,510
Always a tyrant and so moody,

169
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,480
he even tormented me.

170
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,880
Taking into consideration the loss of Jiang family,

171
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,390
his torments to me are nothing.

172
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,990
Cai Hong.

173
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,840
You are too kind.

174
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,480
Moreover, the kindness of that generation had nothing to do with you.

175
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,450
How Jiang Yu treated you,

176
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,770
you can use revenge on him too.

177
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,800
With such a person like Jiang Yu,

178
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,260
you really should not be so kind- hearted.

179
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,390
What should I do then?

180
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,430
Don't tell me that I should be like Jiang Yu harbouring grudges

181
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:33,570
and let the next generation of the Jiang and Wu families forever harbour this grudge too?

182
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,240
I'm the daughter of a killer.

183
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,640
Even if he torments me,

184
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,070
I don't blame him.

185
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,140
You are really a foolish girl.

186
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,570
I am foolish.

187
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,150
That's why I was foolishly taken advantage by him.

188
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,540
I even harmed you.

189
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,110
Cai Hong.

190
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,850
Everything is already in the past.

191
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,920
Starting from today. I only want you.

192
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:31,980
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

193
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,600
Mr Zhou. You are looking good today.

194
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,770
One look and I can tell that you have defeated your rival in love and got the fair lady.

195
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,290
Miss Lu. You are joking. It was fortunate that you helped.

196
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:02,110
Don't worry. I have started to investigate about the secret formula.

197
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,390
Mr Zhou. You are a very smart man. You already know what I want when I didn't even say anything yet.

198
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,210
I wouldn't dare to forget about what you wanted.

199
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,590
Please make it quick then. I have been waiting for that secret formula for more than ten years.

200
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:20,230
I'm curious about what the secret formula is that it has been committed in your memory.

201
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,460
Once you see this secret formula, you will be like me.

202
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,350
When I was young, I was fortunate to see the textile that was dyed by this secret formula.

203
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,460
It was extremely beautiful. After such a long time,

204
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,110
I can still remember it clearly.

205
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:46,590
As long as we use this secret formula to dye the textiles and release them into the market,

206
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,720
the big factories in this industry will go bankrupt immediately.

207
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,770
To say it in an extreme manner, whoever gets a hold of this secret formula

208
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,850
will be able to control the dyeing business in the whole nation.

209
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:03,060
Hence, this secret formula to me, no, to Rong Da,

210
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,590
is of great importance.

211
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,920
But there is something I don't understand.

212
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,170
You have a huge network.

213
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,290
Is there anything else in Huzhou that you are not capable of doing?

214
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,480
Why do you, just because of a minor secret formula,

215
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,190
waste so much energy on it?

216
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,210
You even specially instructed me to do it.

217
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,780
I'm afraid that you are the only person who can get this secret formula.

218
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,620
Thus, please find out immediately.

219
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,410
As to why, you will find out soon.

220
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,370
- Brother. <br>- Enter.

221
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,110
Brother.

222
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,190
Brother.

223
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,900
Fei Fei, accompany me on a tour of the workshop.

224
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,710
Also, tell the staff that we will have a meeting in one hour.

225
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:07,270
♫<i> So long, I have waited for so long... </i>♫

226
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:13,510
♫<i> Waited for your love to bloom. </i>♫

227
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:19,970
♫<i> Desperately, I was desperately struggling to find... </i>♫

228
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:26,310
♫<i> Yet couldn't find the way to your heart. </i>♫

229
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:32,900
♫<i> Gently, I gently tried to inquire </i>♫

230
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:39,100
♫<i> but did not ask you whether I was your fated love. </i>♫

231
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:45,490
♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

232
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:52,120
♫<i> In the end I did not get your heart. </i>♫

233
00:21:54,290 --> 00:22:00,710
♫<i> I'm not willing to give up (the love), but I can't have it either. </i>♫

234
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:07,210
♫<i> I fight a bitter battle between advancing and retreating. </i>♫

235
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:13,500
♫<i> I didn't see through to your eyes or heart </i>♫

236
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,380
♫<i> but I've already fallen in love with your tenderness. </i>♫

237
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,900
<i>Brother. If you can't forget her,</i>

238
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,690
<i>you will only hurt deeper. Please forget her.</i>

239
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,900
<i>Let time heal your wounds.</i>

240
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,960
Shao Tian, look at you.

241
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,550
You buy so much stuff every time you are here. Do you know how expensive these are?

242
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,810
Don't do this again. I won't be happy.

243
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,200
It's nothing much.

244
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,980
Madam Wu. Cai Yun is not in?

245
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,610
Of course, she's not at home. She has gone to school.

246
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,340
We are a republic country now. Girls should study more

247
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,290
so that they can marry into a good family.

248
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,390
I see.

249
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,260
Brother. Why don't I wait outside for you?

250
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,010
It's such a luxurious place here. I don't feel comfortable.

251
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,430
Cai Hong. Shao Tian is here. Come out now.

252
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,960
Cai Hong.

253
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,030
Come.

254
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,320
- Brother Shao Tian. <br>- Did you have a good sleep last night?

255
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,570
She didn't. In the middle of the night,

256
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,040
I could hear her sighing from my room.

257
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,480
The incident happened so many years ago.

258
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,700
Let it go as it's already in the past.

259
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,160
Even if your father really did that,

260
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,780
he was only doing business. It's a free market in Huzhou.

261
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,370
Why do you keep throwing dirty water at your father?

262
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,390
This child.

263
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:14,220
I heard that Boss Wu has Jiang Wen Yuan's secret formula.

264
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,450
What secret formula? I have never heard of this.

265
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,400
I seem to have some impression.

266
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,950
That year, he held a piece of paper

267
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,870
like it was something very precious. He wouldn't take it to the factory either.

268
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,600
He hid it at home and wouldn't let me ask him about it.

269
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,010
Was there a special place for this secret formula?

270
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm a housewife. I don't know much about this.

271
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,720
Moreover, it has been so many years, I have forgotten about it.

272
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,070
That's right. It has been so many years.

273
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,210
We don't even know where the secret formula is.

274
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,150
It seems like he kept this formula

275
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,130
in his safe.

276
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:04,100
But after the Wu family's business was acquired, I don't know where it went.

277
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,990
Brother Shao Tian. Why are you suddenly asking about this?

278
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,860
Shao Tian. Is that secret formula worth a lot of money?

279
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,090
Frankly, it's not that simple as it being worth a lot of money.

280
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,230
That's right. On the morning of his incident,

281
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,990
I saw him taking out a piece of paper from his safe.

282
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,790
I think it must have been that secret formula.

283
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:35,930
Cai Hong. When you last cleaned the safe, did you see it?

284
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:41,970
No. There were only documents like the house deeds in the safe.

285
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:47,180
It must be the secret formula that he took that day.

286
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,140
If the secret formula was in Boss Wu's hands,

287
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,770
why didn't the police find it when they were searching the place?

288
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:01,420
So to say, that killer took the secret formula from my father?

289
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:06,210
You may be right. The murder's motivation of going there could have been this.

290
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:09,630
There is only one person who knows that the secret formula was with your father.

291
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,430
Jiang Yu.

292
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,330
Do you have any evidence?

293
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,870
Shao Tian is right. Jiang Yu is your fathers' killer.

294
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,700
He was also the one who took the secret formula.

295
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,400
Forget it. You are still not feeling well. Let's not talk about this.

296
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,000
Let's go out for a walk. It will be good for your health.

297
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,520
I would like to take a walk alone and see if I can find a suitable job at the same time.

298
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,710
Cai Hong.

299
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:46,370
You don't want to be a lady of leisure and insist on working outside.

300
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:50,480
Aren't you making it difficult for yourself?

301
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,750
Frankly, it's not a bad idea. We are republic country now.

302
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:59,140
It's also right that Cai Hong wants to be a new generation woman with a career.

303
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,790
- I will go with you. <br> - You really don't need to.

304
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,250
Come home early then.

305
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,230
I'm really worried about this child.

306
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,360
I'm leaving, Boss.

307
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,510
Boss, sorry to disturb you. Do you need staff here?

308
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,750
We don't need any more staff. Go and look elsewhere.

309
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,740
Thank you.

310
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:35,840
Hello, Boss. Do you need any staff here?

311
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,700
No.

312
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,380
Sorry for your trouble then.

313
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,420
Boss. Do you need staff here?

314
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,890
You don't have to pay me first.

315
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,070
When you find that I'm suitable, you can pay me later.

316
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,820
This is not a problem of suitability.

317
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,340
Even if you are suitable, we can't afford to pay you.

318
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,410
Business is not doing well lately.

319
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,780
We are a small set up. We don't need many staff.

320
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,070
Why don't you try Ling Long or Rong Da?

321
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:10,260
I heard that these two big companies need staff.

322
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,130
I know. Thank you.

341
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,540
Wait for me.

00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,380
Wait for me.

343
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,030
Stop the carriage.

344
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,350
Are you okay?

345
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,660
What are you doing here?

346
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,150
On behalf of my father,

347
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,730
I wanted to apologise to you.

348
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,370
You don't need to apologise.

349
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:03,040
The grudge between our families has already ended.

350
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,080
Take her home.

351
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,220
In the future, don't come and look for me again.

352
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,930
Thanks.

353
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,570
<i>If Jiang Yu really killed Hong Da,</i>

354
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,200
<i>he must have been discreetly at the scene</i>

355
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,470
<i>but he was not there.</i>

356
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,020
<i>The Police Chief Li Ting may be on good terms with Jiang Yu</i>

357
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,060
<i>but how such a man could go agains the palace order and</i>

358
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,500
<i>helped to be the witness for Jiang Yu.</i>

359
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,990
<i>Where is the loophole?</i>

360
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,010
Reporting, Sir. General Manager Zhou of Rong Da is here to see you.

361
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:56,530
Invite him in.

362
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:01,590
This way, please.

363
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,660
Sit.

364
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,290
I came without any notice as I would like to invite you for a meal.

365
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,220
Drunken Fairy Restaurant's Drunken Chicken.

366
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,540
General Manager. Why do you suddenly want to invite me out to a meal?

367
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,360
You even know that I love to eat drunken chicken.

368
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,530
I came here without notice to seek your advice on a matter.

369
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,030
Regarding Wu Hong Da's case, I know that on the day of the incident,

370
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,310
you and Jiang Yu were having a meal at Drunken Fairy restaurant.

371
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,740
You ordered that signature dish, the drunken chicken.

372
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,550
Mr Zhou. Why are you suddenly so interested in this?

373
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,630
I won't hide this from you. Wu Cai Hong is my girlfriend.

374
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,610
Wu Hong Da was my boss for many years.

375
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,710
Thus, the Wu family's business is my business too.

376
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:51,400
General Manager Zhou. You are a person with heart.

377
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:58,140
Miss. Brother Shao Tian wanted me to bring you here. There is something he would like you to know.

378
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,050
What is it?

379
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,660
- Look where you are going. <br>Look where you are going too.

380
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,270
- What's wrong with you? <br>- What's wrong with you too? You knocked into me.

381
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,520
If you knock into her, why are you going to pay for it?

382
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,380
Teacher Yao.

383
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,880
You are here. Many of the customers in there

384
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,130
are waiting to eat your signature dish, the drunken chicken.

385
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,510
Teacher Yao, go now.

386
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,690
Tell him to wait. The chickens are still being done.

387
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,390
If they want to eat it, they can cook them at their kitchens.

388
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,070
Who is this guy?

389
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,010
Dear customers, please come inside.

390
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,440
Your chef is really interesting. What time is it now and he just reported for work?

391
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,210
He is not afraid that the customers will bang the tables?

392
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,360
What can we do. That Teacher Yao

393
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,510
is a famous chef in Huzhou.

394
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,320
He just likes to drink.

395
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,690
He would drink till he is totally smashed every day after work.

396
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,800
He would only report for work at noon.

397
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,250
Many of our customers here

398
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,230
would wait till noon

399
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,710
but the drunken chicken that Teacher Yao cooks

400
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,580
is really good. Whoever wants to copy him, they just can't do it.

401
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,870
So, we let him get his way.

402
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,290
Some customers are willing to wait for him.

403
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:05,660
<i>Also, when I left that day, it just happened to be at noon.</i>

404
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,700
<i>I had an appointment for lunch later with Police Chief Li Ting.</i>

405
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,500
<i>Do you want to call him here for an investigation?</i>

406
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,250
By the way, I would like to ask you something.

407
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,790
Do youperhaps remember whether on the day of the Wu Hongda's accident

408
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,330
Chief Police Li Ting and the new boss of Ling Long, Jiang Yu,

409
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,970
did they dine here?

410
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,940
I don't remember about that day

411
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,130
but regarding Police Chief Li Ting and Boss Jiang,

412
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,630
I can recognise them.

413
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,610
They are famous people in Huzhou.

414
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,950
They are our regular customers.

415
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,350
Especially, Police Chief Li Ting. Every time when he's here,

416
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,980
he orders our signature dish, the drunken chicken.

417
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,780
Thank you.

418
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,710
It's like this. When Jiang Yu was being investigated by the police on that day,

419
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:55,140
he said that he wasn't at the scene and the witness was you.

420
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,110
Thus, the police called and didn't dare to ask too much about it.

421
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,650
Although, I think that was strange.

422
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,520
Thus, I came here specially to seek your advice.

423
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,120
Yes. Jiang Yu and I dined here that day.

424
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,040
Furthermore, we ordered the drunken chicken.

425
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,440
Do you remember what time Jiang Yu arrived at the restaurant?

426
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,080
I really don't remember. I only remember it was around lunch time.

427
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,270
Do you stil remember

428
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,200
when they served the food?

429
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,640
I remember this because a few of our friends were dining together.

430
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,630
Jiang Yu was a bit late. When he arrived, he was hungry.

431
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,580
We felt bad for him and ordered more food for him.

432
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,070
At that time, when they served the drunken chicken,

433
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:37,600
he said that he didn't had any appetite and didn't order anything else.

434
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,800
- Hello. <br>- Cai Hong.

435
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,400
- So how, Brother Shao Tian. <br>- I have already confirmed it with Police Chief Li Ting.

436
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,470
The day of your father's incident, when Jiang Yu reached Drunken Fairy restaurant,

437
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,440
the drunken chicken that Police Chief ordered just arrived.

438
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,700
That is to say, it couldn't be earlier than 12:20 pm.

439
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,040
I remember when the incident happened to my father,

440
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
it was at noon.

441
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,120
The Jiang family's secret formula was in your father's hands.

442
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,970
It went missing when he died. As long as we can prove that Jiang Yu took it,

443
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:18,000
he is the killer of your father then.

444
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:37,950
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

445
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,210
What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you

446
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,680
not to show up again?

447
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,560
Did you kill my father?

448
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,270
<i>I won't seek for your forgiveness.</i>

449
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,280
<i>I'm begging you</i>

450
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,930
<i>to let my family off.</i>

451
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,090
<i>Sorry.</i>

452
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,090
Shouldn't your father die?

453
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,100
He even did many unethical things.

454
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,340
Death's too good for people like him.

455
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,260
Jiang Yu. Why did you do that?

456
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,620
Why did you do that?

457
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,640
Why did you kill my father?

458
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,740
It's fine if you take revenge on me

459
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,610
but why did you do that?

460
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:56,910
I hate you. Return my father to me.

461
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,930
Return him to me. Jiang Yu, I hate you!

462
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,010
- Miss. <br>- Let me go.

463
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,580
- Miss. <br>- Jiang Yu.

464
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,460
Jiang Yu, come back.

465
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,710
- Jiang Yu. <br>- Miss, keep calm.

466
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,530
Jiang Yu, I hate you.

467
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,260
Miss.

468
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,840
Cai Hong.

469
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,160
What's wrong with you?

470
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,900
I'm fine.

471
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,990
Is it because of Jiang Yu?

472
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,610
Cai Hong. I would like to take you to a place

473
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:09,060
to see someone but you must promise me that

474
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,520
once you are there, you must listen to me and not say anything.

475
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,540
You will know once you have heard what's being said.

476
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,870
This way, please.

477
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,210
I came to disturb you without advance notice again.

478
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,790
I would like to ask you something.

479
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,540
Please ask.

480
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:48,260
I would like to know about the secret formula of the Jiang family.

481
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,520
This was my good friend who said nothing wrong.

482
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,110
- I got to know him a little. <br> - Excuse my interference.

483
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,760
That year, when Wu Hong Da wanted to get hold of the Jiang family's secret formula,

484
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,420
he harmed Jiang Wen Yuan.

485
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,430
That is most likely what happened

486
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,960
but when Old Master Jiang passed away,

487
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,480
they never saw the secret formula again.

488
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,920
After that mighty Jiang family declined.

489
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,270
Fortunately now the young Jiang master managed to buy back the house.

490
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,490
Didn't Jiang Yu learn the secret formula?

491
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:33,740
Young Master Jiang was still very young when his father passed away.

492
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:38,810
He wouldn't have passed on his secret formula to a kid.

493
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,920
To the Jiang tribe,

494
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,900
if he wanted to learn the secret formula, he would have to wait till he was an adult.

495
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,260
That was why the Jiang family could so casually

496
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,380
kick out Young Master Jiang from the family..

497
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,400
If they knew about the shrewd mind of Young Master Jiang then,

498
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,500
I believe they wouldn't have kicked him out that easily.

499
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,040
So to say, if Jiang Yu wants to get back the secret formula,

500
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,600
he could only find Wu Hong Da.

501
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:16,020
Yes. If I were Young Master Jiang,

502
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:20,130
I would ask Wu Hong Da to return the secret formula.

503
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:25,360
but I am afraid that Wu Hong Da wouldn't give it that easily to him.

504
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,990
Now that Wu Hong Da is dead,

505
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:32,660
I'm afraid that the secret formula has been lost.
