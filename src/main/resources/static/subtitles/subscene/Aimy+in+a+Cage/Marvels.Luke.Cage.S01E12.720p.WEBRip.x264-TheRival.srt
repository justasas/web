1
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:14,186
[Green] All right, here's
the plan. Triple-cuff him.

2
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:17,022
Alpha team, you take point
positions in the convoy.

3
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:19,316
Bravo team will bring up the rear.

4
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,775
Remember, we're clear to engage,

5
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:23,986
so if he so much as looks
at you funny, light him up.

6
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:25,405
[officer 1] Copy that.

7
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:28,325
You hear that, freak? I got
something special for you.

8
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:33,288
This isn't necessary.

9
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:35,832
Yeah, it is.

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,961
[indistinct chatter]

11
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:44,466
[groans]

12
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,844
No. You need to let us
finish. Ms. Knight. Ms. Knight!

13
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:50,930
It's Detective Knight, and I'm fine.

14
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:55,518
I need a moment with Cage.

15
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,979
[Green] Misty, we have special orders.

16
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:00,398
Mario, come on.

17
00:01:01,316 --> 00:01:02,817
I was just held hostage.

18
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:05,362
I just need a minute with him.

19
00:01:09,532 --> 00:01:12,369
All right. We'll be right
here. We got your back.

20
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:14,704
[officer 2] Clear!

21
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:16,914
You going down.

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,751
It's about damn time.

23
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:24,881
Cottonmouth, Officer Albini,
what just popped off in there...

24
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:29,261
Look, your friend is in the wind.

25
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:36,559
They've got public enemy number one in
handcuffs for the whole world to see...

26
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,604
so they're not looking for anybody else.

27
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:45,943
Every officer in your detail
has those modified Judas bullets.

28
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:48,821
I wouldn't try anything if I were you...

29
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:52,200
before I got to the precinct.

30
00:01:54,744 --> 00:01:57,038
You're not that crazy, are you?

31
00:01:58,831 --> 00:01:59,957
Always.

32
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:06,506
Take his ass to jail.

33
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:09,634
Come on.

34
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:16,687
[officer 2] All right,
let's go. We're rolling.

35
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:21,604
[sirens wailing]

36
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,779
Three sets of cuffs?
Isn't that overkill?

37
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:32,657
The camera's on. We need to
look like we're in control.

38
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:35,785
[officer 1] It's a shit detail.

39
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:38,871
You'd think ESU would be in the
back with those guns pointed at him.

40
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:40,790
We've got the same guns
and bullets they do.

41
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:43,168
You know, my wife says
it's the end of days,

42
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:45,086
people like him popping up.

43
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:49,006
They've been saying that
since Eve bit the apple.

44
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,675
Cage? He's evolution.

45
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:53,636
[stammers] Whatever
he is, it's just scary.

46
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,223
Makes me feel small. Insignificant.

47
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:58,140
Insecure?

48
00:02:58,225 --> 00:03:01,394
You know what they say. Once
you go black, you never go back.

49
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:03,396
At least that's what your
wife keeps telling me.

50
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,526
I was fast asleep when she came home.
Your daughter already wore me out.

51
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,069
[officer 2] Just sit tight.

52
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:16,743
God damn it.

53
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:19,329
Homeless lady. Can't they
move her out of the way?

54
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:21,724
[Green on loudspeaker] You are
in the path of a police convoy.

55
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:23,416
Clear the road immediately.

56
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,461
[tires screeching]

57
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,463
[officer 3] Come on!

58
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:31,258
[Green on loudspeaker] Cage
must not escape. Fire at will!

59
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:33,968
[officer 3] Go, go, go, go, go!

60
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:36,513
He went down the south side.

61
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:39,807
[guns firing]

62
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:42,810
[officers shouting indistinctly]

63
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:45,038
[officer 4 on radio] <i>Somebody
give me a sitrep right now!</i>

64
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:47,357
[officer 5] Team two...
Let's go, let's go!

65
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:50,610
[officers shouting indistinctly]

66
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,546
[sirens wailing]

67
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:13,633
[shotgun cocks]

68
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:21,140
Young cops always wanna chase somebody.

69
00:04:21,223 --> 00:04:23,643
Me, I'd rather be where
they're already going.

70
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:28,273
They told us these Judas bullets
can kill someone like you.

71
00:04:28,356 --> 00:04:31,150
You don't want to die? Don't run.

72
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:33,235
I'd rather die than go back to prison.

73
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,322
[scoffs] Live free or die?

74
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:37,215
You wanna get all New
Hampshire about this shit?

75
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,575
Fine with me.

76
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:42,078
- Cop killers don't survive these streets.
- I didn't kill a cop.

77
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,790
My problem isn't with you or yours.

78
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:47,500
It's much bigger than that.

79
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:50,086
Some people are calling
you a hero for what you did.

80
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,213
Connie's, Pop's...

81
00:04:52,714 --> 00:04:54,591
I'm no hero.

82
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:57,635
But I do need to take out the
person responsible for all this.

83
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:01,764
- You don't recognize me, do you?
- [sirens continue wailing]

84
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:07,520
I've seen you at Pop's before.

85
00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:11,023
Pop cut my hair for 12 years.

86
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:12,859
He didn't think he was a hero, either.

87
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:15,612
He was just trying to do some
right after years of wrong.

88
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,702
I hope I'm right about you.

89
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:26,581
More people rooting
for you than you think.

90
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:30,335
- What are you gonna tell your people?
- The truth.

91
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:32,337
I had you in my sights,
but you outran me.

92
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,838
I'm getting old.

93
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:37,467
Luke?

94
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:40,762
You better catch that
slippery son of a bitch.

95
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:54,150

00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:07,306
Moments after the tumultuous
events at Harlem's Paradise,

98
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:12,979
<i>fugitive and alleged cop killer Luke
Cage was brought out in handcuffs.</i>

99
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:14,564
<i>And now the city's most...</i>

100
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,691
[Turk] Hey, I'm glad
you called me, Willis.

101
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:19,944
Luke Cage is on the run.
They got Shades in bracelets,

102
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:22,196
but they're gonna be onto
you before long, brother.

103
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,073
Best believe that.

104
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:27,159
Getting ghost and liquidizing
your cash, that was the right move.

105
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:31,330
<i>- Luke Cage must be approached with...</i>
- [Stryker] I wouldn't touch any of that.

106
00:07:31,413 --> 00:07:32,414
[door opens]

107
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,084
[door closes]

108
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,712
People don't test me more than once.

109
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,132
- I overstand.
- Hmm.

110
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:45,177
What you need me for?

111
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:49,056
I understand you're a man
of discretion and taste

112
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,603
with numerous connections willing
to pay full price for my wares.

113
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:55,938
I can still collect from the shadows.

114
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,357
- Bad news, Diamondback.
- Take those off!

115
00:08:01,193 --> 00:08:04,363
I went to your crib. The
files you had are gone.

116
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:13,039
[choking]

117
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:15,124

118
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:17,126

[laughs]

120
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:26,928
- I had you, didn't I?
- [coughing]

121
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,930
[Stryker continues laughing]

122
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:33,685
I couldn't resist.

123
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:38,439
I like you, Zip.

124
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:41,568
You've got ambition.
It'll take you far...

125
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:43,820
as long as you stay in your place.

126
00:08:44,445 --> 00:08:46,781
The first of the 48 laws of power.

127
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:50,117
Never outshine the master.

128
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:52,912
That was the mistake Shades made.

129
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:56,207
He questioned me. He doubted
me. He tried to reach too far.

130
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,085
He was on some Icarus shit.

131
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:02,964
Do you know who that is?

132
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:06,050
Yeah, he had a verse with Kendrick.

133
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,553
- Right?
- No...

134
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:12,640
Icarus was the boy who flew too
close to the sun with fake wings.

135
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:16,518
Shades is no problem.
He's still in custody.

136
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:18,062
Not for long.

137
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,900
- You gonna blow the joint up?
- No, he's going to be bailed out.

138
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:26,988
The hell for? That don't make no sense!

139
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:29,323
See? The questioning.

140
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:31,283
That's how it starts.

141
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:32,827
[sighs]

142
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:42,461
I'm gonna have an opening.

143
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,464
You gonna step up?

144
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:47,759
I'm down to do whatever you need.

145
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:50,887
- No problem.
- [Stryker] Good boy.

146
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:53,514
So are you down?

147
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:56,308
I'm down.

148
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:59,561
As long as the business is
business, I'm good with it.

149
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:01,814
Till then, I'm out of here, man.

150
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:04,400
Show Turk out, Zip.

151
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,409
Romeo would roll over in his grave,

152
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:16,328
the way you hop-skipping
with these cats nowadays.

153
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:18,748
He was a man on these
streets. You's a boy.

154
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:20,667
What the hell are you talking about?

155
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,377
You're down here in
his pocket, same as me.

156
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,296
I'm doing business with him, yes.

157
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:30,134
But I ain't his boy. And I
definitely ain't his bitch.

158
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:42,104
- [door slams]
- [Zip scoffs]

159
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:45,441
These old-ass niggas talkin' about
shit they don't even know about.

160
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:48,069
So... what's in the box?

161
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:51,989
One of the seven deadly sins, my boy...

162
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:55,034
which I plan to unleash
on dear old Carl.

163
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:56,285
Which one?

164
00:10:58,037 --> 00:10:59,413
Wrath.

165
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,544
[in Spanish] This Diamondback
needs to be dealt with.

166
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:12,760
Ernesto is right, Domingo. This
is the perfect time to do it.

167
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:15,137
We've got the muscle.

168
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:21,643
Plus, with the Cuban, Jamaican,
Dominican and Haitian leaders dead,

169
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:26,607
we can control the
drugs, guns, all of it...

170
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:29,777
and walk out like kings.

171
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:33,740
[in English] I was there
when he took them all out.

172
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:36,117
Right next door.

173
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:39,996
We got the drugs.

174
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,956
We got that money.

175
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,542
But with the guns, we
can control everything.

176
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:48,755
Here, the islands, further south...

177
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:53,760
We'd be unstoppable. Hmm?

178
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:56,678
[Ernesto in Spanish]
So what are you saying?

179
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:00,641
[in English] We take him out.

180
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,770
We go after what's ours.

181
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:06,022
[Ernesto scoffs and chuckles]

182
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:09,691
Let's go find Diamondback.

183
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:13,612
[sighs]

184
00:12:14,696 --> 00:12:17,491
- [camera shutter clicking]
- [officer 1] Turn and face the camera.

185
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,473
[officer 2] All right,
let's go. Move it.

186
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:43,893
You're supposed to be in the hospital.

187
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,522
Push yourself too hard too soon and
you could make it worse, you know.

188
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:51,067
- I appreciate your concern.
- No, you don't.

189
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:55,112
I need you at 100%.

190
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:57,990
I need to prove Luke Cage is innocent.

191
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:00,910
Well, the hostages
have all been consistent

192
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:02,673
that Luke Cage never
held them at gunpoint.

193
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:05,206
[Misty] He was set up.
You know it, Priscilla.

194
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:07,041
Half this damn department knows it.

195
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:10,044
We need to be going
after Willis Stryker.

196
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:12,171
Well, then why is Luke Cage running?

197
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:17,426
He's a black man being
chased by the cops...

198
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,011
oh, with special bullets.

199
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:22,139
Accused of killing a cop,

200
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:24,516
and you're asking why
he's running? Come on.

201
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:33,484
Look at how relaxed
Hernan "Shades" Alvarez is.

202
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,028
He knows he's not going
anywhere anytime soon,

203
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:37,613
so he's resting up.

204
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,449
He knows he's guilty.

205
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,334
See this perp?

206
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:55,464
Look how his foot is bouncing. Nervous.

207
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:58,926
- No wonder his street name is Sugar.
- [chuckles]

208
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,071
I don't even have to say a word,
and here come the waterworks.

209
00:14:01,095 --> 00:14:03,014
He's probably innocent...

210
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:06,267
or less guilty than whoever
he's about to give up.

211
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,768
That's a detectives' wives' tale.

212
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:09,896
You can't prove guilt
or innocence by that.

213
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,314
Oh, but you can...

214
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:14,191
- because Luke gave you his word.
- Luke...

215
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:17,028
Right now, his actions are
speaking louder than his words.

216
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:18,487
Luke Cage...

217
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:21,240
saved my life.

218
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:25,661
I don't dispute that we should
be bringing in Diamondback,

219
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:28,830
but to get to the truth, we
need to bring them both in.

220
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:31,959
[indistinct chatter]

221
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:37,965
Okay, well, let me lead the charge.
Make sure Luke is brought in safely.

222
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:40,551
He threw away his chance when
he jumped out that damn van.

223
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:43,637
Now they will shoot him on
sight with the mayor's blessing.

224
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:51,687
You know what? At least let
me take a crack at Shades.

225
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,065
He's in deep with all the players.

226
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:56,901
He doesn't scare me.

227
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:58,402
- Detective...
- I can handle him.

228
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,154
You just got shot.

229
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:02,864
- I need you to go home, get some rest.
- [sighs]

230
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:07,036
I'll interview Shades.

231
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:21,717
[Mariah] My grandmother
loved Harlem's Paradise.

232
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:28,933
She took care of all the small details.

233
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:30,476
She loved it.

234
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:36,148
From the murals...

235
00:15:36,232 --> 00:15:39,360
the glasswork, all the way
down to the table linens.

236
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:42,821
No fine point was overlooked.

237
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,534
- [glass shattering]
- This was her legacy.

238
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:53,249
My family's in tatters, and it's
all because of Diamondback. Shit!

239
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,459
[stammers]

240
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:57,419
Uh, I know, I know...

241
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,339
[sighs] I need to get
out in front of this.

242
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:05,802
Release a statement about Damon
Boone and how much I respected him.

243
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:07,679
That is not what I was gonna say.

244
00:16:07,763 --> 00:16:10,641
Well, yeah, just... Please, no lectures.

245
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,647
This is just a thing.

246
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,693
Things can be rebuilt, and when you
do, you rebuild it as your legacy.

247
00:16:21,777 --> 00:16:23,279
Not just the clubs.

248
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:30,327
I want to be a part of that.

249
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:37,959
Here's what I think.

250
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:41,005
Controlling the narrative is everything.
We can't have any loose threads.

251
00:16:41,088 --> 00:16:42,464
So anyone who might have overheard

252
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:45,801
anything you said to
Diamondback or Shades in here...

253
00:16:45,884 --> 00:16:47,303
is a threat.

254
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:50,097
You're absolutely correct.

255
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:52,849
[chuckles]

256
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,893
How may I be of service?

257
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:02,151
I wouldn't want you to
do anything untoward.

258
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:04,236
Never.

259
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:07,364
Okay.

260
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:10,284
[indistinct chatter]

261
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:36,352
I don't have time for this.

262
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:39,396
- [cash rustling]
- [man 1] Don't move.

263
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,440
He'll blow your head
off. He's crazy like that.

264
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:43,109
Don't try no shit.

265
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:50,324
My bad, Meth. I grew
up on that Wu-Tang shit.

266
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:52,868
- But you know how it is.
- [Method Man] Are you serious?

267
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:55,662
Are you really trying to
have a conversation right now?

268
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:57,932
I'm just tryin'... I'm just
sayin'... You're the man, yo.

269
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:00,352
Pull your mask down! You supposed
to be watchin' the damn door, Bryce!

270
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:02,503
What I say about using my
government name, Michael?

271
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:03,837
[door chimes]

272
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:06,983
Damn, homie. You look like you
went through a cheese grater.

273
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,467
Oh, snap, you Luke...

274
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,219
- [gun firing]
- [bullet ricocheting]

275
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:12,721
- [glass shattering]
- [gasping]

276
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,518
I ain't mean that.

277
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:23,274
Give me your phone.

278
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:24,525
The phone, fool.

279
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,545
Yo, my bad, man. You know, I
just got a little nervous and shit

280
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:30,197
- when you threw my mans across the...
- [grunts]

281
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,160
It's you.

282
00:18:35,536 --> 00:18:38,247
- Yeah, it's you.
- [chuckles]

283
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,831
No, man, it's you.

284
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:43,710
Yo, man, "P.L.O. Style" was
my joint back in the day.

285
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:46,297
Sweet Christmas. [chuckles]

286
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:48,424
Yeah, man, one second.

287
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:54,596
Hey. It's me.

288
00:18:55,806 --> 00:18:57,641
Yeah, they'll be looking for me.

289
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,603
I'll lay in the cut.
I'll see you in a few.

290
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:08,152
You a double XL?

291
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:09,778
[scoffs] Way ahead of you, homie,

292
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,044
Call the cops.

293
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:28,481
I know a lot of people who would
pay you for this kind of protection.

294
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:30,382
They can keep their money.

295
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:33,260
Salute.

296
00:19:37,138 --> 00:19:38,932
[laughs]

297
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:41,768
You ever see anything like that before?

298
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:43,479
Harlem, baby.

299
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:45,689
Harlem.

300
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:47,233
[cell phone ringing]

301
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:50,527
- Hello?
- [Candace] <i>Detective Knight?</i>

302
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,154
- Candace?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

303
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:55,241
<i>What number are you calling me from?</i>

304
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:58,076
A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS.

305
00:19:58,159 --> 00:19:59,578
I need to see you.

306
00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:02,748
- Come into the precinct.
<i>- No. No.</i>

307
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:06,418
You saw how quickly Mariah sent
that lawyer and got me out of there.

308
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:10,797
You didn't wanna talk to me
before. What makes you trust me now?

309
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:12,716
<i>Because Luke Cage does.</i>

310
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,845
He saved my life. And
you saw right through me.

311
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:22,226
<i>- You want the truth, right?</i>
- Where are you?

312
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:24,353
<i>- Look, if you can't help...</i>
- Candace.

313
00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:26,938
<i>Tell me a place, and I will be there.</i>

314
00:20:31,902 --> 00:20:34,988
[Ridley] You should be at Rikers
right now, but I held you...

315
00:20:35,906 --> 00:20:38,742
because I think you
have something to say.

316
00:20:40,035 --> 00:20:41,287
Lawyer.

317
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:45,332
[chuckles] I know your
record, Mr. Alvarez.

318
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,461
Came up in Harlem, rolled around
with Cottonmouth in the late '90s,

319
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,547
spent some time at Spofford, Sing Sing,

320
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,341
then you made it to the
big time, went to Seagate.

321
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:56,552
[sighs]

322
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,138
Lawyer.

323
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:03,600
Cornell Stokes is dead,
but you're still alive.

324
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:07,228
And I've never seen an
arraignment happen so quickly.

325
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:09,273
Two million dollar bail...

326
00:21:09,356 --> 00:21:11,775
and someone paid it in cash.

327
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:15,111
Who's your new sponsor?
Is it Willis Stryker?

328
00:21:16,196 --> 00:21:17,281
Law...

329
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:19,325
yer.

330
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:24,079
You were part of a
hostage situation, Hernan.

331
00:21:25,622 --> 00:21:28,041
Even if your lawyer does get you out...

332
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:31,545
you won't be walking away from that.

333
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:35,090
That's multiple kidnapping
and weapons charges.

334
00:21:35,173 --> 00:21:38,802
How does 25 years to life
sound to you? Minimum.

335
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,887
Are you serious?

336
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:43,599
Yep.

337
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:48,854
Okay.

338
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:51,357
[scoffs]

339
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:53,775
Okay.

340
00:21:54,943 --> 00:21:55,986
[scoffs]

341
00:21:57,028 --> 00:21:58,947
I... I was in the club.

342
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,198
[clears throat]

343
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:02,868
I saw what happened.

344
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:06,162
I know who did it.

345
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:10,041
- Okay.
- [inhales deeply]

346
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,962
We can protect you, but
I need a name to verify.

347
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,089
Who was it?

348
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,261
Was it Stryker?

349
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:27,476
He goes by...

350
00:22:30,228 --> 00:22:31,438
lawyer.

351
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,984
You need me to spell it?

352
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,361
[laughing]

353
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:41,990
[door slams]

354
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:58,298
- You call this safe?
- We're hiding in plain sight.

355
00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:01,552
I've got you. For now.

356
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:04,971
Lie to me again, Candace, I walk away
from here, and you are on your own.

357
00:23:05,055 --> 00:23:07,307
- It's not bullshit.
- We'll see.

358
00:23:08,975 --> 00:23:11,770
How did you even get out of Harlem's
Paradise without being stopped?

359
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:15,524
They were so busy trying to
arrest Luke, I just walked away.

360
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:20,236
So what is it?

361
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,200
What do you need to tell
me that's so important?

362
00:23:22,238 --> 00:23:23,449
[sighs]

363
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:28,411
I was at the club the
night Cottonmouth died.

364
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,289
I already know that.

365
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,084
I mean right after.

366
00:23:41,758 --> 00:23:43,301
[sighs]

367
00:23:53,645 --> 00:23:54,688
[beeps]

368
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:00,151
Mariah killed him.

369
00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:03,905
[Shades] The trash bag is for
the clothes you're wearing now.

370
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:07,117
Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too.

371
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,495
Someone from Spurlock's
will incinerate them.

372
00:24:10,537 --> 00:24:14,791
The secret to any good lie is it
has to run parallel to the truth.

373
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,794
[Misty] <i>How do you know this?</i>

374
00:24:17,878 --> 00:24:19,921
[Candace] <i>I heard them talking about it.</i>

375
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:21,172
[Shades] Do what I say.

376
00:24:21,256 --> 00:24:24,259
[Candace] <i>The guy who always</i>
<i>wears sunglasses, he was there.</i>

377
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,181
<i>It was his idea to say Luke
Cage killed Cottonmouth.</i>

378
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:36,647
[grunts]

379
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:41,401
I was so scared.

380
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:43,862
I snuck out of there,
back to the lockers.

381
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:46,782
And, um, I was trying
to calm myself down.

382
00:24:48,408 --> 00:24:50,368
When I went upstairs,
the guy with the glasses

383
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:53,079
offered me $50,000 to tell a story.

384
00:24:55,248 --> 00:24:56,457
So I told one.

385
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:01,254
- Why are you coming clean now?
- 'Cause I can't live with this.

386
00:25:02,213 --> 00:25:04,591
Especially after Luke saving my life.

387
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:08,554
If you can guarantee my safety,

388
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:11,723
I will testify about
everything I just told you.

389
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:15,977
[phone beeps]

390
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:23,484
Mariah scares me more than Cottonmouth.

391
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:30,033
I asked her if she thought Luke did
it, mostly to see if I could trust her.

392
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:32,535
To see if she would tell me the truth.

393
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:40,293
She looked me right
in my eye and said...

394
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,923
"You never know what
anyone is capable of."

395
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:48,927
[breath trembling] It
was the way she said it.

396
00:25:50,303 --> 00:25:53,098
She... she would kill me if
she knew I was speaking to you.

397
00:25:53,181 --> 00:25:54,891
I truly believe that.

398
00:25:56,977 --> 00:25:58,561
Thank you for helping me.

399
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:04,610
I'm gonna nail Mariah
Dillard's ass to the wall.

400
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,700
- Who else knows that you're here?
- Just my friend Leslie.

401
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:15,328
Don't call anyone else, not even Leslie.

402
00:26:16,663 --> 00:26:18,263
As a matter of fact, give me your phone.

403
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:20,876
Come on.

404
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,842
Okay. Now, I picked this
up... on the way, just in case.

405
00:26:30,385 --> 00:26:32,345
It's already got my
number programed in there,

406
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:35,056
so if I call or text, you know it's me.

407
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,353
Is your arm okay?

408
00:26:40,436 --> 00:26:43,189
[sighs] My trigger finger is just fine.

409
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:47,193
Come on, let's go.

410
00:26:47,277 --> 00:26:49,362
- Where?
- Soledad's.

411
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:50,781
Her daughter Claire

412
00:26:50,864 --> 00:26:53,241
is the one who treated your
ankle at Harlem's Paradise.

413
00:26:53,324 --> 00:26:54,492
She'll be there, too.

414
00:26:55,493 --> 00:26:57,328
I'm gonna take you there myself.

415
00:27:12,302 --> 00:27:14,888
[Method Man] No lie. Bullets
was flying everywhere and shit.

416
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:19,768
You trying to tell me that
those are bullet holes?

417
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:22,437
Man, Meth, I love you,
but get out of here.

418
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,772
I... I don't believe that.

419
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:26,524
HB, I thought the same thing...

420
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:30,904
until shorty pulled the
biscuit and let two off on Cage

421
00:27:30,987 --> 00:27:32,530
and they bounced off.

422
00:27:32,613 --> 00:27:34,199
Bullets ricochetin' and shit.

423
00:27:34,282 --> 00:27:36,042
[stammers] Look, I'm
telling y'all the truth.

424
00:27:36,076 --> 00:27:37,845
I see y'all over there,
y'all don't believe it.

425
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:38,912
Trust me, it's the truth.

426
00:27:38,995 --> 00:27:41,832
[stutters] And after he
smacked fire out these dudes,

427
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:45,418
he left the hoodie, told me
and Gomez to call the police.

428
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:47,796
You know I ain't calling
no po-po. Then he bounced.

429
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:50,256
- Say word.
- Word, Sway. I'm telling you.

430
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,843
He even balled the dude's
gun up like some old homework.

431
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:57,430
But my thing is, though, if he
innocent, so what he running for?

432
00:27:58,348 --> 00:28:00,683
Bulletproof always gonna
come second to being black.

433
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:03,519
HB, you should know
that. You from Jers. Jers!

434
00:28:03,603 --> 00:28:05,814
Wow! Sound like he
stunted on you right there.

435
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:07,583
He did stunt. It was a
stunt. It was a stunt.

436
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:09,275
- Why you gotta stunt on me?
- [laughs]

437
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,401
No, I mean, seriously.

438
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:13,905
Seriously, though, what I'm just
saying, like, if that was me...

439
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:15,907
- [Heather B] Right.
- And I was on the run.

440
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,618
- Why even get involved?
- [Sway] Hmm.

441
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:19,745
But he did.

442
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:24,290
And those dudes was nervous,
so anything could've happened.

443
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:27,252
As far as I'm concerned,
Luke Cage saved my life, man.

444
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:29,004
That's what's up, man.

445
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:32,007
You know what, that don't
sound like no cop killer to me.

446
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,633
For real, for real.

447
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:38,805
You know, there's somethin'
powerful about seeing a black man

448
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:41,599
that's bulletproof and unafraid.

449
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:43,643
- Come on, y'all. You know?
- Yeah, yeah.

450
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:45,287
[Method Man] Streets
got mad love for Cage.

451
00:28:45,311 --> 00:28:48,564
I got mad love for Cage, man,
and... and he one of ours.

452
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:50,400
Yeah, yeah. But you know what?

453
00:28:50,483 --> 00:28:52,193
We got mad love for you, too.

454
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:53,904
- No doubt.
- You one of ours, man.

455
00:28:53,987 --> 00:28:56,382
You know, the show's almost
over, man. You gonna spit for us?

456
00:28:56,406 --> 00:28:59,075
- Of course.
- Oh, man! He 'bout to spit!

457

00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:22,135
[man] <i>Yo, I remember when Larry Davis
was on the run back in the day.</i>

511
00:31:22,218 --> 00:31:24,554
<i>Cops came at him 'cause
they were just as corrupt,</i>

512
00:31:24,637 --> 00:31:26,556
<i>dangerous and jacked up as he was.</i>

513
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:30,810
<i>I don't think we're getting the full
story on Luke Cage yet, for real.</i>

514
00:31:30,894 --> 00:31:32,896
[Sway] <i>I wouldn't put it
past the government, man.</i>

515
00:31:32,979 --> 00:31:36,107
<i>Um, you know, we're gonna be
searching for the answers for you,</i>

516
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:37,483
<i>and once we get the facts,</i>

517
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:40,153
<i>we're gonna put it right here
on Sway's Universe, all right?</i>

518
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:42,822
<i>Thanks for your call, citizen. We
got another person on the line.</i>

519
00:31:42,906 --> 00:31:45,158
- [beeps]
- [smooth jazz playing]

520
00:31:47,202 --> 00:31:49,079
- [man] Now. Come on!
- [woman] All right.

521
00:31:49,162 --> 00:31:51,081
[indistinct shouting]

522
00:31:51,164 --> 00:31:54,250
Oh, come on, man. You
know he's not here.

523
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:06,762
I understand playing against the computer,
but, um, how do you beat yourself?

524
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:08,681
Chess is a game of anticipation.

525
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:13,644
If you know every single possible move,

526
00:32:13,728 --> 00:32:17,523
you can anticipate your adversary's
next move before he does.

527
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:18,649
Oh.

528
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:20,610
That's deep.

529
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:24,197
If we find out you've been hiding
him, there'll be hell to pay.

530
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,842
Yeah, well, just don't break the
hinges on that door on your way out.

531
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:29,410
I just got it fixed.

532
00:32:57,063 --> 00:32:59,607
[smooth jazz continues on radio]

533
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:08,366
That was a close shave.

534
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:10,410
Bad pun.

535
00:33:12,537 --> 00:33:14,664
What the hell did you
even come back for, man?

536
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:18,459
[sighs] I had to.

537
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:20,295
For Harlem.

538
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:22,880
Take care of Diamondback before
he made it bad for everybody.

539
00:33:22,963 --> 00:33:25,716
Well, forget Harlem.
Forget your brother!

540
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,512
You're on the road in a brand
new car and a woman that fine?

541
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:31,681
And you're bulletproof.

542
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:34,100
[scoffs] You'd have never
seen my black ass again.

543
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:36,769
I'd rob the occasional
bank and never look back.

544
00:33:36,852 --> 00:33:38,146
[chuckles]

545
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:43,901
You got every cop in the
city looking for you, brother.

546
00:33:44,777 --> 00:33:48,031
Negroes writing Luke
Cage ballads and shit.

547
00:33:50,075 --> 00:33:52,452
So... what's the plan?

548
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:57,332
To box in all the players.

549
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:02,128
Well...

550
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:06,216
Shades is in jail.

551
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,594
Mariah's out, but she
ain't exactly on your side.

552
00:34:09,677 --> 00:34:11,179
Now you could tail both of 'em,

553
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:14,599
but no telling how long that'll take
for them to lead you to your prey.

554
00:34:18,894 --> 00:34:20,271
What about Misty?

555
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:22,982
No, she's got her hands full already.

556
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:24,835
She's trying to clear my
name inside the precinct

557
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:26,902
and bring me in at the same time.

558
00:34:26,986 --> 00:34:29,114
- We gotta be careful with her.
- [sighs]

559
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:31,907
That leaves you one other option.

560
00:34:33,076 --> 00:34:35,453
Someone else to find Diamondback.

561
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:39,165
[softly] Here.

562
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,292
Turk.

563
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:44,920
Turk may be a pawn, but he's not dumb.

564
00:34:45,004 --> 00:34:47,090
If he thinks he's being
set up, he'll disappear.

565
00:34:47,173 --> 00:34:48,424
[dialing]

566
00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:50,718
You let me worry about that.

567
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:54,305
Hey, Turk, it's Bobby.

568
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:57,517
Listen, I might be able to get my
hands on about 30 pairs of Jordans.

569
00:34:58,518 --> 00:35:00,728
They're the vintage Air Jordan 5s.

570
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:03,981
Let's just say they fell
off the back of a truck.

571
00:35:05,108 --> 00:35:06,567
Okay, when?

572
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:17,328
Who's this?

573
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,498
First name Law, last name Yer.

574
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:25,503
Must be pretty damn connected to get
a lawyer and not even know who she is.

575
00:35:25,586 --> 00:35:27,463
Membership has its privileges.

576
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:30,925
[indistinct chatter]

577
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:36,972
He sprung you?

578
00:35:38,808 --> 00:35:41,477
You think this is funny, don't you?

579
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,730
You got this all figured out, huh?

580
00:35:46,732 --> 00:35:47,733
No...

581
00:35:48,734 --> 00:35:50,403
actually, I don't.

582
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:21,726
When did Diamondback bring in new hires?

583
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:24,437
Well, after the club, he
had to change things up.

584
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,439
Recruit some new faces.

585
00:36:38,951 --> 00:36:40,119
I bet while you were inside,

586
00:36:40,203 --> 00:36:42,747
cops tried to do some
recruiting of their own.

587
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,709
Don't ever question my loyalty.

588
00:37:06,312 --> 00:37:08,481
- The man upstairs?
- [scoffs]

589
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:11,025
You are just full of questions.

590
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:13,611
Matter of fact...

591
00:37:13,694 --> 00:37:15,321
[groans]

592
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:19,909
[straining]

593
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:21,327
[thudding]

594
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:36,592
[grunting]

595
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:41,138
[Shades gasping]

596
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,280
[gunshot]

597
00:37:59,156 --> 00:38:00,450
[panting]

598
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:05,996
[laughs]

599
00:38:06,997 --> 00:38:08,833
Let's go to the penthouse.

600
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:13,713
[groans]

601
00:38:14,547 --> 00:38:16,006
[breathing heavily]

602
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,682
- [door slams]
- [breath trembling]

603
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:27,768
I was just following orders!

604
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:37,277
You're a goddamn puppet.

605
00:38:38,363 --> 00:38:39,655
Who gave you the order?

606
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,032
[grunts]

607
00:38:45,828 --> 00:38:47,246
- Who?
- [grunts]

608
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:51,000
Diamondback!

609
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:55,796
You stopped playing your
position. Asked too many questions.

610
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,383
Diamondback said you
needed to be dealt with.

611
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:03,971
Romeo would be ashamed of you.

612
00:39:04,054 --> 00:39:05,390
[Zip laughing]

613
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:08,058
You're such a disappointment.

614
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:10,978
You're the second person
who told me that today.

615
00:39:11,937 --> 00:39:14,649
I'm my own man, Shades.

616
00:39:17,693 --> 00:39:19,319
Tell him yourself.

617
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,547
[chuckles]

618
00:39:47,306 --> 00:39:48,516
Nice.

619
00:39:53,396 --> 00:39:56,982
[sighs] Sorry, Romeo... He had to go.

620
00:39:58,192 --> 00:39:59,819
[sirens wailing in the distance]

621
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:05,282
It's a good thing her friend
Leslie knew where she was.

622
00:40:05,365 --> 00:40:07,493
- I'm glad you found the park.
- Mmm-hmm.

623
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:08,828
So where is she now?

624
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:12,415
She left with Detective Knight.
Traffic got thick and I lost them.

625
00:40:12,498 --> 00:40:14,584
I'm sorry. I'm not used to
doing anything like this.

626
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:15,918
We'll find her again.

627
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:18,838
Just knowing that she
can't be trusted is helpful.

628
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:21,799
You did a good job, Alex.

629
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:23,593
Hey, you're my rock!

630
00:40:26,303 --> 00:40:27,680
Later.

631
00:40:27,763 --> 00:40:29,557
[cell phone ringing]

632
00:40:41,736 --> 00:40:43,362
What do you want?

633
00:40:43,446 --> 00:40:46,281
[Stryker] <i>That's no way to
speak to a business partner.</i>

634
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:48,909
After what you did to my club,

635
00:40:48,993 --> 00:40:51,120
do you really think I'm
gonna shuck and jive with you?

636
00:40:51,203 --> 00:40:53,831
<i>You might wanna check your attitude.</i>

637
00:40:53,914 --> 00:40:57,793
<i>If you're not of any use to me,
then you're not useful to anyone.</i>

638
00:40:57,877 --> 00:41:01,631
<i>Shades would tell you,
if he was still alive.</i>

639
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,259
What the hell are you talking about?

640
00:41:05,342 --> 00:41:07,302
<i>I had to let him go.</i>

641
00:41:07,386 --> 00:41:12,141
<i>So now, I'm giving you the chance
to tell me where you stand.</i>

642
00:41:12,224 --> 00:41:16,311
<i>I've taken Shades and Damon Boone
off the table so you can grow.</i>

643
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:18,564
<i>I'd hate for us to part, too.</i>

644
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:22,818
I wasn't particularly fond of Shades...

645
00:41:24,194 --> 00:41:28,574
and the death of Damon
Boone, although unnecessary,

646
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:30,450
was appreciated.

647
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:36,791
But you need to know this.
I'm out of the political game.

648
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:41,378
I'm focusing on Harlem's
Paradise. Using it for a...

649
00:41:42,505 --> 00:41:46,133
a power base for community relations.

650
00:41:46,216 --> 00:41:48,886
That's a smart move.

651
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:50,763
But you've made some dumb ones also.

652
00:41:50,846 --> 00:41:54,517
You should never talk about
murder on an open line.

653
00:42:01,106 --> 00:42:02,357
Open it.

654
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:21,251
Seed money... for your New
Harlem Renaissance project

655
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:23,212
and refurbishing the club.

656
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:25,673
My apologies.

657
00:42:27,633 --> 00:42:32,555
It's a very generous donation...
but nothing in this world is free.

658
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:34,014
You're right.

659
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,562
My only condition is loyalty.

660
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,524
Stick with me and Harlem will
be remade in your own image.

661
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,820
We'll be doing this for years to come.

662
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:51,741
Harlem is already in my image.

663
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,829
You staying?

664
00:42:56,912 --> 00:43:00,249
Once I'm finished with
Carl, I'll evaporate.

665
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:02,960
But don't worry.

666
00:43:03,043 --> 00:43:06,631
You'll still feel the
occasional cool breeze.

667
00:43:09,341 --> 00:43:11,218
Sweet dreams, Mariah.

668
00:43:16,891 --> 00:43:17,933
[door opens]

669
00:43:18,017 --> 00:43:19,351
[sighs]

670
00:43:19,434 --> 00:43:20,477
[door closes]

671
00:43:41,624 --> 00:43:42,917
- [thudding]
- [Turk gasps]

672
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,877
- You ratted out Chico.
- [breathing heavily]

673
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,545
You got Pop killed.

674
00:43:46,629 --> 00:43:48,673
Man, the writing was on the wall.

675
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:52,092
Somebody would have seen
him. Might as well be me.

676
00:43:52,176 --> 00:43:54,970
How was I supposed to know Tone
was gonna shoot up the shop?

677
00:43:55,054 --> 00:43:58,808
Whole damn world know Pop's
was Switzerland. Forever.

678
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:00,100
I should crush you.

679
00:44:00,184 --> 00:44:03,353
[chuckles] You won't,
though. You need me.

680
00:44:03,437 --> 00:44:04,980
[inhales sharply] Where's Diamondback?

681
00:44:05,898 --> 00:44:08,108
I don't know... [screaming]

682
00:44:09,985 --> 00:44:11,278
What the... [yelps]

683
00:44:14,114 --> 00:44:15,615
- Hey!
- You still stalling?

684
00:44:17,993 --> 00:44:19,578
[Turk whimpering]

685
00:44:20,746 --> 00:44:22,206
All right! All right!

686
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:24,709
He's at a warehouse by the Harlem River.

687
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:26,626
Near 145th, all right?

688
00:44:28,462 --> 00:44:32,257
I gave you what you
wanted! Now let me out!

689
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:34,468
Sit tight, Mr. Barrett.

690
00:44:34,551 --> 00:44:36,470
Trash pickup is tomorrow.

691
00:44:36,553 --> 00:44:39,974
You can breathe just fine.
There's food in there, too.

692
00:44:41,391 --> 00:44:43,393
[banging]

693
00:44:43,477 --> 00:44:45,813
You can't leave me in here!

694
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:48,607
There's baby diapers in here, man!

695
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:50,567
Hey!

696
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:53,653
Come on!

697
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:55,114
[door opening]

698
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,872
[door slams]

699
00:45:20,848 --> 00:45:22,808
[Domingo] Looks like you downgraded.

700
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:25,560
I liked the club better.

701
00:45:26,812 --> 00:45:29,148
I'm a man who needs his space.

702
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:32,692
Space is a good thing.

703
00:45:33,693 --> 00:45:35,964
- Especially when you come to kill a man.
- [guns cocking]

704
00:45:35,988 --> 00:45:37,156
Whoa, whoa.

705
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,577
[guns cocking]

706
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:50,585
Someone did your boy
Zip and his two homies.

707
00:45:50,669 --> 00:45:53,172
That's not Cage's style...

708
00:45:53,255 --> 00:45:56,591
so I'm guessing Shades didn't
appreciate you bailing him out.

709
00:46:03,348 --> 00:46:08,020
You know when a rattlesnake is
at its most dangerous, Domingo?

710
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:11,899
When it's cornered.

711
00:46:39,176 --> 00:46:40,928
I'm gonna rip your head off!

712
00:46:45,474 --> 00:46:46,683
[groans]

713
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:04,326
[gunshots continue]

714
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,541
- [whirring]
- [chuckles]

715
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,047
"And behold a pale horse...

716
00:47:18,007 --> 00:47:21,969
and he that sat upon
him, his name was Death."

717
00:47:31,311 --> 00:47:32,604
[exhales]

718
00:47:32,687 --> 00:47:33,813
[sniffs]

719
00:48:10,517 --> 00:48:12,561
You really need a security system.

720
00:48:14,563 --> 00:48:17,566
- You waiting for me?
- No.

721
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:21,403
I bet he told you I was dead.

722
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:25,699
Diamondback got to you, didn't he?

723
00:48:25,782 --> 00:48:27,909
No, he didn't.

724
00:48:28,702 --> 00:48:29,954
[scoffs]

725
00:48:32,957 --> 00:48:35,709
What are you doing with
a gun? It's not you.

726
00:48:35,792 --> 00:48:37,044
Shut up.

727
00:48:39,213 --> 00:48:40,380
[sighs]

728
00:48:41,548 --> 00:48:43,300
I have something for you.

729
00:48:48,555 --> 00:48:49,889
Figured...

730
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,769
you'd want this.

731
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:02,194
Your prints... Cornell's blood.

732
00:49:09,868 --> 00:49:12,371
Then you'll have nothing
to blackmail me with.

733
00:49:13,538 --> 00:49:14,706
I don't need it.

734
00:49:15,665 --> 00:49:17,376
We're in this together now.

735
00:49:20,462 --> 00:49:21,546
[bottle thuds]

736
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:25,634
You and I have come a long way.

737
00:49:27,136 --> 00:49:31,848
You know, sometimes you have to reach
across the aisle to get things done.

738
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:35,894
You're talking about Luke Cage?

739
00:49:37,146 --> 00:49:40,815
It's incredible... how
much you and I think alike.

740
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,319
We're at war.

741
00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:49,324
And right now, the enemy
of my enemy is my friend.

742
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,079
Maybe. But it might not take.

743
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,666
You did beat his ass
and give him his powers.

744
00:49:57,749 --> 00:49:59,376
- Mmm-hmm.
- And...

745
00:49:59,459 --> 00:50:03,672
Cornell's flunky killed Pop. You
think he really is gonna jump?

746
00:50:03,755 --> 00:50:05,257
Just jump on our bandwagon?

747
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,301
Absolutely.

748
00:50:07,384 --> 00:50:10,804
'Cause we have something that
he wants more than anything.

749
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:15,475
His old life.

750
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:19,479
A chance to clear his name. Right here.

751
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:27,404
If we send Luke after Diamondback
and they kill each other...

752
00:50:28,447 --> 00:50:30,240
all of our problems are swept away.

753
00:50:30,324 --> 00:50:32,033
- [exhales]
- No matter who wins.

754
00:50:32,117 --> 00:50:34,911
[chuckles] Even better.

755
00:51:32,677 --> 00:51:34,221
[Domingo groaning]

756
00:51:39,976 --> 00:51:42,271
I should've known you'd
turn up. [breathing heavily]

757
00:51:43,397 --> 00:51:45,149
What the hell happened here?

758
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:48,568
Diamondback.

759
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:49,944
[groaning]

760
00:51:50,028 --> 00:51:52,364
[faint beeping in distance]

761
00:52:04,918 --> 00:52:06,711
[beeping continues]

762
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:22,394
Sweet sister.

763
00:52:22,477 --> 00:52:24,188
[beeping continues]

764
00:52:41,037 --> 00:52:43,415
[Luke panting] Slow.

765
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:46,210
Take it easy.

766
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,380
What did he use?

767
00:52:50,464 --> 00:52:52,549
How did Diamondback do that?

768
00:52:54,092 --> 00:52:56,386
[breathing heavily] Something
I've never seen before.

769
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:58,472
[siren wailing in the distance]

770
00:52:58,555 --> 00:53:00,640
Even you can't stop him.

771
00:53:03,017 --> 00:53:04,853
[exhales softly]

772
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:18,742
These just came in.

773
00:53:19,784 --> 00:53:22,996
- [sighs] Elephant punches all over again.
- Mmm-hmm.

774
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:24,205
That's gotta be Cage, right?

775
00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:26,040
[cell phone ringing]

776
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:33,840
- Hello?
- [Luke] <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

777
00:53:33,923 --> 00:53:36,510
<i>You guys find Domingo?</i>

778
00:53:36,593 --> 00:53:38,428
- Yeah.
<i>- Meet me.</i>

779
00:53:38,512 --> 00:53:39,721
Where?

780
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,997
Should I thank you for this?

781
00:54:06,998 --> 00:54:09,125
All credit goes to Diamondback.

782
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:11,878
I don't suppose we'll find his body.

783
00:54:11,961 --> 00:54:15,173
We found Zip's, though, and two
other thugs in an old building.

784
00:54:15,256 --> 00:54:18,009
Shot up. Right after they
picked up your other boy.

785
00:54:19,052 --> 00:54:20,261
Shades.

786
00:54:21,971 --> 00:54:24,182
Don't you ever get tired
of people getting out?

787
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:26,184
Yes.

788
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:32,148
Look, it's not safe for you to be
here. If you don't find Diamondback...

789
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:35,109
Then he wins, and my life
is forever a living hell.

790
00:54:37,779 --> 00:54:39,364
Is there anything I can do?

791
00:54:40,281 --> 00:54:41,950
See what else Turk knows.

792
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:44,494
He's in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd.

793
00:54:44,578 --> 00:54:46,788
Near Mount Olivet and the shop.

794
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:49,666
A Dumpster?

795
00:54:55,797 --> 00:54:56,840
[sighs]

796
00:55:04,348 --> 00:55:07,016
Even if we handle Diamondback...

797
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,604
he's not gonna forgive us for
framing him for Cornell's death.

798
00:55:11,521 --> 00:55:13,231
We could hurdle that easy.

799
00:55:14,315 --> 00:55:16,693
The only people who know what
really happened in the club

800
00:55:16,776 --> 00:55:18,570
are you and me.

801
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:24,409
I'll regret that night
for the rest of my life.

802
00:55:25,535 --> 00:55:26,995
You did what you had to do.

803
00:55:27,078 --> 00:55:29,122
You shouldn't regret that.

804
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:34,753
What were you even doing
at the club that night?

805
00:55:39,591 --> 00:55:41,718
I was going there to kill him.

806
00:55:43,595 --> 00:55:45,179
You beat me to it.

807
00:55:50,769 --> 00:55:52,854
Cornell never needed my political money.

808
00:55:53,772 --> 00:55:56,107
And he was never going to pay it back.

809
00:55:58,026 --> 00:56:02,113
He just wanted me in all the way.

810
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:04,574
So what are you saying?

811
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:13,667
He saw things in me... that
I avoided my whole life.

812
00:56:16,961 --> 00:56:21,675
Now I am becoming that
person he always saw...

813
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:26,345
and I always denied.

814
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:32,561
You ready?

815
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:36,064
I stay ready, baby.

816
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,175
I should've kept my coat
on. Hell just froze over.

817
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:05,301
[door closes]

818
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:08,472
- Where's Luke Cage?
- I'm right here.

819
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:12,100
- We have a problem.
- So do I.

820
00:57:12,183 --> 00:57:15,437
I can't decide which one of
you I'm gonna knock out first.

821
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,314
- Where's Diamondback?
- I don't know.

822
00:57:18,397 --> 00:57:21,526
The parley between the three
of us is more important.

823
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:23,612
You have the nerve to use that term?

824
00:57:23,695 --> 00:57:25,822
Right here? Where Pop died?

825
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,450
Cough up Diamondback's location,

826
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:30,660
or I'll stomp you like
we were back at Seagate.

827
00:57:30,744 --> 00:57:32,370
Luke, be cool, brother.

828
00:57:32,454 --> 00:57:35,707
Whoa, whoa. No one
needs to stomp anyone.

829
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:38,585
Pops made this place
Switzerland for a reason.

830
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:41,004
Cage, we have a mutual enemy,

831
00:57:41,087 --> 00:57:44,132
and the only way to bring him down
is for us all to come together.

832
00:57:44,215 --> 00:57:46,342
There's no way I'm helping you.

833
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:49,012
We came to offer you a truce.

834
00:57:49,095 --> 00:57:52,265
In exchange for helping
you find Diamondback,

835
00:57:52,348 --> 00:57:53,850
you drop your beef with us.

836
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:56,060
You both framed me for murder.

837
00:57:56,144 --> 00:57:58,897
There's nothing you can offer me
that's going to make me let that go.

838
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:02,025
Uh... how about your freedom?

839
00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:06,362
Right here is everything you need

840
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:09,407
to prove that Diamondback
framed Carl Lucas.

841
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:22,546
Even if Carl Lucas is exonerated...

842
00:58:22,629 --> 00:58:25,549
Luke Cage is now wanted for
the murder of Cottonmouth.

843
00:58:25,632 --> 00:58:27,466
I'll tell them the truth.

844
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:30,929
Diamondback killed
Cornell and Damon Boone.

845
00:58:31,012 --> 00:58:32,556
You'll go free.

846
00:58:34,933 --> 00:58:36,434
What the hell is this?

847
00:58:36,518 --> 00:58:40,146
Mariah Dillard, you're under arrest
for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

848
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:41,916
I thought you said you
were going after Turk?

849
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,626
[Misty] I've been tracking
you since you called.

850
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,944
I wasn't going to let
you just ghost me again.

851
00:58:46,027 --> 00:58:49,656
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Shades, back off!

852
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:52,534
Misty, stand down.
We're working this out.

853
00:58:52,617 --> 00:58:54,285
Oh, so you workin' with them now?

854
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:57,080
- He knows where Diamondback is.
- I didn't say that.

855
00:58:57,163 --> 00:59:00,625
Well, whatever you know, Hernan, you
should share it with the whole class.

856
00:59:00,709 --> 00:59:02,586
I ain't telling you shit.

857
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:06,673
Grenade!

858
00:59:07,591 --> 00:59:08,717
[screaming]

859
00:59:13,346 --> 00:59:15,264

What type of Jean Paul
Gaultier shit is this?

What are you, a pimp stormtrooper?

No, I'm the angel of death.
