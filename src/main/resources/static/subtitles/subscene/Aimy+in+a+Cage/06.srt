Two little tigers. Two little tigers.

21
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,220
Ran so fast. Ran so fast.

22
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,110
One doesn't have a mouth. One doesn't have ears.

23
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,950
It's really strange.

24
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,700
It's really strange.

25
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,120
Two little tigers. Two little tigers.

26
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,400
Ran so fast. Ran so fast.

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,040
It's really strange.

31
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,120
Brother Shao Tian. Save me.

32
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,060
Brother Shao Tian. I'm scared.

33
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,710
Two little tigers. Two little tigers.

34
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,170
Ran so fast. Ran so fast.

35
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,940
One doesn't have a mouth. One doesn't have ears.

36
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,490
It's really strange.

37
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,510
Why did you do that to me?

38
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,990
You are asking me why?

39
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,410
What do you think this place is?

40
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,590
Is this the evidence that I killed your father?

41
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,840
You really hoped that I'm the killer of your father?

42
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,810
Jiang Yu. What are you doing?

43
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,450
Ask her. It's late. Ask her

44
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,450
why she is here.

45
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,560
Yes. <br> This doesn't concern you.

46
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,090
It's my fault.

47
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,370
You can't treat her like this.

48
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,210
Don't let me see you bully her again in the future.

49
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,970
If she dares to play tricks,

50
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,520
I will bully her every time I see her.

51
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
If you have the guts, take her away from here.

52
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,310
Brother Shao Tian.

53
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,260
I guarantee that

54
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,760
this mistake

55
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,250
will never happen again.

56
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,900
I heard it.

57
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,110
What were you doing most of the night?

58
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,070
Don't talk about this anymore. I wanted to find the evidence.

59
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,660
In the end, I was played by Jiang Yu.

60
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,300
Cai Hong. In the future, don't do something like this alone again.

61
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,860
You must tell me in advance.

62
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,340
I didn't want you to worry about me.

63
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,000
If you hide this from me, I will be even more worried.

64
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,490
Okay then.

65
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,110
I will confess to you. The next step in my plan

66
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,200
is to find Ling Long's ledger books.

67
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,410
When your father passed away, the police already checked all the documents.

68
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,000
Everything was disclosed.

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,030
A few days ago, the police delivered the documents here.

70
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,910
But now Jiang Yu has them locked up.

71
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,770
Then, do you know where he kept the ledgers?

72
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,260
I don't know but I think

73
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,780
since the police has already investigated,

74
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,490
there should be no problems with the ledgers.

75
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,720
Even so, I still want to take a look at them

76
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,020
and see where the problem lies.

77
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,630
Fei Fei. The Ling Long's ledgers that the police delivered here,

78
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,170
where did you put them?

79
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,780
I let the workers move them to the storage room and lock them up.

80
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,480
Someone must have manipulated the Ling Long's ledgers.

81
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,000
The police couldn't detect anything.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,490
The world is not a perfect place.

83
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,250
Even if the person who manipulated the accounts did a clean job.

84
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,990
In this ledger,

85
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,990
it certainly contains hidden clues.

86
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,950
I don't believe that Old Cai

87
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,120
would dare to touch Wu Hong Da's money on his own.

88

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

89
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,490
You can't leave.

90
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,510
You are burning the ledger?

91
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,020
I didn't burn it.

92
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,060
Someone already burnt it before I came.

93
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,320
You are still trying to deny it? I personally witnessed it.

94
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,060
What did you see? Whether you believe it or not, I didn't do this.

95
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,380
Then why are you in the storage room so late?

96
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,570
If there isn't anything to hide in here

97
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,620
then why do have to burn it?

98
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,950
Have nothing to say anymore, right?

99
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,500
There are only four words to describe this.

100
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,900
Have a guilty conscious.

101
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,860
Okay.

102
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,520
Even if I burned these books, you can't find any proof.

103
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,430
I will find out the truth and get revenge for my father.

104
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,270
Cai Hong.

105
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,410
Where are you going?

106
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,630
Cai Hong, didn't you promise me last night

107
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,930
to not do things alone?

108
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,420
I just want to...

109
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,530
look at Ling Long's old ledgers.

110
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,620
I found it, but I was one step late.

111
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,780
Jiang Yu burned it. He thinks by doing this there would be no evidence.

112
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,420
But he's wrong. The ledgers are burned...

113
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,090
Is he still around?

114
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,090
Are you talking about Old Cai? The police has been looking for him.

115
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,220
I have commissioned a friend to find him.

116
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,760
I'm guessing, he already ran away.

117
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,120
He did business with the temple monks.

118
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,710
I remember Old Cai never missed work and worked many years.

119
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,320
Many workers should know him well.

120
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,640
Ask around about his address.

121
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,650
His hometown may hold more clues.

122
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,060
Cai Hong. I think that Jiang Yu burnt the ledger before you went there.

123
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,650
He is well aware of your actions and

124
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,790
he is watching your every move. He will make things difficult.

125
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,560
He won't do that. I know about the dangers you are talking about

126
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,720
but this is the only way I can investigate my father's death.

127
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,730
I won't give up.

128
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,960
Why are you suddenly taking time off?

129
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,420
Because I'm going to the countryside. My cousin...

130
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,700
She suddenly fell sick. Hence...

131
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,210
Enough.

132
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,410
I don't have the skills to know if you are lying or not.

133
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,380
Just go if you want to.

134
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,350
I will be back soon. Thank you.

135

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

136
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,500
Bookkeeper Cai lived in Xiaoshan.

137
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,920
I went to his home a few years ago.

138
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,630
Go with me on the trip.

139
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,720
Let's go now.

140
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,820
I'm afraid that I can't go today.

141
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,620
I'm taking my mom to the hospital. She is sick.

142
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,500
Why don't we go tomorrow?

143
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,040
Yes. It's important to take care of your mother.

144
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,350
Brother Shao Tian, go back to work first.

145
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,850
Okay then. I will take my mom to the hospital first.

146
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,740
Let's go tomorrow.

147
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,990
Who is there? Coming.

148
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Brother. What brings here here? Today must be a good day.

149
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,530
Come inside and take a seat.

150
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,510
I'm here to see you regarding an urgent matter. I would like to seek your help.

151
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,250
Why are you asking me this? Your business is my business.

152
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,630
Tell me what it is.

153
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,120
Brother.

154
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,550
Brother. Where are you going?

155
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,010
I'm going to settle some stuff.

156
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,170
- I will go with you then. <br>- No need.

157
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,930
I will be back soon. Don't worry.

158
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,800
Take good care of the factory.

159
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
Brother!

160
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,650
Where is he going?

161
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,310
Sir. I would like to ask you a question.

162
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,750
How far is Xiaoshan and what is the cost?

163
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,150
It's not near. It's a silver dollar.

164
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:16,500
A silver dollar? But I left home in a hurry and didn't bring that much money with me.

165
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,620
Could you charge half the price?

166
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,320
Leave then. Don't hamper my business.

167
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,880
Sir. I would like to inquire.

168
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,460
You don't have a silver dollar, right? I'm not going.

169
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,920
I will take you there for half the asking price.

170
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,640
You are going to take her there for half the asking price?

171
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,660
-I need to go to Xiaoshan. <br>-I'll go anywhere.

172
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,700
Rascal. What are you trying to do?

173
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,730
What do you mean? It's broad daylight and you don't want to do any business?

174
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,230
Are you serious? How do you run a serious business?

175
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,980
Half of the asking price is not even enough for a meal.

176
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,350
How can you even go out?

177
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,290
Mind your business. I'm happy to take her there.

178
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,710
It's none of your business.

179
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,620
Miss. Get in.

180
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,770
Cheap. Is his child sick?

181
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,330
Regardless, even if she is pretty...

182
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,810
Chances are he doesn't know where to turn.

183
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,100
Is this your first time doing this?

184
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,500
Who says so? I have been doing this for ten years.

185
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,580
Why can't you turn the horse around then?

186
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,850
I do know how to turn a horse. I'll try harder.

187
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,530
Giddy up. See? Aren't we moving?

188
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,880
Be careful.

189
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,740
Are you sure this is the way there?

190
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,480
Miss.

191
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,970
I may not be good at this but I know the way.

192
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,250
Let's just say, I don't need road signs.

193
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,340
How do I feel that we are going the wrong way?

194
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,370
Why don't you find someone to ask for directions?

195
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,200
Ask someone? Who should we ask?

196
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,250
How do I feel that we getting further?

197
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,620
We are not. We will get there soon.

198
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,300
But...

199
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,400
<i>This wench. She clearly took the wrong road.</i>

200
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,880
<i>Even when taking the wrong path, she doesn't look back. </i>

201
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,740
How long will it take for us to reach Old Cai's home?

202
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,100
We will be there soon. It's just ahead.

203
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,430
Ahead? This doesn't seem to be the way to Old Cai's home.

204
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,880
Who says so? Miss, look.

205
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,690
Look we need to just go a little south.

206
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,180
I'm certain it is there.

207
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,850
Isn't the Cai family's home just ahead?

208
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,240
There are not mountains in Xiaoshan.

209
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,490
Are you even a real driver?

210
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,490
It can't be.

211
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,030
It should be just ahead.

212
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,510
You are a dead man!

213
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,920
- Why are you hitting me? <br>- I'm going to beat you to death.

214
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,530
- Stop hitting. <br>- You rotten egg.

215
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,270
Stop hitting me. I'm not...

216
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,080
Liar! Bad guy!

217
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,830
Buddy. Did you just transport a young woman

218
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,630
to the Cai family's home?

219
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,730
- Where is she? <br>- How would I know?

220
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,230
She said I wasn't a real driver.

221
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,010
She even hit me. That wench.

222
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,510
The other drivers said I was crazy going to the countryside...

223
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,290
Where did she go then?

224
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,620
I don't know.

225
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,300
It seems to be over there.

226
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,800
Over there?

227
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,480
Thanks.

228
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,930
You... what are you doing here?

229
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,710
Does your cousin live here?

230
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,970
Is there a problem with your brain?

231
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,310
You clearly took the wrong road and you are still walking ahead.

232
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,180
Also you hired a driver that took you to a remote place.

233
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,530
Aren't you afraid that someone will sell you?

234
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,120
You came a long distance

235
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,030
just to scold me, right?

236
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,120
I have only one reason to scold you. It's because you are stupid.

237
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,340
You are the stupid one instead.

238
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,100
Where are you going?

239
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,810
Mind your own business.

240
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,830
There are many wolves nearby.

241
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,540
Can't you walk slower?

242
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,480
Miss. Based on your progress,

243
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,010
we will first be home next year.

244
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,870
If you haven't taken the wrong road, I would be home earlier.

245
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,580
Are you going to leave or not?

246
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,460
I'm not leaving.

247
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,840
Can't you see that I'm injured?

248
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,510
Come.

249
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,790
I don't need you to carry me. Put me down.

250
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,560
Put me down.

251
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,700
Put me down.

252
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,570
You are extremely noisy.

253
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,840
I don't need you to carry me.

254
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,190
Put me down.

255
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,820
Okay, sit here.

256
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,550
I'm going to find food. I will be back soon.

257
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,250
Be careful.

258
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,440
If your boyfriend knows that you are alone with me

259
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,720
and spent the night in this forest. What would he think?

260
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,060
I don't have a boyfriend.

261
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,070
Don't go too far.

262
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:38,140
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

263
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,150
Be careful.

264
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,050
This fruit has a sour taste.

265
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,140
They are all for you.

266
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,870
I don't feel like eating.

267
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,560
The fourth code of a secretary.

268
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,580
You can't defy the order from your boss.

269
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,200
Whether right or wrong, you must follow and not hesitate.

270
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,530
Finish them.

271
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,930
- Brother. <br>- Where is Cai Hong?

272
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,420
Didn't I tell you to take her for a ride and then send her back?

273
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,780
I did according to your instruction. I was about

274
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,190
to take her home but talking about this,

275
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,380
I tried to go back but she wouldn't let me say a word.

276
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,010
- She ran off. <br>- Ran off?

277
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,560
A rascal on a horseback came after her later.

278
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,520
How does that rascal looks like?

279
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,700
One look and one could tell that he's a rich man.

280
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,460
I wanted to wait for them to come back but I fell asleep.

281
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,970
- Where did they head off? <br>- Over there.

282
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,250
- Brother, I will go with you. <br>- No need. Stay here and sleep.

283
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,710
- Young Master! <br>- Brother!

284
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,970
- Young Master! <br>- Brother!

285
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,600
Young Master!

286
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,000
Young Master!

287
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,020
Young Master!

288
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,900
Young Master!

289
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,630
Young Master!

290
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,500
Young Master!

291
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,620
Young Master!

292
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,550
- Brother. <br>- Young Master!

293
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,890
Zhou Shao Tian. Stop there.

294
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,040
Where is Wu Cai Hong?

295
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,970
I'm looking for her too.

296
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,150
Our family's coachman has a horse to find them.

297
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,690
Tell me now. Where did they go?

298
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,460
I'm looking for her too.

299
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,240
I'm warning you. If anything were to happen to my brother,

300
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,890
I will never let Wu Cai Hong off.

301
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,170
If anything were to happen to Cai Hong,

302
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,890
do you think I would let Jiang Yu off?

303
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,030
Cai Hong will be lucky to still be alive.

304
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,660
You better stay far away from her.

305
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,670
Miss, there's somebody here.

306
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,810
Young Master!

307
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,970
Young Master!

308
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,150
Young Master!

309
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,360
Wake up.

310
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,490
Young Master.

311
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,260
- We finally found you. <br> - Brother, are you okay?

312
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,190
- I'm fine. <br> - Young Master, young master.

313
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,660
- Cai Hong. <br> - We found them, that's great.

314
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,950
This shirt...

315
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,410
It got dirty, wash it before you return it.

316
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,100
Your leg is injured, I'll carry you.

317
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,520
I'm fine, it's okay.

318
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,340
Are you really okay?

319
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,600
Follow them. Don't let them find out.

320
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,310
Let's go.

321
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,420
I don't think this is the right way.

322
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,250
But it shouldn't be that far from the Cai family's home.

323
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,290
Why don't we check ahead?

324
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,330
Cai Hong, you didn't get to rest last night

325
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,190
and you got injured. How about we go back first?

326
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,640
Let's go the Cai family's home another day.

327
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,630
My leg is fine.

328
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,950
I think I can still go on.

329
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,630
I don't want to wait anymore. I would like to find Old Cai as soon as possible.

330
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,650
That way we'll find out the truth.

331
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,150
Cai Hong, last night...

332
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,200
why were you with Jiang Yu?

333
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,400
I don't know why he appeared either.

334
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,040
Brother.

335
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,310
I looked for you all night long.

336
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:24,150
Don't you think you should let me know what happened?

337
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,700
I'm tired, let's talk next time.

338
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,000
With everything else, there has always been a reason behind it,

339
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,670
but this time...

340
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,710
Do you know why Wu Cai Hong

341
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,360
was out in the wilderness?

342
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,760
She went to look for Lao Cai.

343
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,740
If I didn't guess wrongly,

344
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,570
Wu Cai Hong and Zhou Shao Tian are already at the Cai family's home.

345
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,990
Didn't Lao Cai run away long ago?

346
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,490
She probably got some information from Lao Cai's family.

347
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,030
But sadly, they were still one step late.

348
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,720
Since they're already late...

349
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,370
why did you still need someone to follow them?

350
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,420
Lao Cai fleeing, what does

351
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,920
it have to do with us?

352
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,850
You went through great pains to help.

353
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,000
Are you trying to help her find the killer of her father?

354
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,780
I'm helping myself.

355
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,920
After acquiring Ling Long, not long after,

356
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,250
a fire hollowed out everything.

357
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,800
It left me no choice but to borrow <i>(money)</i> from the east.

358
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,630
Till now, even the ledger

359
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,300
has been burnt by others.

360
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,880
What do you think will happen next?

361
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,290
Come.

362
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,470
I originally thought we found some information.

363
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,850
But who knew we didn't even find anything.

364
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,600
It wasn't all for nothing.

365
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,330
We found a new lead

366
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,200
I believe, regardless of the bad luck we encountered.

367
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,550
His true colours will eventually be exposed.

368
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,880
I will definitely find out the truth.

369
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:16,460
Cai Hong, don't think too much right now.

370
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,690
You just need to rest right now.

371
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,670
Just leave Old Cai's matters to me.

372
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,760
I'll let you know first thing.

373
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,110
I caused you to worry this time.

374
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,330
You go home and rest too.

375
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,400
What's most important is you.

376
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,570
I'll get going then.

377
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,890
<i>Cai Hong.</i>

378
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,030
<i>There are certain things in this world,</i>

379
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,040
<i>it's best to let it</i>

380
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,000
<i>forever be a mystery. </i>

381
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,910
Sure enough, it wasn't as expected. Someone moved the signs

382
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,370
and caused Wu Cai Hong to take the wrong road.

383
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,150
Things are starting to become more clear.

384
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,710
We need to turn this around.

385
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,990
Help me to check the whereabouts of Old Cai's wife.

386
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:18,530
I understand, Young Master. Is there anything else?

387
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,480
How is Wu Cai Long's leg injury?

388
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,190
It seem like it's not a major injury.

389
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,750
Okay, go back to work.

390
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,470
What's wrong, Ah Li?

391
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,620
It's because that lady hit me.

392
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,020
The girl does not play around <i>(go easy)</i>

393
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,170
instead she took advantage and kept hitting me.

394
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,070
Ah Li, sorry. Blame me for this.

395
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,930
I asked for your help and you even got beaten up.

396
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,600
Take this.

397
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,540
Go and buy some medicines.

398
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,720
Brother. How could I accept your money?

399
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,960
I didn't even complete the task you assigned to me.

400
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,730
I even lost her.

401
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,180
I didn't help you at all. I can't accept this money.

402
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,070
You must accept this money. You helped me with the task.

403
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,900
Take this as the expenses for the medicines.

404
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,050
Take it.

405
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,440
I will accept this then.

406
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,830
In fact, regarding yesterday's matter, you could not rely on me.

407
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:31,140
I thought there would be time to get to know my brother's future wife.

408
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,710
She kept asking me questions along the way.

409
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:37,320
Don't be blinded by the fact that she looks like Lin Daiyu*, she's more like a dominatrix! <br> (*Lin Daiyu was a beautiful actress)

410
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,490
She used her shoes to hit my face.

411
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,600
Well... frankly...

412
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,580
when she isn't violent, she is a warm and beautiful person.

413
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,640
When she is violent, that is also like

414
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,900
the female hero, Mulan!

415
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,940
Could she be the one in your heart?

416
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,500
Really? I'm so stupid.

417
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,110
Why didn't you tell me she will be my sister-in-law?

418
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,670
When are you going to invite me to your wedding banquet?

419
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,640
It's still too early.

420
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,260
In Huzhou, my brother is such a great person.

421
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,240
You can't even find someone like that if you tried.

422
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,100
There are ladies in queue behind her. Why isn't she anxious?

423
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,270
I hope so too.

424
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,030
Oh right brother, yesterday I led the small white horse back,

425
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,490
how do you think I should give it back?

426
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,810
That horse isn't missed, it's yours now.

427
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,880
-Mine? <br>-Yours.

428
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,660
I guess it's like Robin Hood. I'll accept it.

429
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,840
Ah Li. I have something on. I'm leaving first. Take care.

430
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,310
- Then do you need anything else? <br> - Let's drink together sometime.

431
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,700
Invite me to your wedding banquet.

432
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,020
<i>If you didn't take the wrong road, I could have gone home earlier.</i>

433
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,970
<i>- Are you going to leave or not? <br>- I'm not leaving.</i>

434
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,980
<i>Can't you see that I'm injured?</i>

435
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,150
<i>I don't need you. Put me down.</i>

436
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,710
<i>Be careful.</i>

437
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,610
What's wrong?

438
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,510
What is with you and Wu Cai Hong?

439
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,970
What do you mean?

440
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:33,580
She is the daughter of your enemy. That night...

441
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,600
Do you know how worried I was over you?

442
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,830
If something were to happen to you,

443
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,710
what are mom and I going to do?

444
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:45,090
If you are worried about this, I have already explained what I need to.

445
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,260
I'm not just worried about this.

446
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,980
Brother. Did you forget about revenge for Dad?

447
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,420
I have never forgotten about it.

448
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,220
Kick Wu Cai Hong out of Ling Long tomorrow then.

449
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,350
Why?

450
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:06,370
Because she is Wu Da Hong's daughter. She is our enemy.

451
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,430
The devil is always dressed as an angel.

452
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,910
But you must not be lured in by the devil.

453
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:18,240
As she pulls you in,

454
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,640
you must not forget about Dad's death.

455
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,120
You must never forget the more than twenty years of sufferings that we went through.

456
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,680
You must not be touched by our enemy's daughter.

457
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,680
I have never forgotten about my Dad's death.

458
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,980
I won't let Cai Hong do this.

459
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,190
This is my intent.

460
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,670
Are you really going to be this way?

461
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,210
If not then?

462
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,570
Fine. I hope that you will keep your word.

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

464
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,890
Strange. Where did I leave it?

465
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,560
Mom.

466
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,280
- Madam. <br>- Mom.

467
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,110
Give it to me.

468
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,130
Let go.

469
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,170
Madam, what's wrong?

470
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,310
What's wrong?

471
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,300
Mom, don't scare me.

472
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,290
Everything's fine.

473
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,130
Blood!

474
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,880
Let's go to the hospital. Get the car ready.

475
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,130
Young Master, it's here.

476
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,340
Mom, what's wrong? What happened?

477
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,710
Wu Da Hong is back.

478
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,930
Wu Da Hong is back. He is going to harm our family.

479
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,450
Wu Da Hong is already dead.

480
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,820
He won't harm us.

481
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,940
- He's back. <br>- Don't be afraid.

482
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,830
He is already dead.

483
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,950
- Impossible. <br>- He won't harm us again.

484
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,920
He is already dead.

485
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,180
- Are you telling me the truth? <br>- Yes.

486
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,130
It's really true. Mom, Wu Da Hong is already dead.

487
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,020
We didn't want to tell you so you wouldn't be upset.

488
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,450
He is really dead.

489
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,980
It's true. Mom. No one will dare to bully us again.

Impossible, he is not dead.

492
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,980
He won't let go, even if he is dead.

493
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,540
HIs daughter will harm us.

494

Young Master.

497
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,310
Mom. Let's go to the hospital now.

498
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,120
Come, quick.

499
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,670
Quick.

500
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,160
He is not dead.

501
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,790
Why did you let my mother see this?

502
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,810
Take this away and burn it.

503
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,990
So many years, even with mom's illness, she has had good times.

504
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,230
But with you and the house,

505
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,100
it's causing too great a damage to mom.

506
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,460
Brother. Mom is old.

507
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,490
She really can not take much more.

508
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,090

He went out. If there is anything, you can tell me.

Previously, Young Master told me to check on the whereabouts of Old Cai's wife.
