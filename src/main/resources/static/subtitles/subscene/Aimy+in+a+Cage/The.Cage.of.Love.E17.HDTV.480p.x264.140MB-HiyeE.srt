The Cage of Love

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,430
<i>Episode 17</i>

3
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,600
Wu Cai Hong.

4
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,870
Are you okay? Let me take a look.

5
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,830
I'm fine.

6
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,010
- Let me do it.
- Don't tidy up.

7
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,100
Come here, quick.

8
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,080
Does it hurt?

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,520
Is it painful?

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,690
I'm fine.

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,680
You are still thinking about Zhou Shao Tian.

12
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,890
I don't know what his place in my heart is.

13
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,510
I remember when my father was alive,

14
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,680
our home was filled with visitors.

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,650
My father would always praise Brother Shao Tian,

16
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:43,180
but in my heart, he was just a good friend and like a brother.

17
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,180
When my father passed away, all my relatives and friends

18
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,880
pretended not to know me.

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,120
They ignored me too.

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,520
I only had Brother Shao Tian. No matter who abandoned us,

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,500
he would think of ways to help us.

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,970
At that time, I really didn't know what to do.

23
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,640
During that period of time,

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,620
if it wasn't for Brother Shao Tian, I don't know how we would have gotten through.

25
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,330
If Brother Shao Tian took the money from Ling Long

26
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,820
and killed my father, then, in this world,

27
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,960
I really don't know who to trust.

28
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:41,100
Sometimes, you need to face the truth.

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,980
By the way, why are you looking for me?

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,770
Have you ever seen Zhou Shao Tian's Parker fountain pen?

31
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,970
Why would Brother Shao Tian have a Parker fountain pen? What do you mean?

32
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,590
Never mind.

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,950
Mr Jiang. This is the oversea's address of the fountain pen that you wanted.

34
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,320
Thanks.

35
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:27,460
Don't mention it, Mr Jiang. If you need anything, please let us know. Our shop can also order goods for you.

36
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,220
No need for the time being.

37
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,560
Fei Fei, please see Boss Fu out.

38
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,840
- Okay.
- Mr Jiang, I'm taking my leave first.

39
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,920
Bye.

40
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,630
- Hello.
- I would like to trouble you.

41
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,130
Please send a telegram to this address.

42
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,030
Okay.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,170
What is the message of the telegram?

44
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,360
Please keep it short.

45
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,530
Dear Sir or Madam. How are you?

46
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,300
I previously purchased a Parker fountain pen from you.

47
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:13,450
There is a problem with it now. May I ask if I can use the warranty for repairs?

48
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,430
- Is that all?
- Yes.

49
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay. Your name, please.

50
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,630
Zhou Shao Tian.

51
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,950
Zhou Shao Tian.

52
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,920
Why are you day dreaming in front of me instead of working?

53
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,490
I would like to take some time off to go out for a while.

54
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,550
Take time off?

55
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,390
Why are you taking time off when my brother has gone out?

56
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,270
Are you going for a rendezvous and are afraid that my brother will find out?

57
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,550
I will be back soon.

58
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,770
I hope that you never come back ever.

59
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,430
I will be back soon.

60
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,440
Okay, go.

61
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,990
I will take it as I didn't see this

62
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,930
but if my brother were to find out,

63
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,990
and he beats or scolds you, it's your problem then.

64
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,860
Thank you.

65
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,050
Hello, Miss Lu.

66
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,910
Miss Wu. What brings you here?

67
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,180
It's such a surprise. Come, take a seat.

68
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,630
No need.

69
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:02,190
I would like to ask you if Brother Shao Tian borrowed $500,000 from you.

70
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,120
Regarding this matter,

71
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,740
yes, he did.

72
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,910
He said that he used his life in exchange for it. Is this true?

73
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,150
How could you use someone's life in exchange?

74
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,770
I'm a business woman. There is nothing that can't be traded with business transactions.

75
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,230
What are you going to use Brother Shao Tian's life for?

76
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:31,280
I don't want Zhou Shao Tian's life but you should know that there is chaos in the military now.

77
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,090
There will always be someone who would trade his life for a task.

78
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,700
Where is he? I want to see him. We will return the money to you.

79
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm afraid it's already too late.

80
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,760
He should already be on the way there.

81
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,650
Are you joking with me now?

82
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,530
What did you task him with?

83
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,300
Miss Wu. I think you already read the newspapers.

84
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,540
The Yao Jiangsu and Zhejiang War has already broken out. <i>War between two providences.</i>

85
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,010
The army and Shanghai's army are allies.

86
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,310
Shao Tian is taking cloth on through to the frontline

87
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,620
to give to the General in Shanghai.

88
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,970
Why did you send him there?

89
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,240
It's because this is a very important mission. He must not make a mistake. If he doesn't do it well,

90
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,310
Mr Zhou is an important part of the business.

91
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:24,310
Of course, a smart person will not go but there is no one as brave as Zhou Shao Tian.

92
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,810
Zhou Shao Tian is the most suitable person that I know.

93
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,600
Especially, when he needed a big sum of money to buy the house.

94
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,570
Who are you to him? It is like you forced him to go.

95
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,920
I really didn't force him. He went willingly.

96
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,250
He really wanted to buy the house back for you.

97
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,980
Instead you should thank me for helping him fulfill his wish.

98
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,080
I don't need the house.

99
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,130
I don't need him to risk his life either.

100
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:02,300
It's already too late now. The plan is at 12 noon. He should have already left.

101
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,340
Even if Zhou Shao Tian didn't tell you that he's going to the frontline,

102
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,340
it looks like he really loves you very much.

103
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,010
He only doesn't want you to worry.

104
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,940
Frankly, I did ask him why he wanted to buy the house.

105
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,930
He said that it was not just a house.

106
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:35,540
It contains all your childhood memories. It contains the memories of your mother and her garden.

107
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:42,360
Also, when he was nineteen years old,

108
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,110
he saw you for the first time. You were reading a book.

109
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:56,070
<i>It's a pity that there aren't any men in this world who can help me to find my memories that I lost.</i>

110
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,990
<i>Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to this point.</i>

111
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,110
Stepmom!

112
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,030
Stepmom!

113
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,960
Stepmom!

114
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,150
Stepmom!

115
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,870
Coming.

116
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,710
Stepmom!

117
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,090
What's going on? Why are you so anxious? Look at her.

118
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,400
Is Brother Shao Tian still here?

119
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,740
He left after he brought Cai Yun here.

120
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,560
Why would he be here?

121
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,270
Aren't he and his mother staying here?

122
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,620
Isn't he living with his mother at his house?

123
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,730
Why would he be living here?

124
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,890
Cai Hong. You just came back. Why are you leaving so soon?

125
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,740
Brother Shao Tian.

126
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,840
Coming.

127
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,260
- Aunt.
- Miss Wu, what brings you here?

128
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,490
Is Brother Shao Tian in?

129
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,450
Miss Wu. Let's go in and talk.

130
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,640
Did Brother Shao Tian already leave?

131
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,510
He left about one and a half hour ago.

132
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,300
He said that he's going on a business trip and will be back in six months.

133
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,850
No need, Aunt.

134
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,920
Brother Shao Tian really left?

135
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,350
Why didn't he tell me?

136
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,010
He did so much for me and I didn't know anything about it.

137
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,190
Miss Wu. Please don't blame him.

138
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:36,160
He has been working night and day ever since he joined Rong Da just to give you a better life.

139
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,480
He didn't tell you about his business trip? It's probably that he's afraid you might worry.

140
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,940
I'm not blaming Brother Shao Tian.

141
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,290
I'm only blaming myself.

142
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,000
Brother Shao Tian is the General Manager of Rong Da

143
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,130
and you are still living here.

144
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,500
He helped me to buy back my home.

145
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,940
It's my fault.

146
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,830
I misjudged Brother Shao Tian.

147
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,950
Miss Wu, don't be sad over this.

148
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,080
Brother Shao Tian and I are used to living here.

149
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,060
He is very sincere about you and thinks on your behalf.

150
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,060
Frankly, I'm very happy.

151
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,380
I was afraid that he would still hold grudges in his heart.

152
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,200
Aunt, what do you mean?

153
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,020
I'm saying that I thought he was being good to you because you came from a rich family

154
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,090
but after having gone through this, I understand now.

155
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:38,910
Shao Tiao really likes you. I'm very happy.

156
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,890
Aunt, I will visit you another day. I'm going to find Brother Shao Tian.

157
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,590
Foolish child. Shao Tian already left one and a half hours ago.

158
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,960
He has already left the city gate. How are you going to find him?

159
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,040
Aunt, don't worry. Regardless of where he went, I will look for him.

160
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,430
<i>Brother Shao Tian,</i>

161
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,420
<i>sorry.</i>

162
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,510
<i>It's my fault.</i>

163
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,780
<i>You treated me so well and I still suspected you.</i>

164
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:57,900
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

165
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,170
Why are you standing alone here?

166
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,430
Are you trying to slack off from work?

167
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,350
I made a mistake about Brother Shao Tian.

168
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,780
What did he tell you?

169
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,310
Lu Man lent him money. Brother Shao Tian went to Shanghai to give the General clothes.

170
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,090
but

171
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:37,020
he needs to deliver it through the Jiangsu and Zhejiang blockage. <i>Battlefield</i>

172
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,900
It will be very dangerous.

173
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,190
If Brother Shao Tian

174
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,290
gets into trouble...

175
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:54,980
My... my life will be condemned.

176
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,930
It's my fault.

177
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,000
I blamed him by mistake.

178
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,940
He has been totally sincere about me.

179
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,060
I heard that you didn't eat anything for the entire night.

180
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,020
Here.

181
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,490
Eat something now.

182
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,960
Thank you. I don't have an appetite.

183
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,790
Do you know that your form of self-abuse will cause my family problems?

184
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,020
Is he that important to you?

185
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,270
Mr Zhou. We will be able to reach your home in two or three days.

186
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,310
Row faster. It should take us about two days.

187
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,440
Boatman, can you speed up?

188
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,700
This is already very fast, Second Master. I'm more anxious than you. This place is very chaotic.

189
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,630
Bullets could fly past. If I didn't need to support my family, who would want to come here to do this business?

190
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,550
Look. Do you see any other boats here?

191
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:08,300
This place is very dangerous. Others wouldn't want to come here but why you?

192
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,070
Mr Zhou. I won't hide from you. No one wants to take on such a dangerous task

193
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,670
but I'm not doing this because they paid me double.

194
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,420
My mom is sick and she is waiting for my money to see the doctor.

195
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,950
I wonder if my mom is feeling better.

196
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,130
Take this money. The money that you received in double is not that much.

197
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:38,410
Use this money to take your mom to the doctor. Don't take on such a dangerous task in the future. Stay home and look after your mom.

198
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,330
Mr Zhou. I can't take this money.

199
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,720
Life is hard for everyone.

200
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,660
If it wasn't, you wouldn't be undertaking in this dangerous task either.

201
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,310
Listen to me. Take the money.

202
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,250
I'm also here because of someone very important.

203
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,990
Your parents are still alive. Grasp the opportunity to show filial piety (to them).

204
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,760
Don't regret it when they're gone.

205
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,330
You will suffer and regret it.

206
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,620
Wu Cai Hong. What do you want to do?

207
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:37,730
Brother Shao Tian must be lacking in food by now.

208
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,810
He could also be injured.

209
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,860
Why do you always expect the worst?

210
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,070
The day Brother Shao Tian lit up paper latterns,

211
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,780
why didn't I give him a chance to explain?

212
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,070
He waited for me the entire night that day.

213
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:15,030
At that time, was he in the same mood as I am now?

214
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,930
Listen carefully to me.

215
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,830
You are the servant of the Jiang family. I'm ordering you to eat, drink and sleep

216
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,900
and do your work properly.

217
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,010
Boatman, row faster.

218
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,820
Okay.

219
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,500
Let me take a look. Mr Zhou, you hand is injured.

220
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,340
I'm fine. Boatman, row faster!

221
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,060
- Quick.
- Okay.

222
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,500
Miss. Zhou Shao Tian is back.

223
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,810
Did he complete his task?

224
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,280
Yes.

225
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,670
This Zhou Shao Tian didn't disappoint me.

226
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:27,030
Mr Wu is very satisfied, Miss. He said it went well during a critical time.

227
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,080
Where is Zhou Shao Tian? Why didn't he find me when he' returned?

228
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,320
He is injured.

229
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,450
Thus, I sent men to take him to the hospital.

230
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,700
Is his injury serious?

231
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,380
This won't do. Uncle Lai, get the rickshaw ready. I'm going to the hospital to see him.

232
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,000
Miss. Are you worried about Zhou Shao Tian?

233
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,140
I'm not worried about him.

234
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,980
If I retain this person, he will be able to do other tasks for me in the future.

235
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,930
Uncle Lai. Can you find someone to deliver a letter to Wu Cai Hong?

236
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,250
Since Zhou Shao Tian is in this condition,

237
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,340
I think he would want to see Wu Cai Hong very much.

238
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,340
He did such a big favour for me. I should be happy on his behalf.

239
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,990
Okay, I will do it immediately.

240
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,550
Shao Tian, how are you feeling?

241
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,770
I heard that you were injured and I rushed here.

242
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,780
Doctor, how is his injury?

243
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,280
Provide me with the best medicines. Don't cut any costs.

244
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,570
-Alright.
Mr. Zhou's injuries are all exterior but it's a bit deep.

245
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,570
Also, he came a bit late.

246
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:57,200
But Miss Lu, don't worry. I gave the best medicines to Mr Zhou.

247
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,340
Thank you, Doctor.

248
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,370
Shao Tian, how are you feeling now? Does it still hurt?

249
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,740
You really helped me with a big task. I didn't misjudge you.

250
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,250
Looks like I should thank you well.

251
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,050
I'm going out first. Call me if there is anything.

252
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,480
Have a good rest.

253
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,090
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

254
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,050
Ms. Lu gave me such a big task. I practically lost my life.

255
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:36,090
I knew Manager Zhou is full of tricks so I knew you would make it.

256
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,130
Look, didn't you come back safe and sound?

257
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,640
I think you intentionally sent me to seek death.

258
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,100
If I died, you would have benefited the most. Rong Da would have belonged to you.

259
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,450
Who do you take me for?

260
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,890
I have no interest in your petty Rong Da.

261
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,080
What I want is Ling Long's secret formula.

262
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,980
Enough. Didn't you come back safely?

263
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,970
Moreover, your efforts were not wasted.

264
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,080
I already sent someone to ask Miss Wu to come here.

265
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,090
Your lover was crying as if the world had ended so of course, she will come.

266
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,520
Will Cai Hong really come?

267
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,690
She'll definitely come. You can count on it.

268
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:37,760
Not long after you left, she came to ask me if I really lent you the money.

269
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,720
What did you reply to her?

270
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,370
Of course, I said a lot of good things about you.

271
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,430
Talked about your love, even the gods would be shaking.

272
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,890
I have a good gut feeling about Cai Hong.

273
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,160
You don't need to tell me about your gut feelings.

274
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,730
Okay, I talked too much.

275
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,550
But this time,

276
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,650
you really escaped death.

277
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:02,130
One must not play with fate.

278
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,030
Was it worth it?

279
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,070
It's worth it as long as she's happy.

280
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,950
Brother Shao Tian.

281
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,580
Brother Shao Tian.

282
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,650
Miss Lu.

283
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay. Seeing that you are alive, I don't have to worry anymore.

284
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,580
I'm leaving first,

285
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,870
so as to not disturb you two.

286
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,770
Brother Shao Tian.

287
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,010
What's wrong with your hand?

288
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,660
Is it serious? Why are you in this condition?

289
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,790
You went to the frontline without even telling me.

290
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,270
Did you know that I was worried about you every day?

291
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,080
I was afraid that you would be hurt and wouldn't be able to eat properly. You are still smiling?

292
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,370
Can't you see that I'm fine?

293
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,240
Cai Hong, it's no big deal. Seriously.

294
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,950
Aren't I back now?

295
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,650
Let me ask you.

296
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,960
Do you still blame me?

297
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,120
It's my fault.

298
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,270
I shouldn't have suspected you.

299
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,960
I would like to apologise to you. Will you forgive me?

300
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,440
I don't blame you at all.

301
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,940
Being able to come back safely and see you, I'm already very happy.

302
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,380
Promise me then.

303
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,060
Promise me that you won't do such foolish things again.

304
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:45,930
It's not important whether I get back my home or not. I only want you to be safe.

305
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,940
I already lost my father.

306
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,940
I don't want to lose you either.

307
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,490
I promise you that I will never ever leave you.

308
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,000
Promise me too, okay?

309
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,740
Trust me.

310
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,940
We will forever be together.

311
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,070
I promise you.

312
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,080
The doctor told me just now that

313
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,330
I can be discharged early.

314
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,370
I will take you home.

315
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,140
You can really be discharged?

316
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,570
Of course, I can.

317
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:32,340
Think about it. My mom hasn't seen me for a long time. She must have missed me like crazy.

318
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,900
Moreover, if she sees me taking you home, she will be extremely happy.

319
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,270
I'm back.

320
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,350
Shao Tian is back?

321
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,690
Miss Wu is also here?

322
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,230
Shao Tian, what's wrong with you?

323
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,340
- It's nothing major.
- Why are you injured?

324
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,400
Aren't I back safe and sound? Don't kick up a big fuss.

325
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,790
No. How could you be injured on a business trip?

326
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,790
Did you fight with someone?

327
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:12,790
I helped Rong Da send the General cloth. While traveling through the blockade, we were shot at.

328
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,450
Are you crazy? You want money instead of your life? It was such a dangerous task and you still dared to do it.

329
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,130
Aunt, please don't blame Brother Shao Tian.

330
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,310
He did this for me,

331
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,670
but he already promised me that he will never leave me again.

332
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,950
He also swore that he wouldn't do any more dangerous tasks in the future.

333
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,120
I already swore to Cai Hong that

334
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,760
I won't do any dangerous tasks again in the future.

335
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,180
But I did it for money this time.

336
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,970
It's so that you will have a daughter-in-law and grandchildren soon.

337
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,780
Really?

338
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,760
But my words don't count. Cai Hong still needs to nod her head.

339
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:00,470
Miss Wu. Will you nod your head or not?

340
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,330
Excellent.

341
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,720
I have been waiting for this day.

342
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,580
Stay here for a meal. I'm going to prepare it now.

343
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,940
Let's go in.

344
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,910
You don't need to see me off.

345
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,190
You are still injured. Stay home and have a good rest.

346
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:43,720
Look, my wrist's injury is not that bad.
Let me take you home.

347
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,940
Brother Shao, don't worry.

348
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,520
I will come again if I have the time.

349
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,860
Okay, be careful on the way home.

350
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:18,690
Shao Tian. I can tell that Miss Wu is a good girl.

351
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,520
There are certain things that can't be bought in the world.

352
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,990
You must treasure her.

353
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,340
Sorry for coming back late.

354
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,180
Is Zhou Shao Tian back?

355
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,860
He went to the frontline to deliver cloth?

356
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:30,700
He did this to buy back my home. He almost lost his life.

357
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,090
I made a mistake about him.

358
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,330
Looks like his plan really worked.

359
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,890
You are not allowed to say that about Brother Shao Tian.

360
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,240
Also, stay out of my business.

361
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,020
I don't want anyone to ruin our relationship.

362
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,320
I really want to find out the truth.

363
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,180
I swear that I will not suspect Brother Shao Tian again.

364
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,790
I will believe every single word that he says.

365
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,050
I already told you not to get involved.

366
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,740
So what? Nothing comes out of doing good deeds, right?

367
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:34,990
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

368
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:50,580
<i>You are allowed to say that about Brother Shao Tian. Stay out of my business too.</i>

369
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,080
<i>I don't want anyone to ruin our relationship.</i>

370
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,860
Brother.

371
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,710
What were you thinking about that caused you to look so captivated?

372
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,470
What's wrong?

373
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,740
This is for you.

374
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,070
It seems to be a telegram from overseas.

375
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:24,030
<i>Dear Mr Zhou Shao Tian, the Parker pen that you bought from us on April 1923</i>

376
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:27,310
<i>is a luxurious item so it's under a lifetime guarantee.</i>

377
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:33,040
<i>If there are any issues, you can send the item back.</i>

378
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,410
Brother. Isn't this telegram for Zhou Shao Tian?

379
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:42,970
Why is it addressed to you at this place?

380
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,260
Where are you going?

381
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,800
I'm going to find Brother Shao Tian. I already completed my tasks for today.

382
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,980
- Moreover, I already...
- Fine, I will go with you to see him.

383
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:10,930
Even though I'm your maid, regarding the matters between Brother Shao Tian and I, you can't get involved.

384
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,720
Wait until you read this

385
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,380
and see if you still believe Brother Shao Tian.

386
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,340
But I won't look at it.

387
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,350
No matter what you say, I will always trust Brother Shao Tian.

388
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:31,160
He has another Parker pen from America after your father passed away.

389
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,470
Read it.

390
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,330
<i>Leave this task to me.</i>

391
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:14,320
<i>I will order the same pen for your father's birthday.</i>

392
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,810
<i>It's a Parker pen.</i>

393
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,520
Impossible.

394
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,160
Brother Shao Tian would never do this.

395
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,420
I'm going to ask him.

396
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,070
Coming.

397
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,080
Miss Wu.

398
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,760
- Aunt.
- Young Master Shao?

399
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,040
- Aunt.
- Why are the both of you together?

400
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,280
Is Brother Shao Tian in?

401
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,720
Please come in and talk about this.

402
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,970
It's like this. I have something important to ask Brother Shao Tian.

403
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,610
Shao Tian went out.

404
00:33:54,610 --> 00:34:01,380
He has been nursing his injuries for half a month. If you didn't visit him often, he would have gone back to work.

405
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,850
He came back to say that he's leaving on a business trip and won't be back today.

406
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,840
Aunt.

407
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,260
I would like to know if Brother Shao Tian owns a Parker Pen.

408
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,190
Parker pen?

409
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,380
Yes.

410
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:23,020
It's exactly the same as this.

411
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,840
It seems so. Yes, I saw him bringing out a fountain pen.

412
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,420
He was very careful about it.

413
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,720
He ordered it from overseas.

414
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,340
Do you know roughly when?

415
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,990
Yes.

416
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,420
It was on the day when the incident happened to Old Master Wu.

417
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,640
I'm old.

418
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,390
I can't remember things

419
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:52,380
but it just so happens that it was on the day of your father's incident.

420
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,820
Thus, I could still remember it.

421
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:03,350
How could that be? Why would Brother Shao Tian own the same pen?

422
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,710
I'm going to ask him.

423
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,330
Miss Wu.

424
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,540
Young Master Jiang, what's going on?

425
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,940
What's wrong with Shao Tian?

426
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,990
Aunt. Regarding this, it's better that you ask him yourself.

427
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,120
When I was fifteen years old,

428
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,370
when my mother had a stroke, I was reading a book.

429
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,880
Even when her temperament wasn't good,

430
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,830
I would take care of her diligently every day.

431
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:30,950
I was afraid that every single word and action would make her angry.

432
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:36,450
No matter what, I would tread carefully around her

433
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,550
but she was still afraid that she would exhaust me.

434
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:42,060
She left me.

435
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,960
It wasn't easy for me to accept my mom's death.

436
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:01,870
Now, I need to face my father's death.

437
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,100
I don't know who harmed my father.

438
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,420
During that short period of time,

439
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,590
Brother Shao Tian was with me.

440
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:17,150
He comforted me.

441
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:22,420
I thought that I would be able to rely on him forever

442
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,490
but now, I suspect that Brother Shao Tian

443
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,150
is my father's killer.

444
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,390
I don't know why he did that.

445
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,560
There are certain things that will sound cruel when I speak about it, but I still think

446
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,030
you need to know. In fact, you should think seriously about it.

447
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:59,640
Do you really think that Zhou Shao Tian's life is worth that much money?

448
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,540
Was it really worth Miss Lu paying such a high price just to tell him to complete a mission?

449
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,220
Don't you find it very strange?

450
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:13,650
But if his money is from Ling Long,

451
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,350
it becomes a different matter of course.

452
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,820
You are too cruel!

453
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:25,350
Why do you want me to believe that the only person who I trust is the killer of my father?

454
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,540
I don't believe it.

455
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,580
I don't believe it.

456
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,190
Come in.

457
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,110
Director Chen Suo.

458
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,810
This is the reply from the overseas office of the Parker pen.

459
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,780
It clearly proves that

460
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:02,690
prior to Wu Hong's death, Zhou Shao Tian purchased a Parker pen and it

461
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,710
is exactly the same as mine.

462
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:10,320
This telegram contains really important information and it's compelling evidence.

463
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,560
Shi Jie. Since there is new evidence, do your best to break this case.

464
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,320
Give Mr Jiang and Miss Wu an explanation as soon as possible.

465
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,720
Yes.

466
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:28,360
Mr Jiang, Miss Wu, Director Chen will take care of the matter.

467
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,290
Don't be too anxious,

468
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:35,540
but Wu Hong Da's case was a long time ago.

469
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,570
The longer the timeframe, the higher possibility that someone tampered with the evidence.

470
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,940
To add further, his injury wasn't from a fountain pen.

471
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,940
A fountain pen doesn't prove that he committed a crime.

472
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,480
Miss Wu, me saying this is not me pushing the blame

473
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,640
on the relationship between you and Zhou Shao Tian. I will not give you the reason of the law to fight.

474
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,330
But don't you worry, the police will not let go of anyone. If it's really Zhou Shao Tian's doing,

475
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,980
he will be dealt with accordingly.

476
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,060
Okay, we know.

477
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,330
<i>Shi Jie.
- Superintendent Ting.</i>

478
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,980
I will let you be responsible for this case.

479
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,460
If you face any difficulties, report to me and I will give you my utmost support.

480
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,900
I hope that you can break the case soon and give them an explanation.

481
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,270
Yes.

482
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,900
Cai Hong, don't worry.

483
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,020
I will definitely give your father in heaven an explanation.
