5

The Cage of Love

19
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,310
<i>Episode 27</i>

20
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,200
Zhou Shao Tian.

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,980
Do you have anything else to defend yourself with?

22
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,210
Shao Tian. Say something.

23
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,390
Didn't you swear to me that by using your father's name that you didn't kill Old Master Wu?

24
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,120
You didn't kill him. You are not a killer. Say something.

25
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,990
If you create a scene again, I will kick you out of the court.

26
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,870
Zhou Shao Tian. Based on the allegations by the police

27
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,050
the court will conclude the present case.

28
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,550
Is there anything that you need to explain yourself?

29
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,700
Zhou Shao Tian. Since you have nothing to say,

30
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,150
with that, the court will move the case for sentencing.

31
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,190
We will announce the verdict now.

32
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,750
Ling Long's weaving and dyeing factories original owner and Secretary Zhou Shao Tian

33
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,130
used his position

34
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,350
together with Old Cai, the original Ling Long Treasurer,

35
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,150
embezzled RMB$10 million.

36
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,960
After that, Zhou Shao Tian killed Boss Wu of Ling Long.

37
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,070
There is very clear evidence,

38
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:30,170
for the court to sentence Zhou Shao Tian with murder charges

39
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,130
and subject the death sentence three days from now.

40
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,080
Why did he faint? Old Cai!

41
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,810
- Stay calm. <br>- What's wrong?

42
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,530
In regards to the Rong Da weaving and dyeing factory and the Wu home,

43
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,190
because Zhao Shao Tian acquired these through illegal means,

44
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,340
the court judgement

45
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,510
is to return everything to the Wu family.

46
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,170
Court dismissed.

47
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,770
We can still save him. Send him the the emergency department of the hospital now.

48
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,160
Don't delay. Go with me to the hospital now.

49
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,660
You both, guard here.

50
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,230
Yes.

51
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,250
<i>Hello. What do you think of your son being a killer?</i>

52
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,320
Don't ask me. I don't know.

53
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,660
<i>Don't leave. Please say a few words.</i>

54
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,950
<i>Please comment.</i>

55
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,240
Stop.

56
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,830
Where is the ambulance?

57
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,730
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

58
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,090
<i>I really can't believe this. </i>

59
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,690
God finally opened his eyes.

60
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,930
Old Master can rest in peace now.

61
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,940
Mom. Let's go.

62
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,010
<i>I really never imagined this.</i>

63
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,160
May I ask, you are...

64
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,650
We are doctors from Fu Yan hospital. We just received a call from the police.

65
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,750
We heard that someone fainted in court.

66
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,900
We came as fast as we could.

67
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,620
But a doctor already came just now.

68
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,160
- He took the patient away. <br>- How could this be?

69
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,990
We have limited hospital staff. Another doctor couldn't have come.

70
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,170
-Director. <br>- What's wrong?

71
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,770
Old Cai has been taken away.

72
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,130
What?

73
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,670
Don't tell anyone. Find him and get him back immediately.

74
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,360
Yes.

75
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,060
Hello.

76
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,550
Boss Jiang. The verdict has been announced.

77
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,290
Zhou Shao Tian has been sentenced to death.

78
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,960
- I get it. <br>- But Old Cai has been taken away by someone.

79
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,870
<i>Zhou Shao Tian, goodbye.</i>

Perfect son-in law receives death penalty! Execution follows in 3 days!

- Give me one. <br>- Headline.

123
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,990
He will sentenced to death in three days.

124
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,600
Miss Wu.

125
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,930
Aunt, please get up now.

126
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,620
I'm begging you. Please help Shao Tian.

127
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,240
- I don't know how to help him. <br>- Shao Tian would never kill anyone.

128
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,090
I'm begging you. Please help him.

129
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,890
Aunt. You also saw

130
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,010
the statements by others.

131
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,920
The court also found him guilty.

132
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,270
Brother Shao Tian didn't want to defend himself.

133
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,000
I really can't help him.

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,760
Shao Tian didn't defend himself. He must have his reasons.

135
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,690
Shao Tian would never kill anyone.

136
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,530
I have something to tell you.

137
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,250
Please let me finish talking first.

138
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,820
Aunt. Let's go in and talk.

139
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,910
Aunt, please sit.

140
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,810
Have some tea.

141
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,860
Aunt. What do you have to say to me?

142
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,080
Miss Wu. The police said that Shao Tian stole Ling Long's money.

143
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,830
I believe this.

144
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,060
Moreover, I knew about it. He planned it for a long time.

145
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,890
There are certain things you may not know.

146
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,410
Ling Long belonged to the Jiang family ten years ago.

147
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,020
I know.

148
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,730
My father framed Old Master Jiang

149
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,200
and closed down Ling Long.

150
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,040
I know that my father caused the death of Old Master Jiang.

151
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,540
But there are certain things that you don't know.

152
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,780
Shao Tian probably didn't tell you.

153
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,990
What is it that I knew nothing about it?

154
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,610
Many years ago,

155
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,120
I was working at Ling Long factory.

156
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,750
Shao Tian's father was very sick.

157
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,280
Fortunately, with Old Master Jiang's help,

158
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,450
we had some money to let my husband see the doctor.

159
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:32,380
Later, something happened at the factory,

160
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,280
your father had Ling Long searched.

161
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,580
He fired all Ling Long's original workers.

162
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,360
Our family was going to starve to death.

163
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,470
I could only just watch Shao Tian's father

164
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,580
suffer in pain in bed on that day.

165
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,910
We didn't have money to buy medicine.

166
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,030
I didn't have any choice.

167
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:06,100
It was me who personally used my hands to strangle him to death.

168
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,850
To help him ease the pain.

169
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,160
It was also to let Shao Tian have food and survive.

170
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,020
Shao Tian personally witnessed everything.

171
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,890
Aunt... What you mean is that...

172
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,370
if my father didn't frame Old Master Jiang,

173
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,180
and didn't search Ling Long, you wouldn't have lost your job

174
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,870
and nothing like that would have happened?

175
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,440
No. Miss Wu. I didn't mean that.

176
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,330
I don't blame Old Master Wu.

177
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,060
This is my fate as a poor person.

178
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:03,110
But this matter affected Shao Tian a lot.

179
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,920
Subsequently, your father took over Ling Long.

180
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,410
Shao Tian schemed to get into Ling Long and get close to your father.

181
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:20,950
I think he stole your father's money to make him feel what it was like to be penniless.

182
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,990
But no matter what,

183
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,520
even if he did not kill my father, he fancied the idea to do so.

184
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,070
Shao Tian would never kill anyone, Miss Wu.

185
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:42,000
Shao Tian joined Ling Long to get close to your father as part of his plan for revenge.

186
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,350
But...

187
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,790
he fell in love with you.

188
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,890
He couldn't control it.

189
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,440
This wasn't part of his plan.

190
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,700
All these years, he has been living in pain.

191
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,010
As his mother, I could see that.

192
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,780
I'm not speaking on behalf of my son.

193
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,500
Miss Wu. Think about it.

194
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,920
If he killed Old Master Wu, why didn't he leave then?

195
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,220
It's because he couldn't give up on you.

196
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,020
He would never kill anyone.

197
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,940
Why then, when Brother Shao Tian was in court,

198
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,560
didn't he defend himself?

199
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,010
He didn't even say anything.

200
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:38,910
This must be a misunderstanding. Shao Tian must be in some difficulties.

201
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:46,560
Previously, when Master Jiang brought the fountain pen to my house, I asked him about it.

202
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,970
He swore on his father's name.

203
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,100
He said that he didn't kill anyone.

204
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,770
I believe my son.

205
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:03,040
Miss Wu, don't be so haste in naming Shao as the murderer.

206
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,500
Think about his sincerity for you. Think about how good he was to you.

207
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,100
I'm begging you, Miss Wu.

208
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,220
Aunt, please get up now.

209
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,530
What you have said,

210
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,010
I will think carefully about this.

211
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,680
Thanks.

212
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,300
<i>Shao Tian joined Ling Long</i>

213
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,100
<i>to get close to your father. It was part of his plan.</i>

214
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,050
<i>But he fell in love with you.</i>

215
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,570
<i>Furthermore, he couldn't control it.</i>

216
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,200
<i>This wasn't part of his plan.</i>

217
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,460
<i>If he killed Old Master Wu, why didn't he leave then?</i>

218
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,240
<i>He couldn't give up on you.</i>

219
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,110
<i>He would never kill anyone.</i>

220
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,180
<i>He swore on his father's name.</i>

221
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,300
<i>He said that he didn't kill anyone.</i>

222
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,910
<i>I believe my son.</i>

223
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,790
What brings you here?

224
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:43,020
I'm very confused. I don't know how I got here.

225
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:53,060
Aunt Zhou told me a lot of things I didn't know today.

226
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:00,130
I have not imagined that my father's greed would cause so much tragedy.

227
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,090
What should I do?

228
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,280
What did Aunt Zhou tell you?

229
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,780
Uncle Zhou's death was connected to my father.

230
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,100
It was my father who took away Ling Long and caused Aunt Zhou to lose her job.

231
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,410
Because of this, she didn't have the money for medical fees.

232
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,430
At that time, Brother Shao Tian personally witnessed everything.

233
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,680
His mother strangled his father to death.

234
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,110
So Zhou Shao Tian, all these years, just was taking revenge for his father?

235
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,620
Aunt Zhou said that Brother Shao Tian stole Ling Long's money as part of his plan.

236
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,080
He wanted my father to experience what it was like without any money.

237
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,990
But he didn't kill my father.

238
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,500
I have known Brother Shao Tian for seven or eight years.

239
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,300
I can't accept that he killed my father.

240
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,330
I can't believe it either

241
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,980
but he didn't say anything.

242
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:11,030
He didn't defend himself himself and he's going to be executed soon.

243
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,750
Jiang Yu. You are very smart. You must have a way to save him.

244
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,050
Please help me to save Brother Shao Tian.

245
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,570
Ever since Old Cai got taken away,

246
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,300
I find that everything feels strange.

247
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,030
Zhou Shao Tian has already been found guilty. Who else would do that?

248
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,450
Who else wanted Old Cai?

249
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,110
I think it's possible that someone wants the secret formula.

250
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,120
They think that the secret formula is still with Old Cai.

251
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:02,570
I heard from Director Chen that there was someone else who was looking for Old Cai.

252
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,340
If that person is connected to the secret formula,

253
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:11,050
then wouldn't they had something to do with your father's death?

254
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,760
Let's look for Brother Shao Tian and check with him.

255
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,060
Could you go with me?

256
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:44,130
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

257
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,270
Aunt Zhou came to look for me.

258
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,050
She doesn't believe that you are the killer.

259
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:16,040
Brother Shao Tian. I don't believe that you killed my father either.

260
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,220
I would like to hear this personally from you.

261
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,840
The court has already given the verdict.

262
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,120
Do you need to ask again?

263
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,150
You have been with my father for ten years.

264
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,420
How could you have done it?

265
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,040
No matter what,

266
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,150
I still don't believe it.

267
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,190
You are going to die in two days.

268
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,890
Such a refined gentleman as you will probably say there is nothing to be afraid of.

269
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,330
What is there for me to be afraid of?

270
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:08,410
Since you want me to tell the truth, I would like to ask you something and you should answer truthfully too.

271
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,800
Before we exchange the truths...

272
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,110
I am a dead man walking.

273
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,710
I have nothing to lose. Would you dare?

274
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,700
Why wouldn't I dare?

275
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,980
Fine.

276
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:27,070
Let me ask you then. When Wu Hong Da died, was the secret formula with you?

277
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,790
Give me an honest answer and I will tell you the truth.

278
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,230
You are right.

279
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,910
The real secret formula was with me

280
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,750
but I already burnt it.

281
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,480
So, the secret formula was with you.

282
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,750
Jiang Yu. You are very sly. You tricked so many people.

283
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,820
Wu Hong Da personally gave me the secret formula.

284
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,860
It's not what everyone thought so, that I killed him for it.

285
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,360
Why didn't you tell me then?

286
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,680
You said that you waited 18 years for making the final steps in getting the formula.

287
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,250
Did you lie to me?

288
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,330
I did this to flush out the real killer of your father.

289
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,820
The Jiang family's secret formula

290
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,850
is being passed from generation to generation orally.

291
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:25,390
My father told me it when I was young. It's all in my memory.

292
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,460
And your father sharing the formula with me was the second step.

293
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:35,120
As for that secret formula, I still had to wait till I was eighteen years old before I could get it.

294
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,390
Okay, it's your turn.

295
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,000
Did you kill Wu Hong Da or not?

296
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,080
I didn't.

297
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:56,440
I know that I committed a lot of wrong things but I really didn't kill your father.

298
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,030
I didn't do that.

299
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,180
If it wasn't you,

300
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,080
why didn't you deny?

301
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,970
If I denied it, would you believe me?

302
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,890
So to say, you took Ling Long's money

303
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:16,240
and used the fountain pen to injure him but you didn't kill him.

304
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,820
- Is this the case? <br>-Yes.

305
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,730
When Wu Hong Da discovered that his money was transferred out,

306
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,650
he suspected me and Old Cai.

307
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,870
<i>Bye.</i>

308
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,590
<i>Enter.</i>

309
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,020
<i>Boss. You are looking for me?</i>

310
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,640
<i>Explain each and everything to me.</i>

311
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,720
<i>Boss. I...</i>

312
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,570
<i>I only borrowed a bit money for another company.</i>

313
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,390
<i>- As for the other, I really don't know anything about it. <br>- A bit of money?!</i>

314
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,480
<i>You call the lion share of Lin Long's profit for so many years a bit of money?</i>

315
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,910
<i>You loaned the money out?</i>

316
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,770
<i>Do you know that this will affect Ling Long?</i>

317
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,460
<i>Boss.</i>

318
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,720
<i>I swear that I really don't know anything.</i>

319
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,830
<i>That company said that they were in urgent need of cash and they would give me five percent interest.</i>

320
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,190
<i>I also wanted Ling Long... <br>- Five percent?</i>

321
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,860
<i>For all those years you have been feeding your private acount! Do you really want me to believe this story?</i>

322
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,740
<i>Let me tell you. This is not a lapse.</i>

323
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,720
<i>It's a conspiracy.</i>

324
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,820
<i>Boss. You must believe me. I have been loyal to you.</i>

325
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,340
<i>You must believe me.</i>

326
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,390
<i>I... I was also tricked by others.</i>

327
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:48,080
<i>Okay, tell me who tricked you then.</i>

328
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,860
<i>Speak.</i>

329
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,370
<i>Boss. Cai Hong said to pick you up and go back together.</i>

330
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,560
<i>I thought you already settled your work.</i>

331
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,080
<i>Go back first.</i>

332
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,930
<i>Wait for me in the office tomorrow morning.</i>

333
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,100
<i>Yes.</i>

334
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,940
<i>Boss. Can we leave now?</i>

335
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,440
<i>I still want to meet a</i>

336
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,990
<i>very important client.</i>

337
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,370
<i>Okay.</i>

338
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,950
<i>Shao Tian.</i>

339
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,790
<i>Don't you have anything else to tell me?</i>

340
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,990
<i>- Boss. Is there still something else? <br>- Speak now!</i>

341
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,170
<i>Why did you conspire with Old Cai?</i>

342
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,230
<i>and scam Ling Long of its money.</i>

343
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,810
<i>Was I lacking in warmth with you all these years?</i>

344
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:57,050
<i>Why did you do this?</i>

345
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,340
<i>Speak. Old Cai is an outsider.</i>

346
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,010
<i>I won't find it strange that he did this. As for you,</i>

347
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,490
<i>I have always regarded you as my son.</i>

348
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,290
<i>I regarded you as family.</i>

349
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,430
<i>publicly and secretly.</i>

350
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,190
<i>I already told you many times.</i>

351
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:25,120
<i>I thought of you as my successor.</i>

352
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,000
<i>Ling Long will be yours sooner or later.</i>

353
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,990
<i>What else are you still unhappy with?</i>

354
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:36,120
<i>Are you complaining that I have lived too long?</i>

355
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,050
<i>You wanted me to die earlier, right?</i>

356
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,310
<i>Frankly, this is not what you think it is.</i>

357
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,280
<i>Okay. Tell me then. What is it all about?</i>

358
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,960
<i>I will listen to you now. Speak.</i>

359
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,970
<i>You have nothing to say?</i>

360
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,040
<i>God, Zhao Sheng. In vain I have told you many times that growing a business is painstaking.</i>

361
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,170
<i>You still want to marry my daughter now. Dream on!</i>

362
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:12,550
<i>Okay, if you don't want to talk. Don't say anything at all.</i>

363
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,970
<i>Ungrateful person. Wait here, I'm going to call the police.</i>

364
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,080
<i>Get lost.</i>

365
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,190
<i>Let go.</i>

366
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,380
<i>You...</i>

367
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,050
<i>I'm going to call the police now.</i>

368
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,040
<i>Give it to me.</i>

369
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,430
<i>You ungrateful brat. Why did you do it?</i>

370
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,490
<i>I was forced to do it.</i>

371
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,090
<i>You were forced you to do it?</i>

372
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,520
<i>What do you mean?</i>

373
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,590
<i>You stubborn...</i>

374
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:15,870
In the midst of the confusion, I used the fountain pen to injure him.

375
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,040
<i>Are you trying to kill me?</i>

376
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,310
In the end, I rushed out

377
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,710
I wounded his shoulder,

378
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,610
but it wasn't life threatening.

379
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,160
I didn't kill him.

380
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,900
Who killed my father then?

381
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,990
When he died,

382
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,490
where were you?

383
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,740
I was with Old Cai. I tried to console him.

384
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,530
He was extremely scared and wanted me to leave with him.

385
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,640
<i>If we don't leave, it will be too late. We will really go to jail.</i>

386
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,910
<i>When I quarreled with the boss, I injured him.</i>

387
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,970
<i>- I didn't want to do that. <br>- Leave with me then.</i>

388
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,380
<i>Wu Hong Da will never let you off.</i>

389
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,240
<i>No. I must explain to Cai Hong.</i>

390
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,410
<i>If I leave now, I won't be able to explain myself.</i>

391
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,070
<i>I... You are a man.</i>

392
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,040
<i>Why are you so indecisive over a woman?</i>

393
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,910
Cai Hong. You said that when you rushed downstairs,

394
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,990
you heard a noise around Maifu hospital at noon.

395
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,940
At that time,

396
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,370
Old Cai and I heard the alarm too.

397
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,290
Looks like only Old Cai can prove your innocence.

398
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:32,030
Hence, what we need to do now is to find Old Cai.

399
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,840
Did you already know who took away Old Cai?

400
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,540
You also figured this out now?

401
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,760
Old Cai has no value on his own.

402
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,600
I suspect now that she is the killer.

403
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,990
That's what I think too.

404
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,960
That person is...

405
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,010
- Lu Man. <br>- Lu Man.

406
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,340
You are finally conscious.

407
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,910
You... who are you?

408
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,540
Why did you tie me up here?

409
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,650
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

410
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,730
If you know who I am,

411
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,000
do you think you will stay alive?

412
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,420
Okay, I won't ask

413
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,930
but why did you capture me and bring me here?

414
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,310
I brought you here because I wanted to find out where the Jiang family's secret formula is.

415
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,750
As long as you hand over the secret formula, not only will I guarantee your safety,

416
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,610
I can also guarantee that you will live comfortably for the rest of your life.

417
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,080
What secret formula?

418
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,030
I don't know anything about this. I don't have the secret formula.

419
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,700
You are playing dumb with me.

420
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,490
Let me tell you. If you don't hand over the secret formula,

421
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,120
you will die.

422
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,230
Miss. I'm begging you.

423
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,060
I really don't have the secret formula.

424
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,130
Fine.

425
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:24,080
Since I talked to him nicely and he doesn't want to talk,

426
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,660
let him try some of your torture then.

427
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,960
I'd like to see if he will still fool around after being hellishly whipped.

428
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,370
Beat him cruelly.

429
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,510
Miss. I'm begging you.

430
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,850
I'm begging you to let me go.

431
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,720
I really don't have the secret formula.

432
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,810
It's useless even if you beat me to death.

433
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,330
Beat him cruelly.

434
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,510
Beat him until he hands over the secret formula and then contact me.

435
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,970
Yes.

436
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,860
What are you thinking of?

437
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,710
I was thinking of using the secret formula in exchange for Old Cai.

438
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,290
Secret formula?

439
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,960
Are you referring to Jiang family's secret formula?

440
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,380
You are really willing to use it to exchange for Old Cai?

441
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,840
What I mean is to use the secret formula as bait,

442
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,520
to find out where Old Cai is.

443
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,030
But if you hand over the secret formula and Lu Man denies it, Old Cai will die in her hands.

444
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,400
- Come with me. <br>- Where are we going?

445
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,220
Let's find Zhou Shao Tian and think of a solution.

446
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,940
A bad person will know another bad person better.

447
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,680
This plan won't work. Lu Man, that wench,

448
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,370
has gone crazy over the secret formula.

449
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,170
In order to get it, she's capable of doing anything.

450
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:02,970
Let's think together about how we can make Lu Man admit that she is holding Old Cai.

451
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,420
Seek her out at the refuge at her brother's house.

452
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:16,070
Tell her that the secret formula is with Old Cai's wife.

453
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,850
This is not a bad idea.

454
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,530
If she deals with Madam Lin, Lu Man will be more assured.

455
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,080
Furthermore, if we say that the secret formula is with Madam Lin, it's more believable.

456
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,240
Whether Lu Man will believe this or not,

457
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,980
what happens next will depend on you.

458
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,500
No problem. Leave this to me.

459
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,580
- Young Master. <br>- Spread this.

460
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,770
Let everyone in Huzhou know that I'm looking for Old Cai's wife's whereabouts.

461
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,390
Yes.

462
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,890
By doing this, you are letting Lu Man believe that the secret formula is with Old Cai's wife.

463
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,490
So how? Did Old Cai hand over the secret formula?

464
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,640
He is still saying that he doesn't have the secret formula

465
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,340
but...

466
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,330
But what?

467
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:20,700
But Jiang Yu's men are also looking around frantically for Old Cai's wife. We heard about this.

468
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,010
It seems like Old Cai got his hands on the secret formula.

469
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:38,090
Looks like the secret formula is definitely with Old Cai.

470
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,730
Uncle Lai.

471
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:42,400
Find someone to watch Jiang Yu.

472
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,430
Also, continue to torture Old Cai.

473
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,090
I don't believe that

474
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:54,390
even if he dies, he won't hand over the secret formula.

475
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,020
Yes.

476
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,140
Still not talking?

477
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,580
I'm begging you.

478
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,000
I really don't have the secret formula.

479
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,020
I really don't have the secret formula.

480
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,440
Just kill me.

481
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,020
Stop torturing me.

482
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:24,000
Miss. This rascal has a tight mouth. He still won't hand over the secret formula.

483
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,240
You just said that it's better to be dead, right?

484
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,380
Let me tell you. You are still far away from death.

485
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,450
Even if you want to die, it's not that easy.

486
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:42,710
I will capture your family and slowly torture them.

487
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:46,780
Thus. before you die, you should think of them first.

488
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,410
No.

489
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,910
Miss. I already sent men to find his family.

490
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,060
Finding them is not such a difficult task.

491
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,140
Don't.

492
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,240
I'm begging you. Let my family go.

493
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,320
They really know nothing. I really don't have the secret formula.

494
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,080
If you are worried about your family, hand over the secret formula now.

495
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,530
Don't waste your time with him. Break his limbs.

496
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,440
- See whether he will talk or not. <br>- Don't!

497
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,080
I'm begging you. I really don't have the secret formula.

498
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,980
I'm begging you to let me go.

499
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,930
Throw water on him to revive him and question him again.

500
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,590
If he still doesn't talk, cut off his limbs.

501
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:36,040
I want to see how high his tolerance level is.

502
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,270
Who's there?

503
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,010
It's me.

504
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,470
Jiang Yu?

505
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,340
Is it convenient to talk?

506
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,140
Come in.

507
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,990
Jiang Yu. It's late in the night. Why are you looking for me?

508
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:11,000
Zhou Shao Tian wanted me to look for you to do him a favour.

509
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,370
My brother will be sentenced to death in two days.

510
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,300
Weren't you behind all this?

511
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,880
He didn't kill anyone.

512
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,990
I know. I don't need you to tell me this.

513
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:25,380
I looked for you today to prove his innocence.

514
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,520
He has already been sentenced to death. Could there be anything worse than this?

515
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,030
Why would I still need to harm him?

516
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,290
What do you want me to do?

517
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,650
The only one who can prove Zhou Shao Tian's innocence now

518
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,230
is Old Cai but he has been taken away by someone.

519
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,870
Zhou Shao Tian thought of a plan to find Old Cai

520
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,910
but he needs your help.

521
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,980
Okay, I will do it for my brother.

522
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,070
It's really very beautiful.

523
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,110
It's really very beautiful.

524
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,520
It's already so late. Why are you still dyeing the textile?

525
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,190
Come here.

526
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:58,230
Only if we have this textile, Lu Man would then believe that

527
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,980
the real secret formula is with Old Cai's wife.

528
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,670
Brother Shao Tian went against you in the past.

529
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:10,290
Even while in locked up,

530
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,960
he shied not from lynching you.

531
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,690
Thank you

532
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,990
for helping him this way.

533
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:22,100
I'm not helping him.

534
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,060
Isn't it the same for you?

535
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:33,100
You clearly know that Zhou Shao Tian stole Ling Long's money and caused it to go bankrupt.

536
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,020
But ultimately, you are still willing to believe him.

537
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,990
All of this happened because of my father's greed.

538
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,420
It was my father who had wronged the Jiang family.

539
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:55,130
Furthermore, he even harmed Brother Shao Tian's family.

540
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:01,150
The mistakes keep repeating.

541
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,470
The night of the incident,

542
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:08,260
Brother Shao Tian told me that

543
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,750
if he could start anew,

544
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,020
he doesn't know

545
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,890
if he should go back to the way it was or start anew.

546
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:27,050
I think I finally understand now

547
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,610
how helpless he was

548
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,070
and what kind of torment he has suffered everyday.

549
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,070
Blame my father for this.

550
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:46,990
He personally planted a poisonous seed.

551
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:52,530
That's why it grew into a poisonous flower.

552
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,860
And prickly fruit.

553
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,040
Due to the previous generation's race to power,

554
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,970
next generation has to bear the consequences.

555
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,250
Your father may have been wrong

556
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,020
but he had such a good daughter like you.

557
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,380
Your appearance

558
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:23,070
was the greatest gift of god given to him.

559
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:26,770
I'm not that good as you think I am.
