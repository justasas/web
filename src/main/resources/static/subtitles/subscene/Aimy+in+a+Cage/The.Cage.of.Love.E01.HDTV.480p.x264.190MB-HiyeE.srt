The Cage of Love

00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,380
<i>Episode 1</i>

3
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,900
Madam.
Yu has grown so big.

4
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,730
Congratulations!

5
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,660
Thank you. Thank you.

6
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,330
Wishing our Brother Jiang (Jiang Yu's dad)
good fortune and longevity.

7
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,400
-Thank you.
-Wishing the Ling Long Dye Factory a thriving

8
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,770
and prosperous business.
- Thank you.

9
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,990
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

10
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,820
-Congratulations, Young Master
-Mr. Ma Ke (Mark),

11
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,470
Mr. Wei Lian (William), please go inside.

12
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,250
Okay.

13
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,900
Big Brother. Why are all of their names so strange?

14
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,290
Dad says China will need to open its doors to do business in the future.

15
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,380
Everyone will need to collaborate with foreigners
so that's why they changed their names to something foreign.

16
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,260
It will make it easier to do business with foreigners in the future.
Do you understand?

17
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,530
Your big brother knows so much.

18
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,570
Yu Er, all of the guests are almost here.
Why has your dad not returned yet?

19
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,880
The workers developed a new dye.
Dad has been at the dyehouse for the past few days,

20
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,170
waiting for the dye to come out of the vat.
He doesn't have time to care about celebrating his birthday.

21
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,410
Mom, don't worry.
I'll go look for him right now.

22
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,980
Okay. Okay. Okay. Go quickly and hurry back.

23
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,690
Master, look!
Success! It's all a success!

24
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,650
Rich in colour and soft to the touch.
Looks like this dye is really good.

25
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,870
-Agreed.
-We're successful.

26
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,970
Everyone, you've all worked hard.

27
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,410
<i>Master, you've worked hard.</i>

28
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,730
Mrs. Zhou

29
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,310
Master.

30
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,550
How is the head of your family (husband)?

31
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,220
Thank you Master for your concern.
The doctor said that he has a chronic disease.

32
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,320
He has to be healed slowly.

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,050
Right. Right. Has to be treated slowly and slowly cured.

34
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,450
If you need money urgently, remember to tell me.

35
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,950
We can give you an advance on your wages.

36
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,720
-Thank you, Master.
-Master! Master!

37
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,000
Master! Master!

38
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,430
Master, shouldn't we be heading back?

39
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,370
It's your birthday today.
They'll be starting the banquet soon.

40
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,530
Oh. Right. Right. Right.

41
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,710
Then I'll leave the rest to you guys.
Tonight, give everyone additional portions of dinner.

42
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,930
<i>Congrats, Master.</i>

43
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,010
<i>-Get up!
-Congrats, Master.</i>

44
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,990
Excuse me, Officer. May I ask, what are you doing?

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:11,440
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

46
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,970
Chief Wu, you honour us with your presence.

47
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,030
This is...

48
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,720
I received a secret report.

49
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,910
It said that Ling Long Dye Factory was selling dog meat as mutton.
(to assume a false identity to conceal one's true purpose)

50
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,570
On the surface, it looks like a dye business.

51
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,900
But privately, it is dealing opium.

52
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,750
-Search this place!
-Wait!

53
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,680
-Chief Wu.
-Let's not let personal interests interfere with public duties.

54
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,620
-Search!
-Yes, Sir!

55
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,970
<i>-Go there. Quick.
-Follow me.
-Yes.</i>

56
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,960
<i>This way.</i>

57
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,600
<i>Search carefully. Quick. </i>

58
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,630
<i>Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
Search carefully.</i>

59
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:39,160
Chief Wu. For generations while in Huzhou,
Ling Long has always been a legitimate business.

60
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,350
This is a well-known fact.

61
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,760
<i>You two go to that side!</i>

62
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,730
<i>Sir.</i>

63
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,650
Sir.

64
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,000
The quality is superior.

65
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,750
Let's talk.

66
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,010
Chief Wu, I repeat, I'm innocent.

67
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,640
This must be someone's plan to frame me.

68
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,170
Please, Chief Wu. I implore you to distinguish right and wrong.

69
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,390
-Help me seek justice.
-In this world, in fact, there's no justice.

70
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,040
If you want justice, it's really simple.

71
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,990
I'll let you use your Jiang family's most important item in exchange (for it).

72
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,980
Alright.

73
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,990
In this room, what do you fancy?

74
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,030
Take your pick.

75
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,960
I want your Jiang family's secret formula for dyeing.

76
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,970
Wu Hong Da,

77
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,950
as a dignified Chief,

78
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,980
you came here to Ling Long to put on such a show.

79
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,970
Just for this?

80
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,670
If you're willing to give me the secret formula,

81
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,470
I can save you from prison.

82
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,780
But if you refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit,
(refuse to do something, but in the end, was forced to do it)

83
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,210
I will make you lose both honour and fortune, confiscate your property, and execute your family.

84
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,890
This trafficking opium issue, if I say it's big, it's big.

85
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,080
If I say it's small, it'll be small.

86
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,030
You're a smart man.
You should know which to choose.

87
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,110
Dream on!

88
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,450
<i>-Get out! Get out!
-My things are still inside.</i>

89
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,290
Let me through. Let me through.

90
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,230
Let me through.
Aunt, what's going on? Where's my dad?

91
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,990
He's still inside.

92
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,750
<i>Let me in.</i>

93
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,550
Dad!

94
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,350
Dad!

95
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,360
Dad! Wake up, Dad!

96
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,390
Dad!

97
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,450
Dad!

98
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,480
Dad, wake up!

99
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,590
Dad!

100
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,830
Opium

101
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,700
is a very strong drug.

102
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,430
It brings people to bad thoughts and evil deeds.

103
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:17,030
Smoking opium turns a most benevolent person into a monster.

104
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:21,570
Because Jiang Wen Yuan was using his company to smuggle opium,

105
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,980
he must be severely punished.

106
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,810
According to the law, he must be executed.

107
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,190
Jiang Wen Yuan, fearing punishment for his crimes, committed suicide.

108
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,730
Therefore, the Ling Long Dye Factory
and the Jiang family's fortune must all be forfeited.

109
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,650
The dye factory will be closed immediately.
All workers will be dismissed at once.

110
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,490
<i>Quick. Let's go. Let's go.</i>

111
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,890
<i>-Remove everything.
-Yes, sir! Removing them.</i>

112
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,650
<i>-Hurry up. Hurry up.
-What are you doing? Stop!</i>

113
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,100
Stop!

114
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,440
You can't do this.

115
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,450
-Get out!
-Yu!
-Get out! Get out!

116
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,560
Mom! Mom!

117
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,420
<i>-Old Master (Husband).
-Let go of us!</i>

118
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,030
<i>I can't leave!</i>

119
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,950
Get out! Get out!

120
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,830
-Get out.
-Mom!

121
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,860
Old Master! Old Master!

122
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,570
Mom!

123
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,860
This is my house. What right do you have to chase us out?

124
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,010
This is Jiang's household!

125
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:25,030
Jiang Wen Yuan committed a deadly sin, causing us to lose our Jiang's reputation

126
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,540
Now the Clan Leader is driving you out of the family tree!

127
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,590
You have no right to live here anymore.

128
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,950
-That's right. Go. Get out.
-My dad was framed.

129
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,790
I beg every Uncle to speak justice for us.

130
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,030
<i>Get out. Go.</i>

131
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,810
<i>-Why waste your breath on them? </i>
-Mom!
-Go!

132
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,400
<i>Go away. Nothing to see here.</i>

133
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,330
<i>They broke the clan rules.</i>

134
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,090
Dad, hang on for a few more days.

135
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:07,190
Once Mom gets this month's pay, she'll be able to buy your medicine.

136
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,480
Once you take the medicine, you'll slowly get better.

137
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,930
Dad. Are you alright, Dad?
Dad, hang on.

138
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,960
Just hang on, Dad.

139
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,000
Mom!
Mom, Dad's medicine has run out.

140
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,830
There's no medicine.

141
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,580
There's no wages.

142
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,180
Ling Long's gone too.

143
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,060
What?

144
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,050
Dad.

145
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,770
Dad. Endure it.

146
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,410
Mom, I'm going out to earn some money.

147
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,370
Shao Tian!

148
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,570
-Mom.
-Fei Fei.

149
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,450
You these black-hearted people. My only son, due to inhaling the smoke,

150
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,540
became someone that is not like a human or a ghost!

151
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,590
- You-
-Yu

152
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,000
What's wrong, Yu?

153
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,030
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

154
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,160
I'll bring you to see a doctor. Otherwise, it'll leave a scar.

155
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,130
No need, Mom. I'm fine.

156
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,510
This scar, is a scar caused by Wu Hong Da destroying our family.

157
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:11,040
Let it be.
It'll be a reminder for me of how Dad died.

158
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,910
Mom, I'm fine.

159
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,610
Let's go.

160
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,590
Let's go.

161
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,710
Young Master Ma! Young Master Ma!

162
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,970
-Young Master Ma.
-I told you I don't have any money to lend you, Zhou Shao Tian.

163
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,950
Everybody knows your family is poor.
Moreover, you have a sickly father.

164
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,680
Lending you money would be like hitting a dog with a meat bun, never to return.

165
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,390
Young Master Ma, I'll just borrow one silver dollar

166
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,060
to buy medicine for my dad.
I'll definitely think of a way to pay it back.

167
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,560
Young Master Ma, I'm begging you.
I just need one silver dollar.

168
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,440
Money... I do have it.

169
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,830
However, only if you are willing to crawl between my legs

170
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,970
and bark like a dog. If you please me,
then I'll lend you the money.

171
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,070
You...

172
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,980
<i>Crawl! Crawl! Hurry up!</i>

173
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,950
<i>Crawl! Crawl! Hurry up and crawl!</i>

174
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,580
<i>Crawl! Crawl!
He's crawling. Good.</i>

175
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,160
<i>Crawl! Hurry up!</i>

176
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,930
<i>Hurry up! What're you doing? Quick!</i>

177
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,500
<i>Hurry up and crawl. Go faster.</i>

178
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,130
<i>Good. That was good.</i>

179
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,410
<i>-This is so fun.
-Alright. Bark like a dog. Bark like a dog.</i>

180
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,970
<i>Bark like a dog.</i>

181
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,940
<i>Good. That was good.</i>

182
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,550
-This is too much fun.
-Come here and see. There's actually someone who, for a silver dollar,

183
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,990
is willing to be a dog.

184
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,880
Young Master Ma, my money.

185
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,450
If you want money, there's none.
But I can reward you with something else.

186
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,470
Come. Give this fall-in-water-dog a good thrashing.
(someone who is down on their luck)

187
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,630
Take this, fall-in-water-dog.
Hit him. Harder.

188
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,550
Hit him. Harder.

189
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,190
We'll beat you up, fall-in-water-dog.

190
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,160
Young Master Ma.
Young Master Ma, I just need one silver dollar

191
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,990
to buy medicine for my dad.
Just one silver dollar can save my dad's life.

192
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,690
I just need one silver dollar.
I'll definitely pay it back, Young Master Ma.

193
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,190
Let's go.

194
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,270
Young Master Ma. Young Master Ma.
Please lend me one silver dollar.

195
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,730
I wish to save my dad's life.

196
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,730
Screw you.

197
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,090
I'm begging you, Young Master Ma.

198
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,430
Please give me one silver dollar.

199
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,930
I wish to save my dad's life.

200
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:45,390
I'm begging you. I just need one silver dollar.

201
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,940
One silver dollar will be able to save my dad's life.

202
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,960
Here, for you.

203
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:17,710
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

204
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,430
Endure it. Just endure it a little longer.

205
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,840
Just hang on for a bit.
Shao Tian went out to get your medicine.

206
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,730
He'll be back in a bit.

207
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,270
I'm... I'm sorry.

208
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,890
All these years, to cure this sickness,

209
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,400
not only did we spend all our money,

210
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,010
we also owe a debt.

211
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,690
I beg you to help me do something.

212
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,990
Give me relief.

213
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,930
Let me go.

214
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,970
What are you saying?

215
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,230
Instead of a living dead,

216
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,130
it would be better to have an earlier release.

217
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,120
No, you can't!

218
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,090
Dad.

219
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:10,570
Not like a person yet not like a ghost, living like this,

220
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,970
I'm really suffering.

221
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,990
Help me find relief. I'm begging you.

222
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,800
Mom!

223
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,870
<i>They dared to move here. I say...</i>

224
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,780
<i>Quickly go away.</i>

225
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,710
<i>Go away! Go away!</i>

226
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,250
Get lost!
If you dare talk nonsense again,

227
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,140
I won't hold back.

228
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,010
Go away! Scram!

229
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,950
Mom!

230
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,930
By the grace of Heaven

231
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,990
and His Majesty, the Emperor

232
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,070
Huzhou Supervisor Wu Hong Da

233
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:52,090
has positively solved the case of the opium smugglers.

234
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:58,440
In regard to his outstanding dilligent compliance

235
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,500
and his extraordinary productivity,

236
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,000
he is being elevated to the court official of the 6th rank

237
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,270
and given the reward of five hundred and twenty silvers.

238
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,010
Admire heaven's will ( hear hear).

239
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,970
<i>Great.</i>

240
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:21,740
<i>Twelve Years Later </i>

241
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,270
Cai Hong, if anything catches your eye, just buy it.

242
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,630
In the afternoon, I'll have Shao Tian pick you up.

243
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,500
Dad, I'm not a kid anymore.
Why do you always ask people to follow me?

244
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,530
Okay. Okay. Anything you say.
Once you're home, give me a call.

245
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,070
I got it.

246
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,380
-Go.
-Dad, take care.

247
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,190
To Ling Long.

248
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,160
Let's go.

249
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:09,010
Wu Long, what should we get for Dad's birthday?

250
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,910
<i>-Hello, Boss.
-Hello, Boss.</i>

251
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,500
Slow down.

252
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,620
<i>-Please.
-Hello, Boss.</i>

253
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,750
Sir, you've got a great eye.
This Parker Pen

254
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,230
is the only one in Huzhou. Even Shanghai doesn't have one.

255
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,950
Look at this pen tip. It is made with special materials.

256
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,770
The tip is sharp and silky smooth, with gilding on the outside.

257
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,320
If you use it with the Lei De ink, it will write smoothly and legibly.

258
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,380
It's not only just functional, it will also show your status.

259
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,440
This fountain pen is perfect for father's birthday present.

260
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,150
I don't want anything else. I want this fountain pen.

261
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,930
But this gentleman saw it first.

262
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,120
Sir. Could you let me have this pen

263
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,060
because it's very important to me?

264
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,970
If you are willing, I can pay you double.

265
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,940
Here.

266
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:13,050
You are too generous. We only just met and you are giving me such an expensive gift.

267
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,230
Thank you. I will treat you to a meal on another day.

268
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,600
What do you like to eat? I can treat you to anything.

269
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,820
Where should I find you? Where do you live? What is your name?

270
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,320
I paid for this pen.

271
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,830
If you dare to take this pen and step out from the shop,

272
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,070
I can immediately sue you for theft.

273
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,140
Thanks.

274
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,510
Sir, take care.

275
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,480
Wait!

276
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,160
Come back. What is your name?

277
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,310
Are you going to offer again to buy my name?

278
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,620
But it's a pity that you can't just buy my name.

279
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,860
I have never seen such a rude, stingly and mannerless man like you!

280
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,430
I also have never seen such a willful and unreasonable lady like you.

281
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:12,260
And you are a blockhead!

282
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,600
You are smelly and stubborn. Do you believe that I can do anything

283
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,240
to find out your name.

284
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,440
I don't believe you.

285
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,560
Let's make a bet then.
If I don't spend a single cent to find out your name, the pen is mine.

286
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,920
Let's talk again when you find me.

287
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:39,050
Just you wait. I will definitely be able to find you.

288
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,960
I'm so furious.

289
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,960
-Rotten Stone Head, you finally found your conscience?
-What's wrong?

290
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,390
-Brother Shao Tian
-Rotten Stone Head?

291
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,980
It's that guy who fought with me over the pen.

292
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,970
Get up and talk.

293
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,690
Brother Shao Tian. How did you know I'm here?

294
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,520
Because we are able to read each other's mind.

295
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,560
Brother Shao Tian, did you know? I was really unlucky just now.

296
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:23,030
I actually saw a unique and beautiful Parker pen.

297
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:27,950
But I just had to meet a person who had to fight with me for that pen.
He didn't have any generosity.

298
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,430
This matter is easy to deal with. Leave it to me, I will send

299
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,830
exactly the same Parker pen on your father's birthday.

300
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,200
No need. That pen is very expensive.

301
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,030
It will cost half of your annual salary.

302
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:51,220
I didn't mean that, Brother Shao Tian. Please don't blame me.

303
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,930
As long as it is something you like, I will definitely fulfill your wish.

304
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,970
Leave this to me.

305
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,500
<i>Good morning, Boss.</i>

306
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
<i>Good morning, Boss.</i>

307
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,730
<i>Morning, Boss.</i>

308
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,010
Morning, Boss Jiang.

309
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,070
Morning.

310
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,210
Miss. This is what you asked for.

311
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,960
I know. You can leave first.

312
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,130
-Fei Fei
-Brother, you came at the right time.

313
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,150
Look at this.

314
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,460
This is from Ling Long.

315
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,620
Our worker used the newest material to create this.

316
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,030
Using dyes from France to dye the materials,

317
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,850
it has such vibrant colours and is soft to the touch,

318
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:55,030
and there is no traditional smell that hurts the nose.

319
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,620
All our workers started work today.

320
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,930
The five tons of French dyes that we ordered have already arrived at the Shanghai dock.

321
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,750
That time, all the workers would put in their best to work.

322
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,510
That way, our production will surpass Ling Long,

323
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,220
to become the greatest Dyeing Factory in Jiang Hu.
-Great.

324
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,770
This is Ling Long's list of customers.

325
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,610
All our fabrics would be sold at a lower price than Ling Long.

326
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,950
Steal all their customers away to our shop.

327
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,020
Brother, everything is prepared.

328
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,630
Everything Wu Hong Da stole from us in the past,

329
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,970
we will get it back.

330
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:55,520
Wu Hong Da, it already has been 12 years.

331
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,050
I'm back.

332
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,750
- Boss.
- Shao Tian, come and sit here.

333
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,170
So how?

334
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,970
Did you profess your love for Cai Hong yet?

335
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:23,290
Shao Tian is useless. I have yet to find an appropriate time.

336
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,990
You are capable in business but when it comes to women, you are not.

337
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,960
Put in more effort. You have my support.

338
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,040
This is the new generation now.

339
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,450
Cai Hong must agree.

340
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,080
Here, have your tea.

341
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:45,410
Boss thinks too highly of me. I am not worth it.

342
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,930
Thinks too highly of you? I understand you.

343
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:53,910
You were born of a poor family but I happen to think of it as your good point.

344
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,990
That way, you are able to withstand hardship and work honestly.

345
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:03,000
You are also meticulous. I won't get the wrong guy. Drink tea.

346
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:18,330
Thank you for your trust. I would definitely take good care of Cai Hong.

347
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,950
I will give you another chance then.

348
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,370
Come for dinner tonight at my home.

349
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,570
Thank you, Boss.

350
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:41,030
Shao Tian, your acting is not bad.

351
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:45,640
Put in more effort.
You will be on the way to become the son-in-law of the Wu Household.

352
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,710
Dad, mom. Please have tea.

353
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:05,040
Cai Hong. How old are you this year?

354
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,050
Dad. Don't you know that

355
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:12,470
to ask a Lady's age in the West is considered rude?

356
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,970
Don't you know your father? He's doing this on purpose.
How could he not know your age?

357
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,000
Cai Hong. It is that I have seen ladies of your age

358
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,370
already get married, so...

359
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:26,770
So, you think that I'm unable to get married, right?

360
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,370
Don't tell me that all the good men in Huzhou are already married.

361
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:35,670
Not all the good men are already married.
I have found one for you.

362
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,940
I think he wouldn't dare to escape.

363
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:45,540
I think I can still stay

364
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,960
with you for a few more years. I don't want to marry anyone.

365
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,350
Lord, see how sensible Cai Hong is.

366
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,310
- What do you know?
- You should learn more.

367
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,940
Mom. Why did you hit me?

368
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:03,380
For Cai Hong to have a good spouse is the best way to be filial to me.

369
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,470
Okay, I know that you hate me. You don't want me to stay with you.

370
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,670
I'm going to find Wu Long who doesn't hate me.

371
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,390
Look at her. She is blushing.

372
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,030
Shao Tian.

373
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,260
Go.

374
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,050
Okay.

375
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:38,960
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

376
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:54,130
See how Wu Long is able to understand us,

377
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,290
he left such a big courtyard to ourselves.

378
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:00,030
Do you know that you didn't scare Wu Long away?

379
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,720
Why are you looking at me?

380
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,930
You are pretty.

381
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,790
Cai Hong. We have known each other for a long time.

382
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,910
I would like to ask you a question.

383
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,960
What is my place in your heart?

384
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,970
You are fine.

385
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:31,910
I regard you as my older brother.

386
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,250
Older brother?

387
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,890
But I don't want to be your older brother.

388
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,610
Every day, I would like

389
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:45,990
to eat and chat with you.

390
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,310
- That would be great.
- It's not that difficult to do this.

391
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:54,980
You can visit me often. We can have meals and chat together.

392
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,960
- I'm saying, the both of us...
- You are even eavesdropping?

393
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,670
Dad.

394
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,220
This wench. I caught her eavesdropping.

395
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,610
Don't let her disturb you. Continue with where you were going.

396
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:11,070
Hateful.

397
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,010
Cai Hong.

398
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,510
Shao Tian.

399
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,130
I will help you find the opportunity next time.

400
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,390
There is a big difference between an older brother and a husband.

401
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:34,000
That year, Cai Hong's mother also said that I was her older brother.

402
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,670
You still said I eavesdropped. What about you?

403
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,950
Why are you not going back?

404
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,020
Shao Tian.

405
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,590
Work hard.

406
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,990
I already prepared the hot water for your bath.

407
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,960
I don't need it.
Just continue to recite your scriptures.

408
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,560
Everyday abstaining from eating meat and chanting prayers not because you are afraid my dad won't ascend to heaven.

409
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,570
It's because you're afraid you'll receive retribution.

410
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,400
<i>We, Mei Fu, wants to order a hundred fabrics!</i>

411
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,990
<i>-Don't squeeze!
-Boss.</i>

412
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,450
- Hello.
- Brother.

413
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,480
Fei Fei. What's wrong?

414
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,910
Bad news. She has gone missing from the hospital.

415
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,970
Don't panic. I will be there soon.

416
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,650
Sorry.

417
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,590
Fei Fei, where is mom?

418
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:38,930
Brother. Mom is missing. I went out to buy some snacks and she went missing.

419
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:43,470
Brother, do you think anything would happen to mom?
Could it be that she is trying to commit suicide again?

420
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,990
- Brother...
- Don't let your imagination run wild. Mom will be fine.

421
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,900
Don't cry first. Let's split up and find her.

422
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,010
Okay.

423
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,410
<i>Thank you.</i>

424
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,370
Stinky Rock, I don't believe that I cannot find you.

425
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,070
Mom.

426
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,120
- May I ask if you have seen this person?
- No.

427
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,050
Thanks.

428
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,520
Have you seen anywho who looks like him?

429
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,950
No.

430
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,100
Hello.

431
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,410
Aunt. May I ask if you have seen him?

432
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,890
This person?

433
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,990
- I saw him.
You saw him?

434
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,390
Who is he and what is his name?

435
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,770
Do you think he's good looking?

436
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,590
What has being good looking got to do with this?

437
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,030
If he's not handsome, why are you looking for him then?

438
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,620
I...

439
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:02,170
<i>I can only follow her wishes to let her tell me his name.</i>

440
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,440
Yes, I find him very good looking.

441
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,040
You see, he has a strikingly handsome face.

442
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,660
He has a Grecian nose, strong brows and is bright-eyed, with an uncommon demeanor.

443
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,800
No matter how you look at him, he is smoothing to look at, a handsome man.

444
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,930
Do you like him?

445
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,500
Aunt, I'm a girl.

446
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,950
How could I tell you?

447
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,090
Why don't you tell me his name?

448
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:35,020
Why don't you ask him yourself?

449
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,960
I'm so embarrassed.

450
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,290
How did you get here?

451
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:51,440
Of course, I have my own ways.

452
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,240
Give me the fountain pen.

453
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,550
Yes, you found me

454
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,900
but what is my name?

455
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,010
Mom, let's go.

456
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,250
This girl is looking for you.

457
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,850
I know.

458
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,890
