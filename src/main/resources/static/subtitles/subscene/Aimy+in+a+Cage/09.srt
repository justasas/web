<i>Episode 9 </i>

20
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,600
Help me to put it on.

21
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,400
You agree?

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,900
Wu Cai Hong!

23
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
By the way, Brother Shao Tian,

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,200
I just remembered that Cai Yue wanted me to help her with her homework. I'll leave first.

25
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,800
- I will take you there. <br>- No need.

26
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,900
Cai Hong has decided to leave Ling Long

27
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,000
for Fu Sheng. In the future, don't look for her anymore.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,700
It seems like I didn't allow her to leave Ling Long.

29
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,800
It's not important whether you did or not.

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,400
What's important is that she has already decided.

31
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,000
Furthermore, she is my girlfriend now.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
She is only just a girlfriend?

33
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,600
So what?

34
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
We will get married soon

35
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,200
and manage Fu Sheng together.

36
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,000
What are you afraid of?

37
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
What else can you do?

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,800
Make a guess.

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,000
No matter what you do,

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,300
Cai Hong is mine.

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,600
Wu Long.

42
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,900
Wu Long.

43
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,000
Wu Long.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Wu Long. Where are you? Come out now.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,400
Wu Long. Be good. Where are you?

46
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,500
Listen to me carefully.

47
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,200
If you don't find the cat,

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,000
no one is allowed to sleep.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,100
Go and look now.

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,600
Wu Long.

51
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
Wu Long, be good.

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,600
I found the cat.

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,800
Young Master, I found Wu Long.

54
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,350
Look.

55
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Let's see where you run to.

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,500
Aunt.

57
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,000
Are you angry?

58
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,100
I told you to get my reading glasses.

59
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,800
I never thought I wouldn't see you again.

60
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
It's clear that

61
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
you didn't place me in your heart.

62
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,700
Looks like someone is really angry.

63
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,600
I will only be able to enjoy this alone then.

64
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,200
I went to Luo Tuo Bridge to buy Rose Candy early in the morning.

65
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,700
It wasn't easy to get this.

66
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,800
It smells so good.

67
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,400
Looking at it makes me salivate.

68
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,700
It must be really sweet and delicious.

69
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,000
It's sweet and soft.

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I think I can finish this entire box.

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,800
No, I must have one now.

72
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,400
If you finish eating everything, what is left for me?

73
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,000
Look.

74
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,780
Wench.

75
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,300
Come, Aunt. Let's eat this together. Okay?

76
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,400
Here. Does it taste good?

77
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Just eat it, Aunt.

78
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,000
That's right, Aunt. You look much better when you smile.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,400
You must smile more. Your mood will improve.

80
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Cai Hong.

81
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,200
Stay with me and talk more.

82
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,600
Look. When no one is with me,

83
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,200
it's so boring.

84
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,800
I know and I want to

85
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,800
but in the future, I will be helping my boyfriend at his factory.

86
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,200
It's not easy for him to run his business.

87
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,470
I would like to do my best to help him.

88
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Cai Hong. You must remember to visit me.

89
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Of course.

90
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Wait until my boyfriend's business is stable, I will visit you often.

91
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,800
You must keep your word.

92
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,300
If you don't believe me, we can cross our fingers.

93
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,200
You really treat me like a kid.

94
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,600
Do you dare to say that you are not?

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,200
I wonder whose son is so lucky

96
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,000
who will marry such a good wife like you.

97
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm not married yet.

98
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,100
You always joke with me.

99
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,100
It's getting late. I should be going home soon.

100
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,200
Aunt. Remember to go out more

101
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,600
and take in more fresh air. It's good for your health.

102
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,200
I know. Leave now.

103
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
I will take good care of myself.

104
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,800
With your concerns, I'm already very happy and satisfied.

105
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Go now.

106
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,900
Take good care of yourself.

107
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm leaving.

108
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,100
Wu Cai Hong.

109
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,000
I won't accept your resignation.

110
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,100
Come back to work immediately.

111
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,300
What are you doing?

112
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

113
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,000
Make the arrangements for me.

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,600
I will no longer accept your insults and let you torment me.

115
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,700
You better find someone else.

116
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,800
I will change my attitude.

117
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,000
I know now.

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
You want me to stay at Ling Long

119
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,200
because it is a past time of yours (to torment).

120
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
If this is the case,

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,900
why don't I go to Fu Sheng to do real work

122
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,800
and investigate my father's case.

123
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,400
Why do you think that I killed your father?

124
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,200
Don't worry.

125
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,190
If you really killed my father,

126
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,590
I won't let you off.

127
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,800
Don't you find this strange?

128
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,300
The audit of the five warehouses inside

129
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,600
the ledger was burnt by someone.

130
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,100
Old Cai disappeared and you went to talk to Old Cai's wife.

131
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,090
When you went to find his lover, she was murdered.

132
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,900
It's one coincidence after another.

133
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,400
Don't tell me the third time was also a coincidence?

134
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,400
What exactly is on your mind?

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Only those who are close to you

136
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
would know your movements.

137
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,000
The person is always one step ahead, destroying evidence.

138
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,800
Don't place too much trust on those near you.

139
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,400
Well said.

140
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,300
Ling Long's ledger, Old Cai's wife and lover, these are not coincidences.

141
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,740
Why would I believe what you said?

142
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,600
I will never trust you.

143
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:39,630
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

144
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,000
Sis. Since you came back today, you have been unhappy.

145
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Are you not used to being with Brother Shao Tian?

146
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,600
No.

147
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,400
Since you are here, sit down for a while.

148
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Cai Yun. Frankly, I know that

149
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,800
ever since Dad passed away, you and stepmom have suffered.

150
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Who says so? The one who suffered the most was you.

151
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,500
Blame me...

152
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,400
for not having understudied Dad in the past.

153
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,700
If not, it wouldn't have been so easy for Ling Long to fall into other's hands.

154
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,800
Don't place all the burdens on your shoulders.

155
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,600
Arent you getting better now?

156
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,000
Brother Shao Tian also said that you are good with business now.

157
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,670
Our family will definitely get better.

158
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,200
Yes.

159
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,900
Our family will definitely get better.

160
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,200
Sis.

161
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,500
You have really accepted to be Brother Shao Tian's girlfriend?

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
In the past, when Dad wanted you to marry Brother Shao Tian,

163
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,600
you said that you wanted to regard him as just a brother.

164
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,900
Do you love him now?

165
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,500
When did you start to understand love?

166
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,000
Now there may only be females in my class, but we read Xu's poems.

167
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,700
Of course, I understand.

168
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Sister, your love for Brother Shao Tianis just like poetry.

169
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,470
In my mind now,

170
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,990
what if the poetry from Xu's poems are wrong.

171
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,300
I only want to think simply. Brother Shao Tian is very good to me.

172
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,800
I would like to be good to him too.

173
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,900
I want to find the killer of Dad as soon as possible now

174
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,000
and then learn all about business

175
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,100
so that you and aunt will live well.

176
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,500
But after such a long time,

177
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,800
will you still be able to find the killer?

178
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,800
As long as I don't give up, there is hope.

179
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,800
Brother.

180
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,700
Brother.

181
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,400
I overheard your conversation with Cai Hong today at the hospital.

182
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,700
You are still worried about her?

183
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,300
- No wonder, the way you treat her... <br>-I am not.

184
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
I want to advise you.

185
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't forget that Dad died a terrible death.

186
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
- Don't forget that the Wu family brought us pain... <br>- I don't need you to remind me every day on how Dad died.

187
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,100
Why are you still not drawing the line between Wu Cai Hong then?

188
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,700
I already said that

189
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,400
I want to investigate who embezzled Ling Long's money.

190
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,100
I think you are worried about Wu Cai Hong instead.

191
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,000
You want to help her to find out the truth.

192
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,500
What I want to find out is who is the killer next to Wu Cai Hong.

193
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,200
Think about it.

194
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,200
If the most trusted and closest person to Wu Cai Hong

195
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,800
is the killer of her father,

196
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,000
to her, this will be

197
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
a great irony and conflict.

198
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
This would be like God giving the Wu family

199
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
an even worse penalty.

200
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,900
Her closest and most trusted person?

201
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,800
Could it be Wu Cai Hong's sister?

202
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,600
Mrs Wu is not Wu Cai Hong's biological mother.

203
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,400
If Wu Hong Da were to leave the family assets to the eldest daughter,

204
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,000
she would have motive to do it.

205
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,900
It's also not Mrs Wu.

206
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,900
The closest person to Wu Cai Hong?

207
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,400
Could it be Zhou Shao Tian?

208
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,000
Without any confirmed evidence,

209
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,800
it is too hard to judge.

210
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,000
Brother.

211
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,800
Are you serious about this?

212
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,000
Everything that you are doing is to make Wu Cai Hong suffer?

213
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,800
If you are feeling bored,

214
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,500
please spend more time with Mom. Okay?

215
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,400
<i>Come and take a look. The buns are hot.</i>

216
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,200
<i>The vegetables are fresh.</i>

217
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,600
Let me tell you. The imported products from this shop are really great.

218
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,000
Once you see them, you won't want to leave.

219
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,600
I'm not going. I don't use make-up.

220
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,700
What's wrong? Didn't you use to like this in the past?

221
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,800
My family now...

222
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,800
you should know that my sister is having a hard time making money.

223
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
I don't need this anymore.

224
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,300
Cai Yun. We haven't gone shopping for a long time.

225
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,200
Just go with me.

226
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,490
Ah Xue.

227
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,700
It's not that I don't want to go with you. But...

228
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,600
I understand. Let's just go in and browse.

229
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,200
We are only just browsing. We don't need to buy anything.

230
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,400
Okay?

231
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,500
Let's go.

232
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,600
Sister Fei Fei. What do you think of this colour?

233
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,800
- It's pretty. <br>- Let me take a look.

234
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
It's pretty. This is the one.

235
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,600
But it's too expensive.

236
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,200
Let me think about it.

237
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,900
It's a bit expensive.

238
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,200
It's okay. If you like it, I will pay for it. I will get one for each for us. What do you think?

239
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,600
Really? Sister Fei Fei is not like the rest.

240
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,500
No. It's Mrs Jiang who is not like the rest.

241
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,200
Mrs Jiang. These two words have such a nice ring to them.

242
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Don't talk nonsense. If Brother hears this, we will be in trouble.

243
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,000
Who says we are talking nonsense? You and Boss Jiang...

244
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,800
No, you and your brother are in fact friends since childhood.

245
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,600
The position of Mrs Jiang is definitely yours.

246
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,800
That's right. It's no difference if we call her this.

247
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,000
She will be called this in the future. What's the difference?

248
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,800
- Mrs Jiang. <br>- Enough.

249
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,000
Mrs Jiang. Our blessed life in the future will depend on you.

250
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,800
In the future, we have to stick close to Madam Jiang.

251
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,300
She will be constantly happy with her joyous welfare.

252
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,300
- Mrs Jiang... <br>- Shouldn't we look around the shop? I heard the new lipsticks were delivered.

253
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,200
Didn't you always want to go see it?

254
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Really? Just take a look. It's okay if we don't buy any.

255
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,900
Okay.

256
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,600
Miss, which do you like?

257
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,300
<i>We didn't expect you to.</i>

258
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,000
This colour is really pretty!

259
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,400
We are buddies. Why are you saying this?

260
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,100
Isn't that the second daughter of the Wu family?

261
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,700
Her sister was your brother's ex-secretary.

262
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,400
Didn't her family go bankrupt?

263
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,600
How does she still have the money to go shopping?

264
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,200
So, she is Wu Cai Yun.

265
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,400
Just as the old saying,"Enemies are bound to meet on a narrow road".

266
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,400
Isn't this the second daughter of the Wu family?

267
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,200
Which Wu family?

268
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,400
It's that Wu Hong Da who went bankrupt and killed himself.

269
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,500
She is his younger daughter.

270
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,200
Cai Yun. Let's go. Just ignore her.

271
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,600
You are broke and you still have the money to buy luxurious items?

272
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,000
That's really something.

273
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,400
If she doesn't have money, she can just browse around.

274
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,300
I think the products suit her better.

275
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,400
Ah Xue. I have something going on.

276
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,800
Let's leave first.

277
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,000
Miss.

278
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,600
I just saw that girl

279
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,100
steal a lipstick and put it in her bag.

280
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,000
I think you should check whether it's from your shop.

281
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,800
Go after her. I will mind the shop.

282
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,200
Okay, tell the boss now.

283
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,700
Stop there.

284
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,100
Stop there.

285
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,300
Stop there. Someone saw you stealing from the shop.

286
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,600
You can't leave.

287
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,800
Nonsense.

288
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,000
We didn't.

289
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,100
You didn't? Open your bag.

290
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,700
I didn't. You are wrong.

291
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm going to report you.

292
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,800
Yes, I'm going to report you for a crime.

293
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,800
You can eat anything but you can't talk nonsense.

294
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,000
Since you said that you didn't steal anything, open your bag and let me check.

295
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,100
Why are you so unreasonable?

296
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,000
Do all customers who go into your shop subject to having their bags checked?

297
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Check everyone then. Why do you insist on only checking me?

298
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,600
Call your boss here.

299
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,200
No need. Our boss is already here.

300
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Boss. She stole from your shop. We caught her but she is still not admitting to it.

301
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,400
Miss.

302
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Boss Ku. You are here in time.

303
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,600
She is making irresponsible accusations. She claims I was stealing.

304
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,800
I didn't.

305
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,400
Miss Wu.

306
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,900
We just took an inventory count

307
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,200
and someone definitely saw you taking the lipstick.

308
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,600
This lipstick is imported from France.

309
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,670
It's a small shop. We can't compensate for it.

310
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,200
Your items are expensive.

311
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
Even if I liked it, I wouldn't steal it.

312
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,300
By saying this, you are insulting us.

313
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,000
Miss Wu.

314
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,600
I know that you used high ended products in the past.

315
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,400
Please don't be a hot head. <i>don't get angry.</i>

316
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,200
<i>This must have something to do with... This must be her only solution.</i>

317
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,100
Why don't we do this? Return the lipstick to me

318
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,200
and I will gift you a cheaper one.

319
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,800
This way, we won't make a mountain out of a mole hill.

320
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,360
What do you mean?

321
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,600
You are using slander against me today.

322
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,800
You want to check, right?

323
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,700
Okay. Call the police to come here.

324
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,200
If you can't find anything, I will sue you for framing me.

325
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,000
Miss Wu. If you really don't want to co-operate,

326
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,400
I will call for the police then.

327
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,800
Okay, call them.

328
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,800
- Sister Fei Fei. Will she be captured by the police? <br>- Do you think I'm afraid?

329
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,600
Look, the police are here.

330
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,000
Move aside.

331
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,600
What's going on?

332
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,880
They are planting lies against me.

333
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,200
Sir. I didn't. It's like this.

334
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,100
Someone saw her taking a lipstick from our shop.

335
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,600
Sir, he wronged me. <i><br>(told lies)</i>

336
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,200
- I have not wronged her. <br> - Alright, Alright. Let me investigate.

337
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,400
Miss. Since you said that you didn't steal it, show me the proof.

338
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,500
He wronged me. <i><br>(telling lies)</i>

339
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,400
Open your bag. If it's not there,

340
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,200
I will deal with him for not being fair to you.

341
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,600
See if you are agreeable to this.

342
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,200
Okay then. Let's do this.

343
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,000
If there really isn't anything there, I will apologise to her.

344
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,600
Okay, check then.

345
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,300
- Is this it? <br>- Yes, this is it.

346
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,600
Sorry, come with us.

347
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,400
I didn't steal anything. I really didn't.

348
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,000
Ah Xue. You know about this. I have been with you all along.

349
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I didn't steal anything.

350
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't know anything at all.

351
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,500
I was only shopping. I didn't notice what she was doing.

352
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,600
Miss, you've been caught red-handed.

353
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,200
Come with us to the police station.

354
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,400
I have been framed. I didn't steal anything.

355
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,700
- Take her away. <br>- I have been framed.

356
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,200
I have been framed.

357
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,900
I didn't steal anything.

358
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,800
I didn't steal anything. I really didn't.

359
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,600
- Where is Wu Cai Yun? <br>- She is over there.

360
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,000
Cai Yun.

361
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,800
Mom. I really didn't steal anything. They framed me.

362
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,400
Alright. Alright. I will deal with them.

363
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,200
Hey. My daughter would never steal.

364
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,300
You must have gotten it wrong.

365
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,400
She was caught red-handed.

366
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,700
We took out the lipstick from her bag.

367
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,400
There were many witnesses.

368
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't know how the lipstick ended up in my bag.

369
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,400
I really don't know.

370
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,000
Yes. It's only just a lipstick.

371
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,400
My daughter would never steal. Someone must be behind it.

372
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,800
Yes. You must have gotten it wrong.

373
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,040
My sister would never steal.

374
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,400
- Stop crying. <br>- Sir, about this.

375
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,900
I would like to ask.

376
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,800
Since you saw it,

377
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,570
we won't deny that the lipstick was in her bag.

378
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,000
But I would also like to know,

379
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,700
did anyone personally witness her stealing it?

380
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,600
- It seems so... - You should call the witness to stand here then.

381
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,700
That's right.

382
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,000
Sir. Based on your experience,

383
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,900
look at her carefully.

384
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,600
Does she look like a thief who would steal?

385
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,400
Chief, is there legal grounds for this?

386
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,800
Can you see if we can do this?

387
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,400
We will pay for this lipstick and consider that we bought it.

388
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,070
We don't need to make it hard on her anymore.

389
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,800
You have also been troubled enough. This will accommodate everyone.

390
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,400
If the victim is willing to agree, that would be good to resolve the matter privately.

391
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,800
But if he is not agreeable, there is nothing we can do.

392
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,400
Please wait. I will make the call.

393
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,600
We will have to trouble you then.

394
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Everything's fine.

395
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,400
Brother Shao Tian. I really didn't steal it.

396
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,300
Don't panic. We know.

397
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,260
First calm down.

398
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,600
That's right, Cai Yun. Don't panic. There definitely will be a solution.

399
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,400
There definitely will be a solution.

400
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,800
It's okay, if they don't reach a compromise,

401
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,400
- I understand. <br>- I will go to the shop to talk to the boss.

402
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,000
Everything's fine. Don't cry.

403
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,400
Alright, the seller was quick to resolve the issue.

404
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,800
After some small formalities, you can take her home.

405
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,600
Thank you for your trouble.

406
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:21,470
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

407
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,600
Cai Yun. If you want to cry, just cry.

408
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,800
It will make you feel better.

409
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,300
Sis.

410
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,800
Enough, Cai Yun.

411
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,900
I know that you have suffered

412
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,500
but I know that this matter is already over.

413
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,800
Isn't that so?

414
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,500
Sis. I really didn't steal it.

415
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,200
You still don't believe me.

416
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Of course, I believe you.

417
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,800
Stop crying. There is only one thing I have to know. What happened between you.

418
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,600
Stop crying. Crying won't solve anything.

419
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,100
Ah Xue told me to go with her to the shop.

420
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,600
You should know that after what happened to our family,

421
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,400
no one is willing to be my friend anymore.

422
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,800
Except Ah Xue.

423
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,200
She asked me to accompany her to the shop.

424
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,200
I originally thought that if I just browsed, I would't spend any money.

425
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,200
But they said that I stole the lipstick.

426
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,800
I was not so convinced even when the police were called

427
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,190
because I didn't steal anything.

428
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,400
But subsequently, when the police opened my bag, the lipstick was in there.

429
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,100
- Okay, I get it. <br>- I also don't know how it got in there.

430
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,400
Do you know the people there? How do they look like?

431
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,900
I don't know them. They are all from the rich families.

432
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,400
There was one who kept watching me.

433
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,800
Sis. I swear that I really didn't steal it.

434
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,400
Enough, Cai Yun. I believe you. You are a good girl.

435
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,600
Don't worry. I will investigate this thoroughly

436
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,200
and prove your innocence. Okay, stop crying.

437
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Okay, I know. I don't blame you.

438
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,800
Boss Gu. This is just a small gesture.

439
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,200
You are too polite.

440
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,200
My sister caused you some trouble yesterday.

441
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,200
About the incident, regardless of who is right,

442
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,200
I would also like your store to not get a bad name.

443
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm here today to apologise.

444
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,200
Miss.

445
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,400
Frankly, after thinking about this, we feel bad.

446
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,200
In the past, your father helped this shop a lot.

447
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,600
Hence, I...

448
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,400
Don't talk about the past anymore.

449
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,200
It's just that my sister is still young.

450
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,390
She is mature in our family.

451
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,800
I think she would never steal.

452
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,200
What happened yesterday?

453
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,000
Was there a misunderstanding?

454
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,400
Actually, I wasn't here yesterday.

455
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,900
I heard about this from two of my staff.

456
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,700
They said that your sister met some ladies here

457
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,000
and they had an exchange of words.

458
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
When your sister wanted to leave, a lady told the shop staff that

459
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
she stole something.

460
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
Second Miss?

461
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,080
Do you now that lady?

462
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,300
Who is she?

463
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,800
It seems like her family name is Fang. She's Miss Fang.

464
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,200
I'm not very clear about what her name is.

465
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
but she was very generous.

466
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,500
A few of her friends were joking with her

467
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,800
and kept calling her Mrs Jiang.

468
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,200
Mrs Jiang?

469
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,500
Miss Fang?

470
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,300
That's right. I have her receipt from yesterday.

471
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,900
Xiao Wu.

472
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,800
Take out all the receipts from yesterday.

473
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,200
Boss. Here it is.

474
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,800
This is it.

475
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,200
She bought these three lipsticks.

476
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,200
Jiang Yu.

477
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,000
To what end will you go with your hatred of my family?

478
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,800
Looks like Zhou Shao Tian didn't take good care of you.

479
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,200
You look haggered

480
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,600
and your temper is flared up even more.

481
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,800
I'm asking you a question.

482
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Do not challenge my limits.

483
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,800
After toying with me,

484
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
you find this interesting, right?

485
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,200
If there is anything, you can take it out on me.

486
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,800
I'm not afraid of being accused but you should clarify everything first.

487
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,200
Accused?

488
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,000
You let Fang Fei Fei steal a lipstick and frame my sister for it.

489
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,400
She is only just a young girl. How could you do this to her?

490
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,600
So, you are sure that I did it.

491
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,700
If it's not you, who else would it be?

492
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,900
This only proves that Ling Long bought three lipsticks from Little Paris.

493
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,200
I would advise you to think clearly about this.

494
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,600
If you don't want your sister to be famous,

495
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,300
the best solution is to keep it (the incidence) a low profile.

496
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,100
So,

497
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,700
you are admitting to this.

498
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,100
Fine.

499
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,000
Even if I did it,

500
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,100
so what?

501
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,200
They said that humans were born kind.

502
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,000
I always thought that you weren't that bad

503
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,200
but the truth is the proof. I was wrong.

504
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,400
Moreover, I was gravely mistaken.

505
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,000
Being born as Wu Hong Da's daughter

506
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
is your life's biggest mistake.

507
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,400
You took my father's company.

508
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,300
Since you even dare to say this...

509
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,800
Even if my father

510
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,260
offended you in business dealings,

511
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,400
did you ever think that my sister is still young?

512
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,600
If this were to leak out, how would you expect to live?

513
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,700
Jiang Yu. Let me tell you.

514
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,000
If you dare to touch my family again,

515
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,900
I will never let you off.

516
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,200
So, in your heart,

517
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm really this kind of person.

518
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,300
Sorry.

519
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,500
You have never been in my heart.

520
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,600
You will never be in future either.

521
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,200
I think what Brother Shao Tian said is right.

522
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,400
Someone who is so cold and selfish like you,

523
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,020
Ling Long will go bankrupt sooner or later.

524
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,600
Just wait and see then.

525
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,100
Let's see whether Ling Long or Fu Sheng will go bankrupt first.

526
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Brother, this Hangzhou White Peony root just arrived today. Try it.

527
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,700
What's wrong, brother? Who made you angry?

528
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,500
Regarding the Wu family issue,

529
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,000
you were the one behind it, right?

530
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,100
That's right.

531
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,600
- Don't do such things in the future again. <br>- Why?

532
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,200
Wu Hong Da destroyed our home.

533
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,000
Father was framed by him.

534
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
An eye for an eye.

535
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,400
I wanted to give them a taste of their own medicine.

536
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,600
You are using such a tactic to take revenge.

537
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
What's the difference between you and Wu Hong Da?

538
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,600
"Trying to punish the wicked is like putting yourself on a bad horse."

539
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,400
What right do you have to hate Wu Hong Da? Tell me!

540
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,000
I hate them.

541
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,200
I hate them for causing father to die.

542
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
I hate them for causing mom to be sick.

543
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,900
I hate them for causing you to be unhappy for many years.

544
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,000
Why?

545
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Fei Fei. Why did you become like this?

546
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,700
I suddenly remember when you were young.

547
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,900
A little bird in our house was killed by a maid. You cried for a long time.

548
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,700
You cried miserably.

549
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Ever since Dad passed away,

550
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,000
all these years, you have been helping me to take care of my mother.

551
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,600
Because of your existence,

552
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,600
you turned this house into a family.

553
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Fei Fei. I have always hoped that you would be a very kind girl.

554
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,100
I really don't want you to dirty your hands because of revenge.

555
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,200
Thus, all those matters,

556
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,700
let me take the burden alone.

557
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,200
Brother.

558
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,400
When Father took me in when my parents died,

559
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,600
he gave me a family.

560
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,200
At the most difficult time,

561
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,200
you didn't get rid of me.

562
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,100
Without the Jiang family,

563
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:22,800
and with you, I wouldn't have grown up peacefully.

564
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,300
I will always remember the family's great kindness.

565
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,500
For you,

566
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,600
I could do anything for the Jiang family.

567
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,800
If you still want me to be your brother,

568
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,000
don't get involved.

569
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,400
Thus, regarding everything,

570
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,300
I will make the arrangements.

571
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,300
What is the progress of this matter?

572
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,800
I have already done according to your instructions.

573
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,900
There has been talk with some of the suppliers.

574
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,400
We only need our suppliers not to supply to Fu Sheng.

575
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,000
Thus, starting from today,

576
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,200
Fu Sheng won't be able to obtain any materials for dyeing.

577
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,400
If this continues, it's just a matter of time before Fu Sheng goes bankrupt.

578
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,200
Unless Zhou Shao Tian spends a big sum of money

579
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,400
and imports the materials.

580
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,800
Please come to the boss with anything major.

581
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,600
and let them be enlightened.

582
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:55,300
The Huzhou weaving and dying sector has become this way.

583
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,350
Moreover, you have already seen Jiang Yu's underhanded tactics.

584
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,400
The Huzhou weaving and dying sector has become this way.

585
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:07,000
Jiang Yu buys cheap

586
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,900
This time, he got involved with the suppliers of the dye materials.

587
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,100
Yes. He is sabotaging my family now

588
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,100
but he won't be able to harm your positions.

589
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,700
Thus, I feel that

590
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,590
Ling Long's real ambition is

591
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:24,300
to occupy the entire area of Huzhou.

592
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,000
Boss Zhou. Your words are logical.

593
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,700
In your opinion, what should we do?

594
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,700
Among all of us, none of us are his match.

595
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,700
But if we were to join forces together,

596
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,200
we will be able to poach his clients.

597
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,600
Even though we can't harm Ling Long, we should at least send him a warning

598
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,400
so that he wouldn't dare to harm such a small shop like us.

599
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,200
Stable prices will inevitably lead to increased pressure to reduce earnings.

600
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,000
Especially when we are doing business to make profits.

601
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,800
Yes. We need to support our families too.

602
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Everyone.

603
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,400
If we join forces together,

604
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,200
we will benefit from the purchase of raw materials.

605
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,000
What do you think?

606
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,120
Join forces together?

607
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,270
The prices of raw materials will be reduced.

608
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,000
Yes, this is a good idea.

609
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,700
Even though our margins will be lower

610
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,000
we will be able to poach even more clients from Ling Long.

611
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,700
Sales will go in a straight line up and our total profits will not be reduced.

612
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,000
It will be even higher.

613
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,800
It's sound logical. It's a good idea.

614
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,400
Dear everyone,

615
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,000
when my father was alive, he helped you a lot.

616
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,500
Now that Fu Sheng is facing difficulties, we hope that you will help us.

617
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,020
We must work as one

618
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,400
and resist the evil.

619
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,700
Okay, Miss. Count me in.

620
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,950
Tell us what we should do. We will listen to you.

621
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,800
If everyone agree, let's sign the consent form.

622
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,400
Okay, I will sign.

623
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,000
Count me in.

624
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,400
- I will sign too. <br>- Thank you.

625
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Count me in.

626
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,300
Me too.

627
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,000
Count me in.

628
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,600
I will sign too.

629
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,600
Please take a look around.

630
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,000
These are Ling Long's new products.

631
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,600
Regardless of the colours, patterns or textures,

632
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
they are made with delicate care.

633
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,800
Please feel free to look around.

634
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,600
It's really not bad.

635
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,600
This is made well. Look at the exquisite work.

636
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,400
You have a good eye.

637
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,600
In terms of color, gray is the hardest

638
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
followed by cool colors.

639
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,900
Mr. Jiang does a cool color treatment that is very cathartic. <i>full of emotions</i>

640
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,000
Really makes me open my eyes.

641
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,600
You are over praising me.

642
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,700
I wonder if the colour will run if it gets wet.

643
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,200
It can't be that you don't believe in our products.

644
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,800
No, Boss Jiang. Your products are the best in Huzhou

645
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,200
but your products are the most expensive.

646
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,800
But if we don't do the water test and we buy it,

647
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,500
inevitably something could happen.

648
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,800
Boss Jiang. I know about Ling Long's rules

649
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,600
but it's really hard to do business now.

650
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,000
Our small businesses also want to avoid risk.

651
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Why don't you reconsider?

652
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,600
We will reconsider too.

653
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,300
Let's compromise.

654
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,600
Brother. Why don't we let them try the water test?

655
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,000
Dear everyone.

656
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,700
We don't have a tryout policy in Ling Long.

657
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,200
I know that there are many small and medium shops

658
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,400
who are willing to do the water tests.

659
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,400
That is because they only sell locally.

660
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,200
The process is simple.

661
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,400
Ling Long does business throughout the country.

662
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,700
If I were to break the rule today,

663
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,050
how would I face foreign merchants?

664
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,800
That's right.

665
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,000
The prices at Ling Long are definitely more expensive.

666
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,800
Higher quality.

667
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,700
No one can be compared to ours.

668
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,700
This is the first we have worked with some of you. For the rest we have worked several times.

669
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,350
Those who have worked with us,

670
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,300
I believe, know very well the exquisite high quality fabrics here.

671
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,100
As for those who are working with us for the first time, I will guarantee that after going through this,

672
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,800
you will definitely have no regrets.

673
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,200
Boss Jiang, you also offer a final inspection of the product.

674
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,000
Yes. I heard that

675
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,700
Boss Zhou of Fu Sheng

676
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,800
orders are intended to be made of this.

677
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,700
Let's go to visit the Miss of former Mr. Wu of Ling Long.
