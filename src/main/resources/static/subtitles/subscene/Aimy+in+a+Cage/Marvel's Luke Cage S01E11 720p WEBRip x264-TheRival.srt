[screaming]

6
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:54,974
We are ten feet from the door.
Just bust through.

7
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:58,103
I can't cover you from every angle.
You're the target.

8
00:00:59,812 --> 00:01:01,772
-Oh, shit.
-Hold this.

9
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:02,857
Claire.

10
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:06,777
[mouthing]

11
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:14,744
-[Shades] What's going on here?
-Cage. Behind the bar.

12
00:01:17,037 --> 00:01:18,373
[bullets ricocheting]

13
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,041
He's bulletproof, ain't he?

14
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:23,753
She ain't.
Shoot her first.

15
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:25,171

-[banging]
-[breathing heavily]

19
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:16,306
No.

20
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:21,561
They barricaded the door and shit.
There's no way through.

21
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:23,354
Forget Cage.

22
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:25,190
The cops are gonna
flood this place in a minute.

23
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:27,066
No. We're staying.

24
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,068
Nobody leaves.
Not until we have them.

25
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:33,113
-What you talking about, Willis?
-You got jokes? Right now?

26
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:34,365
You're the one who's joking

27
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:36,409
if you think that we're escaping here
without a plan.

28
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:40,538
Later for that pre-written shit.
Sometimes you gotta freestyle.

29
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,499
Look, you got one Judas bullet left.

30
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,751
What are you gonna do
if Luke Cage takes you head on?

31
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:47,378
Do I look worried?

32
00:02:47,462 --> 00:02:49,505
No. That's the problem.

33
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:53,968
Place is airtight.
Back is sealed off, too.

34
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:56,429
[Shades] So there's no other way out?

35
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:59,224
-No. Ty caught a straggler.
-[Stryker] Good.

36
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:01,351
Anybody ain't us is a hostage.

37
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:03,561
Make sure none of them
look me in the eye.

38
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:05,896
Lopes, Sugar, you're babysitting.

39
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,940
Move 'em up there
and face them towards the wall.

40
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:09,692
Anybody resists, blindfold 'em.

41
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:11,486
Too much lip,
shoot 'em in the head.

42
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:12,862
The rest will get the message.

43
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:15,281
[men talking indistinctly]

44
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:16,699
Let me go!

45
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,414
Take Diet Obama upstairs, Ty.

46
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:25,583
Keep a gun on him till I get up there.

47
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,084
Take your hands off me!

48
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:30,963
-You can't do this!
-[Stryker] Yes, we can.

49
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:32,131
Zip.

50
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,844
While you're up there,
get me my key.

51
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:38,137
You know the one I'm talking about.

52
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,147
What the hell are you doing
calling me out by my first name?

53
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:49,857
[Shades scoffs]

54
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,235
You're dreaming if you think
we're getting out of here.

55
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,530
You shot a female cop
in front of 100 people.

56
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:57,114
All people will remember

57
00:03:57,197 --> 00:04:00,910
is Luke Cage going all King Kong
with a bitch and jumping off a balcony.

58
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:04,247
What they're gonna remember
is Luke Cage running from the bullets.

59
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,166
All they know outside
is that Cage lost his mind,

60
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,460
shots were fired, and it's a standoff.

61
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:11,546
Confusion is our friend.

62
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,464
We kill Luke and Misty,

63
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:16,926
suddenly, we're the heroes
who stopped the Harlem Menace.

64
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:19,262
For all they know, he killed her.

65
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:22,473
With them dead, we control the story.

66
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:24,850
That's your plan?
That's it?

67
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,852
The bigger the stall,

68
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:29,314
the more time we have
for other diversions.

69
00:04:29,397 --> 00:04:32,525
Misty will be dead,
I'll have another shot at Cage,

70
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,234
and there's bound to be
another way out of here.

71
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,070
We'll cross that bridge soon enough.

72
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:40,115
Okay.
How do we hold them off right now?

73
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,619
I'm gonna be Luke Cage.

74
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,831
[theme music playing]

75
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,026
-[Luke and Misty breathing heavily]
-[blood trickling]

76
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:59,319
[weakly] Luke, I'm cold.

77
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:01,864
-I think you nicked an artery.
-What?

78
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:04,450
[Luke] That's why it's bleeding so fast.

79
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:06,536
And I ain't gonna lie, Misty.

80
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:08,370
-You're not gonna like this.
-What do you mean?

81
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,165
[screams]

82
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,669
-[groans]
-Hold that.

83
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:16,128
[whimpering]

84
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:19,214
We should just go out the back.

85
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:22,593
-They've already secured it.
-[groans] How do you know?

86
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:25,430
It's what I would do.
The only way he can win at this point

87
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:27,306
is if he can control
who comes in and who leaves.

88
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,725
Either way,
I gotta get you someplace safe.

89
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,276
[Misty] What the hell?

90
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,779
Lucky Luciano used to own this building.

91
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:43,906
It still has a lot of prohibition
nooks and crannies.

92
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:45,866
[Sugar] Sit down!

93
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,993
Turn around.
Face the wall.

94
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:58,337
[Misty groans] Who's helping me?

95
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,341
Hmm? Luke Cage?
Or Carl Lucas?

96
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:05,886
Who is Willis Stryker?

97
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,638
[breathing heavily]

98
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:12,560
[groans]

99
00:07:12,643 --> 00:07:14,394
His street name is Diamondback.

100
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:18,273
He was the hardware connect
for Cottonmouth that you were looking for.

101
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,612
-Mmm.
-He's also my half-brother. [sighs]

102
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,951
[whistling]

103
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,835
[Zip] Here's the key you asked for,
boss man.

104
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,216
What're you doing?

105
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:48,345
-I love this part.
-What?

106
00:07:50,305 --> 00:07:52,141
When the panties drop.

107
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:56,896
[people screaming]

108
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:05,070
[both breathing heavily]

109
00:08:05,154 --> 00:08:07,406
Your family is jacked up.

110
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,575
-[sirens wailing]
-[indistinct radio chatter]

111
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:11,201
[Thembi] It's chaos out here, Pat.

112
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:12,953
Several people are injured,

113
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:15,581
mostly from the stampede
to escape the club,

114
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:17,416
but a few have gunshot wounds.

115
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,378
Councilwoman Mariah Dillard
was whisked away by her security

116
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:24,632
<i>and most of the injured protesters</i>
<i>have been rushed to the hospital.</i>

117
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:28,553
<i>Less than an hour</i>
<i>after an anti-Luke Cage rally began,</i>

118
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:31,138
{\an8}<i>Luke Cage himself entered the event.</i>

119
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:34,809
{\an8}According to protesters
and a confidential NYPD source,

120
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:39,396
{\an8}shots rang out after veteran Harlem
police detective Mercedes Knight

121
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,273
{\an8}<i>attempted to arrest Cage,</i>

122
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:44,359
{\an8}the dangerous fugitive
who attacked two police officers

123
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:46,361
{\an8}<i>on a widely seen dashcam video.</i>

124
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:49,156
<i>And moments ago, we heard the sound</i>
<i>of what we believe is...</i>

125
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,950
I wanna know if the explosion
came from the inside.

126
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:54,620
Find out what you can right away.
And somebody get me Misty Knight.

127
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:00,084
ESU has just arrived.

128
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:04,922
-We're going tactical in five minutes.
-No, you're not.

129
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:07,341
-Stand down.
-We're going in.

130
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:09,426
We got an active shooter
and a hostage situation.

131
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:11,637
They haven't asked for anything
and one of ours is in there.

132
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:13,222
We need to be careful.

133
00:09:13,305 --> 00:09:15,850
This whole thing goes through me.

134
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:18,686
Inspector, it's the chief.

135
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:20,730
Yes, sir.

136
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:36,996
[Zip] No way he went out the back.

137
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:47,590
[Stryker] Scour this whole place.

138
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:51,510
Every inch.
Even if it's obvious.

139
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:54,764
We are making way too much noise.

140
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:57,307
They're gonna bust in
that door any minute.

141
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:58,558
It's getting messy.

142
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:02,605
-Why are you so shook?
-'Cause I'm clearheaded.

143
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:05,858
And I'm not?
Look, I'm spitting off the dome.

144
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:08,193
It's true, but I haven't had
a misplaced rhyme yet.

145
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:09,945
Violence breaks out

146
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,823
at an anti-Luke Cage rally
when Luke Cage shows up?

147
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:16,118
Come on, this shit is poetry.

148
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,913
-Is he worth it?
-Absolutely.

149
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,373
Did you talk to Mariah?

150
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,919
-She's on it.
-Good.

151
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:29,131
They're scared of Cage now.
They're afraid people will die.

152
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:32,635
She'll use that to close the deal. Hmm?

153
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:50,778
[Chang] We got a call.

154
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:52,196
-Is it her?
-No.

155
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,573
It's from inside.
A landline.

156
00:10:58,035 --> 00:11:00,454
This is Inspector Priscilla Ridley
from the NYPD.

157
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:02,289
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

158
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:03,916
This is Damon Boone.

159
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:08,253
I've been instructed
to tell you to stay away.

160
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:10,422
Luke Cage has taken us hostage

161
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:14,676
and he warns that he'll start
killing people if the police approach.

162
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:17,930
<i>What does he want?</i>

163
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:19,139
He--

164
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:25,437
Unpredictability gives us leverage.

165
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,564
[Damon] All you're doing is scaring them.

166
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:29,524
Let me help you.
What do you want?

167
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,194
Reciprocity.

168
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:37,491
No one in the department
is going to bow to terrorism.

169
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:39,493
Oh, I'm counting on that.

170
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,627
Is that even clean?

171
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,379
Clean enough for a tourniquet.

172
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:53,048
Who were you, a Boy Scout?

173
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:56,010
Force Recon.

174
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:58,804
They had to... hear that blast outside.

175
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:00,680
I should call Ridley.

176
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:03,392
[groans]

177
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:07,729
[softly] Oh, shit.

178
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,774
[sighs]

179
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:15,154
[cell phone vibrating]

180
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:21,035
-Misty?
-[Misty distorted] <i>Inspector?</i>

181
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:23,829
<i>-Inspector?</i>
-Misty.

182
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:26,331
-[distorted] <i>Misty.</i>
-Inspector...

183
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:28,583
[groans]

184
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:29,794
Do you have your phone?

185
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:32,629
-I lost mine a long time ago.
-Shit!

186
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:40,095
Look, you gotta go upstairs, okay?

187
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:41,847
Those people, they need you.

188
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:47,519
I can't leave you.
You'll bleed out.

189
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:49,646
You'll die.

190
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:55,277
I need to get you stabilized.

191
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,240
Then I'll think of some way to help Claire
and everybody else up there.

192
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:04,286
[breath trembling]
You can't negotiate with him.

193
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,705
I won't.

194
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:10,835
[voice breaking] I don't wanna...

195
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:16,048
I don't wanna bleed to death
on the floor, like Scarfe.

196
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,471
Not on my watch.

197
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:28,727
[sniffs]

198
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,733
I think you deserve a drink,
Councilman.

199
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:38,737
-I don't drink.
-Yes, you do.

200
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:48,747
[smacks lips] Ah.

201
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:53,377
Nothing like an aged Scotch.

202
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,628
You know...

203
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:58,048
there was a time
you'd cross a Scotsman...

204
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:02,552
and he wouldn't think twice
about cutting your head off with a sword.

205
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:06,556
I like a drink that encourages such...

206
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:08,767
decisiveness.

207
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:13,397
I can help you negotiate even more.

208
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,857
I can speak for you.
Get you what you want.

209
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:22,322
You read the Bible, Damon?

210
00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:24,699
Sometimes.

211
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:26,493
When nothing else makes sense.

212
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,961
I read that every day.

213
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:38,588
Gift from my father to my mother.

214
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,426
My mother left it to me after she passed.

215
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:45,762
Please.

216
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:48,057
Go ahead.

217
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:04,614
[Damon shuddering]

218
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,347
[Candace inhales sharply]

219
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,686
[softly] Hey.

220
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:36,771
What's hurting?

221
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:40,650
I messed up my ankle real bad.

222
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:47,616
[Sugar] Hey!

223
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,536
Sit your fine ass down.

224
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,913
[sighs] She hurt her leg.
It could be broken.

225
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:55,290
So?

226
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:00,420
She's my best friend,
and I'm a nurse.

227
00:16:00,504 --> 00:16:02,131
Don't you have enough to worry about?

228
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:04,841
True.
Just do it quick.

229
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:11,306
-Don't help, okay? I'll do all the work.
-[exhales deeply]

230
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,517
-[gasps]
-I'm gonna take your boot off.

231
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,644
-[inhales sharply]
-I see.

232
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:18,105
[Candace gasping]

233
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:19,439
[whimpering]

234
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:21,900
Move your leg like this.

235
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:24,111
-Your toes?
-[groans]

236
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:30,825
Yeah, I don't think it's a break.

237
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:33,537
-But it's a pretty bad sprain.
-[sighs]

238
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:35,998
[sighs] Were you protesting?

239
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:38,875
I'm a VIP hostess.
And you?

240
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,087
Um... [sighs] I was...

241
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:43,630
helping a friend.

242
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,887
-This is some bullshit.
-You got Luke Cage?

243
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,183
Please. That nigga's on that
bulletproof Houdini shit for real.

244
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:56,476
[Sugar] What about downstairs?

245
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,771
There's no way downstairs
from the kitchen.

246
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:02,607
Is your friend Luke Cage?

247
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:06,361
-Do you know him?
-Hard to forget.

248
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,905
He used to work here.

249
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:12,576
This whole thing is my fault.

250
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:15,662
[stuttering] Hey... what's happening?
What's wrong?

251
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:17,664
[voice breaking]
I did something really bad.

252
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:19,749
Hey.

253
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:22,669
What's wrong with her?

254
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:24,713
[sighs] She's in a lot of pain.

255
00:17:30,469 --> 00:17:32,346
[whispering] Tell me.

256
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:33,430
[whispering] I was so scared.

257
00:17:33,513 --> 00:17:36,225
They paid me to say
I saw Luke kill Cottonmouth.

258
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:38,518
Who's they?

259
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:40,979
Mariah Dillard.

260
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:44,566
You wanna help Luke?

261
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,902
Then you tell me how he could have
disappeared from that kitchen

262
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:49,404
that no one could've escaped from.

263
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:54,784
This is a prewar prohibition building.
There's a storage space underneath.

264
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:58,205
Employees used to go down there
to fool around or sleep between shifts

265
00:17:58,288 --> 00:18:00,499
when we had to prep a big event.

266
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:02,251
So it's downstairs in the basement?
Where?

267
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:03,918
By the staff lockers.

268
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:06,338
Would anybody else know about that?

269
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:08,465
Not unless they worked in the kitchen.

270
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:10,634
I'm the only person
from the waitstaff here...

271
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:12,469
-except Luke.
-[sighs]

272
00:18:13,262 --> 00:18:15,222
The only way in or out
of that storage room

273
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:16,681
is through the kitchen.

274
00:18:17,682 --> 00:18:21,520
Luke can make another door.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to pass out.

275
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,897
-What?
-I need you to pass out.

276
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,440
I'm gonna get us out of this.

277
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:28,152
-[sighs]
-[Claire] Oh... Oh, my God!

278
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:29,903
-Help us!
-[Sugar] What now?

279
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:32,322
-[Claire] She's diabetic.
-Where's her shit?

280
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:35,492
[stutters] Uh, it must be in, uh,
the staff locker downstairs.

281
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:39,037
Yo, Lopes.
Escort the night nurse here downstairs.

282
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,330
Thank you.

283
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:42,541
Will you look after her?

284
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:44,293
-I'll be right back, okay?
-Uh-huh.

285
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:46,211
Okay, baby.

286
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:50,924
Come on.
Come on, now.

287
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,802
-Just down here. [grunts]
-Just hurry up.

288
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:55,720
[Lopes groaning]

289
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:10,277
You'll live.

290
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:21,037
Hey.

291
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,461
[sighs]

292
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:31,215
So, what does this brother of yours
want, anyway?

293
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:32,549
Revenge.

294
00:19:33,217 --> 00:19:36,345
He framed me.
He sent me to Seagate.

295
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:41,391
He's trying to pin
this whole hostage thing on you.

296
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:45,270
Did he set you up
for Cottonmouth's murder, too?

297
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:47,272
I wouldn't put it past him.

298
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:50,149
You're the only one that knows the truth.

299
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:53,111
I'll need your help
when we get out of this.

300
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:54,446
You'll have it.

301
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:58,242
[indistinct chatter]

302
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:09,586
[siren wailing]

303
00:20:12,506 --> 00:20:14,966
-We need to go in.
-Not until we have a plan.

304
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:17,594
Cage is super strong and bulletproof.

305
00:20:17,677 --> 00:20:20,347
The longer we sit,
the more entrenched this lunatic gets.

306
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,432
We've had exactly one conversation
with a hostage,

307
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:25,101
Damon Boone, the politician,
and we got cut off.

308
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:28,438
Now, I am with you on going in,
but we need a plan.

309
00:20:28,522 --> 00:20:30,482
We've never faced
anything like this before.

310
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:37,364
Inspector Ridley?
Blake Tower, DA's Office.

311
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:40,116
-Mr. Tower. What's going on?
-You tell me.

312
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:42,577
We've been closely following
Cage's activities.

313
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:44,037
The mayor would like me
to help coordinate.

314
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,081
-The situation is coordinated.
-Really?

315
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:52,712
-We're on the same side...
-Hmm.

316
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:53,880
...and I'd like to guide you

317
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:56,174
as how best to achieve an outcome
that's beneficial to all parties.

318
00:20:56,258 --> 00:20:57,426
Yeah, the most beneficial outcome

319
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:00,429
is for me to get those hostages
and my detective out alive,

320
00:21:00,512 --> 00:21:02,180
and Luke Cage in cuffs.

321
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:04,433
None of which you can give me.

322
00:21:04,516 --> 00:21:05,559
-Inspector?
-Yeah.

323
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:09,020
We have independent confirmation
that the explosion came from inside.

324
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:11,273
-Now can we go in?
-We wait.

325
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:13,692
What if he just shoots
all those people dead?

326
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:14,901
That is not Cage's MO.

327
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:18,196
Every encounter we've ever had with him,
he's never used a gun.

328
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,531
He doesn't have to.

329
00:21:19,614 --> 00:21:23,076
-Well, he's using one now, isn't he?
-Well, I saw that dashcam video.

330
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:25,704
He can take out your whole team
in mere seconds and not get a scratch.

331
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:27,038
I agree.

332
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:30,124
In order to engage this asshole,
we need to bring the heat.

333
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,169
You got any ideas Mr., uh, ADA?

334
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:35,964
Look, the mayor
is in a closed-door session

335
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:38,425
discussing enhanced weapons
for law enforcement.

336
00:21:38,508 --> 00:21:39,676
With who?

337
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:42,512
Mariah Dillard.

338
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:47,141
[Misty] What's wrong?

339
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:49,185
It needs to be tighter.

340
00:21:51,605 --> 00:21:52,606
Brace yourself.

341
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,485
-One...
-[yells]

342
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:59,278
[groaning]

343
00:21:59,363 --> 00:22:01,114
[Luke breathing heavily]

344
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:06,620
I feel like getting
my Crispus Attucks on up there.

345
00:22:06,703 --> 00:22:09,122
Mmm, you gotta be smart about this.

346
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:12,667
There are too many innocent people
up there who could end up dead.

347
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:15,920
I might not have a choice.

348
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:20,675
I had a choice.

349
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:23,428
I should have trusted you.

350
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:26,515
I know.

351
00:22:26,598 --> 00:22:27,849
[chuckles]

352
00:22:29,017 --> 00:22:31,060
[scoffs] You didn't make it easy.

353
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:40,737
Don't go doing anything stupid.

354
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:43,865
Like what?

355
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:45,992
Be a hero.

356
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,245
I'm not the hero type.

357
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:51,289
Are you sure?

358
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:55,835
Looks to me like
that's what you've always been.

359
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,595
[faint tapping]

360
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,096
You hear that?

361
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,057
[tapping continues]

362
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,148
[tapping continues]

363
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:48,387
Why the hell didn't you leave the club?

364
00:23:48,472 --> 00:23:50,765
When have I ever done as I was told?

365
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:58,482
[Luke] Misty! Misty!

366
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,527
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.

367
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,363
What's going on?

368
00:24:05,446 --> 00:24:07,323
We might have something
to take Luke Cage out.

369
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:10,034
An experimental weapon
that's never been authorized before.

370
00:24:10,118 --> 00:24:11,244
[Tower] Hmm.

371
00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:14,163
-Someone's pulling strings. Is that you?
-No.

372
00:24:14,247 --> 00:24:17,792
Then it's Mariah Dillard.
Did you put her in touch with someone?

373
00:24:18,752 --> 00:24:20,587
It's Boone again.

374
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:28,386
Mr. Boone.
Are you okay?

375
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:30,471
Luke Cage would like
to give you his demands.

376
00:24:30,555 --> 00:24:31,890
<i>We're listening.</i>

377
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:33,808
He wants a chopper on the roof.

378
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:35,434
As a sign of goodwill,
Mr. Cage is willing

379
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,646
<i>to let half the hostages go</i>
<i>at the end of this call.</i>

380
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:42,776
Me and a few others will remain
to ensure his escape.

381
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:44,485
We will get right on that.

382
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:47,739
Is Detective Knight still alive?

383
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:52,702
<i>Yes. Yes, she is.</i>

384
00:24:53,703 --> 00:24:55,454
We will need proof of life
before we proceed.

385
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:56,540
[mouthing] No.

386
00:24:57,415 --> 00:24:59,584
He's saying you're not in a position
to make demands.

387
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:01,795
<i>Well, then we have a problem.</i>

388
00:25:01,878 --> 00:25:05,423
He says a few hostages
will be coming out now.

389
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:07,842
-[woman] Got it!
-He's stalling.

390
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:09,678
I know what he's doing.
He could just want a way out.

391
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:11,888
We should keep on stalling him
until the new weapons show up.

392
00:25:11,971 --> 00:25:14,683
I take my orders from the chief.

393
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:16,350
What's really going on here?

394
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:18,978
Do I want us to use a weapon

395
00:25:19,062 --> 00:25:21,189
that can take out a man
that's bulletproof?

396
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:23,399
-Absolutely not.
-I don't understand.

397
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:26,069
Look, any weapon
that the police or military has

398
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:27,821
eventually ends up on the street.

399
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:31,490
You know it's dangerous
to even show that kind of power.

400
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:33,827
Hey, but I don't see
we got much of a choice.

401
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:38,539
-I don't trust Mariah Dillard.
-Yeah, I don't either.

402
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,918
But she has juice with people
way above our paygrade.

403
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:44,629
I just don't want this to turn into
the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

404
00:25:44,713 --> 00:25:48,883
Frank Castle shot the city to hell,
and he only had regular bullets.

405
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:51,552
Now imagine what he or somebody like him
can do with these things.

406
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:54,598
Yeah, I hear you.
Who is the one person you don't see here?

407
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:56,600
Hmm. A chief.

408
00:25:56,683 --> 00:25:59,936
And what does that tell you?
He wants distance. Deniability.

409
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:02,396
If this goes wrong,
the blood is on my hands,

410
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,023
-and mine alone.
-[Chang] Inspector.

411
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:06,025
There's movement at the door.

412
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,991
[officer 1] Eyes up. He's coming out.
[officer 2] Hold fire.

413
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:17,996
[officer 3] Hands! Hands!
[officer 4] Put your hands in the air!

414
00:26:19,372 --> 00:26:20,790
Step forward.

415
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:26,921
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!

416
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:30,008
-Move it, come on!
-That's right. This way! Go, go!

417
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:31,092
We're clear.

418
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,802
-Get them out of here. Come on.
-Follow me.

419
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:48,109
Well, it went clean through.

420
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:54,157
-You've lost a lot of blood.
-Mmm.

421
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,661
I handled the situation the best I could
under the circumstances, Claire.

422
00:26:57,744 --> 00:27:00,121
[Claire] Yeah, you're lucky
she didn't lose her arm.

423
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:02,540
That is way too close to the wound.

424
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:05,835
Me, medical shit.
You, bulletproof shit.

425
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,879
Y'all sound married.

426
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,801
-[Claire sighs]
-That's good.

427
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:16,095
I'm gonna get some stuff.

428
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:24,896
[Stryker] Oh, my mama loved
blue-eyed soul.

429
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,566
["Son of a Preacher Man" playing]

430
00:27:31,945 --> 00:27:34,948
I wish you could have met Dana...

431
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,367
my mother.

432
00:27:44,332 --> 00:27:46,710
-She's beautiful.
-Yes.

433
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:51,005
She was a secretary
for a big-time preacher.

434
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:54,217
A bold, charismatic man who...

435
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,178
loved to talk loud and dress fancy.

436
00:27:57,261 --> 00:27:59,806
-Like you.
-Exactly.

437
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:03,351
They worked long, stressful hours and...

438
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:07,396
Well, they had a lot of laughter
in that back office.

439
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:10,900
Something was bound to happen and...

440
00:28:11,735 --> 00:28:12,861
it did.

441
00:28:13,778 --> 00:28:15,363
I was born.

442
00:28:16,781 --> 00:28:18,699
But he was married.

443
00:28:22,245 --> 00:28:24,372
And everything was good...

444
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,044
until the preacher's wife,
two years later, had a baby boy.

445
00:28:30,128 --> 00:28:31,587
A miracle child.

446
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:35,008
And everything changed.

447
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:38,344
The great Reverend Lucas

448
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:41,806
wasn't man enough
to give his first son his last name.

449
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,350
You see, I was still Willis Stryker.

450
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:45,935
But his real son...

451
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,604
was Carl Lucas.

452
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:52,817
But... here's the crazy thing.

453
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:55,569
Nobody said nothing.

454
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:57,947
And Carl and I...

455
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:01,659
we grew up best friends, but...

456
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:03,577
there was all this tension.

457
00:29:04,495 --> 00:29:05,955
You could just feel it

458
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:09,208
like a draft coming in
from under a door.

459
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,380
I just wanted him to see me.

460
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:17,842
I was a good boy.

461
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:21,595
I did well in school.

462
00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:27,101
But he always loved Carl more.

463
00:29:33,858 --> 00:29:35,734
-[indistinct radio chatter]
-[sirens wailing]

464
00:29:36,986 --> 00:29:39,572
Inspector? A word?

465
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:40,990
I'll be right back.

466
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:47,496
Some of the hostages' statements
are not matching up.

467
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,124
Most are saying that they saw
people inside shooting at Cage,

468
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,793
not the other way around.

469
00:29:53,336 --> 00:29:54,753
We might have this all wrong.

470
00:29:56,047 --> 00:29:57,256
We might.

471
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,383
We'll have time to get to the bottom
of what's going on later.

472
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:01,552
But right now,
we need to get control of this situation,

473
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,805
and we are not in control yet.

474
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:10,812
[man whimpering]

475
00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:13,481
You! Stop looking around!

476
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:23,741
-The first of the hostages are gone.
-Good.

477
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:25,576
You're not worried
about what they're gonna say?

478
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:29,497
By the time anyone figures out the truth,
Harlem's Menace will be dead

479
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,082
or I will.

480
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:33,584
I ain't testifying.
Are you?

481
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,544
[scoffs] Why would I?

482
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:39,215
Would you really want me to confirm
that you had no plan?

483
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:42,927
Think about how stupid
that would make both of us look.

484
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:45,847
Have you forgotten who you're talking to?

485
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,223
Have you?

486
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:53,021
-What about the helicopter?
-Please.

487
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:55,189
There's no way they'll agree to that.

488
00:30:55,273 --> 00:30:56,732
-I know.
-Hmm.

489
00:30:58,026 --> 00:30:59,527
[Stryker] What happened?

490
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,030
-Lopes got pushed down the stairs.
-What?

491
00:31:02,113 --> 00:31:04,073
One of the hostages passed out,

492
00:31:04,157 --> 00:31:06,200
and another one
went to go get her medication.

493
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:09,662
-Which hostage?
-The waitress from VIP.

494
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:11,705
The West Indian-lookin' chick.

495
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:18,963
Candace. God...

496
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:22,550
-Did you find the other one?
-No.

497
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:27,846
Diamondback and I
aren't finished speaking, Sugar.

498
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:30,058
So I'm gonna need y'all to fall back.

499
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:31,392
My bad.

500
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:36,272
[Shades sighs]

501
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:37,440
What?

502
00:31:38,274 --> 00:31:43,362
Candace is the one that Mariah used
to pin Cottonmouth's murder on Luke Cage.

503
00:31:43,446 --> 00:31:44,488
The other one--

504
00:31:44,572 --> 00:31:46,532
Is probably the one
who stabbed me at the clinic.

505
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:48,701
Damn it.
I knew she looked familiar.

506
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:50,494
She probably came in with Cage.

507
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:52,371
-Candace knows what Cage looks like.
-Hmm.

508
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:56,084
The other chick with him,
if she escapes...

509
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,544
Either one of them
could blow our cover story.

510
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:02,798
-They all got to go.
-Take care of it then.

511
00:32:04,342 --> 00:32:07,261
You and me,
we get out of this...

512
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:10,974
we're gonna have a long talk.

513
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:12,766
Best believe that.

514
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:15,269
Hmm.

515
00:32:17,355 --> 00:32:18,982
[Shades] Let's go. Downstairs.

516
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:30,034
Carl, Carl, Carl.

517
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:32,120
[over PA] <i>Here you go again.</i>

518
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:35,706
<i>Bobbing and weaving</i>
<i>because you're too scared to take a hit.</i>

519
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,084
It's just like I taught you in the ring.

520
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:41,629
No matter how much you duck,

521
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:44,673
eventually, you're gonna
have to knuck and buck.

522
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:48,511
<i>If you don't surrender yourself...</i>

523
00:32:49,762 --> 00:32:51,889
and Misty Knight...

524
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:56,477
I'm gonna kill a hostage
every ten minutes...

525
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,189
-starting with Damon Boone.
-[gasps]

526
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:03,526
He's not bluffing.

527
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:08,031
-I gotta take him out.
-You're walking into a trap.

528
00:33:08,114 --> 00:33:10,324
-You know that.
-I'm counting on it.

529
00:33:10,408 --> 00:33:13,702
You don't always have to fight to win.

530
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:16,497
Look, if things go south,
we are surrounded by cops.

531
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,000
I'll make sure
that they know you're innocent.

532
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:21,169
They'll know the truth, I promise.

533
00:33:21,252 --> 00:33:23,837
Don't go dying on me, Misty.

534
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:27,091
-Not on my watch.
-Hmm. That's usually his line.

535
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:28,176
[sighs]

536
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:30,428
They used that waitress, Candace,
to frame you.

537
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:32,805
[Misty scoffs] Lyin' ass.

538
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,182
Where is she?

539
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:36,350
[Claire] Upstairs with the others.

540
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:39,062
Hey.

541
00:33:40,146 --> 00:33:42,106
What if he has more
of those special bullets?

542
00:33:43,566 --> 00:33:44,858
That's a chance I'll have to take.

543
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:48,237
If I don't walk away from this,
you need to lay in the cut

544
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:50,614
until you hear from me,
Bobby Fish or Misty.

545
00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:52,533
No one else.

546
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:55,036
-You know how well I follow orders.
-I'm serious.

547
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,039
Willis plays for keeps...

548
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:01,375
especially with people
I care about the most.

549
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,338
Promise me.

550
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:09,550
I will.

551
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,136
-You have a place in mind?
-Yeah.

552
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:14,347
Be careful.

553
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:17,683
Always.

554
00:34:19,352 --> 00:34:20,519
You're so corny.

555
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:29,820
[inhales sharply]

556
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:31,239
[groaning]

557
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:39,372
Keep that right there, okay?
Arm turned up.

558
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:42,125
-Shit! [groans]
-Shh!

559
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:44,252
You could've warned me.

560
00:34:45,211 --> 00:34:46,879
Yeah, I could've.

561
00:34:50,341 --> 00:34:52,551
Talk me through what you're about to do.

562
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:57,973
Okay.
I am gonna use this dental floss...

563
00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:59,392
to tie off your...

564
00:35:00,393 --> 00:35:03,396
-hosing vein.
-I think I'm gonna throw up.

565
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:06,064
[inhales sharply]

566
00:35:06,149 --> 00:35:07,941
-[groans]
-[Claire softly] There.

567
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,904
This is gonna cut the blood supply
to your hand and your forearm.

568
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:13,864
[Misty breathing heavily]

569
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:15,449
The longer this stays in...

570
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:18,869
the higher the chances of losing your arm.

571
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:22,581
Look, I want to apologize.

572
00:35:22,665 --> 00:35:25,083
I shouldn't have lost my cool with you.

573
00:35:25,168 --> 00:35:28,171
Ah, you can't be to blame
with this kind of crazy.

574
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:31,006
Well, you're in pretty deep.

575
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:34,135
Yeah, well, trouble stalks me
like a crazy ex-boyfriend.

576
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:35,719
[chuckles]

577
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:37,763
I hear you.

578
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:41,267
You and Luke go out for coffee yet?

579
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:45,020
Uh, we haven't had time.

580
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,731
He doesn't like coffee.

581
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,484
I know.

582
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:55,030
[inhales deeply] All done.

583
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:57,991
Damn, you're good.

584
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:01,954
You're good at your job,
I'm good at mine.

585
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:07,251
[man] <i>Mariah talked to the mayor.</i>
<i>The guns are a go.</i>

586
00:36:07,335 --> 00:36:08,419
<i>Good luck, brother.</i>

587
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:15,050
Councilwoman Dillard
never ceases to amaze me.

588
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,511
Pressure...

589
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:20,931
brings the best out of certain people.

590
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,518
So... where was I?

591
00:36:24,602 --> 00:36:25,686
Together...

592
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:28,063
we were bold.

593
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,401
We stole a red Corvette,
just like the song...

594
00:36:32,485 --> 00:36:35,821
just... for a joyride.

595
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:37,406
You see, I was a Prince fan, and...

596
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:40,493
Carl was all about Michael.

597
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,705
We were so busy arguing,
we didn't even see the cop.

598
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:47,291
But Carl was a Lucas.

599
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,378
I was a Stryker.

600
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:55,258
It was over before it even began.

601
00:36:56,384 --> 00:36:58,344
[over PA] <i>When it came time</i>
<i>for sentencing,</i>

602
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:02,890
the preacher convinced the judge
to let his golden boy join the Marines.

603
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:04,225
Me?

604
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:06,769
Juvie.

605
00:37:08,271 --> 00:37:10,564
Got jumped two days in.

606
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:14,402
Boy drew a shank and...

607
00:37:15,653 --> 00:37:16,695
[grunting]

608
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,448
...I killed him in self-defense.

[grunting continues]

610
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,538
So I got sent away to hard time.

611

<i>And sweet Dana?</i>

612
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:36,674

<i>without a friend in the world.</i>

615

You see, the good Reverend Lucas...

616
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:51,855
well, he stopped caring for her
after I was gone.

617
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:53,982
<i>He was free of her...</i>

618
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:57,778
<i>and I was powerless.</i>

619
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,324
But she, oh...

620
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:03,867
Oh, she still loved him...

621
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:09,247
and... well, she wanted me
to have something of my father's.

622

<i>The story of Cain and Abel.</i>

624
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:22,845
When God asked Cain where Abel was
after he killed him...

625
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:26,682
Cain asked,
"Am I my brother's keeper?"

626
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:28,434
See...

00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:33,481

it's real.

631
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:46,744
So...

632
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:50,288
after I kill Luke Cage...

633
00:38:51,749 --> 00:38:56,795
I'm gonna stand over him

00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,819
I was sorry to hear about Dana.

700
00:44:55,403 --> 00:44:57,364
I always liked her.

701
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,576
I couldn't stand Etta.
What a bitch!

702
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,755
-[banging on door]
-[officer 1] We have lethal rounds, Cage

703
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:15,340
-We will use them.
-[Stryker] Gotta go.

704
00:45:15,423 --> 00:45:16,800
With that hostage you killed,

705
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:19,302
they're gonna shoot first
and ask questions later.

706
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:23,098
Mariah supplied the force
with some Judas 2.0s,

707
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:25,225
so they won't bounce off of you.

708
00:45:25,308 --> 00:45:27,394
-They'll stick.
-[Candace whimpers]

709
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:29,938
You gonna run, Miracle Whip?

710
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:32,858
Or you gonna save the damsel?

711
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:34,317
Willis.

712
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:35,944
Bye, Carl.

713
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:37,237
Bye, Felicia.

714
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,655
[Candace screaming]

715
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,168
[officer 1] Go, go!
[officer 2] Get in there!

716
00:45:53,796 --> 00:45:55,338
-[banging]
-[indistinct chatter]

717
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:00,218
I'm sorry, Luke.

718
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:03,138
[officer 1] Move in!
[officer 2] We have visual.

719
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:08,185
[officer 1] Hands in the air!

720
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:10,020
[officer 2] You heard him.
Don't move.

721
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:14,524
[officer 1] In the air!

722
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,532
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-What are you doing?

723
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:24,617
-You want to get out of here, right?
-Yeah.

724
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:27,704
Okay. This way.
This way.

725
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,378
[officer] I said in the air, now!

726
00:46:36,504 --> 00:46:38,048
[indistinct radio chatter]

727
00:46:44,637 --> 00:46:47,765
-Hey, you got a ride?
-Cottonmouth had three.

728
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:52,479
[indistinct chatter]

729
00:46:55,815 --> 00:46:57,484
[Ridley] It worked.

730
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:59,402
They got him.
Didn't even have to fire.

731
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,821
That's all that matters.
Those weapons are a game changer.

732
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:04,366
-Hope we never have to use them.
-[Misty] Inspector.

733
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,286
[Ridley] Are you okay?

734
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,455
Listen, Luke Cage is innocent.

735
00:47:10,538 --> 00:47:13,250
What you think you saw
is not what happened.

736
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:16,211
Why don't you focus on getting fixed up?
Let us clean up this mess.

737
00:47:16,294 --> 00:47:20,757
This mess is Willis Stryker's doing.
He's the one who shot me.

738
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,260
Listen, his name is Diamondback.

739
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:24,677
I believe you, Misty.

740
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:26,096
There are dozens
of other people to talk to.

741
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:29,141
And Luke is still wanted
for Albini's murder, Cottonmouth's murder,

742
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:31,809
-and attacking those cops.
-You are not listening to me.

743
00:47:33,145 --> 00:47:36,606
Luke Cage is innocent of everything.

744
00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:38,901
And after we have him in custody,
we'll verify it.

745
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,194
Look... I trust you.

746
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:42,654
I do.

747
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:45,490
But we have to verify.

748
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,828
The only thing that matters is the truth.

749
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,211
We got you, Detective.
Let me look at your arm.

750
00:47:59,212 --> 00:48:02,049
Listen, whatever you need to do,
you need to do it right here.

751
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:05,510
Okay? I'm not going anywhere.
Not yet.

752
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:10,473
[siren wails]

753
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:16,229
[softly] Let's go.

754
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:44,591
[man] Yo! That's Luke Cage!

755
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:46,718
-Check him out, man!
-[woman] That's him!

756
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:48,803
Yo, B! There go Luke!

757
00:48:50,638 --> 00:48:52,849
[man] We know you innocent, Luke!

758
00:49:05,403 --> 00:49:06,946
[mouthing] Go.

759
00:49:26,299 --> 00:49:28,301
[funk music playing]
