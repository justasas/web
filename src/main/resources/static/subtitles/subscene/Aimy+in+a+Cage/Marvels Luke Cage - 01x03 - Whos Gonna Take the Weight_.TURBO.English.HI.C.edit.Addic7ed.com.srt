[Misty] Well, check with those people.

- They talking?
- [Scarfe] Nah.

37
00:04:20,312 --> 00:04:23,481
"I ain't see shit." It's
the catchphrase of the day.

38
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:27,069
Classic. I should get that
trademarked. You know how many times I hear that?

39
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:30,322
- Nah. I can't hear shit either.
- [chuckles]

40
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:34,076
- The hits looked precise.
- Oh, they knew what they were doing.

41
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,453
Uh, victims said the
assailants were Spanish-speaking.

42
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:39,289
Are the victims a part
of Cottonmouth's crew?

43
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:42,584
Who knows? Computer's down. We
can run it back at the station.

44
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,170
Or get a first-person ID.

45
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:46,853

But... it's a bit much.

51
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:05,858
Well, um, we do have more...

52
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:08,193
affordable options.

53
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:12,030
Can I see the body?

54
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:14,532
I'm sorry. That body just
arrived from the morgue.

55
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,659
It still has to be prepped for viewing.

56
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:19,121
[sighs]

57
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:21,957
Look, Mr. Hunter...

58
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,500
- Pop...
- Mmm.

59
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,418
...was like a father to me.

60
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:31,008
He's my wife's
people... and she's gone now, too.

61
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,136
It's just me. I'm all he has.

62
00:05:35,512 --> 00:05:38,056
I just want to make
sure he's taken care of...

63
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,807
until I can get the
cash to pay for this.

64
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:41,559
Don't worry about it now, brother.

65
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:44,479
It's already taken care of.

66
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:49,276
Flourish is a silent way of us
treasuring the dearly departed.

67
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,611
[breathes deeply]

68
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:53,464
It's too bad you're not
in a position to give Pop

69
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:55,157
the grand homegoing he deserves.

70
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,118
The service should
match the man's integrity.

71
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:00,870
Hmm.

72
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:06,293
- Can we have the room, Joel?
- Uh, no problem, Mr. Stokes.

73
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:18,471
Me and Henry didn't see eye to eye.

74
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:22,850
But I always had his back.

75
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:27,730
He wouldn't want any
drama. Especially here.

76
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:29,583
What Pop would have
wanted is for you not to pay

77
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:32,194
for his arrangements with
bloody guilt money.

78
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:35,322
We set a parley.

79
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:37,865
- I thought your word was bond.
- It is.

80
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:42,537
A former associate of
mine was feelin' himself.

81
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,833
He's not feelin' much
of anything right now.

82
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:50,295
Doesn't matter. Pop's
death is still on you.

83
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:51,879
Step off.

84
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,173
Before you get hurt.

85
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,218
Why?

86
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,677
I'm just getting started.

87
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,096
[laughing]

88
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,183
Good to know. Hmm.

89
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:05,268
How's the job search coming?

90
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,272
- Dishwasher.
- [pats Luke]

91
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:19,782
[bell chimes]

92
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,321
I saw you standing out there earlier.

93
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:03,243
I wasn't ready to come in yet.

94
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:04,786
[Fish] Yeah, I hear you on that.

95
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:09,207
Walking in this shop is the
hardest thing I've ever done.

96
00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:14,587
[sighing] Yeah.

97
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:17,882
I mean, who's ever really ready to
see something like this, though?

98
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:34,482
[sighs]

99
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:41,031
How'd you know Pop?

100
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:44,909
We used to play chess
in Marcus Garvey Park.

101
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,455
He got too busy to play,
so I started coming here.

102
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:52,834
When you played him... who would win?

103
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:53,960
Me.

104
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,754
[chuckles]

105
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:57,898
Just 'cause the brother's dead

106
00:08:57,922 --> 00:08:59,643
don't mean I gotta
start changing the facts.

107
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:01,176
[both chuckle]

108
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:05,388
[sighs]

109
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,043
So what will happen to this place?

110
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:12,979
Ah, the bank will swoop
in and take it eventually.

111
00:09:14,106 --> 00:09:15,565
How do you know that?

112
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:20,862
Besides playing chess, I used
to do the man's taxes every year.

113
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:23,698
I know where every account
is and who's owed what.

114
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:28,328
Trust me, soon as the word
spreads that he's gone,

115
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,206
the wolves will be at the door.

116
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:35,252
- Not on my watch.
- [scoffs] You got 80 grand lying around?

117
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:38,296
'Cause that's what it's gonna
take to keep this place open.

118
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:41,174
So it's too late.

119
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:43,885
Not necessarily.

120
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:47,597
Eighty grand isn't just gonna
come fallin' out of the sky.

121
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,350
What should we do? Talk to the bank?

122
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:53,103
Well, we have a little time.

123
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:55,498
No one's gonna be asking
questions and shutting things down

124
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:57,774
as long as things are paid for on time.

125
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,278
Why do you think so many
people get Grandma's house

126
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:05,157
without having to fill out
extra paperwork or hire a lawyer?

127
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:09,411
You pay the bills, people
shut up and get on with things.

128
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:14,666
So what you thinkin' now?

129
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:19,754
As much I'd like to put my
foot in Cottonmouth's behind,

130
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,673
I need to put my hands in his pockets.

131
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:23,234
That's how you hurt someone like that.

132
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:27,011
Robbin' Cottonmouth was what caused
all this trouble in the first place.

133
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:29,681
[exhales deeply]

134
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:35,019
You're absolutely right.

135
00:10:36,313 --> 00:10:37,897
I'm not gonna touch him.

136
00:10:38,856 --> 00:10:40,400
Not the way I should.

137
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,321
Since I can't touch the king,

138
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:47,282
I'm gonna take his queen, his knights...

139
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:49,617
his rooks...

140
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:53,913
I'm knocking all his
pieces off the board.

141
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:56,833
Where you goin' now?

142
00:10:58,335 --> 00:10:59,961
Check these fools.

143
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,304
Three friends. Grade school tight.

144
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:11,389
Playground tight.

145
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:14,642
All-City in basketball in a
town where that really matters.

146
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:17,312
So what happens?

147
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:19,188
Y'all don't go pro.

148
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:22,650
One of you... starts
working for Cottonmouth...

149
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:25,487
makes some money, sees
a slick opportunity,

150
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,113
and you guys go for it.

151
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:32,577
You were part of the heist, right?

152
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,998
And the shootout at the barber
shop was payback for the heist.

153
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:38,875
So, what happened to your man Dante?

154
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:43,796
Shameek killed Dante.

155
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,259
You admit to that?

156
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:50,094
I admit what?

157
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:54,474
I mean, I was assuming Shameek
did it. 'Cause I know I didn't.

158
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:55,933
Never assume anything, kiddo.

159
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:58,395
Too bad your boys aren't
here to back up your story.

160
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:01,981
Maybe he's telling the truth.

161
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:04,901
Let's say he is.

162
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:06,653
Shameek sees all that cash and says,

163
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:09,781
"Oh, shit, there's no way I'm
splitting that three ways." So...

164
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:11,032
- Boom!
- [gun fires]

165
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:14,327
Now it's a two-way
split instead of three.

166
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:16,288
Shameek gets caught with
his share of the cash.

167
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:19,499
- By Cottonmouth, I'm assuming.
- Mmm-hmm.

168
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:22,669
Who?

169
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,087
[both chuckle]

170
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:27,799
- "Who?"
- Cottonmouth.

171
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,967
The man you stole from.

172
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:31,218
Dante's former boss.

173
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:34,847
The man who shot up Pop's Barber Shop

174
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:38,435
and killed a good
man trying to get at you.

175
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,817
Hey, look, we don't want you, Chico.

176
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,285
We want the people who killed

177
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,763
Shameek and who shot
up the barber shop.

178
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,991
Testify.

179
00:12:55,076 --> 00:12:57,412
Do something good for somebody for once.

180
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:05,545
[breathing shakily] I
can't help you with that.

181
00:13:10,342 --> 00:13:12,760
Hey, look, can y'all
please take off these handcuffs?

182
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:15,347
I'm the victim here. Me.

183
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,850
Talk to us. Talk to a grand jury.

184
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:22,520
You can save lives, Wilfredo.

185
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:25,064
Step up.

186
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:32,029
[grunts]

187
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:36,909
Well, the streets will handle it.

188
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:39,746
Just like they always do.

189
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:41,539
[exhales deeply]

190
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:46,878
[Chico breathing heavily]

191
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:50,840
[gasps]

192
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,260
Yeah, they will.

193
00:14:13,946 --> 00:14:15,281
What are you doing?

194
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:19,869
[Scarfe] Letting you go.

195
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:21,371
Like you said...

196
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:24,624
you're the victim...

197
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:27,043
not a suspect, right?

198
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:29,003
So, go.

199
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:31,172
Wherever.

200
00:14:32,298 --> 00:14:34,759
You got no clothes, you got no money.

201
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:37,512
And your friends are gonna be
looking to finish the job, right?

202
00:14:38,596 --> 00:14:40,473
But you're a man.

203
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:43,810
You're gonna be just fine, Chico.

204
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,565
Chico is the man.

205
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,237
Pop was a friend.

206
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,992
- He deserves the best.
- Yeah.

207
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:02,620
I see you've been busy.

208
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,752
What about this man right here?

209
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:13,590
[Stokes] Tone?

210
00:15:16,258 --> 00:15:17,635
I had to let him go.

211
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:20,722
Nothing humbles a man like gravity.

212
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:22,682
Hmm.

213
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:25,059
Remember...

214
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,979
same as always.

215
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:29,689
This body can't exist.

216
00:15:35,987 --> 00:15:37,947
- What body?
- [chuckles]

217
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:41,283
- My man.
- [grunts]

218
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:50,752
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

219
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:56,215
[chuckles]

220
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,261
And there's the bartender.

221
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:02,429
Luke Cage.

222
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:06,601
Right in the center...
of the nightclub...

223
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:08,978
of the barber shop...

224
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:10,605
of everything.

225
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:14,692
- Where you going?
- To see a friend.

226
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:16,068
Mmm-mmm.

227
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:21,032
Woman, what's your
problem? I've done nothing.

228
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:24,243
There's only one person who
worked for both Pop and Cottonmouth,

229
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:25,995
and that's you.

230
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:27,371
In the past 72 hours,

231
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:31,083
three people connected are
dead. Shameek, Dante and Pop.

232
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,128
And there was another shooting this
morning tied to all of this.

233
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:35,331
Would you call that nothing?

234
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:36,756
And all that's on me?

235
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:41,260
Why don't y'all find Pop's killer instead
of being all up in my business?

236
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:45,640
Your business and our
investigation are one and the same.

237
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:53,022
You know where I live.

238
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:58,736
You wanna work some things out, hmm?

239
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:01,698
We can always do it there.

240
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:05,034
You can even bring handcuffs this time.

241
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:16,963
[Scarfe sighs]

242
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:18,047
[Misty sighs]

243
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:20,663
[Luke] <i>You don't have to worry.</i>

244
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:22,635
Cottonmouth ain't trying to kill you.

245
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:26,639
[scoffs] Are you kidding? Were
you at the same shootout as I was?

246
00:17:26,723 --> 00:17:28,307
It was his boy, Tone.

247
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,101
Tone acted on his own.

248
00:17:30,184 --> 00:17:33,354
And... he died on his own, too.

249
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:35,397
He's cleanin' up and I
ain't trying to be next.

250
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:38,818
Cottonmouth has his cash.
That's all he cares about.

251
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:41,613
Hell, you right about that.

252
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:44,699
Doesn't matter how many
people had to die to get it, huh?

253
00:17:44,782 --> 00:17:46,342
Wasn't like the money fell in your lap.

254
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,245
Your hands have blood all over them.

255
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:51,497
That don't matter. I'm out.

256
00:17:52,957 --> 00:17:55,752
- I've caused enough trouble.
- More than enough.

257
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:58,921
Pop signed his death warrant the
minute he decided to help you.

258
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:01,687
Well, it's the other
way around, ain't it?

259
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:05,427
The bullet that killed
Pops probably bounced off you.

260
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:09,098
You're one of them, ain't you?

261
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:13,477
You don't know nothin'.

262
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,396
I know this isn't my fault.

263
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:19,651
Parley or no parley, this
is on Cottonmouth.

264
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:25,740
[inhales deeply] So help me hurt him.

265
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:34,331
What do you want?

266
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:37,584
Before you guys decided to rob him...

267
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:41,547
how much did Dante tell you about
Cottonmouth's operations?

268
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:44,175
Everything.

269
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:46,427
Cottonmouth sells guns.

270
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,055
Mariah, his cousin, runs the banks.

271
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:52,141
- Where does all that money go?
- Everywhere you could think.

272
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:56,103
They got drops and stash
houses across the city.

273
00:18:56,187 --> 00:19:00,274
Apartments, sham
businesses, street pushers.

274
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:02,193
I mean, they got it locked in.

275
00:19:02,276 --> 00:19:04,236
Is there a final spot?

276
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,487
A central bank?

277
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,702
[Chico] <i>They got a
plan if shit goes down.</i>

278
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:14,496
<i>Everything goes to Crispus Attucks.</i>

279
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:19,626
<i>I even heard they got this
locked room, like a vault,</i>

280
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:22,046
<i>right in the middle of the whole joint.</i>

281
00:19:24,924 --> 00:19:28,845
So why rob a gun shipment if it
was all just about a cash grab?

282
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:33,140
[scoffs] Are you crazy?

283
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:37,687
Man, Crispus Attucks is like a fortress.

284
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:40,940
I mean, they got concrete walls,

285
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:44,193
cats with machine guns,
machetes, dark hallways...

286
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:47,113
One entrance, one exit.

287
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:49,991
[stutters] It's like
a beehive of misery.

288
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:52,409
That place is a suicide
mission, for real.

289
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:58,750
Did Dante tell you where any
of these other stash houses are?

290
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:03,379
Yeah. I mean, yeah, we scoped a few out.

291
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,716
There was a shooting this morning.

292
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,760
A couple of Cottonmouth's
people got hit.

293
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:11,595
Yeah. I mean, the cops
got the guns at the heist.

294
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,223
And my guess is that's Domingo and them,

295
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:17,226
hollering at Cottonmouth to
let him know they ain't happy.

296
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:20,437
If they hit him a few more times...

297
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:23,983
Cottonmouth might just have to move
everything to Crispus to keep it safe.

298
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:29,196
[scoffs] You gonna try to
convince Domingo to hit 'em up?

299
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:31,240
No.

300
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:34,618
I don't need Domingo to be Domingo.

301
00:20:36,954 --> 00:20:39,123
I can do that all by myself.

302
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,102
<i>- [man] All right, sound check.
- [soul music playing]</i>

303
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:43,878
<i>Let's hit it.</i>

304
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,963
[Charles Bradley singing]

305
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:23,334
- [door opens forcefully]
- Oh, shit.

306
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,002
[men grunting]

307
00:21:49,026 --> 00:21:50,652
[Luke grunts]

308
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:25,271
- [officer 1] You see this?
- [officer 2] Yeah. Why leave the cash?

309
00:22:56,093 --> 00:22:58,137
[clattering]

310
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:02,808
[glass shattering]

311
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,614
- [clattering]
- [glass shattering]

312
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:27,333
[Misty] Hey.

313
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,001
[woman speaking indistinctly on radio]

314
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:30,836
Hey...

315
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,629
you okay?

316
00:23:34,006 --> 00:23:35,591
What the hell happened here?

317
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:40,596
Some dude in a hoodie rolled through.

318
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,764
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

319
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:47,228
"Rolled through"? Did you see his face?

320
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:49,813
Hey...

321
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:52,358
what can you tell me about him?

322
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:57,738
He was fine.

323
00:24:00,616 --> 00:24:01,908
[scoffs]

324
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,873
What do you mean everything is fine?

325
00:24:07,956 --> 00:24:09,500
Like I said, it's fine.

326
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:14,380
You've got welders reinforcing doors
to rooms I don't even go into.

327
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:15,547
What are they doing?

328
00:24:16,507 --> 00:24:18,759
We got hit today. We
need to take precautions.

329
00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:22,763
Get the bars down. Place looks
like a goddamn prison now.

330
00:24:22,846 --> 00:24:24,890
And what do you mean "we"?

331
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:28,560
- You got hit again this morning?
- Four of my stash houses were hit today.

332
00:24:28,644 --> 00:24:31,272
Fort Knox is my contingency plan.

333
00:24:31,355 --> 00:24:33,482
It's always been the
plan if shit goes down.

334
00:24:33,565 --> 00:24:36,360
That is not a plan. That's a reaction.

335
00:24:36,443 --> 00:24:39,238
You ever hear of not
putting all your eggs in one basket?

336
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:40,781
Look at it.

337
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:42,866
One way in, one way out.

338
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,494
Sight lines as far as the eye can see.

339
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:48,622
Ain't nobody goin' up in the
projects. We got that shit on lockdown.

340
00:24:48,705 --> 00:24:51,417
They are not projects. It's
going to be a community

341
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,461
as soon as I get the rest of the
funding and we start our construction.

342
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:56,922
[laughing]

343
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:58,882
That's just spin.

344
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:02,386
It's a front, Mariah. It's
always been a front.

345
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,263
It's real.

346
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:07,641
This affordable housing initiative
is going to change things, man.

347
00:25:07,724 --> 00:25:10,269
Let me worry about the street shit.

348
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:12,854
- You're just the laundromat for the money.
- Uh, no, I'm not.

349
00:25:12,938 --> 00:25:15,441
I'm the face on the money.

350
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:18,527
So what's that make me? Loose change?

351
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,779
You are a strong asset,

352
00:25:20,862 --> 00:25:24,658
whose reckless
actions are often a liability.

353
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:29,205
Crispus Attucks is real, Cornell.

354
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:31,707
Nothing I do is a hustle.

355
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:36,420
I sincerely care about
what happens up here.

356
00:25:36,503 --> 00:25:39,840
The only way to save
Harlem is to do it legally...

357
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:42,676
and fortify it against
the real invaders.

358
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,636
[laughs] Whatever.

359
00:25:45,554 --> 00:25:48,640
It's the same as it always
was, and you know it.

360
00:25:48,724 --> 00:25:50,392
Keep livin' in that fantasy land.

361
00:25:50,476 --> 00:25:53,979
Well, it has got to be a
fantasy before it become a reality.

362
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:57,816
I mean, look around.

363
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:01,112
Mama Mabel loved this place.

364
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:05,991
It was her political connections got
that jungle gym over there built.

365
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:09,578
[laughs] We doin' this for jungle gyms?

366
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:13,124
Those political connections

367
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:17,586
were just freaky old men she blackmailed
to push the paperwork through.

368
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:19,963
Why do you think she
blackmailed those politicians?

369
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:23,592
It was all to serve a greater good.

370
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:25,344
Have you forgotten that?

371
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:29,265
No.

372
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:35,687
This building may be
your bank right now.

373
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:38,690
But the Crispus
Attucks, Madam C.J. Walker,

374
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:42,194
Adam Clayton Powell, Shirley
Chisholm complexes

375
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:45,572
will be vibrant
communities reflecting the change

376
00:26:45,656 --> 00:26:49,160
that's gonna keep Harlem
black and us in the green.

377
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:52,913
You focus on the
black, I'll protect our green.

378
00:26:54,206 --> 00:26:56,417
Fort Knox is central to that.

379
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,126
Just need to be ready.

380
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,547
I stay ready, baby.

381
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:27,155
How you doing, Ms.
Mariah? Good to see you.

382
00:27:32,994 --> 00:27:34,538
[Scarfe] <i>Oh, it's gonna work.</i>

383
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:38,250
See, that's the thing about
a dude like Chico.

384
00:27:39,585 --> 00:27:40,586
Trick is...

385
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:43,714
you gotta get inside his head. Uh-huh.

386
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:47,509
You gotta make him
believe that he needs us.

387
00:27:47,593 --> 00:27:49,636
That's the whole trick.

388
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,640
And then... you give him
the illusion of freedom.

389
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:56,268
Hey.

390
00:27:57,769 --> 00:27:59,313
You didn't hear a word I just said.

391
00:28:00,647 --> 00:28:02,524
I'm sorry.

392
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:05,569
- I can't stop thinking about Pop.
- Hmm.

393
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,697
You knew him forever, huh?

394
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,866
Since I was nine.

395
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:12,784
He was the reason I played basketball.

396
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:16,705
- He was your coach?
- No. I never saw him outside the shop.

397
00:28:16,788 --> 00:28:19,625
My dad used to drag me with him when
he went to go get his hair cut.

398
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,378
- Daddy's girl.
- Always.

399
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:25,756
They would sit around all the
time and just argue about basketball.

400
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,008
Larry Bird. Kevin McHale.

401
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:30,219
- Robert Parish...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

402
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:31,303
Celtics?

403
00:28:32,304 --> 00:28:35,849
My dad is a Celtics fan.

404
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:39,185
Please, please tell
me that's not the case.

405
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,772
- The most progressive team in NBA history.
- The Celtics?

406
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:45,108
The first black head
coach with Bill Russell.

407
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:47,694
K.C. Jones as head coach during
the height of the '80s

408
00:28:47,778 --> 00:28:49,613
with Bird and McHale. Come on.

409
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:51,573
Now I got it all figured out.

410
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:52,824
See...

411
00:28:52,908 --> 00:28:55,411
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend

412
00:28:55,494 --> 00:28:56,953
because you love the brothers,

413
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:58,431
and not many brothers
can get with a girl

414
00:28:58,455 --> 00:29:01,417
who carry a gun and kick their
ass. But that's not the reason.

415
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,919
- Oh, so now you an expert?
- The reason is...

416
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:06,463
you're a Celtics fan living
in New York City. [chuckles]

417
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:08,632
I like the Pistons.

418
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:10,091
- Oh, shit!
- [laughs]

419
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:14,638
I would hear Pop and my dad argue
so much about basketball,

420
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:16,014
it made me wanna play.

421
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:17,808
So I did.

422
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:21,603
Pop would complain about
players who couldn't go left or right,

423
00:29:21,687 --> 00:29:23,855
or box out, or hustle back on D.

424
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:25,524
So, I did.

425
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:27,609
Sounds like he taught you well.

426
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,280
I was playing college
ball before I realized

427
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:34,783
how much watching games at the
shop and those arguments shaped me.

428
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:37,744
[sighs] A lot of people loved this guy.

429
00:29:37,828 --> 00:29:41,707
Even when it was
wild during the summers...

430
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,502
shootouts every other
day... the shop was safe.

431
00:29:46,545 --> 00:29:48,672
Nobody ever said anything.

432
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:50,549
It just was.

433
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:51,883
Always.

434
00:29:53,134 --> 00:29:55,053
Until...

435
00:29:55,136 --> 00:29:58,432
- Until what?
- Until Luke Cage started workin' there.

436
00:30:02,394 --> 00:30:04,313
You got a real problem with this guy.

437
00:30:05,564 --> 00:30:09,860
Well, maybe, you shouldn't have jumped
in the sack with him so quickly.

438
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:13,238
- [scoffs]
- [chuckles]

439
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:15,198
How soon did it happen?

440
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:18,635
A couple days after you were
undercover at the Harlem's Paradise?

441
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:22,831
Same night.

442
00:30:22,914 --> 00:30:25,376
[chuckles] Damn, girl!

443
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,669
[chuckles] His place or yours?

444
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:29,004
Shut up.

445
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:34,426
Look, I'm telling you, there is
just something about this dude.

446
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,052
- I can't put my finger on it.
- Mmm.

447
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:37,905
Sounds like you put a lot
more than your finger on him.

448
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:40,474
- Don't make me choke you out.
- Hey!

449
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:42,518
Watch the tofu supreme!

450
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:45,061
- [laughing]
- And watch the hair!

451
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,938
This takes time.

452
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:48,815
It's too much product.

453
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:03,622
[Domingo] Damn.

454
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:10,962
You can't really appreciate this
place till the lights are on.

455
00:31:11,046 --> 00:31:12,464
Fall back, Zip.

456
00:31:17,386 --> 00:31:18,845
Domingo's right.

457
00:31:21,222 --> 00:31:23,349
When the lights are on...

458
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:25,852
you really can see
things for what they are.

459
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:28,980
[speaking Spanish]

460
00:31:30,482 --> 00:31:32,943
- I got some verdad for you.
- Hmm.

461
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:35,446
We got hit. And it was you.

462
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:40,784
You didn't have to send no
mercs to break up my organization.

463
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:43,579
I think somebody's pulling your chain...

464
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:45,330
and using my name to do it.

465
00:31:46,457 --> 00:31:50,251
'Cause if my people were
to hit you, you'd be dead.

466
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:51,336
[speaks Spanish]

467
00:32:00,637 --> 00:32:01,763
[chuckles]

468
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:04,390
You know what a plover is, Cornell?

469
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,234
Plover bird sits inside
the crocodile's mouth.

470
00:32:14,317 --> 00:32:15,611
This bird ain't stupid.

471
00:32:16,778 --> 00:32:21,492
The plover picks scraps of
meat out of the crocodile's teeth,

472
00:32:21,575 --> 00:32:24,327
helping the crocodile avoid infection.

473
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,914
And the plover... he gets a free meal.

474
00:32:27,998 --> 00:32:29,625
[Stokes chuckles]

475
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:33,336
Where's this analogy
going, Animal Planet? [laughs]

476
00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:39,342
You're a plover.

477
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:43,472
I'm a crocodile.

478
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:47,851
You peddle your
guns, picking up my scraps.

479
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:52,648
And I allow it.

480
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:02,282
So you admit raidin' me?

481
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:03,534
[scoffs]

482
00:33:07,203 --> 00:33:09,643
- You think I need to bust your shit up?
- [wrapper crinkling]

483
00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:16,462
You broke your word, Cornell.

484
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:20,884
How does Diamondback feel about that?

485
00:33:26,973 --> 00:33:30,936
You didn't think I knew... who
your supplier was that night, huh?

486
00:33:32,854 --> 00:33:35,649
I was just checking to see if
you would tell me the truth.

487
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:44,533
I want a refund.

488
00:33:44,616 --> 00:33:47,368
- [scoffs]
- Or the product that was promised me.

489
00:33:47,452 --> 00:33:50,455
[laughing] Oh, Domingo.

490
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,293
There ain't no return policy.

491
00:33:55,376 --> 00:33:57,420
This ain't L.L. Bean.

492
00:33:57,503 --> 00:33:58,504
[scoffs]

493
00:34:06,387 --> 00:34:08,682

495
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:27,367
Nice.

496
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:34,958
So? What's poppin'?

497
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:41,047
Better get that Spanish dictionary.

498
00:34:42,758 --> 00:34:45,594
Domingo Colon just declared war on us.

499
00:34:58,523 --> 00:35:00,275
[indistinct chatter]

500
00:35:22,547 --> 00:35:24,465

00:39:13,444 --> 00:39:15,488
[Scarfe] <i>In the duffel
bags. It's a lot of money.</i>

526
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:17,157
Just give me a second.

527
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:19,492
[Scarfe] <i>Millions.</i>

528
00:39:28,877 --> 00:39:30,086
It's you.

529
00:39:35,383 --> 00:39:37,552
Damn it, you're doing it again. [sighs]

530
00:39:37,635 --> 00:39:40,096
Damn it, you just
broke my concentration.

531
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,558
As usual, your priorities
are all out of whack.

532
00:39:44,642 --> 00:39:49,022
Now, you're looking at a
picture of an empty husk of a building.

533
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:51,566
I'm looking at millions
of dollars of contraband.

534
00:39:51,649 --> 00:39:53,944
You know this money belongs
to Cottonmouth.

535
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:55,361
- Allegedly.
- [sighs]

536
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:57,155
Allegedly.

537
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:00,909
Thing I can't figure out...

538
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:03,328
why would somebody...

539
00:40:03,411 --> 00:40:05,330
go through all this hell outside,

540
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:08,291
cause all this mayhem, and
then leave the money behind?

541
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:14,214
[sighs] To take it off the streets.

542
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:16,257
Once it's logged,

543
00:40:16,341 --> 00:40:19,302
whoever it belongs to doesn't
have access to it anymore.

544
00:40:19,385 --> 00:40:21,512
That's quite a message someone's
trying to send.

545
00:40:21,596 --> 00:40:25,016
All that gunfire and no bodies.

546
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,268
Oh, you got that right.

547
00:40:27,352 --> 00:40:31,064
They are nobodies. [sighing]

548
00:40:31,147 --> 00:40:33,774
I mean, no bodies.

549
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,360
Not one.

550
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:39,739
Some big black dude in a
hoodie takes on direct bullet shots...

551
00:40:39,822 --> 00:40:42,075
slaps, punches and pulls
people all over the place

552
00:40:42,158 --> 00:40:43,868
and doesn't kill a single one?

553
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:45,661
That doesn't seem strange to you?

554
00:40:46,371 --> 00:40:48,748
It's like this person wanted
us to shut this place down.

555
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:50,333
Who cares?

556
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:53,044
What?

557
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:54,712
I'm serious.

558
00:40:56,464 --> 00:40:57,590
Who cares?

559
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:02,762
How many investigations, from the
time we put boots on the ground,

560
00:41:02,845 --> 00:41:05,681
begin and end in these projects?

561
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:06,975
Dozens.

562
00:41:07,058 --> 00:41:08,809
And now somebody comes along

563
00:41:08,893 --> 00:41:14,149
and wants to clean up a year's
worth of patrol work by himself?

564
00:41:14,232 --> 00:41:17,235
[stammers] I don't see
anything wrong with that.

565
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:19,029
A vigilante?

566
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:21,072
Yeah, there's something wrong with that.

567
00:41:21,156 --> 00:41:24,575
It's anarchy, a complete
breakdown of the system.

568
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:26,869
There are rules and
regulations to what we do.

569
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:32,125
Yeah, and lawyers... and
paperwork and excuses.

570
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:35,836
Other than mopping up blood...

571
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,632
and arresting the same
piece of shit over and over,

572
00:41:39,715 --> 00:41:41,801
you know, not much we can do as cops.

573
00:41:41,884 --> 00:41:44,470
Jesus, Scarfe, whose side are you on?

574
00:41:44,554 --> 00:41:46,431
I saw the incident up close.

575
00:41:46,514 --> 00:41:49,975
What we can do as
cops, what we can't do.

576
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:53,479
Now, unless this
sidearm that I'm wearing

577
00:41:53,563 --> 00:41:56,482
suddenly turns into some
kind of magic hammer...

578
00:41:56,566 --> 00:41:58,193
this whole job is irrelevant. [scoffs]

579
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:01,654
They have no training.

580
00:42:01,737 --> 00:42:03,656
No responsibility.

581
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:05,575
You have to know what you're doing.

582
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:10,246
They don't have the right to just
start meting out justice. Come on.

583
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:13,708
Some guy in a hoodie...

584
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:17,587
hits various gun-running
spots around the city today?

585
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,004
I think that's wonderful.

586
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:20,340
I think we should thank him.

587
00:42:20,423 --> 00:42:22,633
- For doing our job?
- Exactly.

588
00:42:22,717 --> 00:42:24,885
I don't like paperwork...

589
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:26,650
but I'd rather get a
paper cut on my finger

590
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:28,306
than a bullet in my ass.

591
00:42:28,389 --> 00:42:31,184
Look at... Look at
all them rounds. Look.

592
00:42:31,267 --> 00:42:33,037
You really wanna be in
the middle of all this?

593
00:42:33,061 --> 00:42:35,688
And for what? [stutters]
For a chicken banquet dinner

594
00:42:35,771 --> 00:42:38,274
and a photo with the mayor
as a reward? [scoffing]

595
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:39,942
- Hell, no.
- Wow.

596
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:45,240
You are a credit to the badge, Scarfe.

597
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:46,949
[cell phone ringing]

598
00:42:48,826 --> 00:42:49,994
Hello.

599
00:42:50,828 --> 00:42:52,247
Glad to hear it.

600
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,209
Where?

601
00:43:00,463 --> 00:43:01,756
We'll be there.

602
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,549
- It has to be you.
- [Scarfe] Uh-huh.

603
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:05,635
I'll pick you up out front.

604
00:43:07,512 --> 00:43:08,513
That was Chico.

605
00:43:10,014 --> 00:43:11,974
He wants to talk, needs a pick up.

606
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:15,728
- This is where you say, "I told you so"?
- Somethin' like that.

607
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:18,606
- You coming?
- No.

608
00:43:18,689 --> 00:43:22,402
Your guy in the hoodie left
plenty for the real cops to clean up.

609
00:43:22,485 --> 00:43:26,114
I'll get Chico to give up
the ghost. We got rapport.

610
00:43:26,197 --> 00:43:28,283
Yeah, you're all about rapport.

611
00:43:28,366 --> 00:43:30,368
Oh, you know that.

612
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:31,536
See you when I see you.

613
00:43:33,121 --> 00:43:34,164
[scoffs]

614
00:43:34,872 --> 00:43:37,292
Did you see the guy who attacked you?

615
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:40,253
[tsks] Man, I ain't see shit.

616
00:43:40,336 --> 00:43:42,588
I really need that trademark.

617
00:43:48,469 --> 00:43:50,971
[ship horn blaring]

618
00:43:51,055 --> 00:43:54,350
[Scarfe] I was always
a Jumbo's guy myself.

619
00:43:54,434 --> 00:43:58,103
Used to love Willie
Burger back in the day.

620
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:02,317
But I can't give up
the fries. [chuckling]

621
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,526
True.

622
00:44:05,486 --> 00:44:07,197
Where's Detective Knight?

623
00:44:08,698 --> 00:44:09,865
Busy.

624
00:44:12,868 --> 00:44:14,870
I suppose you heard about...

625
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:17,457
what happened at the
Crispus Attucks today.

626
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:22,337
That's why I called.

627
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:26,757
It's my turn.

628
00:44:28,843 --> 00:44:30,511
Your turn for what?

629
00:44:31,971 --> 00:44:34,182
Tell you everything.

630
00:44:38,853 --> 00:44:40,187
I'm listening.

631
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:44,817
Somebody told me...

632
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,152
we owe it to Pops to come forward.

633
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:51,616
He did his part.

634
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:53,326
I gotta do mine.

635
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,123
I'm ready to talk.

636
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:02,502
Cottonmouth.

637
00:45:03,586 --> 00:45:05,296
I'll name names, dates.

638
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:07,923
The whole nine.

639
00:45:12,803 --> 00:45:13,971
Pop...

640
00:45:15,055 --> 00:45:18,393
he used to always talk to
me about responsibility.

641
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:22,146
About being a man.

642
00:45:24,899 --> 00:45:26,609
Standing up straight.

643
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:31,989
He told me to take charge.

644
00:45:32,907 --> 00:45:35,451
Forward, never backwards.

645
00:45:38,413 --> 00:45:40,873
[stutters]

646
00:45:40,956 --> 00:45:43,501
Luke Cage, I don't even... [gasps]

647
00:45:43,584 --> 00:45:45,586
[Scarfe grunting]

648
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,338
[choking]

649
00:46:03,604 --> 00:46:05,648
[panting]

650
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:12,112
[sniffs]

651
00:46:46,188 --> 00:46:47,773
[glass shattering]

652
00:46:47,857 --> 00:46:50,943
- $7 million!
- Cornell!

653
00:46:51,026 --> 00:46:53,404
You don't wanna be in my
face right now, Mariah!

654
00:46:53,488 --> 00:46:56,073
If anybody should be breaking
shit, it should be me!

655
00:46:56,156 --> 00:46:58,784
They hit my office. My office!

656
00:46:58,868 --> 00:47:00,953
They took damn near every penny I got,

657
00:47:01,036 --> 00:47:02,556
and you up here talkin' about an office?

658
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,540
You can always make more money.

659
00:47:04,624 --> 00:47:07,292
I can't get my name back.

660
00:47:07,377 --> 00:47:11,213
And somebody is gonna
start asking questions.

661
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:14,425
- Step off, Cornell!
- Shut up, Black Mariah.

662
00:47:15,885 --> 00:47:17,428
That's my shit to break!

663
00:47:18,345 --> 00:47:22,099
You better shut up, or I will
cut your color-struck ass.

664
00:47:22,182 --> 00:47:23,225
Call me that again.

665
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,061
Uh, Mr. Stokes?

666
00:47:27,187 --> 00:47:28,564
Spit it out.

667
00:47:28,648 --> 00:47:31,817
There's... There's a
detective here to see you.

668
00:47:33,444 --> 00:47:34,862
The cops are here?

669
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:41,827
- Detective.
- Well, I've had warmer receptions.

670
00:47:41,911 --> 00:47:46,248
What's the use of having a pig on
payroll if you can't get no early intel?

671
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:49,419
[scoffing] Oh, I've got
your intel. Swinging.

672
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:51,003
[chuckles softly]

673
00:47:55,382 --> 00:47:56,801
Oh, yeah.

674
00:48:00,555 --> 00:48:02,932
[pouring drink]

675
00:48:05,768 --> 00:48:06,894
[grunts]

676
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:14,652
Anything related to how I
lost 80% of my cash reserves?

677
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:17,697
Maybe. Maybe.

678
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,579
In my trunk, you will
find a deceased individual.

679
00:48:24,662 --> 00:48:27,289
One Wilfredo "Chico" Diaz.

680
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:29,333
I'm sure your homie down
at Spurlock's Mortuary

681
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:30,751
can hook you up.

682
00:48:32,252 --> 00:48:34,464
So that's off your
plate. You're welcome.

683
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:40,427
What else you got for me?

684
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:41,721
What else I got for ya?

685
00:48:42,513 --> 00:48:45,475
What else I got... Oh, well...

686
00:48:45,558 --> 00:48:48,393
I know who's been busting
up your shit all day,

687
00:48:48,478 --> 00:48:52,064
and who raided the
projects... all by himself.

688
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,069
Don't imagine you know anything about...

689
00:48:58,571 --> 00:49:00,823
Luke Cage, do you?

690
00:49:01,532 --> 00:49:02,908
Luke Cage?

691
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:06,787
That's who did all this shit?

692
00:49:06,871 --> 00:49:08,498
That's what I'm telling you.

693
00:49:09,707 --> 00:49:13,460
And as a proud NYPD detective...

694
00:49:13,544 --> 00:49:15,921
see, my partner and I, well...

695
00:49:16,005 --> 00:49:17,757
we're accountable for each other.

696
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,093
We need to know each
other's whereabouts, 24/7.

697
00:49:21,176 --> 00:49:24,680
And thanks to my
partner's GPS on her phone,

698
00:49:24,764 --> 00:49:27,474
I got Mr. Cage's home address.

699
00:49:27,558 --> 00:49:28,684
And I will give it to you...

700
00:49:28,768 --> 00:49:31,186
if you're a good boy.

701
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,479
[chuckles]

702
00:49:34,732 --> 00:49:35,983
Virginia Slim...

703
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,194
you just might prove to be useful.

704
00:49:39,278 --> 00:49:41,071
Virginia Slim, what's that?

705
00:49:41,155 --> 00:49:43,699
What else do you
call a skinny white bitch?

706
00:49:43,783 --> 00:49:45,159
[laughs]

707
00:49:46,243 --> 00:49:49,121
Time for me to go
holler at the dishwasher.

708
00:49:49,204 --> 00:49:50,330
Personally.

709
00:49:52,374 --> 00:49:55,628
Don't want to know the
details. Just get it done.

710
00:49:57,797 --> 00:50:00,049
[music playing faintly]

711
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:11,602
[grunts]

712
00:50:13,062 --> 00:50:14,271
[door closes]

713
00:50:15,189 --> 00:50:16,774
Goddamn, negro.

714
00:50:17,942 --> 00:50:20,319
You all right? What happened
to you? You get hit by a bus?

715
00:50:21,612 --> 00:50:23,405
Swear jar.

716
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:24,489
You cursed.

717
00:50:24,574 --> 00:50:28,661
Swear jar? Come on, man. I...

718
00:50:28,744 --> 00:50:31,163
All right, look, I don't
have anything on me now.

719
00:50:41,591 --> 00:50:42,800
[Luke] Yeah, you do.

720
00:50:45,052 --> 00:50:47,722
Now you've got
change that can make change.

721
00:50:49,765 --> 00:50:52,643
- [sighs]
- What the hell did you do?

722
00:50:53,978 --> 00:50:56,814
Oh, can you forget the
swear jar for a minute?

723
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:00,400
What the...

724
00:51:08,283 --> 00:51:10,410
Where'd all this money come from?

725
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,206
Bank's not worried about
it... neither should you.

726
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,251
Use it for this.

727
00:51:19,294 --> 00:51:21,213
You ain't gotta tell me twice.

728
00:51:21,296 --> 00:51:23,841
Ask no questions, tell no lies.

729
00:51:23,924 --> 00:51:27,052
I'll call some people and we
get started on this in here.

730
00:51:28,262 --> 00:51:29,513
Good.

731
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,683
I see you been at it.

732
00:51:32,767 --> 00:51:33,768
[scoffs] Yeah.

733
00:51:34,476 --> 00:51:35,686
You, too.

734
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,275
Why haven't you gone home yet?

735
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:43,110
[sighs]

736
00:51:43,193 --> 00:51:45,821
Couldn't leave this
place lookin' so bad.

737
00:51:45,905 --> 00:51:48,908
That was the thing about Pops.
He had a lot of pride in detail.

738
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:52,787
Like that gold leaf window with
the Pop's Barber Shop logo?

739
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:56,248
[chuckles] I polished it every day.

740
00:51:57,166 --> 00:52:00,377
P-O-P. Had to
be spotless.

741
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,171
[chuckling]

742
00:52:02,254 --> 00:52:04,965
First thing Pop said
when he hired me was,

743
00:52:05,049 --> 00:52:07,301
"You do windows, brother."

744
00:52:07,384 --> 00:52:09,762
- That wasn't no question.
- [both chuckling]

745
00:52:11,513 --> 00:52:12,848
[sighs]

746
00:52:19,146 --> 00:52:20,815
We need this place open.

747
00:52:22,024 --> 00:52:23,233
I know.

748
00:52:27,029 --> 00:52:28,530
You gonna run it?

749
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:30,700
I ain't no barber.

750
00:52:30,783 --> 00:52:32,076
What about you?

751
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:34,494
[sighing]

752
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:39,166
Another question for
another time, my man.

753
00:52:41,501 --> 00:52:44,296
We gotta figure out something
soon either way.

754
00:52:47,591 --> 00:52:49,384
[sighs] I will.

755
00:52:50,552 --> 00:52:52,304
You should know that about me by now.

756
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,932
I like to get things done.

757
00:52:55,975 --> 00:52:57,601
Oh...

758
00:52:57,684 --> 00:52:59,019
Where you goin' now?

759
00:53:00,604 --> 00:53:02,272
I'm starving.

760
00:53:07,444 --> 00:53:09,196
[whistles softly]

761
00:53:15,745 --> 00:53:17,079
[sighs]

762
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:23,585
I've never seen you eat so much.

763
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:26,797
I guess I worked up a
bit of an appetite today.

764
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:28,507
Did you go for your run?

765
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:31,593
Something like that.

766
00:53:43,188 --> 00:53:44,689
The food wasn't that good.

767
00:53:44,774 --> 00:53:46,901
I just wanted to make things right.

768
00:53:49,736 --> 00:53:51,530
Where'd the money come from?

769
00:53:51,613 --> 00:53:53,157
It doesn't matter.

770
00:53:54,158 --> 00:53:56,660
What matters is what you do with it.

771
00:54:19,892 --> 00:54:21,435
Sweet sister!

772
00:54:33,989 --> 00:54:35,690
[chuckles]

773
00:54:39,578 --> 00:54:41,580
