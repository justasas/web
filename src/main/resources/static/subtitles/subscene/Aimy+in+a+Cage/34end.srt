<i>Episode 34</i>

20
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,090
Tell me then.

21
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,740
What should I use to make you talk?

22
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,440
Why don't we try this needle

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,320
and see if you will talk?

24
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,480
Tell me about the secret formula now

25
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,940
and I will let you live.

26
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,980
Dream on.

27
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,850
If it doesn't belong to you, it won't.

28
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,660
You will never be able to get the secret formula.

29
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,300
Does it hurts?

30
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,570
It hurts.

31
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,650
I believe now that

32
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,620
you really don't have the secret formula.

33
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,500
<i>For you, in the future, you can teach him too.</i>

34
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,170
<i>So, we were actually friends.</i>

35
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,950
<i>It will be a beautiful cycle of reincarnation.</i>

36
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,530
<i>Remember what you told me.</i>

37
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,920
<i>You will never make me regret</i>

38
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,380
<i>by handing Cai Hong to you.</i>

39
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:16,420
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

40
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,650
Shao Tian. Is something troubling you?

41
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,370
No. Don't guess blindly.

42
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,790
Here, have more food.

43
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,010
Shao Tian. I'm your mother. Don't lie to me.

44
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,840
Even though you don't want to say anything,

45
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,340
I know that you have something on your mind.

46
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,260
Mom. You must believe me.

47
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,110
Look...

48
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,520
all these years,

49
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,960
I already experienced what I should experience.

50
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,450
My hard work has paid off.

51
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,360
I have loved.

52
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,370
Earned love.

53
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:19,260
After letting it go, I finally understood the choice you and Dad made.

54
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,570
Sometimes when you hold it tightly and don't let go,

55
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,330
it doesn't mean that it's good for the other party.

56
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:35,900
When one choses to left go and leave, perhaps, it's another way to love.

57
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,270
Staying together is a kind comfort,

58
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,800
letting go is difficult.

59
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,250
Dad chose another method

60
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,360
to protect us.

61
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,350
All these years,

62
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,490
I didn't do well.

63
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,030
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,200
Shao Tian, let's not talk about this.

65
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,130
Eat.

66
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,300
Tonight,

67
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,770
I'm going out to settle some matters. I may be home a bit late.

68
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,070
Sleep early and don't wait for me.

69
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,340
It's almost time, I should leave now.

70
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,080
Mom, take your time eating.

71
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,100
Shao Tian.

72
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,030
Be careful.

73
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,030
Don't worry.

74
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,010
Mr Jiang, you are punctual.

75
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,070
Did you bring anyone else here?

76
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,680
Don't worry. I came alone.

77
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,690
Mr Jiang, let's go then.

78
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,770
Go.

79
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,880
You two, stay here and keep watch. Check if we are being followed.

80
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,360
Yes.

81
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,030
Speed up.

82
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,930
Let's go.

83
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,630
Old Master.

84
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,780
Please protect Cai Hong and Yu Er. Let them come back safely.

85
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,440
- Mom, Madam. <br>- Don't stop me.

86
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,040
- Mom, don't do this. <br>- Dont stop me.

87
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,770
Let's talk in a civilised manner.

88
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,760
- Mom. <br> - Madam Jiang.

89
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,480
I heard that Cai Hong has been kidnapped. Is this true?

90
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,750
Madam Wu. Let's talk calmly.

91
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,820
It's true.

92
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,690
Mom, get up now.

93
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,880
Madam Jiang. I know that the Jiang family hates us.

94
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,710
My husband has wronged you

95
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,010
but Cai Hong is a kind and good girl.

96
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,510
She is really sincere in paying for her father's crimes.

97
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,950
She's really seeking your forgiveness.

98
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,160
Madam Wu. What are you doing? Get up.

99
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,920
- Get up now. <br>- Madam Jiang, I'm begging you.

100
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,320
I'm begging you to save Cai Hong.

101
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,650
I know that the kidnappers want the Jiang family's secret formula.

102
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,090
I also know that the secret formula is very important to your founders.

103
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,470
But this child didn't do anything wrong.

104
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,300
She didn't sin. If she made any mistakes

105
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,440
I don't want to live anymore.

106
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,670
Madam Jiang. I'm begging you. Please save my sister.

107
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,820
My sister didn't do anything wrong.

108
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,520
Madam Wu. Yu Er has already taken the secret formula to save Cai Hong.

109
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,230
- Really? <br>- Yes, get up now.

110
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,930
Really? Jiang Yu went to save her?

111
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,440
It's true.

112
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,680
That's great.

113
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,360
Madam Wu. Even though the secret formula is important

114
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,370
no matter what, our children are more important.

115
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:40,820
If at this time, I don't hand over the secret formula, am I still a human?

116
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,520
Madam Jiang. Thank you very much.

117
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,000
- Enough. <br>- Thank you very much.

118
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,710
Thank you, Madam Jiang.

119
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,130
It's late and I called you here

120
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,590
because we need to undertake a special mission.

121
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,560
The motive is to save Jiang Wu and Wu Cai Hong.

122
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,640
Everyone, listen carefully. One part of the team will start from here.

123
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,300
The second team will start from here.

124
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,640
We'll meet in the middle.

125
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,230
Remember this. The people we are going against tonight

126
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,000
may have heavy weapons.

127
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,900
It's extremely dangerous. You must be very careful.

128
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,590
Get ready to set off.

129
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,240
Hurry up.

130
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,050
We are back again. Didn't we just pass here?

131
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,510
Did we take the wrong path?

132
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,470
I...

133
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,610
We are almost done.

134
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,480
When we tell you to walk, just walk. Cut the crap.

135
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,460
Go now.

136
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,370
You two stay here. We are leaving.

137
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,540
Yes.

138
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,310
Quick, after them.

139
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,520
Quick.

140
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,610
Watch carefully.

141
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,400
Come here.

142
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,400
Don't move.

143
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,360
Let's go, quick.

144
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,380
Kneel down.

145
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,430
- Speak now. <br>- I will talk.

146
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,520
Take them over there and check if there is anyone else.

147
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,460
Yes. You both, go over there. You two, come with me.

148
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,070
Director. We already searched. There is no one else here.

149
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,510
Come here. Where is Jiang Yu?

150
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,810
He's not here. It's only just me.

151
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,710
I'm telling the truth.

152
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,420
Kneel down.

153
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,360
Before Jiang Yu left, he told me that he would leave some markers.

154
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,250
Did he tell you what the markers are?

155
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,250
He only said to bring this along.

156
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,850
Listen carefully.

157
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,480
Use your torchlights and check

158
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,260
if there are any special markers.

159
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,010
Director Chen.

160
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,230
There is phosphor.

161
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,490
What are you looking at? Let's go.

162
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,110
It's not honest.

163
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,060
Mr Zhou.

164
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,850
Following this florescent path, we have circled the path a few times.

165
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,110
What I see here is that it isn't pink enough anymore.

166
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,640
Mr Zhou, there again is phosphor over here.

167
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,630
What should we do?

168
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,920
Let's do this.

169
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,410
Let's not waste any time. There are only two paths.

170
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,690
You go there and I will go here.

171
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,250
Junior Superintendent, make the arrangements.

172
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,900
Yes.

173
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,400
Let's split.

174
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,290
Okay.

175
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,120
The rest, follow me. Come, buddies.

176
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,710
Over there.

177
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,540
Go in.

178
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,680
Cai Hong.

179
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,400
Cai Hong.

180
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,610
Cai Hong.

181
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,760
Cai Hong.

182
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,960
Cai Hong. Don't be afraid, I'm here.

183
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,170
Why are you here?

184
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,390
Of course, I would come.

185
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,720
If I were captured by someone,

186
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,150
wouldn't you come and save me too?

187
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,290
I was used to lure you.

188
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,290
Even if you came,

189
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,320
Lu Man will never release us.

190
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,040
Don't be afraid.

191
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,840
This is really touching.

192
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,080
Seeing the two of you like this.

193
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,280
If this continues on, it will really make me believe that there is love in this world.

194
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,750
So, it's you.

195
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,600
It's me.

196
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,610
Mr Jiang, now that you see

197
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,900
hand over the secret formula to me.

198
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,400
The secret formula is here.

199
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,900
I can give it to you but you must ensure the safety of Cai Hong.

200
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,330
You must not give it to her. This is from your founder. You must protect this.

201
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,160
Don't do this.

202
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,010
Enough.

203
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,180
The two of you are now my Zushang fish. <i>you are my prisoners.</i>

204
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,240
What right do you have to discuss terms with me?

205
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,280
Mr Jiang. I won't look at the secret formula you are holding in your hand.

206
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,060
Who knows if it's real or fake?

207
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,050
Thus, please dye a piece of cloth for me now

208
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,210
to prove if it's real.

209
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,030
Uncle Lai, prepare a few brushes.

210
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:49,150
Record Mr Jiang's each and every step.

211
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,820
Yes.

212
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,670
Let's go.

213
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:20,330
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

214
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,100
Are you really going to give her the secret formula?

215
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,760
Don't be afraid.

216
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Trust me.

217
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,310
Because this hasn't ended, it may not be a bad ending yet.

218
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,210
What if the ending is bad?

219
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,170
Even if the ending is bad,

220
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,650
we will still die together, right?

221
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,440
You are really foolish.

222
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,040
Enough.

223
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,640
Your time is imminent.

224
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,700
Dye it now.

225
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,860
It's only one garment. It won't take long love.

226
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,220
Come.

227
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,390
Director. This path is not right.

228
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,560
Go back now. Quick.

229
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,580
Ahead.

230
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,340
Director. It's Xiao Shi and Kang Zi.

231
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,760
It's dangerous here now.

232
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,140
Leave now.

233
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,800
Ke Ke. We already tried it.

234
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,310
The colour doesn't run.

235
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,620
<i>Thank you.</i>

236
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,240
<i>Man Man.</i>

237
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,350
<i>Man Man, are you okay?</i>

238
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,280
<i>Mom.</i>

239
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,440
<i>I want to grow up soon.</i>

240
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,560
<i>I want to grow up.</i>

241
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,330
<i>Man Man. You want to grow up.</i>

242
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,390
<i>It's because you want to be able to wear my clothes soon. Isn't that so?</i>

243
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,490
<i>My Man Man. Think about it.</i>

244
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,860
<i>If you were to grow up,</i>

245
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,920
<i>when the time comes, you will be old like me.</i>

246
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,700
<i>My mom will never grow old.</i>

247
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,180
<i>My mom will never grow old.</i>

248
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,270
<i>Mom.</i>

249
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,170
<i>You smell very nice.</i>

250
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,700
This is the feeling.

251
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,120
This is really the secret formula.

252
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,110
You already know the secret formula.

253
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,210
Can we leave now?

254
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,390
Since you have already decided to die together,

255
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,100
do you still need to leave here?

256
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,120
Let's go.

257
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,050
Don't move.

258
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,800
- Cai Hong. <br>-Jiang Yu.

259
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,000
Lu Man. You are too despicable.

260
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,760
I just want to be ruthless.

261
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,110
I'm not like your father.

262
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,170
I'll be lenient and let you go to the Jiang home early.

263
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,720
Otherwise we will experience Jiang Yu's revenge.

264
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,110
There won't be today either.

265
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,710
Ke Ke!

266
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,080
Leave now. Ke Ke.

267
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,450
Zhou Shao Tian.

268
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,040
Brother Shao Tian.

269
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,940
So how? Are you okay?

270
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,080
Be careful.

271
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,690
Uncle Lai. How are you?

272
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,120
So how? Are you okay?

273
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,670
I'm fine.

274
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,270
Uncle Lai.

275
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,790
Uncle Lai, don't die.

276
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,790
You promised me that

277
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,410
you would take care of me forever.

278
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,790
You promised me that you would take care of me forever.

279
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,710
I'm begging you.

280
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,840
If you leave, what would I do?

281
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,630
Can you bear it?

282
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,250
Brother Shao Tian.

283
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,790
Uncle Lai.

284
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,790
I will take revenge for you.

285
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,690
Come out.

286
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,600
Come out.

287
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,740
Come out.

288
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,780
Quick.

289
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,970
Stop there.

290
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,400
Kneel down.

291
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,640
Are you okay?

292
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,950
Come out.

293
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,980
What's wrong?

294
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,990
Police!

295
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,780
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

296
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,970
Take them away now.

297
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,940
Quick, let's go.

298
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,310
Leave.

299
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,800
I will bomb you to death!

300
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,590
Quick!

301
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,840
Jiang Yu!

302
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,770
I will bomb you to death!

303
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,640
Brother Shao Tian.

304
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,670
Let go.

305
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:50,370
- Brother Shao Tian. <br>- What are you doing here? Why aren't you protecting Cai Hong?

306
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,900
Let's go.

307
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,310
Brother Shao Tian!

308
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,630
Shao Tian!

309
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,890
Jiang Yu!

310
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,630
Shao Tian!

311
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,170
Brother Shao Tian!

312
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,540
Let me go.

313
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,590
Don't!

314
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,570
Jiang Yu! <br>- Don't!

315
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,890
- You are awake? <br>- How is Brother Shao Tian?

316
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,300
The doctor said that you can't move around. Go back and rest first.

317
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,560
I'm going to look for him.

318
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,470
- Sit down first. <br>- Let me look for him.

319
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,440
Listen to me. Let me finish first.

320
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,180
- I want to find Brother Shao Tian. <br>- Listen to me. Don't move around.

321
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,570
- Cai Hong, listen to me. <br>- He is already dead.

322
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,540
Sorry, Cai Hong.

323
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,610
That can't be.

324
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,970
Cai Hong, don't be like this.

325
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,920
Cai Hong, listen to me. You must be strong.

326
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,500
Cai Hong, don't be like this.

327
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,860
Cai Hong, don't be like this.

328
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,570
You must be strong.

329
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,340
I couldn't do anything at all.

330
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,970
You must continue to live.

331
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,430
Don't let Shao Tian sacrifice his life for nothing.

332
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,340
Cai Hong.

333
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:07,220
Brother Shao Tian. I'm here to visit you.

334
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,120
Do you still remember

335
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,230
what you told me?

336
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,090
If you could turn back time,

337
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:19,210
you don't where you will go back to.

338
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,130
If you really could start over

339
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,230
I rather I never met you.

340
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,710
This way,

341
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,340
you will be able to live well.

342
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,290
But we already met.

343
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,270
I want to thank you

344
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,180
for always doting on me.

345
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,410
For letting me feel the tenderness

346
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,710
and being very blessed.

347
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,320
Thank you.

348
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,250
Thank you.

349
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,270
Shao Tian.

350
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,510
What I promised you,

351
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,990
I will definitely do it.

352
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,830
Don't worry.

353
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,870
It's my fault.

354
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,180
I harmed Brother Shao Tian.

355
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,990
It's because of me.

356
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,010
Aunt.

357
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,700
I'm sorry.

358
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,880
Child.

359
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,260
This was Shao Tian's own choice.

360
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:10,110
I think he will be very happy to use another way to protect you.

361
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,810
Aunt, don't worry.

362
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,170
In the future, I will definitely

363
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,910
treat you like my mother.

364
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:28,880
I will be filial to you on behalf of Brother Shao Tian.

365
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,830
To serve you.

366
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:13,020
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

367
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,250
Is this for me?

368
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,390
Of course.

369
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,890
Do you like it?

370
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,100
It's such a beautiful necklace.

371
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,010
My mom just said the same thing.

372
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,560
If Aunt likes this, you should give it to her.

373
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,930
- If not, she won't be happy. <br>- Who says so?

374
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:04,970
She even asked me why I took such a long time to give this to you?

375
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,880
If you are all like this, it will be hard for me.

376
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,970
Who's making it hard for you?

377
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:14,800
Did you know when my mom said that to me, Aunt Wu and Aunt Zhou were there too?

378
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,570
They were both talking about me.

379
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,690
What did they say?

380
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,840
In any way, them all living together, they all share the same voice.

381
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,560
I still have a surprise for you.

382
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,620
What is it?

383
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,160
I'm taking you to a place.

384
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,860
Where are we going?

385
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,840
Where exactly are we going? Just tell me.

386
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,710
Don't ask anymore. You will find out later.

387
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,890
Why isn't there anyone in the factory today?

388
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,830
That's right. I gave them the day off.

389
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,520
Is this your surprise?

390
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,690
Is this considered a surprise?

391
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,960
Of course, it's a surprise.

392
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,730
Only when there is a special day at the factory can the employees take leave.

393
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,620
It's really very beautiful.

394
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,590
I finally understand now.

395
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,810
Everything can be let go.

396
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,440
♫<i> So long, I have waited for so long... </i>♫

397
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,380
Including the pain betrayals and revenge.

398
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,580
Even if it's life or death.

399
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,320
♫<i> Waited for your love to bloom. </i>♫

400
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,910
But you are the only one whom I can't let go.

401
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,610
♫<i> Desperately, I was desperately struggling to find... </i>♫

402
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,370
If I see you in pain,

403
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,000
I will be in more pain than you.

404
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,300
When I see you smile,

405
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,200
I'm happier than you.

406
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,060
I think

407
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,550
this is what love is.

408
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:28,040
♫<i> but did not ask you whether I was your fated love. </i>♫

♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

410
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,300

♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

412
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,410

416

♫<i> I didn't see through to your eyes or heart </i>♫

417

Cai Hong.

419
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,350
Marry me, okay?

420
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:28,770
♫<i> Gently, I gently tried to inquire </i>♫

421
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:35,080
