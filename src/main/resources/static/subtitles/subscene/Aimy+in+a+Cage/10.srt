00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:27,080
♫<i> Yet couldn't find the way to your heart. </i>♫

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,600
♫<i> Gently, I gently tried to inquire </i>♫

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,880

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,150
<i>Episode 10</i>

20
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,360
I promise, after this,

21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,160
you will have no regrets.

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,550
Boss Jiang, you also offer a final inspection of the product.

23
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,800
That's right.

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,390
I heard that Boss Zhou of Fu Sheng

25
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,720
orders are intended to be made of this.

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,250
Let's go to visit the Miss of former Mr. Wu of Ling Long.

27
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,500
- There are some things that will fly. <br> - Yes, yes.

28
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,120
Prices are good also.

29
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,470
They even will allow us to do the water test. Let's go over to their shop.

30
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,960
Okay, everyone.

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,030
Let's go over to Fu Sheng to take a look again. After all, we are businessmen.

32
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,700
It makes sense to go where there is stability.

33
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,340
Let's go.

34
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,570
-Boss Luo, wait. There are other styles in our store... <br>-Fei Fei.

35
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,540
Don't stop them from leaving.

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,790
Boss Jiang. Apologies, we are taking our leave.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,440
Dear everyone. I won't be seeing you off. Take care.

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,000
This way, please.

39
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,390
Take care, everyone.

40
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,020
The colours are nice here.

41
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,230
Brother Shao Tian, the dye orders today compared to the original are bigger.

42
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,590
We are working overtime to rush out the orders.

43
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,840
Jiang Yu's face must be black.

44
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,610
Brother.

45
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,610
Miss. We have another client. I heard that they came over from Ling Long.

46
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,350
Their prices are too expensive. Thus, they came here.

47
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,560
Let's go.

48
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,220
Let's go out and take a look.

49
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,400
Since Zhou Shao Tian joined together with the business federation,

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,200
they lowered their prices. We lost quite a number of clients to them.

51
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,190
They abandoned orders which are filled up in our warehouse.

52
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,420
- What should we do, Brother? <br>- Don't worry.

53
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,270
Everything will come to light soon.

54
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,900
Don't bother about the issue regarding Fu Sheng.

55
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,910
They are at an advantage now.

56
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,810
Isn't there someone? <br>What someone?

57
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,560
Send men over there to tell their staff that we will offer them a high salary.

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,780
We are still increasing our staff. We are already having problems selling our products.

59
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,960
I get it. As long as we can lure their staff here

60
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,990
they won't have anyone to produce their goods.

61
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,070
Brother, great move.

62
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,960
If Zhou Shao Tian wants to save Fu Sheng,

63
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,380
he will need a big sum of cash.

64
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,930
I understand now. I will get this done immediately.

65
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,390
Okay.

66
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,420
-Grab your Rose Candy. <br> - Thank you.

67
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,610
Rose Candy.

68
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,760
Hold this carefully.

69
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,190
-I'll have Rose... <br> Rose Candy please.

70
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,320
Okay. Are you together?

71
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,130
We are not together. Split the purchases.

72
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,950
Take care.

73
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,540
My mom has already been discharged from the hospital.

74
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,640
If you want to see her, I can take you there.

75
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,600
Please hand this to Madam Jiang.

76
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,010
You haven't come to your senses yet?

77
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,060
I should be the one saying this.

78
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,890
You always saw Fu Sheng's capability.

79
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,080
So what? Are you afraid?

80
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,740
You will see the true face of that person next to you in Fu Sheng soon.

81
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,610
I already see it very clearly.

82
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,580
You appear as a Yiguanqinshou. <br><i>immoral person</i>

83
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,930
A peer pressure to dominate the market

84
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,030
You even used disgusting tactics to frame my sister.

85
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,020
<i>What is this? There are so many words here. What does it say?</i>

86
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,770
<i>It's a recruitment notice. What is it for?</i>

87
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,040
What is written there?

88
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,780
- What's wrong? <br>- It's a recruitment notice.

89
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,500
Because of vacancies, there are several openings, especially for Journeymen,

90
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,560
Monthly payment of salaries. Between the two companies, the pay is higher. There are bonuses.

91
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,190
The conditions aren't bad!

92
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,870
They're just saying that.

93
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,290
How could it be? Ling Long is a big company!

94
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,570
If they said it, it must be true!

95
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,030
Then what are we still doing here? Let's go work at Ling Long!

96
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,960
- Let's go. <br> - But Boss Zhou treats us pretty well.

97
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,390
Money is more important. We'll be satisfied once we have it in our hands.

98
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,470
Regarding this, both of the companies are doing the same thing.

99
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,090
I say that we should go to whichever one pays higher and has better conditions.

100
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,650
Yes, exactly. Are you coming or not?

101
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,110
Let's go!

102
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,600
Wait for me! I'm here to sign up.

103
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,030
<i>I'm here to register!</i>

104
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,900
<i>Line up!</i>

105
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,570
Where are the others?

106
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,530
They all went to Ling Long.

107
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,660
I couldn't stop them.

108
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,420
I'm sorry, owner.

109
00:07:52,070 --> 00:08:00,130
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

110
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,020
Jiang Yu, you despicable person! To use such means to get rid of all our business!

111
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,430
Let go.

112
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,470
Don't worry, let him go.

113
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,030
All I did was mention a higher salary.

114
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,230
As long as you offer a higher salary, all your workers will come back to you.

115
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,370
If you're capable, then do it. Doing it like this doesn't prove anything!

116
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,500
In business, strength is one thing, strategy is another.

117
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,300
If you have the courage to open a shop, you have the courage to lose.

118
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,280
I won't lose to you.

119
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,090
I also don't want you to give up so soon.

120
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,910
It'll be resolved once you show the money.

121
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,060
What money?

122
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,350
Let me remind you,

123
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,860
the Ling Long that I acquired was just a shell.

124
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,980
The money on the ledgers disappeared.

125
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,990
Where could such a large sum of money have gone?

126
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,650
Think carefully about how you're going to keep Fu Sheng.

127
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,570
Please go carefully.

128
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,590
Hello, who are you looking for?

129
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,760
Boss, Fu Sheng's owner has already

130
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,630
been waiting for you for a long time.

131
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,490
He hasn't left yet?

132
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,090
Boss, there's a call for you.

133
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,150
I know, it's okay.

134
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,800
Hello?

135
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,930
Boss Jiang, hello!

136
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,130
What do you need, just tell me!

137
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,480
You want to deposit some money? Of course!

138
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,960
That's great, thank you so much!

139
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,140
Don't disturb your workers, I'll go there personally to collect it.

140
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,260
What?

141
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,260
Zhou Shao Tian?

142
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,220
He's not a big client of mine.

143
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,960
I already knew that he couldn't do business, so I shouldn't have lent him money!

144
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,520
I'm making many mistakes.

145
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,680
Okay, wait for me.

146
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,380
I'm coming right now.

147
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,000
Boss Qian!

148
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,740
Boss Qian, I had something to discuss with you.

149
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,050
Boss Zhou, I have to leave for some business.

150
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,730
It's like this, can you lend me some more money so I can turn around my situation?

151
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,080
As long as it turns my situation around, I will definitely pay you back with interest.

152
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,820
I can lend you money, but what can you pawn?

153
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,120
It's true that I don't have anything to pawn right now.

154
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,660
However, you know my skills and personality.

155
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,130
In the future, I will invest all of Fu Sheng's earnings here.

156
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,360
Boss Zhou, look here. I'm also a businessman.

157
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,430
You didn't even return all the money you borrowed last time, how do you expect me to lend you more?

158
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:18,090
Also, who doesn't know about Fu Sheng's current situation?

159
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,030
Boss Qian, help me one last time. Give me one last chance.

160
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,840
I have urgent needs to attend to.

161
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,560
How about this, Boss Zhou.

162
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,470
Let's have a cigarette.

163
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,030
Take Boss Zhou to talk in the back.

164
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,460
- Hurry up! <br> - Okay, okay.

165
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,020
Let's go. Boss Zhou, welcome.

166
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,220
Get out!

167
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,140
Boss Qian, what's the meaning of this?

168
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,690
The meaning?

169
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,980
Zhou Shao Tian.

170
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,980
If you stand there not moving, how am I supposed to continue my business?

171
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,700
Let me tell you,

172
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,320
people are from different classes.

173
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,800
A pheasant will never become a phoenix.

174
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,870
You are not fit to be a businessman.

175
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,300
There's no way I'm lending you money.

176
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,330
Let me also remind you that you have to return the money that you borrowed,

177
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,920
or else

178
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,900
don't blame me for not being polite.

179
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:43,740
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

180
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,230
Stop! You can't go in.

181
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,800
I'm looking for your boss, Jiang Yu.

182
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,770
Please move aside.

183
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,440
These are the factory's newest dyes, look over it.

184
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,810
Okay.

185
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,090
I have something important to discuss with him.

186
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,060
- Miss! <br> - Move aside!

187
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,700
Miss!

188
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,520
Wu Cai Hong, why did you come?

189
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,170
Fei Fei.

190
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,420
You can go outside.

191
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,570
Jiang Yu.

192
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,760
Fu Sheng is a very small shop. There's no way it can compare with Ling Long.

193
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,710
Why are you so bitter? Why do you have to make it hard for him?

194
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:25,310
Every time you appear, it's to argue with me.

195
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:35,090
Before, I did treat you like this. I did a lot of things that made you angry.

196
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:41,720
But you can't direct your anger towards Shao Tian. He's him and I'm me.

197
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,940
Jiang Yu, I'm begging you.

198
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,620
Can you let Fu Sheng go?

199
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,710
This is the first time you begged me for Zhou Shao Tian.

200
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,570
Does Zhou Shao Tian support you

201
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,640
coming to beg me?

202
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,510
Then what do you want?

203
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,110
Sorry.

204
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,340
I will definitely force Fu Sheng out of business.

205
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,740
Why can't you let Fu Sheng go?

206
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,740
Let Brother Shao Tian go?

207
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,850
In your eyes, I'm cold-blooded.

208
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,500
So I can only resort to the facts in order for you to see the truth.

209
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,930
I will only accept what I see right now.

210
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,940
I can see clearly what kind of person you really are.

211
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,980
Then we don't have anything more to discuss.

212
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,040
What can I do so that you will let Fu Sheng go?

213
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,500
And let Brother Shao Tian go?

214
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,260
I am not an immoral person.

215
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,080
However I am not lenient and won't show mercy.

216
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,180
You will get your retribution.

217
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,420
Did you hear?

218
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,720
Zhou Shao Tian is asking for a loan for more money.

219
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,400
This is a way for them to feed their families.

220
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,880
Is Zhou Shao Tian going to force us to death?

221
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,910
Yes. He's going to force us to death.

222
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:38,240
Who will lend him the money now? If he doesn't get a loan, our money will be in hot soup.

223
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,850
That's right.

224
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,010
Aren't there goods in his shop now?

225
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,030
Take his goods as collateral. It's better than nothing.

226
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,570
Yes. Let's take his goods as collateral.

227
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,930
Let's go.

228
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,150
Let's go in. Take these away.

229
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,560
Take them away.

230
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,220
Put down my goods.

231
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,160
Put them down.

232
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,600
The deadline is not due yet.

233
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,620
Confiscate them.

234
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,030
You are stealing my goods.

235
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,790
- Sis, what are you doing? <br>- Nothing.

236
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,010
Brother Shao Tian. I was just about to look for you.

237
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,820
Will this help you?

238
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,120
No need.

239
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,980
I don't mind. It's only this.

240
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,800
Brother Shao Tian, take this. This is my mom's personal...

241
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,070
You are giving out your mother's funeral money.

242
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,950
- What are you trying to do? <br>- Stop hitting her.

243
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,960
I will remember what you have done.

244
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,900
But for the rich, they are utterly inadequate.

245
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,350
Thank you, everyone.

246
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,870
Who is it that failed to give you light <i>direction</i>?

247
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,760
Why don't you let Cai Yun buy French perfumes instead?

248
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,670
Mom.

249
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,010
Kneel down.

250
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,420
Zhou Shao Tian, return our money immediately.

251
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,990
If not, it won't be that simple next time.

252
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,790
Let's go.

253
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,370
Let's go.

254
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,290
Brother. I have been thinking about this for the past two days.

255
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,770
What do you know?

256
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,920
So what if you have lost once? This is all crap.

257
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,720
You are just going to give it up like that?

258
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,080
Let's start anew.

259
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,920
Brother.

260
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,490
I'm not good with words.

261
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,610
Brother, you really have the talent.

262
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,970
I believe that you can make a comeback.

263
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,110
Cheers.

264
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,570
Trust me, Ah Li.

265
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,810
I will definitely make a comeback.

266
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,750
I believe you, Brother.

267
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,730
My great worry now is that when I don't have any money,

268
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,500
it's frustrating.

269
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,370
When I have money,

270
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,280
it's even more so.

271
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,380
Money?

272
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,240
Brother, you are saying that there is no way to gain power.

273
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,270
It's not power.

274
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,540
It's money.

275
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,670
Is there something like this in the world?

276
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,680
You have money and you can't spend it.

277
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,360
This is impossible.

278
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,070
Yes.

279
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,200
This is the situation.

280
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,530
Brother. You really know how to joke. I know that in this world, there are things that money can't buy.

281
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,530
-The perfect color is not created with money. <br> -Be quiet.

282
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,020
If you have money and you don't spend it, it will force one to die.

283
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,850
If you want to spend the money, you will cause someone to die.

284
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,280
What do you mean?

285
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,430
All I know is that one can not live without money. On the other hand,

286
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,080
this person will suffocate by money.

287
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,550
I also want to walk away

288
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,090
but in my heart, I can't let this go.

289
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,700
Brother, how much is something worth

290
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,720
when it begins to be taken away.

291
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,910
Brother, where are you going?

292
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,990
Brother, be careful.

293
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,320
Brother Shao Tian. You have drank too much.

294
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,360
This is bad for your health.

295
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,660
I'm fine. I've only been drunk a few times in my lifetime.

296
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,280
I like that you are finding it hard to accept

297
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,470
but when a person is facing hardship, you must bring your spirit up.

298
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,370
Don't you think so?

299
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,740
Don't worry. I won't do this again.

300
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,620
By the way, I went to visit a few of my father's friends...

301
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,900
- Hence... <br>- Cai Hong,

302
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,950
I have already thought it through.

303
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,860
I will take you away from Huzhou. Let's move far away.

304
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,980
What about Fu Sheng then?

305
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,730
Anywhere where you are at, Fu Sheng will be there.

306
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,410
Fu Sheng is not important. You are important.

307
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,240
But we still owe a lot of debts.

308
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,810
We will pay them back gradually.

309
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:22,570
However much profits we made, we will pay them back.

310
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,940
Is this okay?

311
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,980
Let's go to Tianjin. No one knows us there. We can start anew.

312
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,980
But I haven't taken revenge for Ling Long and my father yet.

313
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,710
We can't leave at a time like this.

314
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,720
Cai Hong. The situation now

315
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,360
is that Jiang Yu has forced us into at tight corner.

316
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,180
If this continues, our business will really go down.

317
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,480
Why don't we find a hideaway first

318
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,040
and wait for this to die down before we come back for revenge?

319
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,070
Brother Shao Tian.

320
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:29,160
Your decision is too sudden.

321
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,040
Let me think about it again.

322
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,050
Brother.

323
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,360
Zhou Shao left today.

324
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,950
Has he started his move?

325
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,550
No. But the situation is already like this,

326
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,930
he still haven't got the cash for Fu Sheng.

327
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,290
He quite tolerant about it

328
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,220
Brother. Perhaps, you have guessed wrongly.

329
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,800
Maybe it wasn't Zhou Shao Tian who teamed up with Lao Cai to empty Ling Long.

330
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,950
If it wasn't him, who else would it be?

331
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,620
Brother. I'm a bit suspicious now.

332
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,030
If you go against Zhou Shao Tian this way,

333
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,900
you will need an elixir.

334
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,980
What do you mean?

335
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,970
You don't understand what I mean?

336
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,940
I really hope that you don't understand what I'm saying.

337
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,540
Brother, don't be sad. Where there is life there is hope.

338
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,070
I would like to add fire to the flame. I know the boss would not give me this opportunity again.

339
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:47,000
Miss Lu. Are you making a joke out of this?

340
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:53,240
It's common for soldiers to fail. Mr Zhou, it's you who are taking this too hard.

341
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,670
When you fall, you can still get up and start anew again.

342
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,400
Look at the state I am in now.

343
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,130
I don't have any money left.

344
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,330
I am making a point

345
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,720
and thinking of a way to reverse this.

346
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,900
I can help you.

347
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,060
Really? That's great.

348
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,110
Miss Lu hasn't finished talking yet.

349
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,060
Yes.

350
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,870
Boss Zhou knows me very well.

351
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,730
What can I do for Miss Lu then?

352
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,040
The secret formula.

353
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,970
What secret formula?

354
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,850
The secret formula of Wu Hong Da.

355
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,890
I don't have the secret formula.

356
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,110
I don't know what the secret formula is. It doesn't concern Ling Long.

357
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,870
Fu Sheng started a business for only a few days and it was brought down by Ling Long.

358
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,650
Are you really going to swallow this?

359
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,430
That's right, Brother.

360
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,960
Let's do this, Boss Zhou. Think about this

361
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,520
but don't let me wait for too long.

362
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,910
A woman doesn't like to be kept waiting.

363
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,950
I won't be seeing you off.

364
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:23,010
Brother. Why didn't you take up her offer? It's a great opportunity.

365
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,960
I really don't have the secret formula.

366
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,260
Yesterday stepmother did tofu. She especially liked it.

367
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,880
This child of mine doesn't like to eat greasy and oily food.

368
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,120
She doesn't like to eat fish. She said that they have a fishy smell.

369
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,500
That's right. We still have half a fish left from yesterday.

370
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,570
Go and buy some vegetables.

371
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,830
Remember to bargain with them.

372
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,670
Stepmom, don't worry. Deliver the food to Cai Yun now.

373
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,730
Candied fruits on sticks.

374
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,360
Candied fruits on sticks.

375
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,300
Candied fruits on sticks.

376
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,660
What are you going? What's going on?

377
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,250
- Don't you look where you are going? This dress is very expensive. <br>- Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose.

378
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,850
- It's so dirty. <br>- Let me wipe it off for you.

379
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:20,160
She is from a dye factory. Her husband committed suicide by jumping down. Look at her, she's still wearing such bright and floral clothes.

380
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:25,140
- Seriously. <br>- Stop wiping, it's so dirty.

381
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,690
Stop wiping. Don't touch me. Go away.

382
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,110
What are you doing? Why are you bullying him?

383
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,610
Who says I'm bullying him? Look at my dress. It's very expensive.

384
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,180
So what if it's dirty? Just go back and wash it. Why are you creating a ruckus here?

385
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,770
Seriously.

386
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,960
She broke my eggs. Compensate me for these.

387
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,360
- Compensate me for the eggs. <br>- Why should I pay for them?

388
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,690
She pushed me and made me fell.

389
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,710
Look at my dress.

390
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,620
The eggs have broken shells.

391
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,280
- Do you know how expensive it is? <br>- Don't leave. You must pay for it.

392
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,650
- Stepmom. <br>- What are you doing?

393
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,470
- What are you doing? <br>- She broke my eggs.

394
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,960
-How much are they? <br>- Take a look. Pay for them.

395
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,760
Just this sum of money? It's not enough. Look at the amount of eggs.

396
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,530
In any case, it's not enough.

397
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,400
This should be enough, right?

398
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,330
Consider that I'm unlucky.

399
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:24,660
Seriously. Why did you pay her?

400
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,520
Stepmom, don't be angry.

401
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,900
What are you looking at? Go away.

402
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,260
Leave now.

403
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,420
Let's go.

404
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,190
I will deliver this to Cai Yun.

405
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,190
Go back home and wash up now.

406
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,090
I'm so unlucky

407
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,130
to encounter such an unlucky incident.

408
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,580
I'm leaving first.

409
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,730
- Wu Cai Yun. You are a thief. <br>- I'm not a thief.

410
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,890
What are you still doing here? We don't welcome thieves here.

411
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,550
- I didn't steal. <br>- What are you doing? Stop it.

412
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:19,280
-She stole and has a criminal record. <br> -That was an injustice.

413
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,440
Ah Xue, say something.

414
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,490
- What right do you have to say that she is at thief? <br>- Wu Cai Yun is the poorest student in the class.

415
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,310
Isn't it common for her to steal?

416
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,570
How could you just simply say this? I'm going to sue you for defamation.

417
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:34,080
You are going to sue me for defamation? My mom also heard that Wu Cai Hong stole something.

418
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,720
She has even planned to petition the students to kick her out of school.

419
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,970
My mom said that she doesn't want me to be in the same school as a thief.

420
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,660
You have gone overboard.

421
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,980
- Cai Yun. <br>- We should have kicked her out a long time ago.

422
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,840
That's right. Let's kick her out.

423
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,590
Cai Yun.

424
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,750
Wait for me. Just ignore them.

425
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,340
Sis, Why was I framed?

426
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,050
Why am I being misunderstood by them?

427
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,180
Why must I live such a life?

428
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,750
I don't want to study anymore.

429
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,330
What's the status of the task?

430
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,370
Don't worry about Zhou Shao Tian.

431
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,770
I'm keeping a close watch on him.

432
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,810
But Miss Wu has been asking for help from her father's business friends for the past two days.

433
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,490
That Miss Wu, this kid is really not bad

434
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,980
I heard that she's swearing on her dad's reputation.

435
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,630
Do it as soon as possible. Close it.

436
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,860
Okay. I will acquire Fu Sheng tomorrow.

437
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,190
Boss Jiang.

438
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,120
Boss Jiang.

439
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,360
Okay, let's do this. I still have some matters to attend to.

440
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,090
Okay.

441
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:34,990
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

442
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:09,160
Now the only thing left is to hand him over.

443
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,990
Why did you come here?

444
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,630
Why aren't you saying anything?

445
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,570
Jiang Yu. You are here every day.

446
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:28,160
Don't you feel my father's soul has been following you?

447
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,290
What are you trying to say?

448
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,860
What I'm trying to say?

449
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:39,540
You forced Brother Shao Tian into a dead end and caused my sister to be unable to continue her studies.

450
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,300
What else are you still thinking of?

451
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,390
Let me tell you.

452
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:49,240
You harbour grudges about my family. You will never change.

453
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,870
I never planned to be the saviour of the Wu family.

454
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,730
Even if Wu Hong Da didn't pass away, I would still have acquired Ling Long.

455
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,930
Why should I bother. Give yourself the trouble of it.

456
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,960
Devil's words.

457
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,290
There will come a day when you will regret everything that you have said today.

458
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,190
What I regret is meeting such an evil man like you.

459
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,530
You should go back and keep calm first before you talk again.

460
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,730
I'm very calm now.

461
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,760
Don't be full of yourself.

462
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,550
Look, it's such a beautiful day but you can't appreciate it.

463
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,880
It's because people like you have a dark heart.

464
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,030
Even now if you have an exquisite life, you are not kind.

465
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,030
I don't want to see you again.

466
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,060
I'm not going. I don't want to go to Tianjin.

467
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,920
It's so far away. I like living here.

468
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,920
Stepmom. It's a dead end for us here.

469
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,770
When you go there, you can start anew.

470
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,230
No one is forcing you. You are only forcing yourselves.

471
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:26,240
You didn't stay at the great Ling Long. You quit such a great job. You didn't choose the great Jiang Yu.

472
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,040
Jiang Yu acquired Ling Long and now, Fu Sheng has been brought down by him.

473
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,630
If we continue to stay here, we might be his next target.

474
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,290
Why would he target us?

475
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,740
Fine. Even if Ling Long was acquired by him,

476
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,940
that's business. Kiddo, what do you know?

477
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,050
The words you've spoken, aren't you afraid that dad would be disappointed?

478
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,810
I heard that it's winter six months of the year in Tianjin.

479
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,410
I'm afraid of the cold. Moreover,

480
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,160
I won't be able to drink longjing tea

481
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,380
or eat Rose flower candy.

482
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,480
I don't understand the way the people talk that too. How could I live there?

483
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,760
Mom. I believe that Brother Shao Tian will let us live well there.

484
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,080
What do you mean? When he started Fu Sheng, he said that he would make the business expand.

485
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,410
(Where are) The results? <br>The situation we're in was caused by Jiang Yu.

486
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:25,330
Don't tell me you still want to be laughing stock here?

487
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:30,900
Cai Yun's schoolmates look down on her. Since this is the case, why don't we start anew there?

488
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,810
That's right, Mom. Just agree.

489
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,230
Give me a few days

490
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,420
to prepare.

491
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,320
To buy longjing tea and Rose flower candy.

492
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,970
Stepmom. I will get all these for you.

493
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,270
Once I have gotten them, we will set off tomorrow.

494
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,910
That fast?

495
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:01,240
Heavens, I have so much clothes. Let me go and pack first.

496
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,580
It's okay. She will pack for you.

497
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,140
Mom.

498
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,060
Shao Tian, you are back.

499
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,750
Pack your stuff and get ready to leave.

500
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,920
- What's wrong? <br>- We are going to Tianjin tomorrow.

501
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,710
- We won't return again. <br>- What happened that we must relocate?

502
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,520
- Did you... <br>- It's Jiang Yu.

503
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,920
Jiang Yu?

504
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,640
Jiang Yu forced me into a dead end.

505
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,730
I have no choice except to leave.

506
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,980
Is Jiang Yu that bad?

507
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,120
He is not bad? Is it me then?

508
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,510
I don't mean that. I'm just saying if it was an misunderstanding.

509
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:02,960
- Shao Tian. Even though you didn't tell me about Fu Sheng... <br>- Fu Sheng doesn't concern you.

510
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,110
Does Jiang Yu have anything to do with it?

511
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,990
I don't want to talk about this. Pack up.

512
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,820
Big Brother.

513
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,120
This way.

514
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,540
It's her, Miss Wu.

515
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,950
I heard that you want to borrow money from me.

516
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,720
Yes.

517
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,030
Do you know what this place is?

518
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,120
Yes. <br>- You know and you still dare to come here?

519
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,890
- I will definitely return the loan. <br>- Let me tell you.

520
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,540
My interest is very high.

521
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,320
Your Wu family has gone bankrupt and Fu Sheng is also in dire straits.

522
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,910
How do you plan to return my loan?

523
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,180
I will definitely pay back the loan.

524
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:19,550
You need collateral to take a loan.

525
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,590
What do you plan to use as the collateral?

526
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,130
I will use myself as the collateral.

527
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:35,350
You are a smart person. When you take my loan and can't return it when it's due,

528
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,450
don't blame me for not being polite to you.

529
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,500
Since I'm already here, I won't have any regrets.

530
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,490
Whether you lend or not, you should give it to one's heart's content.

531
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,760
Happy.

532
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,850
You do realize what you would be giving up.

533
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:58,340
Your sister and you are renowned beauties in Huzhou.

534
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,770
If you can't return the loan,

535
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,790
I may sell you to the brothels.

536
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:07,250
Did you think it over carefully?

537
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,000
Are you going to take the loan or not?

538
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,480
I will take the loan.

539
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,100
Fine.

540
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,110
Wait here.

541
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:43,430
