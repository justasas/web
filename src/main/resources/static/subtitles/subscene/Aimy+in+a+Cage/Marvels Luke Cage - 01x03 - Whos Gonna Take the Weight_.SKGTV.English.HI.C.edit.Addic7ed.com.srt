- They talking?
- [Scarfe] Nah.

37
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,317
"I ain't see shit." It's
the catchphrase of the day.

38
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,905
Classic. I should get that
trademarked. You know how many times I hear that?

39
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,158
- Nah. I can't hear shit either.
- [chuckles]

40
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,912
- The hits looked precise.
- Oh, they knew what they were doing.

41
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,289
Uh, victims said the
assailants were Spanish-speaking.

42
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,125
Are the victims a part
of Cottonmouth's crew?

43
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,420
Who knows? Computer's down. We
can run it back at the station.

00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,006
Or get a first-person ID.

But... it's a bit much.

51
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,694
Well, um, we do have more...

52
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,029
affordable options.

53
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,866
Can I see the body?

54
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,368
I'm sorry. That body just
arrived from the morgue.

55
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,495
It still has to be prepped for viewing.

56
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,957
[sighs]

57
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,793
Look, Mr. Hunter...

- Pop...
- Mmm.

59
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,254
...was like a father to me.

60
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:43,844
He's my wife's
people... and she's gone now, too.

61
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,972
It's just me. I'm all he has.

62
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,892
I just want to make
sure he's taken care of...

63
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,643
until I can get the
cash to pay for this.

64
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,395
Don't worry about it now, brother.

65
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,315
It's already taken care of.

66
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,112
Flourish is a silent way of us
treasuring the dearly departed.

[breathes deeply]

68
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,300
It's too bad you're not
in a position to give Pop

69
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,993
the grand homegoing he deserves.

70
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,954
The service should
match the man's integrity.

71
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,706
Hmm.

72
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,129
- Can we have the room, Joel?
- Uh, no problem, Mr. Stokes.

73
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,307
Me and Henry didn't see eye to eye.

74
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,686
But I always had his back.

75
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,566
He wouldn't want any
drama. Especially here.

76
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,419
What Pop would have
wanted is for you not to pay

77
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,030
for his arrangements with
bloody guilt money.

78
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,158
We set a parley.

79
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,701
- I thought your word was bond.
- It is.

80
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,373
A former associate of
mine was feelin' himself.

81
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,669
He's not feelin' much
of anything right now.

82
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,131
Doesn't matter. Pop's
death is still on you.

83
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,715
Step off.

84
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,009
Before you get hurt.

85
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,054
Why?

86
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,513
I'm just getting started.

87
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,932
[laughing]

88
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,019
Good to know. Hmm.

89
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,104
How's the job search coming?

90
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,108
- Dishwasher.
- [pats Luke]

91
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,618
[bell chimes]

92
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,157
I saw you standing out there earlier.

93
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,079
I wasn't ready to come in yet.

94
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,622
[Fish] Yeah, I hear you on that.

95
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:22,043
Walking in this shop is the
hardest thing I've ever done.

96
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,423
[sighing] Yeah.

97
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,718
I mean, who's ever really ready to
see something like this, though?

98
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,318
[sighs]

99
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,867
How'd you know Pop?

100
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,745
We used to play chess
in Marcus Garvey Park.

101
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,291
He got too busy to play,
so I started coming here.

102
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,670
When you played him... who would win?

103
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,796
Me.

104
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,590
[chuckles]

105
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,734
Just 'cause the brother's dead

106
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,479
don't mean I gotta
start changing the facts.

107
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,012
[both chuckle]

108
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,224
[sighs]

109
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,879
So what will happen to this place?

110
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,815
Ah, the bank will swoop
in and take it eventually.

111
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,401
How do you know that?

112
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:33,698
Besides playing chess, I used
to do the man's taxes every year.

113
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,534
I know where every account
is and who's owed what.

114
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,164
Trust me, soon as the word
spreads that he's gone,

115
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,042
the wolves will be at the door.

116
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,088
- Not on my watch.
- [scoffs] You got 80 grand lying around?

117
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,132
'Cause that's what it's gonna
take to keep this place open.

118
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,010
So it's too late.

119
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,721
Not necessarily.

120
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,433
Eighty grand isn't just gonna
come fallin' out of the sky.

121
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,186
What should we do? Talk to the bank?

122
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,939
Well, we have a little time.

123
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,334
No one's gonna be asking
questions and shutting things down

124
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,610
as long as things are paid for on time.

125
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,114
Why do you think so many
people get Grandma's house

126
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,993
without having to fill out
extra paperwork or hire a lawyer?

127
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,247
You pay the bills, people
shut up and get on with things.

128
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,502
So what you thinkin' now?

129
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,590
As much I'd like to put my
foot in Cottonmouth's behind,

130
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,509
I need to put my hands in his pockets.

131
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,070
That's how you hurt someone like that.

132
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,847
Robbin' Cottonmouth was what caused
all this trouble in the first place.

133
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,517
[exhales deeply]

134
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,855
You're absolutely right.

135
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,733
I'm not gonna touch him.

136
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,236
Not the way I should.

137
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,157
Since I can't touch the king,

138
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,118
I'm gonna take his queen, his knights...

139
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,453
his rooks...

140
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,749
I'm knocking all his
pieces off the board.

141
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,669
Where you goin' now?

142
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,797
Check these fools.

143
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,140
Three friends. Grade school tight.

144
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,225
Playground tight.

145
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,478
All-City in basketball in a
town where that really matters.

146
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,148
So what happens?

147
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,024
Y'all don't go pro.

148
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,486
One of you... starts
working for Cottonmouth...

149
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,323
makes some money, sees
a slick opportunity,

150
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,949
and you guys go for it.

151
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,413
You were part of the heist, right?

152
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,834
And the shootout at the barber
shop was payback for the heist.

153
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,711
So, what happened to your man Dante?

154
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,632
Shameek killed Dante.

155
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,095
You admit to that?

156
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,930
I admit what?

157
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:07,310
I mean, I was assuming Shameek
did it. 'Cause I know I didn't.

158
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,769
Never assume anything, kiddo.

159
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,231
Too bad your boys aren't
here to back up your story.

160
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,817
Maybe he's telling the truth.

161
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,737
Let's say he is.

162
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,489
Shameek sees all that cash and says,

163
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,617
"Oh, shit, there's no way I'm
splitting that three ways." So...

164
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,868
- Boom!
- [gun fires]

165
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,163
Now it's a two-way
split instead of three.

166
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,124
Shameek gets caught with
his share of the cash.

167
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,335
- By Cottonmouth, I'm assuming.
- Mmm-hmm.

168
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,505
Who?

169
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,923
[both chuckle]

170
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,635
- "Who?"
- Cottonmouth.

171
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,803
The man you stole from.

172
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,054
Dante's former boss.

173
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:47,683
The man who shot up Pop's Barber Shop

174
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,271
and killed a good
man trying to get at you.

175
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,653
Hey, look, we don't want you, Chico.

176
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,121
We want the people who killed

177
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:04,599
Shameek and who shot
up the barber shop.

178
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,827
Testify.

179
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,248
Do something good for somebody for once.

180
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,381
[breathing shakily] I
can't help you with that.

181
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,596
Hey, look, can y'all
please take off these handcuffs?

182
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,183
I'm the victim here. Me.

183
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,686
Talk to us. Talk to a grand jury.

184
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,356
You can save lives, Wilfredo.

185
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,900
Step up.

186
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,865
[grunts]

187
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,745
Well, the streets will handle it.

188
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,582
Just like they always do.

189
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,375
[exhales deeply]

190
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,714
[Chico breathing heavily]

191
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,676
[gasps]

192
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,096
Yeah, they will.

193
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,117
What are you doing?

194
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,705
[Scarfe] Letting you go.

195
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,207
Like you said...

196
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,460
you're the victim...

197
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,879
not a suspect, right?

198
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,839
So, go.

199
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,008
Wherever.

200
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,595
You got no clothes, you got no money.

201
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,348
And your friends are gonna be
looking to finish the job, right?

202
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,309
But you're a man.

203
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,646
You're gonna be just fine, Chico.

204
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,401
Chico is the man.

205
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,073
Pop was a friend.

206
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,828
- He deserves the best.
- Yeah.

207
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,456
I see you've been busy.

208
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,588
What about this man right here?

209
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,426
[Stokes] Tone?

210
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,471
I had to let him go.

211
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,558
Nothing humbles a man like gravity.

212
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,518
Hmm.

213
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,895
Remember...

214
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,815
same as always.

215
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,525
This body can't exist.

216
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,783
- What body?
- [chuckles]

217
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,119
- My man.
- [grunts]

218
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,588
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

219
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,051
[chuckles]

220
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,097
And there's the bartender.

221
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,265
Luke Cage.

222
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,437
Right in the center...
of the nightclub...

223
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,814
of the barber shop...

224
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,441
of everything.

225
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,528
- Where you going?
- To see a friend.

226
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,904
Mmm-mmm.

227
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,868
Woman, what's your
problem? I've done nothing.

228
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,079
There's only one person who
worked for both Pop and Cottonmouth,

229
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,831
and that's you.

230
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,207
In the past 72 hours,

231
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,919
three people connected are
dead. Shameek, Dante and Pop.

232
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,964
And there was another shooting this
morning tied to all of this.

233
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,167
Would you call that nothing?

234
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,592
And all that's on me?

235
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,096
Why don't y'all find Pop's killer instead
of being all up in my business?

236
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,476
Your business and our
investigation are one and the same.

237
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,858
You know where I live.

238
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,572
You wanna work some things out, hmm?

239
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,534
We can always do it there.

240
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,870
You can even bring handcuffs this time.

241
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,799
[Scarfe sighs]

242
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,883
[Misty sighs]

243
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,499
[Luke] <i>You don't have to worry.</i>

244
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,471
Cottonmouth ain't trying to kill you.

245
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,475
[scoffs] Are you kidding? Were
you at the same shootout as I was?

246
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,143
It was his boy, Tone.

247
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,937
Tone acted on his own.

248
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,190
And... he died on his own, too.

249
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,233
He's cleanin' up and I
ain't trying to be next.

250
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,654
Cottonmouth has his cash.
That's all he cares about.

251
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,449
Hell, you right about that.

252
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,535
Doesn't matter how many
people had to die to get it, huh?

253
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,178
Wasn't like the money fell in your lap.

254
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,081
Your hands have blood all over them.

255
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,333
That don't matter. I'm out.

256
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,588
- I've caused enough trouble.
- More than enough.

257
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,757
Pop signed his death warrant the
minute he decided to help you.

258
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,523
Well, it's the other
way around, ain't it?

259
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,263
The bullet that killed
Pops probably bounced off you.

260
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,934
You're one of them, ain't you?

261
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,313
You don't know nothin'.

262
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,232
I know this isn't my fault.

263
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,487
Parley or no parley, this
is on Cottonmouth.

264
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,576
[inhales deeply] So help me hurt him.

265
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,167
What do you want?

266
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,420
Before you guys decided to rob him...

267
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,383
how much did Dante tell you about
Cottonmouth's operations?

268
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,011
Everything.

269
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,263
Cottonmouth sells guns.

270
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,891
Mariah, his cousin, runs the banks.

271
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,977
- Where does all that money go?
- Everywhere you could think.

272
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,939
They got drops and stash
houses across the city.

273
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:13,110
Apartments, sham
businesses, street pushers.

274
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,029
I mean, they got it locked in.

275
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,072
Is there a final spot?

276
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,323
A central bank?

277
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,538
[Chico] <i>They got a
plan if shit goes down.</i>

278
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,332
<i>Everything goes to Crispus Attucks.</i>

279
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:32,462
<i>I even heard they got this
locked room, like a vault,</i>

280
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,882
<i>right in the middle of the whole joint.</i>

281
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,681
So why rob a gun shipment if it
was all just about a cash grab?

282
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,976
[scoffs] Are you crazy?

283
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,523
Man, Crispus Attucks is like a fortress.

284
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,776
I mean, they got concrete walls,

285
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,029
cats with machine guns,
machetes, dark hallways...

286
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,949
One entrance, one exit.

287
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,827
[stutters] It's like
a beehive of misery.

288
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,245
That place is a suicide
mission, for real.

289
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,586
Did Dante tell you where any
of these other stash houses are?

290
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,215
Yeah. I mean, yeah, we scoped a few out.

291
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,552
There was a shooting this morning.

292
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,596
A couple of Cottonmouth's
people got hit.

293
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,431
Yeah. I mean, the cops
got the guns at the heist.

294
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,059
And my guess is that's Domingo and them,

295
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,062
hollering at Cottonmouth to
let him know they ain't happy.

296
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,273
If they hit him a few more times...

297
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,819
Cottonmouth might just have to move
everything to Crispus to keep it safe.

298
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,032
[scoffs] You gonna try to
convince Domingo to hit 'em up?

299
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,076
No.

300
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,454
I don't need Domingo to be Domingo.

301
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,959
I can do that all by myself.

302
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:54,938
<i>- [man] All right, sound check.
- [soul music playing]</i>

303
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,714
<i>Let's hit it.</i>

304
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,799
[Charles Bradley singing]

305
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,170
- [door opens forcefully]
- Oh, shit.

306
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,838
[men grunting]

307
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,488
[Luke grunts]

308
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,107
- [officer 1] You see this?
- [officer 2] Yeah. Why leave the cash?

309
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,973
[clattering]

310
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,644
[glass shattering]

311
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,450
- [clattering]
- [glass shattering]

312
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,169
[Misty] Hey.

313
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,837
[woman speaking indistinctly on radio]

314
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,672
Hey...

315
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,465
you okay?

316
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,427
What the hell happened here?

317
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,432
Some dude in a hoodie rolled through.

318
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,600
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

319
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,064
"Rolled through"? Did you see his face?

320
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,649
Hey...

321
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,194
what can you tell me about him?

322
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,574
He was fine.

323
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,744
[scoffs]

324
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,709
What do you mean everything is fine?

325
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,336
Like I said, it's fine.

326
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:27,216
You've got welders reinforcing doors
to rooms I don't even go into.

327
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,383
What are they doing?

328
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,595
We got hit today. We
need to take precautions.

329
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:35,599
Get the bars down. Place looks
like a goddamn prison now.

330
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,726
And what do you mean "we"?

331
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,396
- You got hit again this morning?
- Four of my stash houses were hit today.

332
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,108
Fort Knox is my contingency plan.

333
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,318
It's always been the
plan if shit goes down.

334
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,196
That is not a plan. That's a reaction.

335
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,074
You ever hear of not
putting all your eggs in one basket?

336
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,617
Look at it.

337
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,702
One way in, one way out.

338
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,330
Sight lines as far as the eye can see.

339
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,458
Ain't nobody goin' up in the
projects. We got that shit on lockdown.

340
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,253
They are not projects. It's
going to be a community

341
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,297
as soon as I get the rest of the
funding and we start our construction.

342
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,758
[laughing]

343
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,718
That's just spin.

344
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,222
It's a front, Mariah. It's
always been a front.

345
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,099
It's real.

346
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,477
This affordable housing initiative
is going to change things, man.

347
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,105
Let me worry about the street shit.

348
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,690
- You're just the laundromat for the money.
- Uh, no, I'm not.

349
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,277
I'm the face on the money.

350
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,363
So what's that make me? Loose change?

351
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,615
You are a strong asset,

352
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,494
whose reckless
actions are often a liability.

353
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,041
Crispus Attucks is real, Cornell.

354
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,543
Nothing I do is a hustle.

355
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,256
I sincerely care about
what happens up here.

356
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,676
The only way to save
Harlem is to do it legally...

357
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,512
and fortify it against
the real invaders.

358
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,472
[laughs] Whatever.

359
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,476
It's the same as it always
was, and you know it.

360
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,228
Keep livin' in that fantasy land.

361
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,815
Well, it has got to be a
fantasy before it become a reality.

362
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,652
I mean, look around.

363
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,948
Mama Mabel loved this place.

364
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,827
It was her political connections got
that jungle gym over there built.

365
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,414
[laughs] We doin' this for jungle gyms?

366
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,960
Those political connections

367
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:30,422
were just freaky old men she blackmailed
to push the paperwork through.

368
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,799
Why do you think she
blackmailed those politicians?

369
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:36,428
It was all to serve a greater good.

370
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,180
Have you forgotten that?

371
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,101
No.

372
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,523
This building may be
your bank right now.

373
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,526
But the Crispus
Attucks, Madam C.J. Walker,

374
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,030
Adam Clayton Powell, Shirley
Chisholm complexes

375
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,408
will be vibrant
communities reflecting the change

376
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,996
that's gonna keep Harlem
black and us in the green.

377
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,749
You focus on the
black, I'll protect our green.

378
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,253
Fort Knox is central to that.

379
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,962
Just need to be ready.

380
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,383
I stay ready, baby.

381
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,991
How you doing, Ms.
Mariah? Good to see you.

382
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,374
[Scarfe] <i>Oh, it's gonna work.</i>

383
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:51,086
See, that's the thing about
a dude like Chico.

384
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,422
Trick is...

385
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,550
you gotta get inside his head. Uh-huh.

386
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:00,345
You gotta make him
believe that he needs us.

387
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,472
That's the whole trick.

388
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:06,476
And then... you give him
the illusion of freedom.

389
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,104
Hey.

390
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,149
You didn't hear a word I just said.

391
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,360
I'm sorry.

392
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,405
- I can't stop thinking about Pop.
- Hmm.

393
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,533
You knew him forever, huh?

394
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,702
Since I was nine.

395
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,620
He was the reason I played basketball.

396
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,541
- He was your coach?
- No. I never saw him outside the shop.

397
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,461
My dad used to drag me with him when
he went to go get his hair cut.

398
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,214
- Daddy's girl.
- Always.

399
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,592
They would sit around all the
time and just argue about basketball.

400
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,844
Larry Bird. Kevin McHale.

401
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,055
- Robert Parish...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

402
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,139
Celtics?

403
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,685
My dad is a Celtics fan.

404
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,021
Please, please tell
me that's not the case.

405
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:54,608
- The most progressive team in NBA history.
- The Celtics?

406
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,944
The first black head
coach with Bill Russell.

407
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,530
K.C. Jones as head coach during
the height of the '80s

408
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,449
with Bird and McHale. Come on.

409
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,409
Now I got it all figured out.

410
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,660
See...

411
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,247
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend

412
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,789
because you love the brothers,

413
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,267
and not many brothers
can get with a girl

414
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,253
who carry a gun and kick their
ass. But that's not the reason.

415
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,755
- Oh, so now you an expert?
- The reason is...

416
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,299
you're a Celtics fan living
in New York City. [chuckles]

417
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,468
I like the Pistons.

418
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,927
- Oh, shit!
- [laughs]

419
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:27,474
I would hear Pop and my dad argue
so much about basketball,

420
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,850
it made me wanna play.

421
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,644
So I did.

422
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,439
Pop would complain about
players who couldn't go left or right,

423
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,691
or box out, or hustle back on D.

424
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,360
So, I did.

425
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,445
Sounds like he taught you well.

426
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,116
I was playing college
ball before I realized

427
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,619
how much watching games at the
shop and those arguments shaped me.

428
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,580
[sighs] A lot of people loved this guy.

429
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:54,543
Even when it was
wild during the summers...

430
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,338
shootouts every other
day... the shop was safe.

431
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,508
Nobody ever said anything.

432
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,385
It just was.

433
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,719
Always.

434
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,889
Until...

435
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,268
- Until what?
- Until Luke Cage started workin' there.

436
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,149
You got a real problem with this guy.

437
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,696
Well, maybe, you shouldn't have jumped
in the sack with him so quickly.

438
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,074
- [scoffs]
- [chuckles]

439
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,034
How soon did it happen?

440
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,471
A couple days after you were
undercover at the Harlem's Paradise?

441
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,667
Same night.

442
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,212
[chuckles] Damn, girl!

443
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,505
[chuckles] His place or yours?

444
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,840
Shut up.

445
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:47,262
Look, I'm telling you, there is
just something about this dude.

446
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,888
- I can't put my finger on it.
- Mmm.

447
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,741
Sounds like you put a lot
more than your finger on him.

448
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,310
- Don't make me choke you out.
- Hey!

449
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,354
Watch the tofu supreme!

450
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,897
- [laughing]
- And watch the hair!

451
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,774
This takes time.

452
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,651
It's too much product.

453
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,458
[Domingo] Damn.

454
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:23,798
You can't really appreciate this
place till the lights are on.

455
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,300
Fall back, Zip.

456
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,681
Domingo's right.

457
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,185
When the lights are on...

458
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,688
you really can see
things for what they are.

459
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,816
[speaking Spanish]

460
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,779
- I got some verdad for you.
- Hmm.

461
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,282
We got hit. And it was you.

462
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,620
You didn't have to send no
mercs to break up my organization.

463
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,415
I think somebody's pulling your chain...

464
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,166
and using my name to do it.

465
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:03,087
'Cause if my people were
to hit you, you'd be dead.

466
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,172
[speaks Spanish]

467
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,599
[chuckles]

468
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,226
You know what a plover is, Cornell?

469
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:27,070
Plover bird sits inside
the crocodile's mouth.

470
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,447
This bird ain't stupid.

471
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:34,328
The plover picks scraps of
meat out of the crocodile's teeth,

472
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,163
helping the crocodile avoid infection.

473
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,750
And the plover... he gets a free meal.

474
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,461
[Stokes chuckles]

475
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:46,172
Where's this analogy
going, Animal Planet? [laughs]

476
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,178
You're a plover.

477
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,308
I'm a crocodile.

478
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,687
You peddle your
guns, picking up my scraps.

479
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,484
And I allow it.

480
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,118
So you admit raidin' me?

481
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,370
[scoffs]

482
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,479
- You think I need to bust your shit up?
- [wrapper crinkling]

483
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,298
You broke your word, Cornell.

484
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,720
How does Diamondback feel about that?

485
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,772
You didn't think I knew... who
your supplier was that night, huh?

486
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,485
I was just checking to see if
you would tell me the truth.

487
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,369
I want a refund.

488
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,204
- [scoffs]
- Or the product that was promised me.

489
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,291
[laughing] Oh, Domingo.

490
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,129
There ain't no return policy.

491
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,256
This ain't L.L. Bean.

492
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,340
[scoffs]

493
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,518
[breathes heavily]

494
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,269
[speaking Spanish]

495
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,203
Nice.

496
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,794
So? What's poppin'?

497
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,883
Better get that Spanish dictionary.

498
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,430
Domingo Colon just declared war on us.

499
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,111
[indistinct chatter]

500
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,301
[man] Councilwoman, let
me get that for you.

501
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,855
[hip-hop song playing]

502

00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,197
- Come here! Come here!
- [both grunting]

508
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:42,742
[guns firing]

509
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,869
- [bullets clattering]
- [Luke groaning]

510
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,290
[man] How the hell did he do that?

511
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,502
- [Luke grunting]
- [man groaning]

512
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,722
[men talking indistinctly]

513
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,601
[guns firing]

[all grunting]

[bone cracking]

517

[Scarfe] <i>It's a lot of money.</i>

524
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,197
What?

525
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,324
[Scarfe] <i>In the duffel
bags. It's a lot of money.</i>

526
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,993
Just give me a second.

527
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,328
[Scarfe] <i>Millions.</i>

528
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,922
It's you.

529
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,388
Damn it, you're doing it again. [sighs]

530
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,932
Damn it, you just
broke my concentration.

531
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:56,394
As usual, your priorities
are all out of whack.

532
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,858
Now, you're looking at a
picture of an empty husk of a building.

533
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,402
I'm looking at millions
of dollars of contraband.

534
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,780
You know this money belongs
to Cottonmouth.

535
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,197
- Allegedly.
- [sighs]

536
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,991
Allegedly.

537
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,745
Thing I can't figure out...

538
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,164
why would somebody...

539
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,166
go through all this hell outside,

540
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,127
cause all this mayhem, and
then leave the money behind?

541
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,050
[sighs] To take it off the streets.

542
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,093
Once it's logged,

543
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:32,138
whoever it belongs to doesn't
have access to it anymore.

544
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,348
That's quite a message someone's
trying to send.

545
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,852
All that gunfire and no bodies.

546
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,104
Oh, you got that right.

547
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,900
They are nobodies. [sighing]

548
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,610
I mean, no bodies.

549
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,196
Not one.

550
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,575
Some big black dude in a
hoodie takes on direct bullet shots...

551
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,911
slaps, punches and pulls
people all over the place

552
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,704
and doesn't kill a single one?

553
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,497
That doesn't seem strange to you?

554
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,584
It's like this person wanted
us to shut this place down.

555
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,169
Who cares?

556
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,880
What?

557
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,548
I'm serious.

558
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,426
Who cares?

559
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,598
How many investigations, from the
time we put boots on the ground,

560
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,517
begin and end in these projects?

561
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,811
Dozens.

562
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,645
And now somebody comes along

563
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:26,985
and wants to clean up a year's
worth of patrol work by himself?

564
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,071
[stammers] I don't see
anything wrong with that.

565
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,865
A vigilante?

566
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,908
Yeah, there's something wrong with that.

567
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:37,411
It's anarchy, a complete
breakdown of the system.

568
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,705
There are rules and
regulations to what we do.

569
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:44,961
Yeah, and lawyers... and
paperwork and excuses.

570
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,672
Other than mopping up blood...

571
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:52,468
and arresting the same
piece of shit over and over,

572
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,637
you know, not much we can do as cops.

573
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,306
Jesus, Scarfe, whose side are you on?

574
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,267
I saw the incident up close.

575
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,811
What we can do as
cops, what we can't do.

576
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,315
Now, unless this
sidearm that I'm wearing

577
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:09,318
suddenly turns into some
kind of magic hammer...

578
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,029
this whole job is irrelevant. [scoffs]

579
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,490
They have no training.

580
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,492
No responsibility.

581
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,411
You have to know what you're doing.

582
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:23,082
They don't have the right to just
start meting out justice. Come on.

583
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,544
Some guy in a hoodie...

584
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:30,423
hits various gun-running
spots around the city today?

585
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,840
I think that's wonderful.

586
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,176
I think we should thank him.

587
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,469
- For doing our job?
- Exactly.

588
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,721
I don't like paperwork...

589
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,486
but I'd rather get a
paper cut on my finger

590
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,142
than a bullet in my ass.

591
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,020
Look at... Look at
all them rounds. Look.

592
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,873
You really wanna be in
the middle of all this?

593
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,524
And for what? [stutters]
For a chicken banquet dinner

594
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,110
and a photo with the mayor
as a reward? [scoffing]

595
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,778
- Hell, no.
- Wow.

596
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:58,076
You are a credit to the badge, Scarfe.

597
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,785
[cell phone ringing]

598
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,830
Hello.

599
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,083
Glad to hear it.

600
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,045
Where?

601
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,592
We'll be there.

602
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,385
- It has to be you.
- [Scarfe] Uh-huh.

603
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,471
I'll pick you up out front.

604
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,349
That was Chico.

605
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,810
He wants to talk, needs a pick up.

606
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,564
- This is where you say, "I told you so"?
- Somethin' like that.

607
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,442
- You coming?
- No.

608
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:35,238
Your guy in the hoodie left
plenty for the real cops to clean up.

609
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,950
I'll get Chico to give up
the ghost. We got rapport.

610
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,119
Yeah, you're all about rapport.

611
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,204
Oh, you know that.

612
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,372
See you when I see you.

613
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,000
[scoffs]

614
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,128
Did you see the guy who attacked you?

615
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,089
[tsks] Man, I ain't see shit.

616
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,424
I really need that trademark.

617
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,807
[ship horn blaring]

618
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:07,186
[Scarfe] I was always
a Jumbo's guy myself.

619
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,939
Used to love Willie
Burger back in the day.

620
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,153
But I can't give up
the fries. [chuckling]

621
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,362
True.

622
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,033
Where's Detective Knight?

623
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:22,701
Busy.

624
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,706
I suppose you heard about...

625
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,293
what happened at the
Crispus Attucks today.

626
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,173
That's why I called.

627
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:39,593
It's my turn.

628
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,347
Your turn for what?

629
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,018
Tell you everything.

630
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,023
I'm listening.

631
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,653
Somebody told me...

632
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,988
we owe it to Pops to come forward.

633
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,452
He did his part.

634
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,162
I gotta do mine.

635
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,959
I'm ready to talk.

636
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,338
Cottonmouth.

637
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,132
I'll name names, dates.

638
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,759
The whole nine.

639
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:26,807
Pop...

640
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:31,229
he used to always talk to
me about responsibility.

641
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:34,982
About being a man.

642
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,445
Standing up straight.

643
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,825
He told me to take charge.

644
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,287
Forward, never backwards.

645
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,709
[stutters]

646
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,337
Luke Cage, I don't even... [gasps]

647
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,422
[Scarfe grunting]

648
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,174
[choking]

649
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,484
[panting]

650
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:24,948
[sniffs]

651
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,609
[glass shattering]

652
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:03,779
- $7 million!
- Cornell!

653
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,240
You don't wanna be in my
face right now, Mariah!

654
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,909
If anybody should be breaking
shit, it should be me!

655
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,620
They hit my office. My office!

656
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,789
They took damn near every penny I got,

657
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,392
and you up here talkin' about an office?

658
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,376
You can always make more money.

659
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,128
I can't get my name back.

660
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:24,049
And somebody is gonna
start asking questions.

661
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:27,261
- Step off, Cornell!
- Shut up, Black Mariah.

662
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,264
That's my shit to break!

663
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,935
You better shut up, or I will
cut your color-struck ass.

664
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,061
Call me that again.

665
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,897
Uh, Mr. Stokes?

666
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,400
Spit it out.

667
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,653
There's... There's a
detective here to see you.

668
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,698
The cops are here?

669
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,663
- Detective.
- Well, I've had warmer receptions.

670
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:59,084
What's the use of having a pig on
payroll if you can't get no early intel?

671
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,255
[scoffing] Oh, I've got
your intel. Swinging.

672
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:03,839
[chuckles softly]

673
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,637
Oh, yeah.

674
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,768
[pouring drink]

675
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,730
[grunts]

676
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:27,488
Anything related to how I
lost 80% of my cash reserves?

677
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,533
Maybe. Maybe.

678
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:37,415
In my trunk, you will
find a deceased individual.

679
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,125
One Wilfredo "Chico" Diaz.

680
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,169
I'm sure your homie down
at Spurlock's Mortuary

681
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,587
can hook you up.

682
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,300
So that's off your
plate. You're welcome.

683
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,263
What else you got for me?

684
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,557
What else I got for ya?

685
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,311
What else I got... Oh, well...

686
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:01,229
I know who's been busting
up your shit all day,

687
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:04,900
and who raided the
projects... all by himself.

688
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,905
Don't imagine you know anything about...

689
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,659
Luke Cage, do you?

690
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,744
Luke Cage?

691
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,623
That's who did all this shit?

692
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,334
That's what I'm telling you.

693
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:26,296
And as a proud NYPD detective...

694
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,757
see, my partner and I, well...

695
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:30,593
we're accountable for each other.

696
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,929
We need to know each
other's whereabouts, 24/7.

697
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:37,516
And thanks to my
partner's GPS on her phone,

698
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,310
I got Mr. Cage's home address.

699
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,520
And I will give it to you...

700
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:44,022
if you're a good boy.

701
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,315
[chuckles]

702
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:48,819
Virginia Slim...

703
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,030
you just might prove to be useful.

704
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,907
Virginia Slim, what's that?

705
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,535
What else do you
call a skinny white bitch?

706
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:57,995
[laughs]

707
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,957
Time for me to go
holler at the dishwasher.

708
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,166
Personally.

709
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,464
Don't want to know the
details. Just get it done.

710
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,885
[music playing faintly]

711
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,438
[grunts]

712
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,107
[door closes]

713
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,610
Goddamn, negro.

714
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,155
You all right? What happened
to you? You get hit by a bus?

715
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,241
Swear jar.

716
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:37,325
You cursed.

717
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:41,497
Swear jar? Come on, man. I...

718
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,999
All right, look, I don't
have anything on me now.

719
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:55,636
[Luke] Yeah, you do.

720
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,558
Now you've got
change that can make change.

721
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,479
- [sighs]
- What the hell did you do?

722
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:09,650
Oh, can you forget the
swear jar for a minute?

723
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,236
What the...

724
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,246
Where'd all this money come from?

725
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:27,042
Bank's not worried about
it... neither should you.

726
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,087
Use it for this.

727
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,049
You ain't gotta tell me twice.

728
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,677
Ask no questions, tell no lies.

729
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,888
I'll call some people and we
get started on this in here.

730
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,349
Good.

731
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,519
I see you been at it.

732
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,604
[scoffs] Yeah.

733
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,522
You, too.

734
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,111
Why haven't you gone home yet?

735
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,946
[sighs]

736
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,657
Couldn't leave this
place lookin' so bad.

737
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,744
That was the thing about Pops.
He had a lot of pride in detail.

738
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:05,623
Like that gold leaf window with
the Pop's Barber Shop logo?

739
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:09,084
[chuckles] I polished it every day.

740
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:13,213
P-O-P. Had to
be spotless.

741
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,007
[chuckling]

742
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,801
First thing Pop said
when he hired me was,

743
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,137
"You do windows, brother."

744
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,598
- That wasn't no question.
- [both chuckling]

745
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,684
[sighs]

746
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,651
We need this place open.

747
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,069
I know.

748
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,366
You gonna run it?

749
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,536
I ain't no barber.

750
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:44,912
What about you?

751
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,330
[sighing]

752
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:52,002
Another question for
another time, my man.

753
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:57,132
We gotta figure out something
soon either way.

754
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,220
[sighs] I will.

755
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,140
You should know that about me by now.

756
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,768
I like to get things done.

757
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,437
Oh...

758
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,855
Where you goin' now?

759
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,108
I'm starving.

760
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,032
[whistles softly]

761
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:29,915
[sighs]

762
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,421
I've never seen you eat so much.

763
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,633
I guess I worked up a
bit of an appetite today.

764
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,343
Did you go for your run?

765
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,429
Something like that.

766
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,525
The food wasn't that good.

767
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,737
I just wanted to make things right.

768
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,366
Where'd the money come from?

769
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,993
It doesn't matter.

770
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,496
What matters is what you do with it.

771
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:34,271
Sweet sister!

772
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,526
[chuckles]

773
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,416
