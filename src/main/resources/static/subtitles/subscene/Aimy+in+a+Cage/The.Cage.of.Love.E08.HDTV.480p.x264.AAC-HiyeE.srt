00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,390
<i> Episode 8 </i>

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,450
Don't bother yourself with this.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,810
What arrangements? I didn't see any.

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,480
She's making your mind restless!

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,290
Brother. Don't forget

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,100
how father died and mom fell sick.

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,140
I'm calculating it in my head.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,310
I don't need you to teach me what to do. Go back to work.

10
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,650
I have already done this.

11
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,710
<i>I wonder how Uncle Fu is doing lately.</i>

12
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,710
<i>I deserve to die. I even forgot about this.</i>

13
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,720
It's time to eat. Come.

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,030
<i>Let's eat. It's time to eat.</i>

15
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,460
<i>Everyone , come over and eat.</i>

16
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,740
- Is anyone there?
- Coming.

17
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,910
- Miss.
- Uncle Fu.

18
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,170
I won't trouble you. I still need to go back to the factory to work.

19
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,960
I came over to visit you. These are snacks.

20
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,500
Dan Ke!

21
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,310
Miss is here. Greet her now.

22
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,150
- Dad.
- No need.

23
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,080
Hello, Miss.

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,150
I'm fine.

25
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,240
Miss. You are really our great saviour.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,270
I'm not a saviour. Actually, I'm really sorry for last time.

27
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,870
Thus, I specially came here to ask if you had found a new job.

28
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,240
Miss, didn't you already arrange for Dan Ke to work at Ling Long?

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,670
You are really a saviour to our family.

30
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,980
Look.

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,920
You didn't blame me for my mistake and even got Dan Ke a job. I can grow old without worries.

32
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,740
I really don't understand how I could have secured Dan Ke a job if my own position is still unstable.

33
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,330
Other than you, who would treat us that well?

34
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,410
<i>Could it be Shao Tian?</i>

35
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,360
- Mom, look!
- That's not good, it's so dirty!

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,320
Cai Yue. What do you think of this dress?

37
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,060
It's very pretty.

38
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,070
- Mom.
- Why did you stop me?

39
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,670
Don't go in. It's not like you don't know that we can't afford these things now.

40
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,750
- Can't I just take a look?
- You can't.

41
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,270
- Just a glance.
- No.

42
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,660
One glance.

43
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,270
Just a glance.

44
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,370
- Let's go.
- Mom.

45
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,000
- Mom, don't go in.
- We are already in.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,300
Let's take a look first.

47
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,430
Get a cup of tea for me.

48
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,670
Look at this. Isn't it beautiful?

49
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,330
It looks especially nice.

50
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,820
It's really nice.

51
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,380
Look.

52
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,130
Look at the embroidery...

53
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,560
Isn't this Madam Wu from Ling Long?

54
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,490
I said the wrong thing.

55
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,250
It should be Mrs Jiang.

56
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,960
Madam Zhang, you are here.

57
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,720
- Madam Zhang.
- What nonsense are you spouting? We own a factory and

58
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,530
our business is big.

59
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,520
We have made enough money and are tired.

60
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,890
We want to take a break.

61
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,710
Enjoy life!

62
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,960
Miss, don't say anymore.

63
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,330
Madam Wu. This dress is very expensive.

64
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,160
It can easily get snagged on something!

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,120
That's right. This dress

66
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,600
was specially prepared for Madam Zhang.

67
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,490
That's right. If you want to buy this, you wouldn't be able to afford it.

68
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,070
- Just don't touch anything.
- That's right.

69
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,560
Who says I can't afford it?

70
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,120
I like this very much. I'm buying this today. Wrap it up.

71
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,500
- Mom.
- Xiao Lin.

72
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,230
Wrap up this dress for me.

73
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,900
Yes, Madam Zhang.

74
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,410
Give it to me.

75
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,670
Mom, let go.

76
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,150
- Mom!
- Forget it.

77
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,060
The dress depends on who the owner is.

78
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,540
With your identity, this dress doesn't suit you.

79
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,310
Who says that it doesn't suit me?

80
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,210
What's so great about you? In the past, you were trailing behind me.

81
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,170
- What are you acting like right now?
- What kind of person are you?!

82
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,370
Madame Zhao, don't mind her!

83
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,570
- It's not worth it.
- Who do you think you are?

84
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,720
Do you think you are still Madam Wu of the past?

85
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,690
You have no factory, no money, and no house! I'm being polite by calling you Madam!

86
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,590
Who says I don't have any money? I can't even spend what I have.

87
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,030
- You must be dreaming.
- Why did you push me?

88
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,730
So what if I push you?

89
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,690
Your husband is already dead and you still want to dress well? Who's going to look at you?

90
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,660
I know now. It must be for that Zhou Shao Tian.

91
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,730
That Zhou Shao Tian is really something, going around with you three people!

92
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,100
What are you talking about? So shameless.
What has it got to do with my daughter?

93
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,860
- So what if I say that about you?
- Nonsense!

94
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,640
- Who's spouting nonsense
- Who's spouting nonsense?

95
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,530
I'm going to hit you today.

96
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,340
- I'm going to hit you!
- Mom!

97
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,830
- Who says you can spout nonsense?
- Stop fighting.

98
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,700
- Mom...
- Leave now.

99
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,420
Don't shut the door.

100
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,710
Mom, forget it. Don't be so angry.

101
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,230
I'm furious. I have never been this furious before.

102
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,500
Just wait and see. Wait until I'm living well.

103
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,820
I will be back to see you kneel in front of me and beg.

104
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,680
Mom. They have poor taste.

105
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,110
Don't argue with them anymore.

106
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,920
Let's go home now.

107
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,880
Look. Your hair is a mess.

108
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,160
So embarrassing. Let's leave now.

109
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,520
Listen well, daughter. It's up to you whether I can vent my anger in this lifetime.

110
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,270
Mom. What can I do?

111
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,440
You fool.

112
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,260
Youth? Youth is an asset.

113
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,950
Look at you now. You are so beautiful.

114
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,310
You have to find a man with money and power. Help me vent my anger.

115
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,840
Don't be like your sister! That Zhou Shao Tian,

116
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,330
he's so poor.

117
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,160
When I talk about him, I feel so frustrated.

118
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,940
Don't be angry. Actually, I think Brother Shao Tian is a good man.

119
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,500
Mom. Why did you hit me?

120
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,720
Can't I hit you? Just like your sister.

121
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,670
Seriously.

122
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,700
- You are so hateful.
- You are hateful.

123
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,600
Let's go. So hateful.

124
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,170
Miss.

125
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,710
- Hello, Miss
- Don't call me this anymore.

126
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,710
It's still the same.

127
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,150
Where is Uncle Fu's son working now?

128
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,380
That guy might not be very smart, but he's pretty strong.

129
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,370
He's in the warehouse.

130
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,900
Go back to work then.

131
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,790
I will teach you how to carry goods today.

132
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,720
Look carefully. I will demonstrate it to you.

133
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,350
Kneel down first.

134
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,190
Grab the rope.

135
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,850
Put it on your shoulder.

136
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,300
Come.

137
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,870
Get up slowly.

138
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,730
Use your shoulder to lift it.

139
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,040
These are very heavy, you have to bend your back.

140
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,900
You won't get hurt this way. Try it.

141
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,760
Not this way.

142
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,880
Bend down first so that you won't get hurt.

143
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,360
Get up slowly.

144
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,080
It's okay. Let's do it again.

145
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,350
Okay.

146
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,070
Are you hungry?

147
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,080
Here. Wipe your sweat.

148
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,920
- Okay.
- I will take you to have a feast later. Okay?

149
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,400
- Okay.
- Okay. What do you like to eat?

150
00:08:51,400 --> 00:09:00,250
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

151
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,630
What's wrong?

152
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,270
Thank you.

153
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,300
For what?

154
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,850
Thank you for helping the Fu family.

155
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,090
I'm not concerned about him.

156
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,920
I just pity him.

157
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,870
As for you, don't be so sweet with your words.

158
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,670
You will very quickly regret thanking me.

159
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,910
I'm not surprised that you say that.

160
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,440
Its because I am ready any time.

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,230
You are not afraid?

162
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,250
You should be the one who's afraid.

163
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,170
Harming someone is just like harming yourself.

164
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,790
You don't need to worry about this.

165
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,790
Go out.

166
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,940
Wu Cai Hong.

167
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,350
I'm warning you.

168
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,980
You don't need to be concerned about my brother.

169
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,790
If you plan to remain here at Ling Long,

170
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,420
you will definitely regret it.

171
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,240
Perhaps, the person who will regret it is not me.

172
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,250
Do you know that

173
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,460
people like you who are full of yourself... other people find you very hateful.

174
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,930
I don't need anyone to like me.

175
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,830
Don't say that I didn't advise you.

176
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,010
My brother is a good person. But to you,

177
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,140
he is a monster.

178
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,490
There will come a day when he will make you miserable.

179
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,410
Thank you for your advice.

180
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:24,840
I will personally watch you fall into despair.

181
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,920
You're wrong, I was already in a pit of despair.

182
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,360
Thus, the one who will fall won't be me.

183
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,270
It will be you both.

Wish them a good future relationship!

189
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,730
Wait. What did you say?

190
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,170
Give me one.

191
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,090
- Here.
- Thanks.

Headline, Headline! Wu Hong Da's daughter, Wu Cai Hong...

193
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,360
This wench has been hiding from me.

194
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,950
Cao Hong, you are back.

195
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,660
Look at you. Why do you look so tired?

196
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,710
A girl should put on more make-up

197
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,390
and have a trendier hairstyle.

198
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,190
Your identity is different now.

199
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,710
You can't be so casual anymore.

200
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,410
What kind of identity do I have now?

201
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,210
Look at you. You don't need to feel bad anymore. You are even hiding it from me.

202
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,590
Look. Everyone in Huzhou already knows.

203
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,330
I definitely agree and give you my consent to be with Jiang Yu.

204
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,420
Aunt, don't believe this rumour.

205
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,950
This child. In terms of wealth and appearances,

206
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,120
he may have nothing to say.

207
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,670
Don't just choose anyone. Don't tell me you are going to choose that poor guy, Zhou Shao Tian?

208
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,500
Who says so?

209
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,300
If it wasn't for Jiang Yu, would our family have come to this state?

210
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,510
You must not say this. The police already investigated and said that he's not the killer.

211
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:52,490
If you talk about him acquiring Ling Long, then, in the future, you can be Mrs Jiang.

212
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,230
Ling Long will belong to you too.

213
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,780
How can you think like this! If you want to push me to the enemy,

214
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,700
you should ask my father in heaven!

215
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,570
How could you say this?

216
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,150
How could you not understand? I'm doing this for our family.

217
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,820
I only want you and your sister to live a good life and find a good man.

218
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,740
What's wrong with Jiang Yu? What are you still not satisfied with?

219
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,410
What's with wealth and power? Are you living just for wealth?!

220
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,410
After father passed away, I haven't seen you do anything for him!

221
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,280
Sis, Mom. What are you doing?

222
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,690
No matter what, I'm still your stepmother.

223
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,670
I don't need you to teach me.

224
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,710
Stop there.

225
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,600
Cai Hong.

226
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,150
Cai Hong. What's wrong with you?

227
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,020
Look at your face.

228
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,660
Wasn't everything going well? Why did you start fighting?

229
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,770
I'm fine.

230
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,200
My aunt just talks without thinking. I won't take her words to heart.

231
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,370
You're always like this, always carrying the burdens by yourself.

232
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,290
I already told you that I can help you to shoulder your burdens

233
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,030
Although I'm still thankful to Madam Wu.

234
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,330
Why?

235
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:23,830
By doing that, she let me reflect a lot on myself.

236
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,330
I have alway been someone didn't dare to make any decisions.

237
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:39,090
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

238
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:47,210
I think that this is a declaration of war, not a resignation letter.

239
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,120
It's good that you know.

240
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,350
Whatever harm you caused Cai Hong, I will give it back to you.

241
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,010
I will be waiting.

242
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,780
Starting from now, I will do everything to protect Cai Hong

243
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:09,810
and make you leave Ling Long. I will make you unable to continue your dyeing industry in Huzhou.

244
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,910
I will also find the evidence that you killed Boss Wu.

245
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,280
Don't let me be disappointed in you.

246
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,720
Goodbye.

247
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,210
Cai Hong, come here.

248
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,890
It's just ahead.

249
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,470
Brother Shao Tian. Where are we going?

250
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,000
Close your eyes first.

251
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,430
Close your eyes first.

252
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,260
Okay, I will close my eyes. Tell me where we are going.

253
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,130
Okay.

254
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,880
Wait.

255
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,440
Be careful. Don't make me trip.

256
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,520
Don't go anywhere else. Just follow me.

257
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,670
We will be there soon.

258
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,030
- Don't open your eyes.
- We are not there yet?

259
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,100
We will be there soon.

260
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,970
We are here.

261
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,360
Don't move.

262
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,680
Brother Shao Tian. Can I open my eyes now?

263
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,470
Okay.

264
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,450
Open your eyes now.

265
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,690
It's yours?

266
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,480
- Is this for real?
- Yes.

267
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,160
But where did you get the money from?

268
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,380
It's from the bank.

269
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,450
It's great that you are able to start your own shop. I'm happy for you.

270
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,900
You are right. This shop doesn't only belong to me.

271
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,030
It's yours too.

272
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,920
It should make us happy.

273
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,370
I didn't help you at all.

274
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,880
It's just a small shop now

275
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,460
but I believe that with our hard work,

276
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,810
we can quickly pay off all our debt.

277
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:39,640
There will come a day with Fu Sheng will be like Ling Long. Moreover, it will also surpass Ling Long.

278
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,520
Brother Shao Tian. Do you know that I have always had a guilty conscious?

279
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,070
I dragged you down and caused you to leave Ling Long.

280
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,730
I didn't imagine that you would start a small shop on your own when you left Ling Long.

281
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,380
I'm really very happy.

282
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,110
Thanks.

283
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:03,120
By the way, I will operate my shop tomorrow. I hope that you would come.

284
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,580
Of course. I will take leave and come here.

285
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,490
The rest are not important. It's more that important that you will be there alone.

286
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,180
Me alone?

287
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:21,620
I was just joking. I really need a hand now. I hope that you will come over and help me.

288
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,760
I can't leave Ling Long now.

289
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,450
Why?

290
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,410
Is it because of your father's case?

291
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,910
Even if many people forgot about it, I won't.

292
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,490
Father fell to his death in front of my eyes. If I don't get to the bottom of this,

293
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,350
I won't feel assured.

294
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,910
Aso that I can find out the truth, I can't leave Ling Long.

295
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,110
But I'm worried about you staying with Ling Long.

296
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,050
Why would you worry?

297
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,570
Jiang Yu doesn't have a hold on me, he won't do anything to me.

298
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,430
Don't worry about me.

299
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,160
Okay.

300
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,370
I respect your decision

301
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,680
but Fu Sheng and I will wait for you.

302
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,700
You are welcome to come back anytime.

303
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,090
Thanks.

304
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,660
Thank you too.

305
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,300
<i>-Congratulations.
-This way, please.</i>

306
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,960
<i>- May you prosper.
- Please take a look around.</i>

307
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,320
<i>I hope your business prospers.</i>

308
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,690
<i>Please look around.</i>

309
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,310
Boss Jiang. I would like to take time off. I'm going out at noon.

310
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,930
You still need to memorise over thirty types of flowers.

311
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,380
Manage your time.

312
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,120
I know. I will be back.

313
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,880
You are not allowed to go.

314
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,330
But you already gave me your consent this morning.

315
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,400
It's because I just found out that today is the opening of Fu Sheng.

316
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,870
I don't care whether you agree now or not, I'm going.

317
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,140
Fu Sheng won't last for long. It will be a waste of time for you to go.

318
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,980
Are you really going to be like this?

319
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,360
You are really so petty.

320
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,740
I just remembered that I have a party to go to as well.

321
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,650
If you want to go that much, if you don't mind, you can go with a petty person like me.

322
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,380
So how?

323
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,420
Didn't you want to go? Why aren't you moving?

324
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,830
What are you trying to do?

325
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,240
What do you think I'm trying to do?

326
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,040
Someone like you is capable of doing anything.

327
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,890
He personally gave me an invitation.

328
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,360
If I don't go, it will be a waste of his sincerity.

329
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,600
<i>Thank you for hosting this today.</i>

330
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,840
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

331
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,540
<i>I hope that everyone will drink and enjoy themselves.</i>

332
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,490
<i>Please stay.</i>

333
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,410
<i>Don't mention it.</i>

334
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,570
Cai Hong.

335
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,370
Brother Shao Tian.

336
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,290
I want to thank your boss.

337
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,670
Without you, Cai Hong wouldn't have come to this event today.

338
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,310
Without you, there won't be a Fu Sheng today.

339
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,690
So polite?

340
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:15,090
I have seen a lot of this kind of business in Huzhou where they start operations today and fold the next day.

341
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,400
If I didn't come today, I would have made a mistake. <i>missed seeing the business open.</i>

342
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,770
No matter what, I'm better than a person who lives off others.

343
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,470
Looks like I really wronged you.

344
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,210
You both drank quite a lot. Please talk less.

345
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,760
- I will let you talk then.
- Boss Jiang, I would like to ask a favour from you.

346
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,740
Let Cai Hong go.

347
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,110
It's me who doesn't want to let her go now

348
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,740
or is it you instead?

349
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,990
Leave with me.

350
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:01,430
Okay, you can go back on your own today. I will do this myself.

351
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,420
Shao Tian. Who is that?

352
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,660
The new boss of Ling Long, Jiang Yu.

353
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,520
Jiang Yu?

354
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,210
His family name is Jiang.

355
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,290
It's really Young Master Jiang.

356
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,110
Be careful.

357
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,010
Be careful.

358
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,510
Stop the carriage. Jiang Yu, are you crazy?

359
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,090
If you want to die, I don't.

360
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,690
What? Do you want to find your Brother Shao Tian?

361
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,380
I won't allow you.

362
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,870
Stop the carriage.

363
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,920
Are you crazy? You don't even want your life?

364
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,630
I can tell that you drank too much. You are the one who doesn't want your life. Let go.

365
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,040
I'm not letting you go.

366
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,150
- Let me go.
- I won't. So how?

367
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,440
- Let go.
- No.

368
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,310
I don't want to see you again.

369
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,500
- <i>Let me go.
- No.</i>

370
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,030
- <i>Let me go.
- No.</i>

371
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,380
<i>Let me go.</i>

372
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:34,480
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

373
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,540
<i>Fine. I respect your decision.</i>

374
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,300
<i>But Fu Sheng and I will wait for you.</i>

375
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,480
- Miss Wu.
- Why is it you?

376
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,110
Cai Hong.

377
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:42,600
- You know each other?
- You know him?

378
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,740
He was my neighbour when we were young. His name is Ma Li.

379
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,040
I needed a new employee to help me manage the shop. It just so happens that he also needed money to raise his family.

380
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,400
Thus, he came to help me.

381
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,070
How do you know each other?

382
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,190
You are still talking about it? Previously...

383
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,380
Brother, it's like this.

384
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,470
I was driving a carriage not for long when Miss Wu was my customer.

385
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,560
I wasn't familiar with the road and got lost with Miss Wu.

386
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,610
Miss Wu took me for a bad person and hit me.

387
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:14,330
I see. This is definitely a misunderstanding.

388
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,440
Ah Li and I grew up together. I know what kind of person he is.

389
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,740
He wouldn't dare to do that kind of stuff.

390
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,320
That's right, too.

391
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,900
If you weren't a bad guy, I shouldn't have bullied you.

392
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,170
Since this was a misunderstanding, don't talk about it anymore. Go back to work now.

393
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,410
Okay.

394
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,500
Cai Hong. Why are you here looking for me?

395
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:48,380
Actually, I have been thinking about something for a long time.

396
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,200
I think you are right. I shouldn't remain at Ling Long.

397
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,390
Thus, I will come and help you out here.

398
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,620
Really?

399
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,830
Hello, Boss.

400
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:24,890
Boss. The dye for this month will be running out soon.

401
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,910
Which house is the closest?

402
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,780
Also, we decreased by 10%.

403
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:36,730
There's also thirteen accounts receivable left, and we reminded them to hurry up with it.

404
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,350
Brother.

405
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,510
Please sign this document.

406
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,030
Wu Cai Hong is becoming more impossible.

407
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:26,090
She is still not at work yet. Help me to check. You must punish her properly.

408
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,310
Brother, no need.

409
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,930
Wu Cai Hong already sent someone to deliver a letter.

410
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,730
She said that she quit.

411
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,640
Who says she can resign?

412
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,730
What's wrong? You can't bear to see her go?

413
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,420
Ling Long is not a place where she can simply come and go.

414
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,280
Brother, leaving her here is a burden. She finally wants to go,

415
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,770
why must you insist that she comes back?

416
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,010
To add further,

417
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:01,100
with her here, we'll always be looking behind our backs. Who knows, maybe one day we'll get sent back to the police station!

418
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,650
Where did she go?

419
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,010
How would I know?

420
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:11,040
But I guess that, other than Zhou Shao Tian,

421
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,340
where else would she go?

422

- Wu Long, where are you?

443
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,540
- Come out now.
- What are you doing?

444
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,410
The cat made a lot of noise last night. I couldn't sleep.

445
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:20,460
The cat cried the entire night?

446
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,350
I think it's your heart which had been crying the whole night instead.

447
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,550
Wu Long.

448
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,720

♫<i> but I've already fallen in love with your tenderness. </i>♫

451
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,680
Brother Shao Tian. Don't be affected by what my aunt said.

452
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,230
If not, I really don't know how to face you.

453
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:11,910
Cai Hong. Whatever others say or think, I don't care about them.

454
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,350
What I care about is what you you think.

455
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,490
When my father passed away,

456
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:26,030
I remember that you had always been helping me.

457
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,170
You took care of my family.

458
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,370
I'm really very grateful to you.

459
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:36,070
I don't want to hear your words of thanks.

460
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:43,170
It's because it makes me feel that I'm very distant from you.

461
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,800
I don't mean that.

462
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,800
I know that.

463
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,980
Cai Hong.

464
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:59,030
Even though you only take me for a brother, I will always take care of you,

465
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:04,140
and do anything for you.

466

♫<i>I can't help but believe in fate</i>♫

467
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:15,710
This is not something precious, but I made this bracelet from strands I dyed myself.

468
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:24,900
The bracelet is very similar to you and has the same name.

469
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,670
Frankly,

470
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:36,070
I didn't know how to hand this to you.

471
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:42,360
I thought about this for a long time for many reasons too but it couldn't represent my heart.

472
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,130
I finally thought it through.

473
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,460
What I want to say is this.

474
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,760
Cai Hong.

475
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,360
Let's be together and let me take care of you.

481
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,550
<i>If you are not happy, you can scram and go back with her.</i>

482

483
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,930
<i>Jiang Yu. What are you doing?</i>

484
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,950
<i>- Ask her.
- Don't let me see you bully her again.</i>

Don't be in a hurry to reply me.

We don't need to rush this. Moreover, you just started your business.

00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,550
Of course, I want to rush it.
