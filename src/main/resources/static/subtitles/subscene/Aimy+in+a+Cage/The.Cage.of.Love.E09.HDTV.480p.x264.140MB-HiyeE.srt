The Cage of Love

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,400
<i>Episode 9 </i>

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,600
Help me to put it on.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,400
You agree?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,900
Wu Cai Hong!

6
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,400
By the way, Brother Shao Tian,

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,200
I just remembered that Cai Yue wanted me to help her with her homework. I'll leave first.

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,800
- I will take you there.
- No need.

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,900
Cai Hong has decided to leave Ling Long

10
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,000
for Fu Sheng. In the future, don't look for her anymore.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,700
It seems like I didn't allow her to leave Ling Long.

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,800
It's not important whether you did or not.

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,400
What's important is that she has already decided.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,000
Furthermore, she is my girlfriend now.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,400
She is only just a girlfriend?

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,600
So what?

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
We will get married soon

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,200
and manage Fu Sheng together.

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,000
What are you afraid of?

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,200
What else can you do?

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Make a guess.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,000
No matter what you do,

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,300
Cai Hong is mine.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,600
Wu Long.

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,900
Wu Long.

26
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,000
Wu Long.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Wu Long. Where are you? Come out now.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
Wu Long. Be good. Where are you?

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,500
Listen to me carefully.

30
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,200
If you don't find the cat,

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,000
no one is allowed to sleep.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,100
Go and look now.

33
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,600
Wu Long.

34
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,800
Wu Long, be good.

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,600
I found the cat.

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,800
Young Master, I found Wu Long.

37
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,350
Look.

38
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,800
Let's see where you run to.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Aunt.

40
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
Are you angry?

41
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,100
I told you to get my reading glasses.

42
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,800
I never thought I wouldn't see you again.

43
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,200
It's clear that

44
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
you didn't place me in your heart.

45
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,700
Looks like someone is really angry.

46
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,600
I will only be able to enjoy this alone then.

47
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,200
I went to Luo Tuo Bridge to buy Rose Candy early in the morning.

48
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,700
It wasn't easy to get this.

49
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,800
It smells so good.

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,400
Looking at it makes me salivate.

51
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,700
It must be really sweet and delicious.

52
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,000
It's sweet and soft.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I think I can finish this entire box.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
No, I must have one now.

55
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,400
If you finish eating everything, what is left for me?

56
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,000
Look.

57
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,780
Wench.

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,300
Come, Aunt. Let's eat this together. Okay?

59
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,400
Here. Does it taste good?

60
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Just eat it, Aunt.

61
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,000
That's right, Aunt. You look much better when you smile.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,400
You must smile more. Your mood will improve.

63
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Cai Hong.

64
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Stay with me and talk more.

65
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,600
Look. When no one is with me,

66
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,200
it's so boring.

67
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,800
I know and I want to

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
but in the future, I will be helping my boyfriend at his factory.

69
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,200
It's not easy for him to run his business.

70
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,470
I would like to do my best to help him.

71
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Cai Hong. You must remember to visit me.

72
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,600
Of course.

73
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Wait until my boyfriend's business is stable, I will visit you often.

74
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,800
You must keep your word.

75
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,300
If you don't believe me, we can cross our fingers.

76
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,200
You really treat me like a kid.

77
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,600
Do you dare to say that you are not?

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,200
I wonder whose son is so lucky

79
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,000
who will marry such a good wife like you.

80
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm not married yet.

81
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,100
You always joke with me.

82
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,100
It's getting late. I should be going home soon.

83
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,200
Aunt. Remember to go out more

84
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,600
and take in more fresh air. It's good for your health.

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,200
I know. Leave now.

86
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
I will take good care of myself.

87
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,800
With your concerns, I'm already very happy and satisfied.

88
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Go now.

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,900
Take good care of yourself.

90
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm leaving.

91
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,100
Wu Cai Hong.

92
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,000
I won't accept your resignation.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,100
Come back to work immediately.

94
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,300
What are you doing?

95
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

96
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,000
Make the arrangements for me.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,600
I will no longer accept your insults and let you torment me.

98
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,700
You better find someone else.

99
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,800
I will change my attitude.

100
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,000
I know now.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,400
You want me to stay at Ling Long

102
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,200
because it is a past time of yours (to torment).

103
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,000
If this is the case,

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,900
why don't I go to Fu Sheng to do real work

105
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,800
and investigate my father's case.

106
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,400
Why do you think that I killed your father?

107
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,200
Don't worry.

108
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,190
If you really killed my father,

109
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,590
I won't let you off.

110
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Don't you find this strange?

111
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,300
The audit of the five warehouses inside

112
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,600
the ledger was burnt by someone.

113
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,100
Old Cai disappeared and you went to talk to Old Cai's wife.

114
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,090
When you went to find his lover, she was murdered.

115
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,900
It's one coincidence after another.

116
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,400
Don't tell me the third time was also a coincidence?

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,400
What exactly is on your mind?

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,800
Only those who are close to you

119
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
would know your movements.

120
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,000
The person is always one step ahead, destroying evidence.

121
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,800
Don't place too much trust on those near you.

122
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
Well said.

123
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,300
Ling Long's ledger, Old Cai's wife and lover, these are not coincidences.

124
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,740
Why would I believe what you said?

125
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,600
I will never trust you.

126
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:46,630
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

127
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,000
Sis. Since you came back today, you have been unhappy.

128
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Are you not used to being with Brother Shao Tian?

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
No.

130
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,400
Since you are here, sit down for a while.

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Cai Yun. Frankly, I know that

132
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,800
ever since Dad passed away, you and stepmom have suffered.

133
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Who says so? The one who suffered the most was you.

134
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,500
Blame me...

135
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,400
for not having understudied Dad in the past.

136
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,700
If not, it wouldn't have been so easy for Ling Long to fall into other's hands.

137
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,800
Don't place all the burdens on your shoulders.

138
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,600
Arent you getting better now?

139
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,000
Brother Shao Tian also said that you are good with business now.

140
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,670
Our family will definitely get better.

141
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,200
Yes.

142
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,900
Our family will definitely get better.

143
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,200
Sis.

144
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,500
You have really accepted to be Brother Shao Tian's girlfriend?

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,200
In the past, when Dad wanted you to marry Brother Shao Tian,

146
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,600
you said that you wanted to regard him as just a brother.

147
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,900
Do you love him now?

148
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,500
When did you start to understand love?

149
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,000
Now there may only be females in my class, but we read Xu's poems.

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,700
Of course, I understand.

151
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,700
Sister, your love for Brother Shao Tianis just like poetry.

152
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,470
In my mind now,

153
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,990
what if the poetry from Xu's poems are wrong.

154
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,300
I only want to think simply. Brother Shao Tian is very good to me.

155
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,800
I would like to be good to him too.

156
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,900
I want to find the killer of Dad as soon as possible now

157
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,000
and then learn all about business

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,100
so that you and aunt will live well.

159
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,500
But after such a long time,

160
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,800
will you still be able to find the killer?

161
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,800
As long as I don't give up, there is hope.

162
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
Brother.

163
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,700
Brother.

164
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,400
I overheard your conversation with Cai Hong today at the hospital.

165
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,700
You are still worried about her?

166
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,300
- No wonder, the way you treat her...
-I am not.

167
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
I want to advise you.

168
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't forget that Dad died a terrible death.

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
- Don't forget that the Wu family brought us pain...
- I don't need you to remind me every day on how Dad died.

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,100
Why are you still not drawing the line between Wu Cai Hong then?

171
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,700
I already said that

172
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,400
I want to investigate who embezzled Ling Long's money.

173
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,100
I think you are worried about Wu Cai Hong instead.

174
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,000
You want to help her to find out the truth.

175
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,500
What I want to find out is who is the killer next to Wu Cai Hong.

176
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Think about it.

177
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,200
If the most trusted and closest person to Wu Cai Hong

178
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,800
is the killer of her father,

179
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,000
to her, this will be

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
a great irony and conflict.

181
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This would be like God giving the Wu family

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
an even worse penalty.

183
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,900
Her closest and most trusted person?

184
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,800
Could it be Wu Cai Hong's sister?

185
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,600
Mrs Wu is not Wu Cai Hong's biological mother.

186
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,400
If Wu Hong Da were to leave the family assets to the eldest daughter,

187
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,000
she would have motive to do it.

188
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,900
It's also not Mrs Wu.

189
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,900
The closest person to Wu Cai Hong?

190
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,400
Could it be Zhou Shao Tian?

191
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,000
Without any confirmed evidence,

192
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,800
it is too hard to judge.

193
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,000
Brother.

194
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,800
Are you serious about this?

195
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,000
Everything that you are doing is to make Wu Cai Hong suffer?

196
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,800
If you are feeling bored,

197
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,500
please spend more time with Mom. Okay?

198
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,400
<i>Come and take a look. The buns are hot.</i>

199
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,200
<i>The vegetables are fresh.</i>

200
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,600
Let me tell you. The imported products from this shop are really great.

201
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,000
Once you see them, you won't want to leave.

202
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm not going. I don't use make-up.

203
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,700
What's wrong? Didn't you use to like this in the past?

204
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
My family now...

205
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,800
you should know that my sister is having a hard time making money.

206
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,600
I don't need this anymore.

207
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,300
Cai Yun. We haven't gone shopping for a long time.

208
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,200
Just go with me.

209
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,490
Ah Xue.

210
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,700
It's not that I don't want to go with you. But...

211
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,600
I understand. Let's just go in and browse.

212
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,200
We are only just browsing. We don't need to buy anything.

213
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,400
Okay?

214
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,500
Let's go.

215
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,600
Sister Fei Fei. What do you think of this colour?

216
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,800
- It's pretty.
- Let me take a look.

217
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
It's pretty. This is the one.

218
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,600
But it's too expensive.

219
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,200
Let me think about it.

220
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,900
It's a bit expensive.

221
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,200
It's okay. If you like it, I will pay for it. I will get one for each for us. What do you think?

222
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,600
Really? Sister Fei Fei is not like the rest.

223
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,500
No. It's Mrs Jiang who is not like the rest.

224
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,200
Mrs Jiang. These two words have such a nice ring to them.

225
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Don't talk nonsense. If Brother hears this, we will be in trouble.

226
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,000
Who says we are talking nonsense? You and Boss Jiang...

227
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,800
No, you and your brother are in fact friends since childhood.

228
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,600
The position of Mrs Jiang is definitely yours.

229
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,800
That's right. It's no difference if we call her this.

230
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,000
She will be called this in the future. What's the difference?

231
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,800
- Mrs Jiang.
- Enough.

232
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,000
Mrs Jiang. Our blessed life in the future will depend on you.

233
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,800
In the future, we have to stick close to Madam Jiang.

234
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,300
She will be constantly happy with her joyous welfare.

235
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,300
- Mrs Jiang...
- Shouldn't we look around the shop? I heard the new lipsticks were delivered.

236
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,200
Didn't you always want to go see it?

237
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Really? Just take a look. It's okay if we don't buy any.

238
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,900
Okay.

239
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,600
Miss, which do you like?

240
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,300
<i>We didn't expect you to.</i>

241
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,000
This colour is really pretty!

242
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,400
We are buddies. Why are you saying this?

243
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,100
Isn't that the second daughter of the Wu family?

244
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,700
Her sister was your brother's ex-secretary.

245
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,400
Didn't her family go bankrupt?

246
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,600
How does she still have the money to go shopping?

247
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,200
So, she is Wu Cai Yun.

248
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,400
Just as the old saying,"Enemies are bound to meet on a narrow road".

249
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,400
Isn't this the second daughter of the Wu family?

250
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,200
Which Wu family?

251
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,400
It's that Wu Hong Da who went bankrupt and killed himself.

252
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,500
She is his younger daughter.

253
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,200
Cai Yun. Let's go. Just ignore her.

254
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,600
You are broke and you still have the money to buy luxurious items?

255
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,000
That's really something.

256
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,400
If she doesn't have money, she can just browse around.

257
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,300
I think the products suit her better.

258
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,400
Ah Xue. I have something going on.

259
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,800
Let's leave first.

260
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,000
Miss.

261
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,600
I just saw that girl

262
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,100
steal a lipstick and put it in her bag.

263
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,000
I think you should check whether it's from your shop.

264
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,800
Go after her. I will mind the shop.

265
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,200
Okay, tell the boss now.

266
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,700
Stop there.

267
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,100
Stop there.

268
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,300
Stop there. Someone saw you stealing from the shop.

269
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,600
You can't leave.

270
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,800
Nonsense.

271
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,000
We didn't.

272
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,100
You didn't? Open your bag.

273
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,700
I didn't. You are wrong.

274
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm going to report you.

275
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,800
Yes, I'm going to report you for a crime.

276
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,800
You can eat anything but you can't talk nonsense.

277
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,000
Since you said that you didn't steal anything, open your bag and let me check.

278
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,100
Why are you so unreasonable?

279
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,000
Do all customers who go into your shop subject to having their bags checked?

280
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Check everyone then. Why do you insist on only checking me?

281
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,600
Call your boss here.

282
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,200
No need. Our boss is already here.

283
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Boss. She stole from your shop. We caught her but she is still not admitting to it.

284
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,400
Miss.

285
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Boss Ku. You are here in time.

286
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,600
She is making irresponsible accusations. She claims I was stealing.

287
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,800
I didn't.

288
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,400
Miss Wu.

289
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,900
We just took an inventory count

290
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,200
and someone definitely saw you taking the lipstick.

291
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,600
This lipstick is imported from France.

292
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,670
It's a small shop. We can't compensate for it.

293
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,200
Your items are expensive.

294
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,400
Even if I liked it, I wouldn't steal it.

295
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,300
By saying this, you are insulting us.

296
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,000
Miss Wu.

297
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,600
I know that you used high ended products in the past.

298
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
Please don't be a hot head. <i>don't get angry.</i>

299
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,200
<i>This must have something to do with... This must be her only solution.</i>

300
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,100
Why don't we do this? Return the lipstick to me

301
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,200
and I will gift you a cheaper one.

302
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,800
This way, we won't make a mountain out of a mole hill.

303
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,360
What do you mean?

304
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,600
You are using slander against me today.

305
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,800
You want to check, right?

306
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,700
Okay. Call the police to come here.

307
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,200
If you can't find anything, I will sue you for framing me.

308
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,000
Miss Wu. If you really don't want to co-operate,

309
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,400
I will call for the police then.

310
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,800
Okay, call them.

311
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,800
- Sister Fei Fei. Will she be captured by the police?
- Do you think I'm afraid?

312
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,600
Look, the police are here.

313
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,000
Move aside.

314
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,600
What's going on?

315
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,880
They are planting lies against me.

316
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,200
Sir. I didn't. It's like this.

317
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,100
Someone saw her taking a lipstick from our shop.

318
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,600
Sir, he wronged me. <i>
(told lies)</i>

319
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,200
- I have not wronged her.
- Alright, Alright. Let me investigate.

320
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,400
Miss. Since you said that you didn't steal it, show me the proof.

321
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,500
He wronged me. <i>
(telling lies)</i>

322
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,400
Open your bag. If it's not there,

323
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,200
I will deal with him for not being fair to you.

324
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,600
See if you are agreeable to this.

325
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,200
Okay then. Let's do this.

326
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,000
If there really isn't anything there, I will apologise to her.

327
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,600
Okay, check then.

328
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,300
- Is this it?
- Yes, this is it.

329
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,600
Sorry, come with us.

330
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,400
I didn't steal anything. I really didn't.

331
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,000
Ah Xue. You know about this. I have been with you all along.

332
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I didn't steal anything.

333
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't know anything at all.

334
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,500
I was only shopping. I didn't notice what she was doing.

335
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,600
Miss, you've been caught red-handed.

336
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,200
Come with us to the police station.

337
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,400
I have been framed. I didn't steal anything.

338
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,700
- Take her away.
- I have been framed.

339
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,200
I have been framed.

340
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,900
I didn't steal anything.

341
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,800
I didn't steal anything. I really didn't.

342
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,600
- Where is Wu Cai Yun?
- She is over there.

343
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,000
Cai Yun.

344
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,800
Mom. I really didn't steal anything. They framed me.

345
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,400
Alright. Alright. I will deal with them.

346
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,200
Hey. My daughter would never steal.

347
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,300
You must have gotten it wrong.

348
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,400
She was caught red-handed.

349
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,700
We took out the lipstick from her bag.

350
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,400
There were many witnesses.

351
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't know how the lipstick ended up in my bag.

352
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,400
I really don't know.

353
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes. It's only just a lipstick.

354
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,400
My daughter would never steal. Someone must be behind it.

355
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,800
Yes. You must have gotten it wrong.

356
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,040
My sister would never steal.

357
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,400
- Stop crying.
- Sir, about this.

358
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,900
I would like to ask.

359
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,800
Since you saw it,

360
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,570
we won't deny that the lipstick was in her bag.

361
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,000
But I would also like to know,

362
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,700
did anyone personally witness her stealing it?

363
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
- It seems so... - You should call the witness to stand here then.

364
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,700
That's right.

365
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,000
Sir. Based on your experience,

366
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,900
look at her carefully.

367
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,600
Does she look like a thief who would steal?

368
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,400
Chief, is there legal grounds for this?

369
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Can you see if we can do this?

370
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,400
We will pay for this lipstick and consider that we bought it.

371
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,070
We don't need to make it hard on her anymore.

372
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,800
You have also been troubled enough. This will accommodate everyone.

373
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,400
If the victim is willing to agree, that would be good to resolve the matter privately.

374
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,800
But if he is not agreeable, there is nothing we can do.

375
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,400
Please wait. I will make the call.

376
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,600
We will have to trouble you then.

377
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Everything's fine.

378
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,400
Brother Shao Tian. I really didn't steal it.

379
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,300
Don't panic. We know.

380
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,260
First calm down.

381
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,600
That's right, Cai Yun. Don't panic. There definitely will be a solution.

382
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,400
There definitely will be a solution.

383
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,800
It's okay, if they don't reach a compromise,

384
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,400
- I understand.
- I will go to the shop to talk to the boss.

385
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,000
Everything's fine. Don't cry.

386
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Alright, the seller was quick to resolve the issue.

387
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,800
After some small formalities, you can take her home.

388
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,600
Thank you for your trouble.

389
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:28,470
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

390
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,600
Cai Yun. If you want to cry, just cry.

391
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,800
It will make you feel better.

392
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,300
Sis.

393
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,800
Enough, Cai Yun.

394
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,900
I know that you have suffered

395
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,500
but I know that this matter is already over.

396
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,800
Isn't that so?

397
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,500
Sis. I really didn't steal it.

398
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,200
You still don't believe me.

399
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Of course, I believe you.

400
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,800
Stop crying. There is only one thing I have to know. What happened between you.

401
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,600
Stop crying. Crying won't solve anything.

402
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,100
Ah Xue told me to go with her to the shop.

403
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,600
You should know that after what happened to our family,

404
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,400
no one is willing to be my friend anymore.

405
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,800
Except Ah Xue.

406
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,200
She asked me to accompany her to the shop.

407
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
I originally thought that if I just browsed, I would't spend any money.

408
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,200
But they said that I stole the lipstick.

409
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,800
I was not so convinced even when the police were called

410
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,190
because I didn't steal anything.

411
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,400
But subsequently, when the police opened my bag, the lipstick was in there.

412
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,100
- Okay, I get it.
- I also don't know how it got in there.

413
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,400
Do you know the people there? How do they look like?

414
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,900
I don't know them. They are all from the rich families.

415
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,400
There was one who kept watching me.

416
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,800
Sis. I swear that I really didn't steal it.

417
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,400
Enough, Cai Yun. I believe you. You are a good girl.

418
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,600
Don't worry. I will investigate this thoroughly

419
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,200
and prove your innocence. Okay, stop crying.

420
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Okay, I know. I don't blame you.

421
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,800
Boss Gu. This is just a small gesture.

422
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,200
You are too polite.

423
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,200
My sister caused you some trouble yesterday.

424
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,200
About the incident, regardless of who is right,

425
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,200
I would also like your store to not get a bad name.

426
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,000
I'm here today to apologise.

427
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,200
Miss.

428
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,400
Frankly, after thinking about this, we feel bad.

429
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,200
In the past, your father helped this shop a lot.

430
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,600
Hence, I...

431
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,400
Don't talk about the past anymore.

432
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,200
It's just that my sister is still young.

433
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,390
She is mature in our family.

434
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,800
I think she would never steal.

435
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,200
What happened yesterday?

436
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,000
Was there a misunderstanding?

437
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,400
Actually, I wasn't here yesterday.

438
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,900
I heard about this from two of my staff.

439
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,700
They said that your sister met some ladies here

440
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,000
and they had an exchange of words.

441
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
When your sister wanted to leave, a lady told the shop staff that

442
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
she stole something.

443
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,600
Second Miss?

444
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,080
Do you now that lady?

445
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,300
Who is she?

446
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,800
It seems like her family name is Fang. She's Miss Fang.

447
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,200
I'm not very clear about what her name is.

448
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,600
but she was very generous.

449
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,500
A few of her friends were joking with her

450
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,800
and kept calling her Mrs Jiang.

451
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,200
Mrs Jiang?

452
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,500
Miss Fang?

453
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,300
That's right. I have her receipt from yesterday.

454
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,900
Xiao Wu.

455
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,800
Take out all the receipts from yesterday.

456
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,200
Boss. Here it is.

457
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,800
This is it.

458
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,200
She bought these three lipsticks.

459
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,200
Jiang Yu.

460
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,000
To what end will you go with your hatred of my family?

461
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,800
Looks like Zhou Shao Tian didn't take good care of you.

462
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,200
You look haggered

463
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,600
and your temper is flared up even more.

464
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,800
I'm asking you a question.

465
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Do not challenge my limits.

466
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,800
After toying with me,

467
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
you find this interesting, right?

468
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,200
If there is anything, you can take it out on me.

469
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,800
I'm not afraid of being accused but you should clarify everything first.

470
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,200
Accused?

471
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,000
You let Fang Fei Fei steal a lipstick and frame my sister for it.

472
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,400
She is only just a young girl. How could you do this to her?

473
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,600
So, you are sure that I did it.

474
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,700
If it's not you, who else would it be?

475
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,900
This only proves that Ling Long bought three lipsticks from Little Paris.

476
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,200
I would advise you to think clearly about this.

477
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
If you don't want your sister to be famous,

478
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,300
the best solution is to keep it (the incidence) a low profile.

479
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,100
So,

480
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,700
you are admitting to this.

481
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,100
Fine.

482
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,000
Even if I did it,

483
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,100
so what?

484
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,200
They said that humans were born kind.

485
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,000
I always thought that you weren't that bad

486
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,200
but the truth is the proof. I was wrong.

487
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,400
Moreover, I was gravely mistaken.

488
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,000
Being born as Wu Hong Da's daughter

489
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
is your life's biggest mistake.

490
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,400
You took my father's company.

491
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,300
Since you even dare to say this...

492
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,800
Even if my father

493
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,260
offended you in business dealings,

494
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,400
did you ever think that my sister is still young?

495
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,600
If this were to leak out, how would you expect to live?

496
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,700
Jiang Yu. Let me tell you.

497
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,000
If you dare to touch my family again,

498
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,900
I will never let you off.

499
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,200
So, in your heart,

500
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm really this kind of person.

501
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,300
Sorry.

502
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,500
You have never been in my heart.

503
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,600
You will never be in future either.

504
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,200
I think what Brother Shao Tian said is right.

505
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,400
Someone who is so cold and selfish like you,

506
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,020
Ling Long will go bankrupt sooner or later.

507
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,600
Just wait and see then.

508
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,100
Let's see whether Ling Long or Fu Sheng will go bankrupt first.

509
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Brother, this Hangzhou White Peony root just arrived today. Try it.

510
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,700
What's wrong, brother? Who made you angry?

511
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,500
Regarding the Wu family issue,

512
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,000
you were the one behind it, right?

513
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,100
That's right.

514
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,600
- Don't do such things in the future again.
- Why?

515
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,200
Wu Hong Da destroyed our home.

516
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,000
Father was framed by him.

517
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,200
An eye for an eye.

518
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,400
I wanted to give them a taste of their own medicine.

519
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,600
You are using such a tactic to take revenge.

520
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,600
What's the difference between you and Wu Hong Da?

521
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,600
"Trying to punish the wicked is like putting yourself on a bad horse."

522
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,400
What right do you have to hate Wu Hong Da? Tell me!

523
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,000
I hate them.

524
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,200
I hate them for causing father to die.

525
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
I hate them for causing mom to be sick.

526
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,900
I hate them for causing you to be unhappy for many years.

527
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,000
Why?

528
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Fei Fei. Why did you become like this?

529
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,700
I suddenly remember when you were young.

530
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,900
A little bird in our house was killed by a maid. You cried for a long time.

531
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,700
You cried miserably.

532
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Ever since Dad passed away,

533
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,000
all these years, you have been helping me to take care of my mother.

534
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,600
Because of your existence,

535
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,600
you turned this house into a family.

536
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Fei Fei. I have always hoped that you would be a very kind girl.

537
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,100
I really don't want you to dirty your hands because of revenge.

538
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,200
Thus, all those matters,

539
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,700
let me take the burden alone.

540
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,200
Brother.

541
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,400
When Father took me in when my parents died,

542
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,600
he gave me a family.

543
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,200
At the most difficult time,

544
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,200
you didn't get rid of me.

545
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,100
Without the Jiang family,

546
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:29,800
and with you, I wouldn't have grown up peacefully.

547
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,300
I will always remember the family's great kindness.

548
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,500
For you,

549
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,600
I could do anything for the Jiang family.

550
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,800
If you still want me to be your brother,

551
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,000
don't get involved.

552
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,400
Thus, regarding everything,

553
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,300
I will make the arrangements.

554
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,300
What is the progress of this matter?

555
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,800
I have already done according to your instructions.

556
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,900
There has been talk with some of the suppliers.

557
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,400
We only need our suppliers not to supply to Fu Sheng.

558
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,000
Thus, starting from today,

559
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,200
Fu Sheng won't be able to obtain any materials for dyeing.

560
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,400
If this continues, it's just a matter of time before Fu Sheng goes bankrupt.

561
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,200
Unless Zhou Shao Tian spends a big sum of money

562
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,400
and imports the materials.

563
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,800
Please come to the boss with anything major.

564
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,600
and let them be enlightened.

565
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,300
The Huzhou weaving and dying sector has become this way.

566
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,350
Moreover, you have already seen Jiang Yu's underhanded tactics.

567
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,400
The Huzhou weaving and dying sector has become this way.

568
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,000
Jiang Yu buys cheap

569
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,900
This time, he got involved with the suppliers of the dye materials.

570
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,100
Yes. He is sabotaging my family now

571
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,100
but he won't be able to harm your positions.

572
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,700
Thus, I feel that

573
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,590
Ling Long's real ambition is

574
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,300
to occupy the entire area of Huzhou.

575
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,000
Boss Zhou. Your words are logical.

576
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,700
In your opinion, what should we do?

577
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,700
Among all of us, none of us are his match.

578
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,700
But if we were to join forces together,

579
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,200
we will be able to poach his clients.

580
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,600
Even though we can't harm Ling Long, we should at least send him a warning

581
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,400
so that he wouldn't dare to harm such a small shop like us.

582
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,200
Stable prices will inevitably lead to increased pressure to reduce earnings.

583
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,000
Especially when we are doing business to make profits.

584
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,800
Yes. We need to support our families too.

585
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Everyone.

586
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,400
If we join forces together,

587
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,200
we will benefit from the purchase of raw materials.

588
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,000
What do you think?

589
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,120
Join forces together?

590
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,270
The prices of raw materials will be reduced.

591
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,000
Yes, this is a good idea.

592
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,700
Even though our margins will be lower

593
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,000
we will be able to poach even more clients from Ling Long.

594
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,700
Sales will go in a straight line up and our total profits will not be reduced.

595
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,000
It will be even higher.

596
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,800
It's sound logical. It's a good idea.

597
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,400
Dear everyone,

598
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,000
when my father was alive, he helped you a lot.

599
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,500
Now that Fu Sheng is facing difficulties, we hope that you will help us.

600
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,020
We must work as one

601
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,400
and resist the evil.

602
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,700
Okay, Miss. Count me in.

603
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,950
Tell us what we should do. We will listen to you.

604
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,800
If everyone agree, let's sign the consent form.

605
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,400
Okay, I will sign.

606
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,000
Count me in.

607
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,400
- I will sign too.
- Thank you.

608
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Count me in.

609
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,300
Me too.

610
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,000
Count me in.

611
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,600
I will sign too.

612
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,600
Please take a look around.

613
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,000
These are Ling Long's new products.

614
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,600
Regardless of the colours, patterns or textures,

615
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
they are made with delicate care.

616
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,800
Please feel free to look around.

617
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,600
It's really not bad.

618
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,600
This is made well. Look at the exquisite work.

619
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,400
You have a good eye.

620
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,600
In terms of color, gray is the hardest

621
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
followed by cool colors.

622
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,900
Mr. Jiang does a cool color treatment that is very cathartic. <i>full of emotions</i>

623
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,000
Really makes me open my eyes.

624
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,600
You are over praising me.

625
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,700
I wonder if the colour will run if it gets wet.

626
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,200
It can't be that you don't believe in our products.

627
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,800
No, Boss Jiang. Your products are the best in Huzhou

628
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,200
but your products are the most expensive.

629
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,800
But if we don't do the water test and we buy it,

630
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,500
inevitably something could happen.

631
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,800
Boss Jiang. I know about Ling Long's rules

632
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,600
but it's really hard to do business now.

633
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,000
Our small businesses also want to avoid risk.

634
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Why don't you reconsider?

635
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,600
We will reconsider too.

636
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,300
Let's compromise.

637
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,600
Brother. Why don't we let them try the water test?

638
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,000
Dear everyone.

639
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,700
We don't have a tryout policy in Ling Long.

640
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,200
I know that there are many small and medium shops

641
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,400
who are willing to do the water tests.

642
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,400
That is because they only sell locally.

643
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,200
The process is simple.

644
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,400
Ling Long does business throughout the country.

645
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,700
If I were to break the rule today,

646
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:28,050
how would I face foreign merchants?

647
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,800
That's right.

648
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,000
The prices at Ling Long are definitely more expensive.

649
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,800
Higher quality.

650
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,700
No one can be compared to ours.

651
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,700
This is the first we have worked with some of you. For the rest we have worked several times.

652
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,350
Those who have worked with us,

653
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,300
I believe, know very well the exquisite high quality fabrics here.

654
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,100
As for those who are working with us for the first time, I will guarantee that after going through this,

655
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,800
you will definitely have no regrets.

656
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,200
Boss Jiang, you also offer a final inspection of the product.

657
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,000
Yes. I heard that

658
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,700
Boss Zhou of Fu Sheng

659
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,800
orders are intended to be made of this.

660
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,700
Let's go to visit the Miss of former Mr. Wu of Ling Long.
