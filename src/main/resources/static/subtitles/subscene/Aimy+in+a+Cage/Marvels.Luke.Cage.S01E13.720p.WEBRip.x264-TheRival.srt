Of course Luke can win.

180
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:50,736
[panting] I'm done, Willis.
I'm not doing this anymore.

181
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,489
You ain't done. Not
till one of us is dead.

182
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,491
You're more like Dad than you think.

183
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,537
When I got shipped to Seagate...

184
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,331
he called me a mistake, too.

185
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:05,209
I'm not paying for his sins anymore.

186
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,086
And neither should you.

187
00:11:08,796 --> 00:11:09,964
You want me dead?

188
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:11,966
Then kill me.

189
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,134
Do it!

190
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:18,222
You ain't ready.

191
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:21,159
- [bell dings]
- [Stryker grunting]

192
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:22,476
[crowd shouting]

193
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,145
Throw in the jab! Move!
Keep moving, keep moving!

194
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:27,106
- [grunting]
- [crowd exclaims]

195
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:34,380
[young Stryker] Take
the hits! Take the hits!

196
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:36,198
- Let him get tired!
- [crowd shouting]

197
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:38,325
- Save him.
- [both grunting]

198
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:41,203
No.

199
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:46,351
You can take it. Keep
breathing, keep breathing!

200
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,335
[Stryker grunting]

201
00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:50,254
[crowd cheering]

202
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:55,193
[young Stryker] Let him get tired.
He ain't got shit to come back with.

203
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:56,510
[Luke groaning]

204
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:01,974
[wheezing]

205
00:12:04,393 --> 00:12:06,854
[man] Come on, son! You can do it!

206
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:08,355
[grunting]

207
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:09,815
[crowd exclaims]

208
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,526
- [woman 1] Come on, Luke.
- [man 1] Don't give up, Luke!

209
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:15,070
[woman 2] Luke, come on, man!

210
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:18,908
[woman 3] You got it, Luke!

211
00:12:25,915 --> 00:12:28,000
Remember who you are.

212
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,212
[Stryker panting]

213
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:36,926
[chanting] Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke!

214
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:38,302
[spits]

215
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:40,805
[crowd shouting]

216
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:44,474
[crowd continues chanting]

217
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,521
[chanting] Luke! Luke! Luke!

218
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:51,565
[chanting continues]

219
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:52,817
You're right.

220
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,402
You reap what you sow.

221
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:58,363
Let's go! Put it on him! Put it on him!

222
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:00,157
- [crowd continues chanting]
- [grunting]

223
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:05,787
Am I my brother's keeper?

224
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,125
[crowd exclaiming]

225
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:12,962
No, I'm not.

226
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,464
- [bell ringing]
- [young Stryker] Yeah!

227
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:17,549
[crowd cheering]

228
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:18,675
[young Stryker] Yeah!

229
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:20,219
[crowd cheering]

230
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:22,637
[chanting] Luke! Luke! Luke!

231
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:31,688
On the ground, now! We
got Judas bullets, Cage.

232
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,693
Lieutenant, stand down.

233
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:40,280
I got you.

234
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:43,533
Councilwoman Dillard...

235
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:45,660
What?

236
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:49,456
You are under arrest for
the murder of Cornell Stokes.

237
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:51,299
- You goin' down.
- [Misty] Do the perp walk.

238
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,169
- You are going down.
- Take her out of here.

239
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,047
[indistinct chatter on radio]

240
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:05,555
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

241
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,642
Oh, come on. You're not
even gonna try to move?

242
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:10,978
Not even a lil' bit?

243
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:14,814
Take his tired...

244
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:17,359
broken...

245
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:19,862
false-preachin' ass on out of here.

246
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,249
[breathing heavily]

247
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:38,297
I should be healed up in
a couple of hours, right?

248
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:41,508
Sooner than that, Power Man.

249
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:47,890
Nah, B.

250
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,935
Brother deserves discretion.

251
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:03,989
How did you know...

252
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:07,284
that you could do that?

253
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:10,579
The more I hit him...

254
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:12,915
the more he dished out.

255
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,584
So I stopped feeding him hate.

256
00:15:18,462 --> 00:15:20,047
What if it didn't work?

257
00:15:22,091 --> 00:15:24,676
Well, sometimes you gotta
throw out the science and...

258
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:27,637
go for what you know.

259
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:29,389
You heard me say that?

260
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:32,267
I hear everything you say.

261
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:35,437
Even when you don't speak...

262
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:37,940
Still hear it.

263
00:15:38,023 --> 00:15:39,566
[man] Luke Cage!

264
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:42,569
Thanks for keeping Harlem safe, baby.

265
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:48,867
[sighs]

266
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:56,666
I'm sorry, Luke. I'm
gonna need to bring you in.

267
00:15:57,376 --> 00:15:58,835
I need a statement.

268
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:01,546
I'm done running.

269
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,632
How many of these you own, brother?

270
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,974
Looks like this place don't
wanna be a barber shop anymore.

271
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:14,934
[sighs]

272
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,521
Maybe not.

273
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:21,108
But whatever it is,
it's gonna be famous.

274
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:25,529
People are gonna be talking about
what went down here for years.

275
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:29,533
You ready?

276
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:34,329
You know how I feel about cop shops.

277
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:36,706
Well...

278
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,292
if it's any comfort,

279
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,586
you'll have a front-row seat when
I nail Mariah's ass to the wall.

280
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:46,925
How's Candace?

281
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:50,470
Safe and secure at my mom's place.

282
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,515
- Promise.
- Good.

283
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:56,101
<i>All these people were
talking bad about Luke Cage.</i>

284
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:58,937
<i>But they didn't stop for one minute
to look at the good he had done.</i>

285
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:03,192
<i>Cleaning up Crispus Attucks by
himself, lookin' out for people...</i>

286
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,610
<i>Most of these guys wear spandex.</i>

287
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:08,822
<i>Who would have thought a black
man in a hoodie would be a hero?</i>

288
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:12,242
<i>It's been an extraordinary
night here in Harlem.</i>

289
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:15,120
See? I'm not the type of person

290
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:18,707
who wants always to say, "I am right."

291
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,459
- But...
- I'm glad you're right.

292
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:21,918
[cell phone chimes]

293
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:25,422
[sighs]

294
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,601
[man] There he is. There's Luke.

295
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:39,978
- [all clamoring]
- [camera shutters clicking]

296
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:42,772
Hey, back it off. Back!

297
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:45,150
[reporter 1] Mr. Cage, how
does it feel to be a hero?

298
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:46,818
I'm no hero. I'm a regular guy,

299
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:50,655
just trying to live life on his
own terms, one day at a time.

300
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:51,906
Are you single?

301
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,135
[reporter 2] Do you have anything
to say to Councilwoman Dillard?

302
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:55,994
[all clamoring]

303
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:57,847
[reporter 2] Have you
received any medical treatment?

304
00:17:57,871 --> 00:17:59,711
[reporter 3] How does
it feel to be vindicated?

305
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:03,918
[scoffs]

306
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:05,337
[chuckles]

307
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,382
You can take a seat.

308
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:11,885
Mr. Cage.

309
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:15,639
My name is Inspector Priscilla Ridley.

310
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:18,558
You realize there is a warrant
still out for your arrest.

311
00:18:19,476 --> 00:18:22,562
I do. I came here to clear things up.

312
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,483
I haven't done any of the things
that I've been charged with.

313
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:28,943
Even the dash cam video that
everyone's talking about?

314
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:31,321
I'd like to provide some context.

315
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:34,199
Would you like an attorney?

316
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,576
I know a really good one.

317
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,120
I'm not guilty of anything.

318
00:18:39,246 --> 00:18:40,747
I'll speak for myself.

319
00:18:53,968 --> 00:18:56,388
- Interrogation One?
- No.

320
00:18:57,306 --> 00:19:00,099
As far as I'm concerned,
he's no longer a suspect.

321
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:02,436
And we both know if he
doesn't wanna be, he'll walk.

322
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,604
Procedure says he should be in a room.

323
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:07,191
He won't go for a room.

324
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:09,984
Look, we can do it right
here, right now. It's fine.

325
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:11,695
What about your sororal?

326
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:15,073
You gonna let her just
skee-wee on out of here again?

327
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:16,950
Actually, it's "ooh-woop..."

328
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:19,953
and no, she's not going anywhere, but...

329
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:24,374
we are showing her every
courtesy the NYPD extends...

330
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,875
very slowly.

331
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:33,425
[Mariah] I want my goddamn phone call!

332
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:36,636
Okay, Mama. All right.

333
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:40,098
Hmm. [sniffles]

334
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:44,644
This ends here.

335
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:50,066
You got it?

336
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:54,321
I already said you
don't need to be here.

337
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:55,989
I'm fine where I am.

338
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:59,033
If Claire leaves, I leave.

339
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:02,787
So be it. I'm not being
redundant. I'm just being thorough.

340
00:20:03,997 --> 00:20:05,123
Luke is innocent.

341
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:08,918
Claire, I got this. I'm good.

342
00:20:09,002 --> 00:20:10,629
I know you do. It's just frustrating.

343
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:14,132
Officer Albini in the park?

344
00:20:14,216 --> 00:20:16,718
[Luke] I wasn't even in the state.

345
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:18,262
Claire and I went to Georgia.

346
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:20,054
What were you doing in Georgia?

347
00:20:20,972 --> 00:20:22,307
Unfinished business.

348
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:24,142
You said no more secrets.

349
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:32,567
You don't have any scars.

350
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:34,486
The doctor who did this to me...

351
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:39,366
with Claire's help, did
it again, and I got better.

352
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:43,161
The officer in the park? Damon Boone?

353
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,707
Just match the fist prints from the
suit and gloves that Stryker was wearing.

354
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,125
All of that was Stryker.

355
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,169
Why didn't you just come to me?

356
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:52,462
I didn't know you.

357
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:54,756
I stayed out of it.

358
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,925
Until you were right
in the center of it.

359
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:58,385
They killed Pop.

360
00:20:59,636 --> 00:21:00,762
They did.

361
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:05,517
I couldn't just lay in the cut anymore.

362
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:08,312
Pop knew about my abilities.

363
00:21:09,313 --> 00:21:10,855
So I put them to good use.

364
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:13,567
<i>I shut down Crispus Attucks personally.</i>

365
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:17,529
That wasn't your job.

366
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:24,077
People needed someone that didn't require
a warrant or shield to get things done.

367
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,122
Call it a vigilante, or a superhero...

368
00:21:28,206 --> 00:21:29,541
Call it what you will, but...

369
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:31,876
[sighs] like it or not,

370
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,381
<i>I finally accepted that
that someone had to be me.</i>

371
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:38,049
Maybe I could've helped you.

372
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:40,469
This burden is bigger than you.

373
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:42,762
Or me.

374
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:44,514
People are scared...

375
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:48,643
but they can't be
paralyzed by that fear.

376
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:52,271
You have to fight for what's
right every single day,

377
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:54,316
bulletproof skin or not.

378
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:58,570
You can't just not snitch, or turn
away or take money under the table

379
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:00,614
because life has turned you sour.

380
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:02,491
When did people stop caring?

381
00:22:02,574 --> 00:22:08,204
Harlem is supposed to
represent our hopes and dreams.

382
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:10,790
<i>It's the pinnacle of black art...</i>

383
00:22:10,874 --> 00:22:12,376
<i>politics...</i>

384
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:13,960
<i>innovation.</i>

385
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:18,131
It's supposed to be a
shining light to the world.

386
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:23,177
It's our responsibility to push forward,

387
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:27,015
so that the next generation
will be further along than us.

388
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:31,227
Pop said his mantra aloud twice a day.

389
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,438
The kids in the shop were pissed...

390
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:36,441
but they could never unhear it.

391
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:38,317
"Never backwards..."

392
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:39,694
Always...

393
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:42,030
forward.

394
00:22:42,113 --> 00:22:43,197
"Forward..."

395
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:44,574
"Always."

396
00:22:47,577 --> 00:22:49,913
You forget I grew up around the man.

397
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:51,706
I wish I could've met him.

398
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,958
In a way, you have.

399
00:22:58,004 --> 00:22:59,839
Well, hello!

400
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:01,633
Doesn't everybody have work to do?

401
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:05,929
Is Mariah still in there?

402
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:08,097
Yeah.

403
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:11,309
Well, now that I'm
no longer a suspect...

404
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,687
you guys got any take-out menus?

405
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:16,440
I'm starving.

406
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:20,401
You know, I kept telling
Cornell it was enough.

407
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:26,115
He had enough money to keep
Harlem's Paradise flush.

408
00:23:27,617 --> 00:23:30,161
Even for opening
another club downtown...

409
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:33,748
like our grandmother
always talked about.

410
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:36,501
[takes deep breath]

411
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:40,547
He had the talent to make it big.

412
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:47,554
But there was always another
deal, another detail. [sniffles]

413
00:23:47,637 --> 00:23:50,682
And then this... this guy, Diamond Jim.

414
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:52,141
Diamondback.

415
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:55,061
Yes, Diamondback.

416
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,899
Cornell said that he
was his direct contact,

417
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:01,400
[stammering] whatever that means.

418
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:05,113
And he was pissed off when
those guns were stolen.

419
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:09,784
You know, in that... that thing that
your Detective Scarfe got caught up in?

420
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:12,370
There were a lot of dirty hands.

421
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:14,413
Not Cornell's.

422
00:24:14,498 --> 00:24:17,208
- He didn't have the guns.
- Oh, yes, he did.

423
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:20,545
That's why Detective Scarfe got shot.

424
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:24,465
Detective Scarfe stole
them from evidence

425
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:26,843
and then gave them back to Cornell.

426
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:29,554
[stammers] I don't know any details.

427
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:34,183
I just know that Cornell
was scared and he wanted out.

428
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:37,436
And the night when I came into the club,

429
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:41,525
that big brother that was fighting
Luke Cage up on Malcolm X...

430
00:24:41,608 --> 00:24:45,820
"Hey," I screamed, and he... he
pulled a gun on me and said that...

431
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:50,116
if I didn't say it was Luke
Cage, he was gonna kill me.

432
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:52,619
He said Luke Cage?

433
00:24:52,702 --> 00:24:55,789
- That it had to be Luke Cage?
- Yes.

434
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:59,292
He was firm about that. Luke Cage. Yes!

435
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:03,797
- And Candace Miller?
- Oh, God. Candace. [inhales deeply]

436
00:25:04,714 --> 00:25:08,217
She tried to protect me,
but she didn't have to.

437
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,012
[stammers]

438
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,889
I feel terrible...

439
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:15,391
that a decent man's
name has been maligned,

440
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:20,104
but I will do whatever I need
to to rectify that. I will.

441
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,862
You are absolutely
goddamn right you will.

442
00:25:27,946 --> 00:25:29,614
[door closes]

443
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:31,783
Start by telling the truth.

444
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:38,247
I am not a liar, Detective.

445
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:39,498
[Misty] Mmm.

446
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,500
According to the lab...

447
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:44,838
Cottonmouth was struck
in the back of the head

448
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:47,048
by a heavy, circular object...

449
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:52,136
probably consistent with a
bottle, before he was pushed.

450
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,806
[Ridley] How do we know
he was pushed, Detective?

451
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:56,224
The angle.

452
00:25:57,141 --> 00:26:00,604
[Mariah screaming] No! No! No!

453
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,940
I did not want it!

454
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:05,108
[Stokes groans]

455
00:26:05,191 --> 00:26:06,192
No!

456
00:26:06,901 --> 00:26:09,403
[Misty] Cottonmouth landed on his back,

457
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:13,157
- turned over, and then crawled.
- [Stokes groaning]

458
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:15,785
[Mariah] You shut up!

459
00:26:16,786 --> 00:26:18,121
No!

460
00:26:18,204 --> 00:26:21,582
- No, I didn't want it!
- [breathing heavily]

461
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,043
[Misty] Judging by the
wounds on his hands,

462
00:26:24,127 --> 00:26:26,921
he probably was pleading for his life

463
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:31,384
when he was smashed by
a heavy, circular base.

464
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:36,180
Now, the coroner thought it
was maybe a heavy waste basket.

465
00:26:36,264 --> 00:26:37,641
But my vote...

466
00:26:38,642 --> 00:26:40,351
it was a mic stand.

467
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:44,355
I went through Harlem's Paradise
inventory records with the stage manager,

468
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:46,190
and it turns out...

469
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:50,028
there was a mic stand
that was unaccounted for.

470
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,657
I've been around the music
business my whole life.

471
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,492
Equipment goes missing.

472
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:59,495
You can't trust niggas around equipment.

473
00:27:00,664 --> 00:27:03,332
- Cottonmouth was weakened.
- [Ridley clears throat]

474
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:06,460
It wouldn't take a man
to kill him in that state,

475
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:09,130
just somebody who was angry...

476
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:12,591
and passionate about seeing him dead.

477
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,594
And...

478
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,056
someone who was sloppy...

479
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:20,516
in the cover-up.

480
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:27,857
[Candace] <i>Mariah killed him.</i>

481
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:29,734
[Misty] <i>What?</i>
<i>How do you know this?</i>

482
00:27:29,818 --> 00:27:31,652
[Candace] <i>I heard them talking about it.</i>

483
00:27:31,736 --> 00:27:33,863
<i>The guy who always wears sunglasses...</i>

484
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:36,490
<i>he was there, trying
to calm Mariah down.</i>

485
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:40,995
And that's just a taste.

486
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:43,873
I got plenty more where that came from.

487
00:27:46,876 --> 00:27:47,919
I...

488
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,798
- I'm...
- [Misty] You don't have to say anything.

489
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:53,591
Just tell the truth.

490
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,677
We are right here.

491
00:27:58,012 --> 00:27:59,638
Make a deal.

492
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:03,017
If you can help us nail
Shades and Diamondback,

493
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:05,436
and maybe confirm some
of Cornell's contacts,

494
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,105
we can make your stay...

495
00:28:08,314 --> 00:28:09,690
a little bit easier.

496
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,069
That's all you got.

497
00:28:15,238 --> 00:28:18,532
Cornell liked fooling around
with them nasty-ass bitches.

498
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:20,744
I... I had no use for chickenheads.

499
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:22,453
You are going down.

500
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,831
Go to trial with that flimsy-ass shit.

501
00:28:24,914 --> 00:28:28,459
I dare you. I double
damn dare you, trick!

502
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,169
Oh! Trick?

503
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,632
Whatever... Madam Inmate.

504
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,637
- Misty.
- Not right now.

505
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:40,805
Now.

506
00:28:53,526 --> 00:28:56,695
- Don't you ever, and I mean, ever...
- Misty.

507
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,240
Interrupt an interrogation.

508
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:00,408
What is it?

509
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:02,326
Detective Chang just caught a body.

510
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,747
An African-American woman,
mid-twenties, in front of a bodega.

511
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,959
The victim had a pay-as-you-go
phone in her pocket.

512
00:29:10,043 --> 00:29:12,086
<i>I traced the phone's credit card.</i>

513
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,089
It belongs to you.

514
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:19,427
<i>Chang thought you might've gotten
cloned, but you bought the phone...</i>

515
00:29:20,136 --> 00:29:21,679
and you activated it.

516
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:24,432
And the victim...

517
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:28,561
had numerous text exchanges
with an NYPD cell phone number.

518
00:29:29,562 --> 00:29:30,646
It's yours.

519
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,900
Come on. Where are you, Misty?

520
00:29:33,983 --> 00:29:35,359
I'm right here.

521
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:42,784
How recent were the texts?

522
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:46,620
I lost my phone...

523
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:51,417
at the barber shop.

524
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:56,422
Show me the picture, Bailey.

525
00:29:57,465 --> 00:30:01,135
- We should verify with the family first.
- Show me the goddamn picture, Bailey.

526
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:02,595
Please.

527
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:09,393
[Bailey] The victim appears
to be Candace Miller.

528
00:30:21,197 --> 00:30:22,949
Was that an important call, my dear?

529
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:24,492
- You murdered her!
- Hey, hey, hey!

530
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:26,095
- You murdered her!
- You are out of control.

531
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,319
- Misty, stop!
- Get off of me!

532
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,306
- You're hysterical. She's being...
- You murdered her!

533
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,891
- She's being hysterical.
- You murdered Candace

534
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:32,625
and you murdered Cornell.

535
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,293
- Enough is enough!
- What?

536
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:36,355
- What are you talking about?
- [Ridley] What is going on?

537
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:38,297
Candace is dead.

538
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:39,715
What?

539
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:43,094
You stole my phone. I know it was you!

540
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:46,014
You will say anything
about me, won't you?

541
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:47,932
Where's your proof?

542
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:49,893
I loved my cousin.

543
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:51,310
[scoffs]

544
00:30:51,394 --> 00:30:53,812
And I would test that love

545
00:30:53,897 --> 00:30:57,901
against the recorded voice
of a dead whore any day.

546
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:01,863
Am I still being charged with anything?

547
00:31:06,868 --> 00:31:08,702
- [clattering]
- No.

548
00:31:08,786 --> 00:31:10,788
Not at this time.

549
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:12,999
[Mariah inhales deeply]

550
00:31:16,294 --> 00:31:18,712
You have the man who killed Cornell,

551
00:31:18,796 --> 00:31:21,883
Diamondback, in custody, Priscilla.

552
00:31:21,966 --> 00:31:23,551
Do the right thing.

553
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:27,430
Keep him there. He is dangerous.

554
00:31:36,814 --> 00:31:39,692
That is the second time you
have attacked a civilian in here.

555
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:42,028
This shield...

556
00:31:42,111 --> 00:31:44,072
ain't worth the tin it's printed on

557
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:48,993
if Mariah Dillard can just walk
out of here after what she's done.

558
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:52,788
- This system is broken, Priscilla.
- Mercedes...

559
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:55,041
you are one of the finest
detectives I have ever seen,

560
00:31:55,124 --> 00:31:57,043
but you have got to learn...

561
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:59,087
that there is no getting
around the system.

562
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,588
You must work within it.

563
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:03,132
Candace should have been
in protective custody.

564
00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:06,385
She should have been here and
I should have known about it.

565
00:32:07,303 --> 00:32:10,306
Mariah Dillard walked out
of here today because of you.

566
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:13,601
Because you didn't trust our system.

567
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,940
Because you didn't trust me.

568
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,784
[sobs]

569
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:34,663
[Claire sighs]

570
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,127
Misty's been gone a long time. [sighs]

571
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:41,462
That's never good.

572
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:44,340
No.

573
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:49,637
We have a lot to talk about, though.

574
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:53,016
Like what?

575
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:54,767
Your future.

576
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,811
Your next moves.

577
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:01,565
[sighs] Well, I don't wanna
talk about that right now.

578
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:03,192
[inhales deeply]

579
00:33:03,276 --> 00:33:05,236
I just wanna chill.

580
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:07,946
It's been a long day.

581
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,331
You're right. It can wait.

582
00:33:18,124 --> 00:33:20,251
You wanna get coffee
when we get out of here?

583
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,255
You accused me of not liking coffee.

584
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:26,590
That's not true.

585
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:28,801
Just depends on the blend.

586
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:35,308
I hear that Cuban coffee
is particularly robust.

587
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:40,313
[dishes clattering]

588
00:33:45,276 --> 00:33:48,529
That might be the corniest
thing you've said yet.

589
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:54,702
It also happens to be true.

590
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:14,847
Oh, thank you.

591
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,141
Helping a sister out.

592
00:34:18,226 --> 00:34:19,310
[chuckles]

593
00:34:20,228 --> 00:34:22,521
The hero of Harlem.

594
00:34:22,605 --> 00:34:24,565
Congratulations!

595
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:27,151
You are good for the neighborhood.

596
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:28,902
[Luke] You're not.

597
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:30,654
What about our deal?

598
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:33,949
- Where's the file?
- What file?

599
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:36,077
Buh-bye!

600
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:50,841
What the hell happened?

601
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,426
They killed Candace.

602
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,263
What? My mom...

603
00:34:55,346 --> 00:34:58,682
Not your mom. She's
fine. We checked on her.

604
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:03,646
Shades or somebody used my phone

605
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:06,107
to lure Candace out of the apartment.

606
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:08,234
But I can't prove it yet.

607
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,652
What about her confession?

608
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:11,570
- It's worthless.
- Why?

609
00:35:11,654 --> 00:35:14,990
If she were still alive,
that would be one thing.

610
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:19,120
But she admitted to
taking money from Mariah,

611
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:22,080
she changed her statement,
and now she's dead.

612
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:24,125
The definition of reasonable doubt.

613
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:27,670
And the woman she's accusing
is politically connected.

614
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:31,549
It's unwinnable. There's no
way the DA will take that case.

615
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:33,801
That's why Ridley just kicked her.

616
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:39,014
Mariah and Shades will talk. Trust me.

617
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:42,017
I told her not to leave.

618
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:45,646
I know.

619
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:52,695
[man] Carl Lucas,

620
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:55,406
I'm Marshal Franco.
This is Marshal Johnson.

621
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:03,539
You're under arrest for your
unlawful escape from Seagate Prison.

622
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:04,748
What are you doing?

623
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:06,167
You won't need those.

624
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,419
- Says who?
- [Luke] Says me.

625
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:10,338
I'm done running.

626
00:36:10,421 --> 00:36:11,589
I'm sorry, Mr. Cage.

627
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:14,842
I'm gonna recommend the New York City
DA's office drop all charges against you.

628
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:16,260
I have done all I can.

629
00:36:16,344 --> 00:36:18,304
Thank you for all you've done for us.

630
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:20,013
Luke is innocent.

631
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:23,309
They're not arresting Luke Cage.
They're arresting Carl Lucas.

632
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:25,811
Who called you?

633
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:30,191
Once a city councilwoman identified
Luke Cage as Carl Lucas on television,

634
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:32,235
our office received numerous calls.

635
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:34,027
The information's pertinent and valid.

636
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:36,572
Mariah, again.

637
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:39,742
I'm innocent, and I can prove it.

638
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:42,495
It doesn't matter what you can prove.

639
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,747
You still owe the state of Georgia time.

640
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:48,917
[sighs] Okay.

641
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:54,590
Sorry.

642
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:56,717
Coffee's gonna have to wait, babe.

643
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,310
[Claire] Luke.

644
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:39,009
Like I said, I know a
really great lawyer in town.

645
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,386
I'll call him.

646
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:42,805
[sighs] Okay.

647
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:47,393
- Be careful.
- Always.

648
00:37:48,311 --> 00:37:49,478
[chuckles softly]

649
00:37:50,396 --> 00:37:52,105
You're so corny.

650
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,463
[Mariah] One of the things
that was happening was...

651
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:17,214
[continues speaking indistinctly]

652
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,110

653
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:44,700
[sighs]

654
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:47,620
Alex, you're the man.

655
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:50,623
Anything you need, Madam
Councilwoman, let me know.

656
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:55,503
It's old school. But
it's got a nice feel.

657
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,880
Belonged to Cornell.

658
00:38:58,589 --> 00:38:59,882
It suits you.

659
00:39:02,468 --> 00:39:03,969
[chuckles softly]

660
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:07,681
Yeah, it does.

661

[sighs]

664
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,904
It's a long trip. You
want something to drink?

665
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:25,866
I was set up for something hot and
dark before y'all messed that up.

666
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:27,284
[scoffs]

667
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:29,161
Sweet Christmas.

668
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:32,623
Well, we can stop for coffee at
Dunkin' Donuts before we hit the bridge.

669
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:35,418
Ain't the same.

670
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,044
Let's just get this over with.

671
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,801
Oh. I like Chester
Himes. This is a good one.

672
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:44,968
It's actually mine.

673
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,388
What were you reading before?

674
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,473
- [sighs]
- Some West Coast shit.

675
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:50,599
Michael Connelly.

676
00:39:50,683 --> 00:39:53,143
- You ever read Harry Bosch?
- Nah.

677
00:39:53,226 --> 00:39:55,312
Well, you'll have some time to read now.

678
00:39:56,814 --> 00:39:58,649
No, I won't.

679
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,818
I don't plan on hibernating.

680
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:03,361
I was innocent before
and I'm innocent now.

681
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:05,989
I've got work to do.

682

to move forward.

688
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:45,292
Always.
