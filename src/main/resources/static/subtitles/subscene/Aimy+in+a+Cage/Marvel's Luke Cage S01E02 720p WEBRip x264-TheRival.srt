1
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:22,570
-[breathes deeply]
-[man] What are you doing here, nigga?

2
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:32,746
I'm not gonna ask you again.

3
00:00:35,749 --> 00:00:37,126
Young man...

4
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:40,796
I've had a long day.

5
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:44,007
I'm tired.

6
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:46,094
But I'm not tired enough...

7
00:00:46,177 --> 00:00:49,513
to ever let nobody call me that word.

8
00:00:51,932 --> 00:00:55,186
You see a nigga standin' in front of you?
[breathing heavily]

9
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:58,814
Across the street from a building
named after one of our greatest heroes?

10
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:02,818
-[gun cocks]
-Yeah, a dead one.

11
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:04,195
[Luke exhales]

12
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:07,948
[theme music playing]

13
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:21,564
[gunshots]

14
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:26,444
[gunshot]

15
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:54,763
[Scarfe] You're doing it again.
I hate it when you do that.

16
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:57,850
Hate it when I do what?

17
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,978
Stare at the photos
like they're about to start moving.

18
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,105
They are talkin' and movin'.

19
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:05,524
You just have to be still enough
to hear what they're sayin'.

20
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:07,192
Whatever, Horton.

21
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:11,989
A clue is a clue, no matter how small.

22
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:14,116
This was deeply personal.

23
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:17,160
Well, money invites the beast.

24
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:18,496
There's nothing in Chico's jacket

25
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:21,790
to suggest he was capable
of that type of violence.

26
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:23,917
I don't think he has the stomach for it.

27
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:27,588
Stomach? [sighs]

28
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:30,466
There was vomit found at the junkyard.

29
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,552
Inside it were fibers
consistent with that of a winter mask.

30
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:37,055
One of the robbers didn't have the heart
to go through with it.

31
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:39,933
My guess, it was babyface Chico.

32
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:44,397
Uh, he was the last man standing.

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,358
You mean to tell me
Benjamin Franklin was wrong?

34
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:51,570
Well, in this case,
it was all about the Benjamins either way.

35
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:53,364
[scoffs] Always is.

36
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:56,575
Somebody got jacked,
and somebody got pissed...

37
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:58,577
And somebody got dead.

38
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:00,871
This ain't over yet.

39
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:17,388
Eh, I just never got into Donald Goines.

40
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:18,764
[chuckling] Are you crazy?

41
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:22,560
Donald Goines was a street poet.

42
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:25,062
-[Pop chuckles]
-[Luke] I didn't say Goines isn't.

43
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:28,566
But Walter Mosley, George Pelecanos?
[clicks tongues] Boom.

44
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:30,734
I bet you're into Richard Price.

45
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:32,278
{\an8}I dig Price.

46
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:33,862
{\an8}Dennis Lehane, too.

47
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:37,115
What about Chester Himes?

48
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,826
Without question.

49
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:41,745
[clears throat] My biggest beef
with Donald Goines

50
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:44,623
is that he wrote about criminals
and he died like one.

51
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:48,586
[chuckles] You don't have to get
all Fox News about it.

52
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:49,962
[Pop chuckling]

53
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:52,255
Goines invented Kenyatta,

54
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,717
the best black hero this side of Shaft.

55
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,469
-[customer] Thank you, my brother.
-All right.

56
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:58,971
-Keep that magic touch.
-I'll keep working on it.

57
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:00,222
See you next week, Victor.

58
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,559
So you're saying
Kenyatta is better than Easy Rawlins?

59
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:05,060
I ain't saying all that.

60
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:08,105
I'm just saying Kenyatta's my favorite.

61
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:11,567
He took the fight to the man...

62
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:14,862
in the streets by his self.

63
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:18,115
Just like somebody else could
if he wasn't sweeping hair

64
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,158
and washing dishes.

65
00:05:20,993 --> 00:05:22,202
[sighs] Don't start, Pop.

66
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:26,874
The whole neighborhood
is yapping about how Zip and two goons

67
00:05:26,957 --> 00:05:30,127
got the beat down
at Genghis Connie's last night.

68
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,462
Hmm.

69
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:36,299
I heard it was four guys.

70
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:40,095
[chuckling]

71
00:05:41,263 --> 00:05:43,056
I knew it had to be you.

72
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:48,020
{\an8}[chuckles] No wonder you came
into the shop so light on your feet.

73
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:51,649
Either that or someone
finally gave you some trim.

74
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:52,983
Oh!

75
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:56,319
[both laugh]

76
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:00,157
{\an8}[Pop] Mmm. Mmm.

77
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:07,915
So that's how it works?
Those thugs shake people down?

78
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,504
They work for Mariah or Cottonmouth?

79
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,090
[grunts]

80
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:23,597
A little bit of both.

81
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:26,016
They related?

82
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:28,644
-Aunt and nephew?
-Cousins.

83
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:31,396
Their grandma was Mama Mabel.

84
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:33,356
Who's Mama Mabel?

85
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:36,652
[sighs] The devil's ex-wife.

86
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:40,781
They ever come at you sideways?

87
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:42,491
No.

88
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:46,161
This place right here is Switzerland.
Everybody knows that.

89
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,415
Where you from, Luke?

90
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:52,835
Chicago.

91
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:55,045
You ain't from no Chicago.

92
00:06:56,464 --> 00:06:58,674
Where are you from, really?

93
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:02,970
Savannah, Georgia.

94
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:04,513
All right.

95
00:07:05,431 --> 00:07:07,265
Country boy.

96
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:11,645
You know how the wind feels fluffy,
like you could stuff it into a pillowcase

97
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,897
-right before a big thunderstorm?
-Mmm-hmm.

98
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:16,191
Harlem's the same.

99
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:18,068
Trouble smells a certain way.

100
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:20,821
You can... touch it.

101
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:23,240
Cottonmouth.

102
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:26,452
He's gonna fall behind lookin' for Chico.

103
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:28,036
That's the way that works.

104
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,205
Ain't no secrets uptown.

105
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:35,168
I mean, you could set a watch
by the way that shit will play out.

106
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:37,379
[scoffs]

107
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:38,756
I'm fresh out of singles.

108
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,299
-I ain't gonna break no ten for that.
-[laughs]

109
00:07:41,383 --> 00:07:43,218
[chuckles] Oh, no, no.

110
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:45,053
-[door opens]
-[bell chimes]

111
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:08,869
Something real about a razor.

112
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,832
You should let me use my clippers.
You gonna bump up.

113
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,834
Nah. [inhales deeply]

114
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:17,377
Doesn't have the same feel.

115
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,296
The clippers are idiot-proof.

116
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:23,091
That's what's missin' nowadays, Pop.

117
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,594
Attention to detail.

118
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:29,472
Everyone wants things fast, quick.

119
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:32,768
Me?
I like to take my time.

120
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,023
[Pop] Time is a luxury most...
working class men cannot afford.

121
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,274
[Stokes] True.

122
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:43,612
Time is precious.
Shouldn't be wasted.

123
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:47,407
Mmm...

124
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,952
A good razor shave
is like a vacation to me.

125
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:53,872
It's incredible
how few people take advantage.

126
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:56,584
[Pop] It's a lost art.
[Stokes] Exactly.

127
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,210
That's the problem with these youngsters.

128
00:08:58,752 --> 00:08:59,878
They want it all.

129
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:02,881
But they don't want to put in the work.

130
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,634
They'll rob...

131
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:09,096
lie, cheat, steal,
just to get what they want.

132
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,015
Damn shame if you ask me.

133
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:15,102
[softly] Yeah.

134
00:09:15,185 --> 00:09:17,187
-Shame.
-Mmm-hmm.

135
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:21,567
How'd you... cut your hands?

136
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,194
Oh, uh, eh... shaving.

137
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:28,240
[chuckling] That's why I needed
a professional touch, you dig?

138
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:31,619
-[Pop] Sorry, brother.
-Twelve feet.

139
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:34,913
Two guns.

140
00:09:35,956 --> 00:09:37,499
Four seconds.

141
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,627
You gonna move?

142
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:41,962
No, not yet.

143
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:46,549
Just 'cause they call you Bobby Fish
don't mean you're Bobby Fischer.

144
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:48,636
And you ain't Turkish neither, Turk.

145
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:50,178
Not last time I checked.

146
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:52,014
[Turk] That's not what your daughter said.

147
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:54,099
[Bobby chuckling]
Yeah, but your mama confirmed it.

148
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:56,727
[Turk] Oh, you think you can throw me off
my game talking about my mama?

149
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,271
[Bobby] Oh, no, she is
a well-established ho.

150
00:09:59,354 --> 00:10:01,649
That should not faze you one bit.

151
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:02,775
Check.

152
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:11,742
That's a cheap broom.

153
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:13,744
Old.

154
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:18,331
I just got home.

155
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,250
College?

156
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:22,795
Three years this time...

157
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:24,087
Seagate.

158
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:26,298
I'm from 'round the way.

159
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:28,634
Grew up right here.

160
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:31,553
Everyone knows Pop.

161
00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:36,767
There was this little Puerto Rican kid...

162
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:40,437
I can't remember his name...
It's like, um...

163
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,230
Rico or, uh...

164
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,316
Chico.

165
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:48,361
Yeah...

166
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:51,824
Chico.

167
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:56,453
He used to shape me up back in the day.

168
00:10:58,413 --> 00:11:00,123
He was real good, too.

169
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,086
I was hoping he was still around.

170
00:11:07,422 --> 00:11:09,341
People come and go.

171
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:10,675
You know how it is, right?

172
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:13,053
Yeah.

173
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,267
[Luke] Pop...

174
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:21,478
I've got some fresh towels right here.

175
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:24,314
You've got some dirty ones.

176
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:26,358
I could take 'em out if you want.

177
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:28,986
No sweat at all.

178
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:33,198
I'm good, Luke.

179
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:34,532
[Stokes] Big man...

180
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:37,327
you work here, too?

181
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:41,623
This brother got more jobs
than a Jamaican.

182
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:43,625
-[laughing]
-[chuckles]

183
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:46,962
[Stokes] What's your name again?

184
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:49,757
-Luke.
-Luke. [snaps fingers]

185
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,674
[inhales sharply] Mmm, old school.

186
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,844
Biblical. [chuckles]

187
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:55,678
I'm all about the old school.

188
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:58,473
You know that...

189
00:11:58,556 --> 00:12:00,893
eye for an eye,
tooth for a tooth kind of thing.

190
00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:03,145
Fire and brimstone.

191
00:12:03,228 --> 00:12:06,273
[inhales sharply]
See... back then...

192
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:10,944
do someone wrong,
wasn't no beggin' and pleadin'.

193
00:12:11,987 --> 00:12:13,446
Just took care of it.

194
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:16,825
Handled your business.

195
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:21,830
What about turning the other cheek?

196
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:23,081
Mmm...

197
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:25,918
Jesus saves...

198
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,335
I don't.

199
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:31,506
You want a hot towel?

200
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:34,384
Not today. [exhales]

201
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,011
Gotta keep it movin'.

202
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:39,347
I'm a working man, too.

203
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:46,604
[Tone] Chico falls through...

204
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:48,148
we need to holler at him.

205
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:51,484
[Stokes] Thanks for the shave, Henry.

206
00:12:52,735 --> 00:12:54,696
I'm loyal to my people.

207
00:12:55,864 --> 00:12:58,116
[Luke] You're forgetting something,
Mr. Stokes.

208
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:08,001
Unless your last name is Corleone,
Shaft or Riley...

209
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:10,963
you owe my man $25.

210
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:13,798
Don't worry about it, Cornell.

211
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:17,845
Nah, it's all good.

212
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:20,138
[Stokes chuckles]

213
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:23,851
Tone, pay the man.

214
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:28,063
[bell chimes]

215
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,703
[door closes]

216
00:13:53,421 --> 00:13:55,090
They got Shameek.

217
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:59,469
Cottonmouth did it personally.
Did you see his knuckles?

218
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:01,263
I'm sorry, Pop.

219
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:03,681
You never liked him anyway.

220
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:05,058
That's not entirely true.

221
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:08,436
Shameek is gone.
I don't condone what he did.

222
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,981
But it's not too late for Chico.

223
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:13,400
Pop, stay out of it.

224
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:15,152
Some people you just gotta let go.

225
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:17,279
I can't just turn my back on him.

226
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:20,740
You used to find people, right?

227
00:14:21,783 --> 00:14:23,201
That was a long time ago.

228
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:25,871
It ain't exactly a skill you lose.

229
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:29,249
Look, this place is Switzerland.

230
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:31,293
If we can find him before they do,

231
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:34,880
maybe I can set up a parley
with Cottonmouth.

232
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:41,553
I don't think so, man.

233
00:14:42,804 --> 00:14:44,722
I'm sorry, Pop.
I can't do it.

234
00:14:44,806 --> 00:14:47,309
Hey... yes.

235
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:49,186
You are sorry.

236
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,981
Now, I hadn't seen Reva
since she was five.

237
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:55,275
So when she comes home
with a convict husband

238
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:57,652
and a shaky-ass story...

239
00:14:57,735 --> 00:14:59,487
I ain't ask her no questions.

240
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:04,701
And when that same well-read ex-con
comes back wanting to be paid in cash...

241
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:08,538
and lifting up refrigerators
like they're empty cardboard boxes,

242
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:11,458
I just nodded my head again.

243
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,130
What did you tell me
about keeping your secrets?

244
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:22,552
That I owed you one.

245
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:27,099
Well, time is due.

246
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,229
I'm collecting.

247
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:41,113
[indistinct chatter]

248
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:44,324
[boy 1] Whoo!

249
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:46,576
[boy 2] Hey!

250
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:53,875
[boy 3] Five-O! Five-O!
[boy 4] Let's go!

251
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:56,753
[Scarfe] Whoa! Hold up...
Hold up, hold up!

252
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:58,005
[chuckling] Where's everybody goin'?

253
00:15:58,088 --> 00:16:00,173
Come on, Chauncey.
You know the drill.

254
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:04,761
Have you seen this kid?
Chico?

255
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,597
[Chauncey]
No, I don't know that dude.

256
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,890
Stop it.

257
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:14,021
His initials are painted right here.

258
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:16,982
Just like all the other
St. Nick playground legends.

259
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:18,441
You seen him or not?

260
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:20,860
Nah.

261
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,864
Wastin' time, Misty.

262
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:26,699
Yo, pass me the rock.

263
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:28,326
[chuckling]

264
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:31,163
What, you fittin' to play
one-on-one with me?

265
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:35,042
No. That wouldn't be fair to you.

266
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,668
[all exclaim]

267
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:38,378
Come on, let's play H-O-R-S-E.

268
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:41,464
Shot for shot.
And if I win...

269
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:45,760
you tell me everything I need to know
about Wilfredo Chico Diaz.

270
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:47,637
What's in it for me?

271
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:51,974
A get out of jail free card
for any non-violent felony.

272
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:54,352
[scoffs] Not doin' that shit.
No way.

273
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,355
-[ball bounces]
-We good?

274
00:16:58,981 --> 00:17:00,692
[boy 1] Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

275
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,235
Ladies first.

276
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:04,446
-[all exclaim]
-[boy 2] Come on, Chauncey.

277
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:05,780
[Chauncey chuckles]

278
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,038
[boy 2] Come on, man.
It's your thing, man!

279
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:16,208
[indistinct chatter]

280
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:22,339
Hey, you better shoot like Cheryl Miller,
not Barney Miller.

281
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,842
Sometimes I forget how old you are.

282
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:28,970
I mean, he gonna hold your purse, too?

283
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:30,638
[all chuckling]

284
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:34,934
Wow!

285
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:43,360
[all exclaim]

286
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:48,030
Come here.

287
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:51,033
You see that?

288
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:54,579
This is my court, too.

289
00:17:56,831 --> 00:17:58,208
Let's play.

290
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,628
[all exclaim]

291
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,382
-[boy 1] Oh, come on, now!
-[all exclaim]

292
00:18:11,596 --> 00:18:13,014
[inaudible]

293
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:53,971
[men speaking indistinctly]

294
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:05,107
-[knock on door]
-Yes.

295
00:19:07,694 --> 00:19:08,945
Hey.

296
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:18,996
Mmm-mmm.
That's not nearly enough.

297
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,166
[laughing] What?

298
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:22,834
It's not enough.

299
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:25,837
I need the rest so I can make the deposit.

300
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:28,673
Well, I need to find the guy who has it.

301
00:19:29,716 --> 00:19:32,844
Look... I borrowed from those donations,

302
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:35,847
at your request,
so you could refurbish your club.

303
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:38,975
You go and make
a gun deal with Domingo.

304
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:41,228
Then you get jacked
and we're all exposed.

305
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:44,231
You promised this would be
taken care of, but it's not.

306
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:46,148
You don't give me orders.

307
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:47,775
We're partners.
You're not my boss.

308
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:51,196
We're family, Cornell.
But think about it.

309
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,030
Do you really want to go to jail?

310
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:55,450
-Do you want to lose your club?
-Of course not.

311
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:58,203
Then you need
to fix this shit right now.

312
00:20:00,497 --> 00:20:03,165
Does your guard dog
want a drink of water?

313
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,418
-[chuckles softly]
-Don't worry about him.

314
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:08,296
You worry about the politics,
I worry about my job.

315
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,216
Your job is to uncomplicate my life.

316
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:14,636
And your job
is to turn my water into wine.

317
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:20,642
Family first, right?

318
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:23,353
Always.

319
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:27,106
I'm coming by the club tonight.

320
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:28,608
[chuckles]

321
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:31,403
Why? I thought you said
you don't want to be seen there.

322
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:32,487
I don't.

323
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:34,864
But I like the music.

324
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:39,827
I'm going to be on you
until this is resolved.

325
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:43,331
It's getting resolved.

326
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:45,082
You best believe that.

327
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:51,298
[gun cocks]

328
00:20:52,006 --> 00:20:55,176
-You ain't gonna fire that.
-I'll kill you.

329
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,136
Shameek is dead.

330
00:20:57,219 --> 00:21:00,181
They have his half of the money.
Now they want yours.

331
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:05,186
-Shameek is dead?
-Yeah.

332
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:07,855
Well, good. [spits]

333
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:11,693
Then you just want my money
for yourself, don't you?

334
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:15,029
I couldn't care less.

335
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:17,490
I came here because
Pop asked me to come for you.

336
00:21:18,658 --> 00:21:19,867
Pops?

337
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:22,203
For your dad.

338
00:21:22,287 --> 00:21:23,705
[breath trembling]

339
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:26,874
Why does everybody bring him up?
He was never there for me.

340
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,626
I'm sick and tired of hearing about him.

341
00:21:29,544 --> 00:21:31,713
Pop thinks he has a way
to clear this mess up.

342
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,006
I know you didn't kill Dante...

343
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:35,675
or Shameek.

344
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:37,719
All you guys wanted was the cash.

345
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:40,012
It was an inside job.

346
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:42,557
Dante's safe idea.

347
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,351
Look...

348
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:47,479
I found you in four hours for free.

349
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:52,567
Imagine how fast someone
Cottonmouth pays will find you.

350
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,026
[inhales sharply]

351
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,448
The only chance you have at survival
is if you come with me right now.

352
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:04,454
Well, I got a half a million new chances
is the way I see it.

353
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,885
Tell Pops... I'm sorry.

354
00:22:22,346 --> 00:22:24,223
He was always good to me.

355
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:26,518
He deserves better.

356
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:45,202
Took your rook, rookie.

357
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,997
Hmm.

358
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:52,710
-It's your move, son.
-[chuckling] Mmm-hmm.

359
00:22:52,794 --> 00:22:54,837
-Don't get scared now.
-Oh, no, no, no...

360
00:22:54,921 --> 00:22:56,506
-[bell chimes]
-[indistinct chatter]

361
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:05,473
[gate creaking]

362
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:10,728
[Luke] Want some catfish
with that hot sauce?

363
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:12,063
[chuckling]

364
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,775
-You count calories, Power Man?
-[sighs]

365
00:23:15,858 --> 00:23:18,110
Fork will kill you
quicker than any bullet.

366
00:23:20,404 --> 00:23:21,823
[chuckling]

367
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:25,117
I found Chico.

368
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:28,996
He ain't coming.

369
00:23:30,665 --> 00:23:32,166
You can't save everybody.

370
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:35,837
You're wrong about that.

371
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:40,424
What would have happened in my life
if people gave up on me?

372
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:43,553
I was no angel.

373
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:47,599
No, I was a beast.

374
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:50,727
-[man grunting]
-[Pop] <i>I was a beast.</i>

375
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,353
<i>No two ways about it.</i>

376
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:55,482
[Luke] <i>They call you Pop</i>
<i>because you were the OG?</i>

377
00:23:55,565 --> 00:24:00,319
[Pop] <i>No, it was the sound my fist made</i>
<i>when I knocked a fool out.</i>

378
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:02,363
<i>Snap, crackle, pop!</i>

379
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:07,368
<i>Cottonmouth lost three teeth as a kid.</i>

380
00:24:07,451 --> 00:24:11,038
[chuckles] <i>Wilfredo saw him smile</i>
<i>and the name just stuck.</i>

381
00:24:11,956 --> 00:24:16,252
<i>And Fredo was the craziest</i>
<i>little Puerto Rican in black Harlem.</i>

382
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:19,839
<i>I used to call 'em</i>
<i>Thing One and Thing Two.</i>

383
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:21,340
Hey, yo, yo, yo.
Can I take your photo?

384
00:24:21,423 --> 00:24:23,843
-Yeah, yeah. Jamel, right?
-Right over here, man. Thanks.

385
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:25,052
Yeah, yeah. [mutters]

386
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:28,097
[Luke] <i>What'd that make you?</i>
<i>The Cat in the Hat?</i>

387
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,517
-[shutter clicks]
-[Pop] <i>Something like that.</i>

388
00:24:33,895 --> 00:24:35,813
[Luke] So what happened?

389
00:24:35,897 --> 00:24:37,273
[Pop] We got popped.

390
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:42,945
Wilfredo went from selling crack
to smoking crack.

391
00:24:44,321 --> 00:24:47,366
I got caught
with a gun and a bag of money.

392
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:48,910
Kept my mouth shut.

393
00:24:50,077 --> 00:24:52,413
Went on pause for ten years.

394
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:54,749
My woman was pregnant when I went in.

395
00:24:54,832 --> 00:24:56,918
I haven't seen her or...

396
00:24:57,001 --> 00:25:00,087
my son since he was 13.

397
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:02,715
I have this nightmare that...

398
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,052
one day, he's gonna come to the shop...

399
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:09,639
ask for a cut, sit in my chair...

400
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:11,599
and I'm not even gonna know him.

401
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:17,396
I didn't have one single skill
when I got out.

402
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,525
I could've gone back to the streets.

403
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:25,863
But you weren't that guy anymore.

404
00:25:25,947 --> 00:25:28,783
I wasn't... and I'm not.

405
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:30,868
And that's what I go through every day.

406
00:25:30,952 --> 00:25:32,787
Trying not to be that person.

407
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:35,873
I'm not that guy either.

408
00:25:35,957 --> 00:25:39,085
I thought you was innocent, Shawshank.
Mmm.

409
00:25:40,377 --> 00:25:42,338
I ain't guilty. [sighs]

410
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:45,675
But... I ain't innocent either.

411
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:50,471
I had to balance my dirt...
so I opened up this shop.

412
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:55,267
So those young knuckleheads
have a place to get away.

413
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:58,354
Like Fredo's son, Chico.

414
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:04,736
And certain... muscle-headed fugitives
lookin' for a change of pace.

415
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:08,656
[Pop chuckles]

416
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,783
After what I did at Genghis Connie's...

417
00:26:12,243 --> 00:26:16,538
for the first time in a long time...
I felt at peace.

418
00:26:16,623 --> 00:26:17,874
[Pop] Mmm-hmm.

419
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:20,417
I made a decision
when I got back to the crib.

420
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:24,922
I'm done running.

421
00:26:28,676 --> 00:26:30,094
Boys run.

422
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:33,180
Men stand.

423
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:34,682
You're a man.

424
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:39,436
I am who I am.

425
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:42,356
Or...

426
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:47,361
maybe I have a chance to find out
who I could really be.

427
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:49,906
That's right.

428
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:52,616
-[Luke] Hmm?
-Yeah.

429
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,786
Come on.
Let's get going.

430
00:26:58,915 --> 00:27:00,332
Hey, Pop.

431
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,209
Damn. Y'all still at it, huh?

432
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:04,045
-He don't know when to quit.
-Oh, I know.

433
00:27:05,004 --> 00:27:06,714
[Bobby] Until I win.

434
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:08,340
Gonna leave it open?

435
00:27:08,424 --> 00:27:10,009
Yeah, till we shut the doors...

436
00:27:10,092 --> 00:27:12,594
[chuckles] whether it's empty or not.

437
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,722
I'm gonna go get my smock.

438
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:34,283
[grunts]

439
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:36,535
What... were you thinking?

440
00:27:36,618 --> 00:27:40,289
Sorry. I'm sorry!
[sniffles]

441
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:43,334
[Pop exclaims] You dummy.

442
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:46,879
-You dummy.
-What's up?

443
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:48,005
Dummy.

444
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:49,966
[both sobbing]

445
00:27:58,265 --> 00:27:59,391
You did good.

446
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:02,895
That's what.

447
00:28:04,939 --> 00:28:06,983
My bad, Mr. Hunter.

448
00:28:09,944 --> 00:28:11,695
Where's the restroom key? Just...

449
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:13,239
Get out of here.

450
00:28:13,322 --> 00:28:14,907
Go.

451
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:16,743
You heard me.

452
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:27,086
You got to get him out of here.

453
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:32,091
And you know damn well,
Chico ain't gonna show up for work today.

454
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:35,427
Of course not, but...
Pop will tell us the truth

455
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:37,429
about who Chico really is.

456
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,140
He's just a barber, right?

457
00:28:39,223 --> 00:28:41,100
Ah, he's a little bit of everything.

458
00:28:41,183 --> 00:28:43,644
Not a very good judge of character.

459
00:28:43,728 --> 00:28:46,272
He's got a big heart.
We should fault him for that?

460
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:47,648
[Scarfe] Nope.

461
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:51,819
Gimme a second.
And don't start without me.

462
00:28:51,903 --> 00:28:53,695
Can't do the one-two punch without you.

463
00:28:55,907 --> 00:28:56,949
Turk.

464
00:28:59,994 --> 00:29:00,995
Misty.

465
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:04,373
I'm surprised to see you this far uptown.

466
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:07,668
I'm mostly Midtown nowadays, you know?

467
00:29:07,752 --> 00:29:09,754
Puffy ain't got shit on me, baby.

468
00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:12,423
I'm the real bad boy worldwide.

469
00:29:12,506 --> 00:29:15,843
Yeah, your rap sheet got so many hits,
your record could put out a record.

470
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:19,596
Hey, I just fell through to see my man,
Bobby Fish, and to play some chess.

471
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,349
Well, you need to fall your ass
back downtown,

472
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:24,601
'cause if I catch you around here again...

473
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:27,271
it's gonna be checkmate.

474
00:29:27,354 --> 00:29:29,857
Understood? Mr. Barrett?

475
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:31,818
I hear you...

476
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,904
Detective.

477
00:29:35,822 --> 00:29:36,989
Loud and clear.

478
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,038
Did anyone see you come here?

479
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:46,999
-Hmm?
-No... I don't think so.

480
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:49,043
-[door opens, bell chimes]
-Luke, check.

481
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:56,092
[whispers] Five-O!

482
00:29:57,176 --> 00:29:59,678
You need to go
in the bathroom and hide. Go.

483
00:30:02,348 --> 00:30:04,266
Go!

484
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:08,104
-Hey, Misty.
-Fish.

485
00:30:08,187 --> 00:30:09,605
-How you doin'?
-Good to see you.

486
00:30:09,688 --> 00:30:10,689
You, too.

487
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:12,399
[Misty] Is Pop around?
[Fish] He's in the back.

488
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:13,609
He'll be out in a minute.

489
00:30:15,194 --> 00:30:18,197
-[pats Pop]
-Let me stall 'em. Sit tight.

490
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:22,618
[chuckles] Whoa.

491
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:25,913
Detective Mercedes Knight.

492
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:28,540
It's Misty now, Pop.
You know that.

493
00:30:28,624 --> 00:30:30,251
[Pop] All right, all right.

494
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:31,627
[chuckles]

495
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,588
Call yourself
whatever you want to, Detective.

496
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:36,007
-Hey!
-[chuckles] Ooh!

497
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,967
I respect authority.

498
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,969
[both chuckle]

499
00:30:40,052 --> 00:30:42,263
I bet Kelly must be
really proud of you, hmm?

500
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:46,100
He's still mad I went to Temple
instead of playin' for St. John's.

501
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:48,269
-Bam!
-Swish!

502
00:30:48,352 --> 00:30:49,770
[both laugh]

503
00:30:50,687 --> 00:30:52,023
Is this your partner?

504
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:54,608
Detective Rafael Scarfe.

505
00:30:58,362 --> 00:30:59,821
[softly] Okay.

506
00:30:59,906 --> 00:31:01,866
How can I help you?

507
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:04,576
We're looking for someone
who works for you.

508
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,120
Wilfredo Chico Diaz?

509
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:08,830
You heard about that shooting...

510
00:31:08,915 --> 00:31:10,499
at the junkyard?

511
00:31:10,582 --> 00:31:12,334
Near the edge of the river?

512
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:14,545
No.

513
00:31:15,129 --> 00:31:16,380
Really?

514
00:31:17,256 --> 00:31:19,716
There was a shootout.

515
00:31:20,426 --> 00:31:22,428
Looks like a gun deal that was robbed.

516
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:24,680
Turned into a bloodbath.

517
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:28,059
Dante Chapman was found dead at the scene.

518
00:31:28,142 --> 00:31:32,854
Shameek Smith was found
about 18 hours later, beaten to death.

519
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:36,317
Last person to see Shameek Smith alive,

520
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,610
other than a strip club...

521
00:31:38,694 --> 00:31:41,238
was right here at the shop
with his homeboy.

522
00:31:43,157 --> 00:31:44,200
Uh, they were both here.

523
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:48,620
Chico gave Shameek a fade in that chair,

524
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:50,539
right next to where you're standing.

525
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:53,875
That's it though.
That's the last time I saw them both.

526
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,877
You really think Chico killed his friend?

527
00:31:57,379 --> 00:31:58,630
Over money?

528
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:01,633
You are?

529
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:08,224
Luke Cage.

530
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:12,394
Detective Misty Knight.

531
00:32:12,478 --> 00:32:13,980
Detective.

532
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:17,608
Looks like you found some better clothes
to audit in.

533
00:32:22,947 --> 00:32:23,948
[exhales]

534
00:32:25,282 --> 00:32:28,827
Look... when my guys are here,

535
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,621
they know the rules.

536
00:32:30,704 --> 00:32:33,332
Respect, no street talk.

537
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:36,168
But when they leave,
I got no control.

538
00:32:36,252 --> 00:32:39,463
Understood,
but Chico is a person of interest

539
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:41,757
who might have pertinent information.

540
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,259
Pertinent information?

541
00:32:43,342 --> 00:32:46,012
Like, someone saying
who they really are?

542
00:32:46,928 --> 00:32:49,806
Pertinent as in useful.

543
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,475
As in factual.

544
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:54,936
Like, uh... Chico's number.
You got that, right?

545
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:58,482
He missed work the last two days.

546
00:32:59,608 --> 00:33:04,655
His booth rent is due,
so maybe he'll return my call.

547
00:33:04,738 --> 00:33:07,449
If you see him, tell him to call me.

548
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:11,370
Call me anyway.

549
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:14,623
He may not be safe otherwise.

550
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:17,418
Will do.

551
00:33:18,752 --> 00:33:21,588
-[chuckles]
-Nice meeting you, Luke.

552
00:33:21,672 --> 00:33:25,009
You too... Detective.

553
00:33:36,062 --> 00:33:37,729
-[door opens]
-[bell chimes]

554
00:33:42,276 --> 00:33:44,945
Really? [scoffs]

555
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:46,447
We had coffee.

556
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,825
Mmm-hmm.
[chuckles] Right.

557
00:33:53,995 --> 00:33:55,331
You gonna call Cottonmouth?

558
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:57,208
No.

559
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:59,960
You need to see him.

560
00:34:00,044 --> 00:34:01,753
What?

561
00:34:01,837 --> 00:34:03,089
He's going to want to see you.

562
00:34:03,172 --> 00:34:07,843
No. I'm afraid our... friends in blue
might have eyes on the shop.

563
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:11,763
You work at Harlem's Paradise.

564
00:34:11,847 --> 00:34:13,807
You have a reason to go there.

565
00:34:15,142 --> 00:34:18,604
You can't do this kind of thing
on the phone.

566
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:23,067
[sighs]

567
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,987
Look, man, Wilfredo...

568
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:30,866
he died... on these streets.

569
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:36,830
I don't wanna see Chico
go out the same way.

570
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:40,959
Can you do this for me?

571
00:34:47,216 --> 00:34:48,884
I'm on it.

572
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:50,552
All right.

573
00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:55,224
[softly] Thanks.

574
00:35:00,604 --> 00:35:02,022
[dishes clattering]

575
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:07,569
[Nate] You're late.
I have your money.

576
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,489
Cage.

577
00:35:10,572 --> 00:35:12,533
Cage!

578
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:14,451
Do you hear me?

579
00:35:14,535 --> 00:35:15,744
Cage!

580
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:17,329
[indistinct chatter]

581
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:28,924
Your brother down there told Candace
to send me up a Blue Hawaiian.

582
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:31,510
Like he gonna get up on me
with a Blue Hawaiian.

583
00:35:31,593 --> 00:35:32,886
[both laugh]

584
00:35:34,305 --> 00:35:36,432
Ah, he lucky I let his ass in here.

585
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,435
I need to speak to your man.

586
00:35:39,518 --> 00:35:41,645
What? You didn't get tipped
at the barber shop?

587
00:35:41,728 --> 00:35:42,979
Pat him down.

588
00:35:50,654 --> 00:35:51,988
He's clean.

589
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:54,950
Thought you already had a job.

590
00:35:56,285 --> 00:35:58,370
'Cause I could use some more ice.

591
00:35:59,538 --> 00:36:00,956
I'm here for Pop.

592
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,876
Pop is a grown-ass man.
Why ain't he here?

593
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:08,964
He said you wouldn't wanna hear this
over the phone.

594
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:10,549
So he sent me.

595
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:13,134
Ha! The suspense is killing me.

596
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:15,887
Pop wants to set up a parley for Chico.

597
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:19,558
He doesn't want him
to end up like Shameek.

598
00:36:20,934 --> 00:36:22,894
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

599
00:36:23,437 --> 00:36:25,814
Those cuts on your hands say different.

600
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:27,733
[cell phone vibrates and chimes]

601
00:36:29,776 --> 00:36:33,364
All I'm saying is that if you
want to talk to Pop about Chico,

602
00:36:33,447 --> 00:36:34,906
that can be arranged.

603
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,033
All of your goods will be returned.

604
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:41,288
{\an8}The only thing our mutual friend
wants is safe passage.

605
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:46,001
He'll never come back to New York, ever.

606
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:48,044
I don't speak Chinese.

607
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:51,590
[laughs] 'Cause that's what
this conversation is to me.

608
00:36:51,673 --> 00:36:55,135
If I got somethin' to say to Pop,
I say it to him my damn self, you dig?

609
00:36:57,888 --> 00:36:59,765
[sighs] There's history.

610
00:37:01,182 --> 00:37:02,809
Pop understands your trouble.

611
00:37:04,895 --> 00:37:07,689
He's just asking you
to remember your history.

612
00:37:15,781 --> 00:37:17,115
[Stokes inhales deeply]

613
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,997
Tell Pop I'll come by
the barbershop for a haircut.

614
00:37:25,749 --> 00:37:27,709
Same time as before.

615
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:29,169
You understand?

616
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:32,506
I'll tell him.

617
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,884
By the way...

618
00:37:37,218 --> 00:37:38,720
you're fired.

619
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:41,515
No, I'm not.

620
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:44,518
I quit before I walked in.

621
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:49,022
[chuckles]

622
00:37:49,105 --> 00:37:51,358
-[upbeat music playing]
-[crowd cheering]

623
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:04,455
We got eyes on the boy.

624
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:06,122
What do you want me to do?

625
00:38:06,957 --> 00:38:09,209
-Your man say where he was?
-No.

626
00:38:11,295 --> 00:38:12,504
[Stokes] Hmm.

627
00:38:15,674 --> 00:38:17,133
Let it go.

628
00:38:18,302 --> 00:38:19,928
Take care of it in the morning.

629
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:22,598
You sure?

630
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:24,975
If he's out on the streets slippin',
handle it.

631
00:38:25,892 --> 00:38:29,020
But if he's not moving around,
I'll deal with it, all right?

632
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:33,942
[crowd cheering and whistling]

633
00:38:34,025 --> 00:38:36,695
[Faith Evans over microphone]
Now let me holler at y'all for a minute.

634
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:39,280
'Cause I got somethin' that I need to say.

635
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:40,907
What y'all know about that thing?

636
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:42,743
[Mariah] You're wasting your gifts,
my brother.

637
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:46,162
This gangster life...

638
00:38:46,246 --> 00:38:48,540
not what our ancestors fought for.

639
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:50,834
Not what our people died for.

640
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:52,794
This is exactly what they died for.

641
00:38:53,504 --> 00:38:57,298
Self-determination, control, power.

642
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:28,997
That boy we was
looking for earlier today...

643
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,707
he's at Pop's Barber Shop.

644
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:34,378
-You seen him?
-With my own two eyes.

645
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:36,463
How long ago?

646
00:39:36,547 --> 00:39:38,214
A little while back.

647
00:39:40,175 --> 00:39:41,968
Hey!

648
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:43,053
Hey!

649
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,681
Yo, what's up with my money?

650
00:39:57,568 --> 00:39:59,528
[clippers buzzing]

651
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:00,779
[Pop] You need to leave?

652
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:02,823
I'm just gonna pick up dinner
from Boulevard.

653
00:40:02,906 --> 00:40:05,033
Where's Luke?

654
00:40:08,787 --> 00:40:12,624
-Have you seen him?
-Girl, you just don't quit, do you?

655
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:15,794
-I just want to take him out for coffee.
-[scoffs]

656
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:27,848
You know what people remember
besides black martyrdom?

657
00:40:27,931 --> 00:40:29,265
What?

658
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:31,017
Black money.

659
00:40:32,102 --> 00:40:35,606
Don't you ever get sick
of people calling you a criminal?

660
00:40:35,689 --> 00:40:37,733
[gun clicks]

661
00:40:38,525 --> 00:40:41,069
You gonna at least wait
for Chico to come outside, right?

662
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:44,490
Right?

663
00:41:08,972 --> 00:41:10,516
What he sayin'?

664
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:14,603
He'll only talk to you.
Right here at the shop.

665
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,527
I want something better.

666
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:24,195
-Like what?
-Respect.

667
00:41:25,572 --> 00:41:27,282
It's all that ever really matters.

668
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:34,205
Money outlasts respect.

669
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:37,918
Respect will put your name
on the side of a building...

670
00:41:38,835 --> 00:41:43,089
but the money that put your name up there
comes from someplace.

671
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:49,971
At what cost, Cornell?

672
00:41:50,055 --> 00:41:53,892
When you find out...
you'll tell me.

673
00:41:59,147 --> 00:42:01,608
[all cheering]

674
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:11,284
What are you doing out here
with that bag, man?

675
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:13,453
-There's no TV back there.
-Are you serious?

676
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,001
Pop!

677
00:42:31,012 --> 00:42:32,013
[bullet ricochets]

678
00:42:32,848 --> 00:42:33,890
[screams]

679
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:45,944
[muffled screaming]

680
00:42:47,278 --> 00:42:49,364
[whispering]
Stay dead. Stay dead.

681
00:42:53,493 --> 00:42:55,078
[gunfire stops]

682
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:06,923
[whimpering]

683
00:43:07,966 --> 00:43:09,134
[gagging]

684
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:20,937
-You should've waited.
-Shut up, man.

685
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:36,745
You okay?

686
00:43:37,663 --> 00:43:39,998
Pop!
[softly] Pop.

687
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:42,208
Oh, Pop... [crying]

688
00:43:42,292 --> 00:43:43,877
[gagging]

689
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,003
-Come on...
-[Pop grunts]

690
00:43:45,086 --> 00:43:47,213
-[wheezing]
-You hear the sirens?

691
00:43:48,214 --> 00:43:51,217
[panting] They're almost here.
They comin'.

692
00:43:52,761 --> 00:43:54,595
Someone call the goddamn ambulance!

693
00:43:55,889 --> 00:43:57,348
[Luke sobbing]

694
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:00,268
[Pop straining] Swear...

695
00:44:01,895 --> 00:44:04,648
Swear jar...

696
00:44:05,273 --> 00:44:07,901
[crying] I will. I will.

697
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:11,612
[gulps]

698
00:44:11,697 --> 00:44:13,406
Luke...

699
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:20,371
[stuttering] Forward... always.

700
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:21,873
[gagging]

701
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:26,002
Always...

702
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:31,174
[stuttering] forward.

703
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:36,722
[whispers] Always forward.

704
00:44:37,931 --> 00:44:38,932
[mumbling]

705
00:44:40,851 --> 00:44:42,268
[crying] No.

706
00:44:43,937 --> 00:44:45,814
[sniffling] No...

707
00:44:46,732 --> 00:44:48,859
No! [sobbing]

708
00:44:50,736 --> 00:44:51,945
No!

709
00:44:53,654 --> 00:44:55,323
[screaming] No!

710
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:01,204
[breathing heavily]

711
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:03,790
[sniffles]

712
00:45:15,176 --> 00:45:17,512
[indistinct radio chatter]

713
00:45:17,595 --> 00:45:19,639
[Lonnie] Mommy, I'm okay.

714
00:45:19,722 --> 00:45:22,642
I'm okay.
Luke covered me.

715
00:45:22,725 --> 00:45:25,561
He said he didn't move because
he didn't want them to shoot again.

716
00:45:25,645 --> 00:45:28,648
-[Patty sighs] You see who did this?
-[Lonnie] No, Mama.

717
00:45:28,731 --> 00:45:30,691
[officer] Excuse me, ma'am.
Will you come with me?

718
00:45:34,404 --> 00:45:36,281
[Scarfe] You get a look at the shooter?

719
00:45:36,364 --> 00:45:37,532
Nah.

720
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:39,659
It's a miracle I'm even alive, man.

721
00:45:52,338 --> 00:45:53,882
Luke.

722
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,927
Luke?

723
00:45:57,844 --> 00:45:59,262
Are you okay?

724
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:05,936
You didn't get hit?

725
00:46:07,187 --> 00:46:09,022
I said I'm okay.

726
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,820
What happened?

727
00:46:15,778 --> 00:46:17,363
They started firing.

728
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:20,491
The kid, Lonnie,
was in the middle of the room.

729
00:46:21,409 --> 00:46:23,661
So, once I saw the flash...

730
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:26,372
instincts kicked in.

731
00:46:27,457 --> 00:46:30,501
I grabbed him... and I shielded him.

732
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:35,340
You... shielded him?
You shielded him with what?

733
00:46:39,302 --> 00:46:41,346
Have the paramedics seen you yet?

734
00:46:42,763 --> 00:46:45,558
I said I'm good.

735
00:46:49,312 --> 00:46:51,898
How long have you been
working here at the shop?

736
00:46:51,982 --> 00:46:53,649
Five months.

737
00:46:55,526 --> 00:47:01,032
Did Chico reach out to Pop
since we were in here earlier?

738
00:47:03,034 --> 00:47:05,536
Was he hiding out here the whole time?

739
00:47:10,959 --> 00:47:14,754
-What did they get from the canvass?
-[Scarfe] Uh, patrol got nothing.

740
00:47:14,837 --> 00:47:17,715
Traffic cam picked up a black Escalade.

741
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,469
Tracked it to Hunts Point in the Bronx,
but it was torched. No prints.

742
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:23,763
[inhales sharply]
They were after Chico?

743
00:47:23,846 --> 00:47:26,182
-There's no doubt in my mind.
-Hmm.

744
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:29,435
I checked out Cottonmouth.
He's been at the club all night in VIP.

745
00:47:30,353 --> 00:47:32,772
-So we don't have shit?
-No.

746
00:47:32,855 --> 00:47:36,442
No decent witnesses except for Chico,
but then what else?

747
00:47:36,526 --> 00:47:37,735
Nothin'?

748
00:47:55,878 --> 00:47:57,713
[indistinct chatter]

749
00:48:01,092 --> 00:48:02,802
[man] Yeah, baby. Uh-huh.

750
00:48:14,105 --> 00:48:16,274
-[mouthing] Upstairs.
-I'm coming with you.

751
00:48:16,357 --> 00:48:18,526
-Nah.
-No, I need to be there.

752
00:48:21,904 --> 00:48:23,573
[Stokes] What's wrong, Shades?

753
00:48:25,366 --> 00:48:27,702
-You should've waited.
-Waited? [scoffs]

754
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:31,039
Bump that noise.
I got the call. It was me.

755
00:48:31,122 --> 00:48:32,582
What happened?

756
00:48:32,665 --> 00:48:34,334
Look, Turk calls me.

757
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:37,628
Tells me he saw
Chic at the shop, slippin'.

758
00:48:37,712 --> 00:48:41,299
I came and ask you if it was important
if the nigga was breathing.

759
00:48:41,382 --> 00:48:42,758
You seem non-committal...

760
00:48:44,177 --> 00:48:45,553
so I make an executive decision.

761
00:48:46,637 --> 00:48:48,098
[both laughing]

762
00:48:48,181 --> 00:48:50,683
That's what you call...
an executive decision?

763
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:52,102
[chuckles]

764
00:48:52,185 --> 00:48:53,561
Yeah, okay.

765
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,731
Mmm, so you caught him slippin' outside?

766
00:48:56,814 --> 00:48:59,609
No, bro, I lit that shit up
like the Fourth of July.

767
00:48:59,692 --> 00:49:03,279
[chuckling] It was all so
<i>Django</i> Candyland shit for real.

768
00:49:03,363 --> 00:49:05,406
Lights, camera, action, baby!
[clapping hands]

769
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,658
Somebody call Quentin! [laughing]

770
00:49:12,413 --> 00:49:15,250
I suggested... we wait.

771
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:16,959
[Tone] Wait?

772
00:49:17,043 --> 00:49:20,130
[stammers] Wait for what, Shades?

773
00:49:21,214 --> 00:49:23,799
You ain't even down with the clique.
You can't give orders.

774
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,636
It was loud 'cause it's supposed to be.

775
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:29,930
Niggas need to know
you don't rob Cottonmouth!

776
00:49:30,015 --> 00:49:32,225
[yelling] My name is not Cottonmouth!

777
00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:37,855
[Tone] My bad.

778
00:49:37,938 --> 00:49:39,482
My bad.

779
00:49:40,191 --> 00:49:41,859
He's dead, right?

780
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:44,862
Chico's laid out...
He's done.

781
00:49:44,945 --> 00:49:47,157
It don't matter.
We got the money!

782
00:49:50,743 --> 00:49:52,328
[breathes deeply]

783
00:49:52,412 --> 00:49:54,164
You had to do it, I guess.

784
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,380
Pops can rebuild.
[inhales sharply]

785
00:50:04,132 --> 00:50:06,176
He won't like it
but I'll donate some money...

786
00:50:07,385 --> 00:50:08,844
anonymously.

787
00:50:08,928 --> 00:50:11,722
-It's all gonna be okay. [chuckles softly]
-[pats arm]

788
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,896
What?

789
00:50:21,441 --> 00:50:22,567
Pops is dead.

790
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:28,614
A casualty of war.

791
00:50:28,698 --> 00:50:30,866
You know...
[stammers] Shit happens.

792
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,327
[Turk] Yo...

793
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,079
Where's my money?

794
00:50:36,789 --> 00:50:38,291
How the hell did you get up here?

795
00:50:38,374 --> 00:50:40,460
I'm Turk Barrett, baby.

796
00:50:40,543 --> 00:50:42,962
The door ain't been built yet
that can hold me back.

797
00:50:43,045 --> 00:50:44,922
Now, where's my money?

798
00:50:46,299 --> 00:50:47,758
Okay, Mr. Barrett.

799
00:50:47,842 --> 00:50:50,803
Tone promised to pay you
for finding Chico, right?

800
00:50:50,886 --> 00:50:52,972
-Yeah.
-That right?

801
00:50:56,267 --> 00:50:57,768
Okay.

802
00:50:58,644 --> 00:50:59,979
Hey, hey, hey!

803
00:51:00,062 --> 00:51:01,814
[screaming]

804
00:51:05,526 --> 00:51:07,487
[panting]

805
00:51:09,905 --> 00:51:15,161
You can collect your money
from Tone downstairs, Mr. Barrett!

806
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:21,459
I assume that completes our business.

807
00:51:22,793 --> 00:51:24,879
Y'all Harlem niggas are off the hook.

808
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:27,590
I'm going back to Hell's Kitchen,
where it's safe.

809
00:51:27,673 --> 00:51:29,091
[scoffs]

810
00:51:37,308 --> 00:51:38,684
Is that sufficient?

811
00:51:42,438 --> 00:51:44,106
There's enough there.

812
00:51:48,694 --> 00:51:50,571
You all right, cuz?

813
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,365
With what?

814
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,911
Extortion? Well...

815
00:51:57,912 --> 00:52:00,122
Murder, no!

816
00:52:00,206 --> 00:52:01,749
I'm not good.

817
00:52:03,709 --> 00:52:05,170
Don't expect me to be.

818
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:07,255
The money's still green.

819
00:52:10,925 --> 00:52:12,468
That it is.

820
00:52:13,886 --> 00:52:15,471
You should get outta here.

821
00:52:16,514 --> 00:52:19,684
You shouldn't be seen associating
with known criminals...

822
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:21,394
Councilwoman.

823
00:52:21,477 --> 00:52:22,937
Take the side exit.

824
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,481
I got some garbage
to clean up downstairs.

825
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:36,992
Sorry about Pop.

826
00:52:39,495 --> 00:52:41,331
Yeah, so am I.

827
00:52:41,414 --> 00:52:42,873
I know what he meant to you.

828
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:45,042
[Stokes sighs deeply]

829
00:52:47,378 --> 00:52:51,257
Believe it or not,
there's supposed to be rules to this shit.

830
00:53:12,778 --> 00:53:14,780
He must have gotten hit.

831
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,285
What?

832
00:53:21,412 --> 00:53:23,331
Luke...

833
00:53:23,414 --> 00:53:24,749
Cage.

834
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:28,461
He shielded the kid.

835
00:53:30,255 --> 00:53:33,424
He had bullet holes in his shirt.

836
00:53:33,508 --> 00:53:35,968
Blood everywhere, none of it his?

837
00:53:38,137 --> 00:53:39,972
How did he not get hit?

838
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:43,768
You're drunk.

839
00:53:47,062 --> 00:53:48,648
Not yet.

840
00:54:47,332 --> 00:54:50,751
-[breathing deeply]
-[man] What are you doing here, nigga?

841
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:00,803
I'm not gonna ask you again.

842
00:55:03,931 --> 00:55:05,475
Young man...

843
00:55:06,642 --> 00:55:08,853
I've had a long day.

844
00:55:10,229 --> 00:55:12,189
I'm tired.

845
00:55:12,272 --> 00:55:14,316
But I'm not tired enough...

846
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,403
to ever let nobody call me that word.

847
00:55:20,072 --> 00:55:22,241
You see a nigga standin' in front of you?

848
00:55:23,534 --> 00:55:27,287
Across the street from a building
named after one of our greatest heroes?

849
00:55:28,205 --> 00:55:31,125
-[gun cocks]
-Yeah, a dead one.

850
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:32,543
[Luke sighs]

851
00:55:33,794 --> 00:55:36,005
You even know who Crispus Attucks was?

852
00:55:37,256 --> 00:55:38,758
A free black man.

853
00:55:38,841 --> 00:55:42,553
The first man to die
for what became America.

854
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:48,183
He could've acted scared
when those Brits raised their guns.

855
00:55:48,267 --> 00:55:50,310
Blended in, in the crowd.

856
00:55:50,395 --> 00:55:51,937
But he stepped up!

857
00:55:52,855 --> 00:55:54,565
He paid with his life.

858
00:55:55,315 --> 00:55:57,067
But he started something.

859
00:55:58,152 --> 00:56:00,195
That's what Pop did...

860
00:56:00,279 --> 00:56:01,363
Not me.

861
00:56:02,031 --> 00:56:05,034
I laid in the cut until he stepped up!

862
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,703
And it cost him his life, too.

863
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,082
I ain't laying back no more!

864
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:14,043
You wanna shoot me?

865
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:16,796
Do it.

866
00:56:16,879 --> 00:56:18,380
Pull the trigger, nigga!

867
00:56:18,464 --> 00:56:21,175
I ain't got all night.
[breathing heavily]

868
00:56:21,258 --> 00:56:22,677
Do it!

869
00:56:23,553 --> 00:56:26,346
What, you scared?

870
00:56:26,431 --> 00:56:28,641
[breathing heavily] Fine.

871
00:56:29,642 --> 00:56:31,185
I'll do it for you.

872
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:08,598
Always forward, Pop.

873
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:11,851
Forward...

874
00:57:13,102 --> 00:57:14,604
always.

875
00:57:18,065 --> 00:57:20,067
[funk music playing]
