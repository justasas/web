3
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,608
Thank you, you may go now

00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:49,744
You'll soon be better than me!

5
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:52,873
The case of Ronning Holdings

00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:55,709
You still can win that,
let's celebrate!

00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:58,169

10
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:11,182
They're getting marry!
It's not business

11
00:02:12,392 --> 00:02:14,895
Come to our firm to be our auditor,

12
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:16,021
OK?

13
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:17,689
Waise, what do you think?

14
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:20,317
I appreciate Philip's talent,

15
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:24,362
but it'll be boring
for couples working together

16
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,035
I'd never be bored!

17
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,369
Don't you regret?

18
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:33,038
Never!

19
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:36,333
Be honest! Every morning

20
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:39,336
I've to wake her up
& prepare her breakfast

21
00:02:39,502 --> 00:02:42,255
Then, do her laundry

22
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:43,423
And then...

23
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:46,343
Petty,
please stop disclosing my privacy

24
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:49,679
Shall we delay our marri...

25
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:51,473
What're you saying?

26
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,183
Poor me...

27
00:02:54,517 --> 00:02:56,144
Right? What's the good of marriage?

28
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:58,480
You mean it or not?

29
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:02,317
Sorry, I've to finish my work

30
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,530

00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:08,782
Sorry!

32
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:18,166
Let it go!

33
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,493

34
00:03:19,543 --> 00:03:20,585
Go to work

35
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,921
Mr. Chow, I'm sorry!

36
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,297
Never mind

37
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:29,013
Philip have to live with
the bad habits of Mandy

38
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:31,680
If you don't want to be married,
just say so

39
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:35,350
Don't be so serious!
You understand me, right?

40
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:41,273
Mr. Chow, Mr. Ng's arrived

41
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,148

51
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:19,144
So I can get back to US to report duty

52
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:22,272
No problem! How is Uncle Chiu?

53
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,940

Need my help?

57
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:30,196

58
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:32,164

give them a good lesson

59
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:35,160
Should you need any help, tell me

60
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,037

You're the chairman of Adonis' club.

00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:49,109
I've no chance after you've left

82
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:50,652
How about you?

83
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:52,654

Move it now, or I'll kill you!

92
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:02,909
Move it quickly

93
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,331
Go there & have a look!

94
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:05,912

They'll kill you! Hurry up!

96
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:10,250
I...

97
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:20,528
Where is the money, where is it?

98
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:35,752
Hurry up!

99
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:36,836

100

Hi! Dragon!

101
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:39,373
I've just left the Law office

102
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,507
Are you OK?

103
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:43,677
It peanut for me,
but there's hell of a mess

104
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:47,347
Kent...

105
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:50,600
Kent...

106
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:58,483
Sir, be calm, don't touch the injured

107
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,484
Come on over!

108
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,404
Be careful Miss, it'll be ok!

109
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:07,701
Hurry up!

110
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:20,881
Hello boss,
after Kent'd got on Mandy Chang's Car

111
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:22,966
The money was gone

112
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:24,467
Maybe that bitch took away our money

113
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:25,635
Well,

114
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:28,054
don't let her tell anyone
about this case

115
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,932
No matter how,
I've to talk to her first

116
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:49,659
Miss Chang,
can you recall the situation?

117
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:53,330
It's a mess! That thief...

118
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:57,834
He... He was running with the robbers

119
00:10:58,001 --> 00:10:59,753
Mind what you're saying!

120
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:01,338
Are you very sure?

121
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:05,050
He'd just visited my office, I'm sure!

122
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:06,551
Don't frame me!

123
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:07,677
Be calm!

124
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:09,012
She is framing me!

125
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:10,741
He's nuts! Don't let him come near me!

126
00:11:11,223 --> 00:11:12,824
You bitch!
Don't you want me to beat you?

127
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:14,100
Let me go...

128
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:19,522
I don't want to see him!
Don't let me see his face

129
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:25,820
He is out of your sight!

130
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,959
Be careful! Slowly...

131
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:45,674
This way

132
00:11:47,342 --> 00:11:48,093
Thanks

133
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:51,054
Hurry up!

134
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:12,576
We've got the wrong guy!

135
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:15,745
You idiot! Throw him out of the car!

136
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:32,095
Stop any bull shit!

137
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:32,888
We've been buddies for so many years,

138
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:33,975
why don't you trust me?

139
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,015
I do trust you!

140
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:36,516
But the money is robbed

141
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:37,809
There must be a betrayer!

142
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:40,353
Are you tailed all the way to HK?

143
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,606
If so,
I'd have been robbed in C. America!

144
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:45,025
There must be a betrayer here!

145
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:46,613
Who are you suspecting?

146
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:49,011
How much does your girlfriend know?

147
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:52,699
Nonsense! She won't!
I'm just playing her

148
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,326
I won't let her know such things

149
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:55,535
How about Mandy Chang?

150
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:56,494
She won't!

151
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,747
Maybe, she's hiding our money

152
00:12:58,914 --> 00:12:59,664
She wants to take it as her own!

153
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:00,582
Impossible!

154
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:02,834
Waise Chow, we've the responsibility to
get the money back

155
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:05,441
I'll inform Uncle Chiu,
you'd better figure our an explanation

156
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,141
You've heard what we said?

157
00:13:18,308 --> 00:13:19,184
Yes,

158
00:13:19,643 --> 00:13:22,229
the triad members of US export

159
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:25,607
the dirty money secretly to HK

160
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:27,359
Cause HK is a free port

161
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:31,571
They'll white wash the money here
& remit it to US lawfully!

162
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:33,099
Thus, the govt. Can't check it our

163
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:34,082
You're quite correct

164
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:36,535
You're the one

165
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:38,662
who launders the money for them

166
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:40,997
I've not committed any crime in HK

167
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:41,915
But to me,

168
00:13:42,123 --> 00:13:44,417
you're no different from
the triad criminals

169
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:45,919
I do it for our future

170
00:13:50,006 --> 00:13:51,091
You still love me, right?

171
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,345
Are we friends from now on? I doubt it

172
00:13:55,554 --> 00:13:56,304
I wonder if the robbery case

173
00:13:56,513 --> 00:13:57,514
was masterminded by you!

174
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:33,633
Thanks

175
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:49,900
Waise, we'd keep the righteousness

176
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,985
for we're the lawyers

177
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:54,070
But anyway,

178
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:56,823
we cannot commit crimes!

179
00:14:57,574 --> 00:15:01,036
I always trust you,
but why you cheat me?

180
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:04,831
I can't forgive you, anyway!

181
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:06,917
So, sorry...

182
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,419
No! You're the one who'd apology

183
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:12,255
You'd better think over
how to defend yourself

184
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:24,809
Inspector Yeung

185
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:25,936
Speaking!

186
00:15:26,228 --> 00:15:27,270
Hello, I'm Petty Lee

187
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:30,607
I'm at home, I want to talk to you

What're you doing? Don't come to me

00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:23,994
You've taken 1 /2 of my property

It's so high! I can't jump!

228
00:17:58,755 --> 00:17:59,589
Jump!

00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:04,177
It hurts, leave me alone!

00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:05,674
But you'd run for your life!

231
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:07,764
Hurry up!

232
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:25,574
Don't shoot!

233
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,244
No... Don't shoot! Don't...

00:18:31,788 --> 00:18:32,622

00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:40,130
Bull shit!

238
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:42,498
Bullets were flying up there!
I don't want to be killed!

239
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:44,729
I'll be a suspect of homicide

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,721
Put me down!

242
00:18:52,142 --> 00:18:53,768
What're you doing? Damn!

243
00:19:05,197 --> 00:19:05,447

244
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:07,115

245
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,247

Don't pull me!

249
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:26,218
Why did you beat me?

250
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:39,481
Are you ok? Get up at once!

251
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:41,274
Help him! He is falling down

252
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:42,067
Mind yourself!

253
00:19:42,234 --> 00:19:46,279
Why don't you save him? He is falling!

254
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:05,048
My feet are killing me! I can't walk!

255
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,554
Let me go! Where do you take me to?

256
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:16,434
Let me down! Damn you!

257
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:18,687
Are you crazy!

258
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:19,980
Are you happy?

259
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:27,195
Let me down!

260
00:20:27,654 --> 00:20:29,406
Don't pull my hair!

261
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:30,957
I'll make you blind!

262
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:32,492
I can't see! You'll be easily hurt!

263
00:20:32,868 --> 00:20:34,588
You wanna get killed?
I almost run you over!

264
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:36,454
Bastard, go to hell!

265
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:37,581
Don't play on the road

266
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,499
Don't block my way...

267
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,084
I am sorry!

268
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:46,047
My foot! It's painful!

269
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:49,885
Don't move, cops

270
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:51,136
He kidnaps me!

271
00:20:51,303 --> 00:20:51,803
I didn't

272
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,054
Arrest him...

273
00:20:54,764 --> 00:20:56,349
You've assaulted a police officer!

274
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:58,059
Help! He kidnaps me!

275
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:00,645
Don't shout...

276
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,652
Are you ok?

277
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,489
Breathe deeply

278
00:21:53,823 --> 00:21:56,451
Don't die,

279
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,454
I don't want to
be charged of another homicide

280
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,873
Are you ok?

281
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,211
Let's go!

282
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,521
Where is it?

283
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:26,231
This is my home

284
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:30,986
Where are you going?

285
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:32,320
Hurry up!

286
00:22:34,948 --> 00:22:36,157
What do you want?

287
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:37,409
Pissing!

288
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,411
I won't go in there!

289
00:22:39,578 --> 00:22:41,162
I won't let you in too!

290
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:54,301
Don't pull!

291
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:55,468
It's painful!

292
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:00,223
Stop!

293
00:23:15,155 --> 00:23:15,906
What're you doing!

294
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:20,577
Let me down!

295
00:23:40,472 --> 00:23:41,348
Get up!

296
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:50,190
Don't come over! Don't!

297
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:51,608
You think I want you to stick around?

298
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:53,527
If not the cuff, who'll care about you?

299
00:23:53,735 --> 00:23:54,402
Who do you think you are?

300
00:23:54,611 --> 00:23:55,692
Why did you follow me home?

301
00:23:56,112 --> 00:23:57,531
You've framed me of robbery

302
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:58,615
So I came for you

303
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:01,284
I did see you rushing out
together with the robbers

304
00:24:01,451 --> 00:24:03,370
If I were a thief, you'd have been killed

305
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:09,209
After raped! Don't cry!

306
00:24:16,258 --> 00:24:17,717
Was the dead

307

308
00:24:45,036 --> 00:24:46,329
Don't move!

309
00:24:53,712 --> 00:24:55,839
You're smart in the solicitor's office

310
00:24:56,256 --> 00:24:58,258
But now, you look shit!

311
00:25:34,002 --> 00:25:35,545
We can no longer stay here

312
00:25:36,213 --> 00:25:38,048
The police will find us here

313
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,549

00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:58,461
Let's eat first, come on

330
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,683
Your noodle will get cold!

331
00:27:13,894 --> 00:27:15,604
You don't like me, anyway

332
00:27:16,187 --> 00:27:19,024
Change my ex-wife's clothes after eating

333
00:27:19,191 --> 00:27:21,776
Then, do what you like

334
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:36,499

Let's go for him, ok?

338
00:27:42,255 --> 00:27:43,298
Are you begging me?

339
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:47,427
Let's eat first

340

It's hot!

341
00:28:14,037 --> 00:28:16,873
Sorry, I didn't intend to!

342
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,543
Did the cops treat you badly?

343
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:21,336
No, I've informed Uncle Chiu,

344
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:22,629

345
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:23,880
I'm leaving

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,972
Follow him, see what's he doing!

347
00:28:32,138 --> 00:28:32,973
Yes!

348
00:28:51,074 --> 00:28:51,834

Hit him!

351
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:24,774
What's the use of at stick?

352
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:25,734
Find a big one!

353
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:27,068
I've never hit any body!

354
00:29:27,235 --> 00:29:28,361
Get bigger one!

355
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:37,120
Left side... left side!

356
00:30:03,897 --> 00:30:05,106
Don't scare me!

357
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,567
Wake up please! I don't intend to...

358
00:30:08,902 --> 00:30:11,196
Wake up!

359
00:30:11,404 --> 00:30:12,239
Mandy Chang!

360
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:13,365
It's Mandy!

361
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:05,125
Dragon, try your best to stop the car!

362
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,328
Dragon, they're after me,
come up & help me!

363
00:31:41,494 --> 00:31:42,495
You'd better come down!

364
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:45,415
It's high! How can I?

365
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,918
There are stairs! Idiot!

366
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:03,808
Go!

367
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:31,377
Where?

368
00:32:31,461 --> 00:32:32,128
Over there!

369
00:32:39,553 --> 00:32:40,387
I can't walk...

370
00:32:40,554 --> 00:32:41,304
Run!

371
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:44,307
They're close! You trouble maker!

372
00:32:58,446 --> 00:33:00,490
Did you kill Petty?

373
00:33:00,657 --> 00:33:01,950
Why you killed her?

374
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:02,868
I didn't

375
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,413
Give the money back to me

376
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:08,999
If the money is taken by me,
why should I stay here?

377
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:09,875
Why should I come to you?

378
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:11,418
What sort of money is it?

379
00:33:11,877 --> 00:33:13,336
Speak up! Or I'll lose my temper?

380
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:24,264
Chase them!

381
00:33:25,015 --> 00:33:26,016
Release me!

382
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:17,567
How are you? Are you ok?

383
00:34:56,857 --> 00:34:57,858
Stop!

384
00:34:58,942 --> 00:35:01,152
Give me back the money,
it is important to me!

385
00:35:01,361 --> 00:35:02,654
Is it dirty money?

386
00:35:03,029 --> 00:35:05,490
It's not your concern,
you can't take it!

387
00:35:05,657 --> 00:35:06,408
Give it back to me

388
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:08,273
I don't want to tell, how's it?

389
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,456
In my home

390
00:35:13,665 --> 00:35:14,666
He means his home!

391
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:21,006
We don't know!

392
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:21,882
Sorry!

393
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,803
If I killed Petty,

394
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,014
I could have killed you too

395
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:32,976
Who are they?

396
00:35:33,977 --> 00:35:35,270
I do want to know.

397
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:37,522
I suspect that
there is a betrayer in your office

398
00:35:37,689 --> 00:35:40,358
This is my phone no.
Call me if you're in need

399
00:35:43,153 --> 00:35:44,738
I'll call you

400
00:35:47,866 --> 00:35:50,160
I'm back to investigate

401
00:35:50,368 --> 00:35:53,747
Who's the guts to steal from Uncle Chiu

402
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,044
Kent was dead on the car of Mandy Chang

403
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:00,879
I've asked my boys to catch them back

404
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:04,799
But I don't know why David let them go!

405
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:10,305
Is it true?

406
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:13,266
If it's true,

407
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:15,353
I won't ask you here
to be in charge of this case

408
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,025
I'll find the money back & find out

409
00:36:22,192 --> 00:36:23,273
who's the head of this case

410
00:36:24,236 --> 00:36:26,530
This is my territory,

411
00:36:26,696 --> 00:36:28,073
may I send someone to help you?

412
00:36:28,573 --> 00:36:29,282
No!

413
00:36:29,449 --> 00:36:32,118
The one who killed Kent would pay for it

414
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:38,500
Hello, I'm Mandy, may I speak to Philip?

415
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:41,628
Philip is busy,
he told you not to call him again

416
00:36:46,883 --> 00:36:47,444
A table for...

417
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:48,051
Two

418
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:48,969
That way please

419
00:36:49,803 --> 00:36:50,762
Please sit

420
00:36:58,562 --> 00:36:59,563
Let's eat!

421
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:03,316
The beer's come

422
00:37:04,818 --> 00:37:07,153
Alcohol makes me happy

423
00:37:21,418 --> 00:37:24,379
See! You're stupid, your clothes' wet!

424
00:37:26,715 --> 00:37:27,465
Thank!

425
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:33,972
Thank!

426
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:37,809
Let's eat

427
00:37:38,018 --> 00:37:38,935
OK!

428
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:05,962
You're rude!

429
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,598
Let's try!

430
00:38:24,064 --> 00:38:25,106
It's hot

431
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,027
In the past,
I think you're a rude person,

432
00:38:29,402 --> 00:38:30,904
but you're not

433
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:32,739
Why do you make yourself disgusting?

434
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,700
When I was a cop, if you are not fierce

435
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:36,576
The rascals won't to scared

436
00:38:36,785 --> 00:38:38,495
"Hey bastard who you are?"

437
00:38:39,162 --> 00:38:40,455
You'd ask like this!

438
00:38:41,998 --> 00:38:42,916
Why did your wife leave you?

439
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,335
If you were her, would you leave me?

440
00:38:45,877 --> 00:38:47,754
I don't know, cause I'm not your wife

441
00:38:48,088 --> 00:38:49,047
I help her cause she is my client!

442
00:38:49,214 --> 00:38:50,423
I'll help you

443
00:38:50,757 --> 00:38:52,717
when you divorce again, ok?

444
00:38:52,884 --> 00:38:54,302
Next?

445
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:56,388
If I were Philip, I'd have helped you

446
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,090
Don't talk about that bastard

447
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,851
Ok... Sorry

448
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:01,701
The bill please

449
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:02,936
Coming!

450
00:39:08,483 --> 00:39:10,110
$1 80

451
00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:12,821
$1 80, what'll we do?

452
00:39:13,446 --> 00:39:15,073
Sorry, we do want some more dish

453
00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:20,161
I think you've

454
00:39:20,328 --> 00:39:21,830
never committed any crime

455
00:39:22,122 --> 00:39:22,914
What?

456
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:24,361
I don't have enough cash with me

457
00:39:28,962 --> 00:39:30,505
You bastard, get lost at once

458
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:32,257
Your girl stays with me tonight

459
00:40:52,796 --> 00:40:53,516
What's the matter?

460
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:54,548
Sorry!

461
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:55,799
What's that on? Crazy!

462
00:41:00,554 --> 00:41:01,054
Help!

463
00:41:01,263 --> 00:41:02,889
Shut up! Knee down!

464
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:34,504
Open the door!

465
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:49,186
That way!

466
00:42:39,694 --> 00:42:40,570
Go!

467
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:47,494
Hurry up!

468
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:05,887
Dragon!

469
00:43:14,229 --> 00:43:19,401
Don't! Stop!

470
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:25,323
Stop!

471
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,705
If you want to leave safely

472
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:33,373
Give back the money

473
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,417
I won't mistreat you two!

474
00:43:35,792 --> 00:43:36,952
I treat you as my role model,

475
00:43:37,043 --> 00:43:38,763
I can't imagine
you're doing this dirty job!

476
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,850
I don't need
your comment of my personality

477
00:43:41,673 --> 00:43:43,800
But I need to know where's the money

478
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,861
I know it!

479
00:44:03,528 --> 00:44:04,863
The US dollars put

480
00:44:05,322 --> 00:44:07,490
in a black brief-case, right?

481
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:12,704
You can't take away the money,
give it back to me

482
00:44:13,496 --> 00:44:14,706
I'll make you a share!

483
00:44:15,415 --> 00:44:19,002
Ok, why don't you let us go,
then I'll give you half of it

484
00:44:20,795 --> 00:44:21,755
What a proud idiot!

485
00:44:30,513 --> 00:44:31,431
Dragon!

486
00:44:31,598 --> 00:44:33,808
I feel so good! It's like massage!

487
00:44:33,975 --> 00:44:34,851
Faster please!

488
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:42,943
Boss!

489
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:44,109
The men from US have come

490
00:44:45,195 --> 00:44:46,196
Watch them carefully

491
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:49,199
I'll return soon

492
00:44:50,992 --> 00:44:54,913
It's so nice

493
00:45:01,753 --> 00:45:03,129
It's of 1 st class

494
00:45:06,216 --> 00:45:07,384
Right!

495
00:45:08,134 --> 00:45:08,885
Good!

496
00:45:09,594 --> 00:45:10,595
But Mr. Luciano

497
00:45:10,804 --> 00:45:12,472
is not satisfied with the deal

498
00:45:12,681 --> 00:45:13,974
Anything makes him dissatisfied?

499
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:15,433
Even he does,

500
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,602
who do you think you're?

501
00:45:17,769 --> 00:45:20,188
I've agreed with him that

502
00:45:20,355 --> 00:45:22,732
We'll share the business of

503
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,277
Uncle Chiu after Chiu's death

504
00:45:25,485 --> 00:45:26,570
50/50

505
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:30,699
By Luciano and me, is that clear?

506
00:45:31,157 --> 00:45:35,662
Just wait until we see Chiu's death body

507
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:41,167
Bull shit, if you can kill Chiu

508
00:45:41,334 --> 00:45:43,135
You won't be in my office,
begging for my help

509
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:18,163
Sit, sit...

510
00:46:33,803 --> 00:46:34,888
I've got it!

511
00:46:35,972 --> 00:46:39,476
My boss agreed with the terms

512
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,437
We're straight forward people

513
00:46:42,604 --> 00:46:44,856
I'll present the body of Chiu on time

514
00:46:58,662 --> 00:46:59,702
Will your buddy arrest us?

515
00:46:59,871 --> 00:47:00,914
He's loyal to friends,

516
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:02,332
he's not like Philip

517
00:47:02,499 --> 00:47:03,833
Don't even mention that bastard!

518
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:05,001
Ok...

519
00:47:10,257 --> 00:47:11,591
Tak!

520
00:47:12,759 --> 00:47:15,345
Tak, I'm Dragon!

521
00:47:15,845 --> 00:47:17,514
I don't see you! You'd better leave

522
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:21,852
You're invisible to him, let's go

523
00:47:24,187 --> 00:47:25,188
What's that mean?

524
00:47:25,647 --> 00:47:26,690
I'm not your buddy if I arrest you,

525
00:47:26,857 --> 00:47:28,218
I'm not a cop if I don't do my job

526
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:30,235
I'm innocent! Why you treat me so cool?

527
00:47:30,402 --> 00:47:31,236
Why do you come to me so secretly?

528
00:47:31,403 --> 00:47:33,154
You must be the criminal

529
00:47:33,321 --> 00:47:34,948
I didn't do it,
that's why I come to you

530
00:47:35,115 --> 00:47:37,701
Let it be! He doesn't take
a glance at you, leave now

531
00:47:37,868 --> 00:47:39,411
We're no thieves! Why should we leave?

532
00:47:39,703 --> 00:47:41,121
Ok, I'm now arresting you

533
00:47:47,502 --> 00:47:49,337
We're good buddies,
how come you treat me like that?

534
00:47:49,504 --> 00:47:51,631
Don't stop me,
I'll give him a good lesson

535
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,632
Who do you think you are?

536
00:47:52,799 --> 00:47:54,400
I've to arrest of
you've offended the law

537
00:47:56,595 --> 00:47:58,346
Stop!

538
00:47:58,513 --> 00:47:59,306
Get lost, bitch!

539
00:48:03,894 --> 00:48:05,228
Help!

540
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:13,361
Help! I can't swim...

541
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,822
Hold on, I'll save you!

542
00:48:16,531 --> 00:48:17,324
Go & save her now!

543
00:48:18,325 --> 00:48:20,327
You know I can't swim, go & help!

544
00:48:21,077 --> 00:48:22,746
Hurry up!

545
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,083
You always add me trouble
when I ask for help!

546
00:48:27,292 --> 00:48:30,587
You've always made me down graded!

547
00:48:30,754 --> 00:48:32,422
I'm benefiting you cause we're buddies

548
00:48:32,797 --> 00:48:33,882
If you do this for me,

549
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:35,342
you'll surely be appreciated

550
00:48:35,759 --> 00:48:38,345
You'll make me in deep shit!

551
00:48:38,511 --> 00:48:40,347
You always bring troubles to me!

552
00:48:41,973 --> 00:48:43,475
You've really a strong fist

553
00:48:44,643 --> 00:48:45,310
Thanks!

554
00:48:45,477 --> 00:48:47,354
Welcome, it's nothing

555
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:48,939
Let me do it

556
00:48:49,356 --> 00:48:51,024
No, I've almost finished

557
00:48:51,399 --> 00:48:52,192
Let me do it

558
00:48:52,776 --> 00:48:53,610
Are you ok?

559
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,570
Ok!

560
00:48:56,655 --> 00:48:58,114
Let me use Tse-ku to heal you

561
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,699
You know it?

562
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:02,202
Sure, but lack of practice

563
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:05,914
Take your clothes off!

564
00:49:09,084 --> 00:49:10,252
You're great!

565
00:49:31,231 --> 00:49:32,232
Comfortable!

566
00:49:33,024 --> 00:49:35,777
Yes, but a bit painful

567
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,446
I've just called David,

568
00:49:38,613 --> 00:49:39,865
he is on his way to here

569
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:40,949
What?

570
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:42,409
He gave me his name card

571
00:49:42,617 --> 00:49:43,897
He asked us to call him for help

572
00:49:46,454 --> 00:49:47,747
Why you trust him?

573
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:51,084
Tak, come on

574
00:49:51,293 --> 00:49:52,013
What's the matter?

575
00:49:52,168 --> 00:49:53,169
Come on!

576
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:55,714
Can I borrow it?

577
00:49:55,922 --> 00:49:56,882
You're putting me in trouble again?

578
00:49:57,048 --> 00:49:59,175
When did I put you in trouble?

579
00:49:59,342 --> 00:50:00,218
Other than those incidents!

580
00:50:00,385 --> 00:50:02,512
Go to buy something to eat, I'm hungry!

581
00:50:02,888 --> 00:50:03,805
I pay for it again?

582
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:05,640
Sure, cause we're buddy?

583
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:06,349
You...

584
00:50:06,474 --> 00:50:07,434
Are we buddy?

585
00:50:07,934 --> 00:50:09,414
You always make your buddy miserable!

586
00:50:22,073 --> 00:50:22,824
Stop!

587
00:50:24,701 --> 00:50:25,911
Dragon, what are you doing?

588
00:50:27,204 --> 00:50:27,621
What're you doing?

589
00:50:27,787 --> 00:50:29,456
You damn ABC, you play tricks on me?

590
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:30,790
Kill me then!

591
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:32,296
I don't want to do it!

592
00:50:36,129 --> 00:50:37,255
You'd deserve it

593
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,553
What are you doing

594
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:46,556
Cruel interrogation

595
00:50:54,105 --> 00:50:55,232
Hold the bowl

596
00:50:58,985 --> 00:51:00,529
Don't

597
00:51:00,946 --> 00:51:01,738
Don't move!

598
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:06,060
If you want your face ruined, move

599
00:51:06,243 --> 00:51:07,244
What's the relationship
between you & Waise Chow?

600
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:08,450
Do you want to murder him?

601
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,621
Put it back!

602
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:10,664
Hands off!

603
00:51:12,249 --> 00:51:14,125
Oh my face hurts!

604
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:16,419
Damn! Oh! My face...

605
00:51:16,586 --> 00:51:17,629
Help! It's painful...

606
00:51:18,463 --> 00:51:19,839
Will water hurt you face?

607
00:51:22,342 --> 00:51:23,593
It's only water!

608
00:51:24,427 --> 00:51:25,887
Look into the mirror!

609
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:40,443
I'm scared! You nuts!

610
00:51:41,027 --> 00:51:42,237
You deserve it

611
00:51:43,738 --> 00:51:46,032
You want to know it? Ok!

612
00:51:46,449 --> 00:51:48,201
Those are the dirty money
I brought from US

613
00:51:48,368 --> 00:51:50,453
Waise Chow's responsible to
white wash it

614
00:51:50,662 --> 00:51:52,789
I'm suspecting that
he arranged the robbery & murder!

615
00:51:53,582 --> 00:51:55,458
You idiot! He is on our side!

616
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:58,420
See, no bullet!

617
00:51:59,337 --> 00:52:00,714
Give me the keys, hurry up!

618
00:52:02,215 --> 00:52:03,258
Be quick!

619
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:11,600
Thanks!

620
00:52:11,766 --> 00:52:12,475
I'm sorry!

621
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,353
I know where Mandy & Dragon are

622
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,355
Really?

623
00:52:17,731 --> 00:52:19,900
Yours dirty money is taken away

624
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:21,026
by them

625
00:52:21,651 --> 00:52:24,654
I give you the people,
you give me 30% of the money, ok?

626
00:52:25,697 --> 00:52:26,740
What dirty money?

627
00:52:26,948 --> 00:52:29,451
Stop acting,
I can arrest them anything, so that

628
00:52:29,618 --> 00:52:30,911
They'll disclose your crime

629
00:52:31,828 --> 00:52:32,579
Sergeant,

630
00:52:32,913 --> 00:52:35,081
I'm a lawyer as well as a merchant

631
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:37,918
What secret do you mean?
You're black-mailing me

632
00:52:38,084 --> 00:52:40,170
It's a trade only,

633
00:52:40,587 --> 00:52:42,214
deal or no deal, it's up to you

634
00:52:45,675 --> 00:52:49,471
You want to black mail me?
You're not wise enough!

635
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:50,889
Mr. Chow, what do you want to show me?

636
00:52:51,097 --> 00:52:55,685
Your fellow wants to blackmail me,
he hides the criminals too

637
00:52:56,853 --> 00:52:58,271
You can search him.

638
00:52:58,438 --> 00:53:00,106
He taped the conversation

639
00:53:02,192 --> 00:53:03,235
Search!

640
00:53:05,445 --> 00:53:06,196
Don't drive mad...

641
00:53:06,404 --> 00:53:07,405
Don't push him!

642
00:53:08,156 --> 00:53:09,574
I've a tape too

643
00:53:10,867 --> 00:53:14,079
Sergeant Ho,
if you beg me to defend you

644
00:53:14,454 --> 00:53:16,540
You may be spared

645
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:18,583
You asshole!

646
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:22,796
Tak, give a report to me

647
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,541
During the investigation,
you are temporarily suspended

648
00:53:32,138 --> 00:53:33,223
Are you ok?

649
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,391
I'm ok!

650
00:53:43,733 --> 00:53:44,651
You're so careless

651
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:47,988
Inspector Yeung,
although such thing happened

652
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,990
I'm still willing to co-operate with you

653
00:53:50,198 --> 00:53:50,949
Thanks

654
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:12,512
Miss Leung, may I come in?

655
00:54:13,305 --> 00:54:14,472
Sure

656
00:54:24,858 --> 00:54:27,652
What can I help you?

657
00:54:29,529 --> 00:54:31,114
I'm suspecting you are linked with
the murder of Petty Lee

658
00:54:31,281 --> 00:54:32,115
You're under arrest!

659
00:56:28,899 --> 00:56:29,820
Don't go, or I'll shoot

660
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:54,591
It's illegal!

661
00:56:54,758 --> 00:56:56,343
How can we arrest Waise without a car?

662
00:56:56,843 --> 00:57:00,055
You've being suspected of murder,
which is more serious crime than this

663
00:57:04,267 --> 00:57:05,810
Hurry up!

664
00:57:06,186 --> 00:57:07,437
It'll be ok soon!

665
00:57:11,942 --> 00:57:13,527
Get on the car!

666
00:57:21,201 --> 00:57:22,786
Come on!

667
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:27,916
You're great,
you're faster in stealing car!

668
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,044
It's on hire, idiot!

669
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:32,337
Why'd we steal? Idiot!

670
00:57:33,255 --> 00:57:34,464
Sit the back seat, I'll drive

671
00:57:34,673 --> 00:57:35,507
Why?

672
00:57:35,674 --> 00:57:37,217
I'm familiar with the traffic of HK

673
00:57:37,425 --> 00:57:39,219
But you're wanted by the police!

674
00:57:39,386 --> 00:57:40,095
Sit at the back

675
00:57:40,262 --> 00:57:41,304
Shut up!

676
00:57:41,638 --> 00:57:43,932
You 2 sit at the back, I'll drive

677
00:58:10,876 --> 00:58:12,794
There is Waise's home,

678
00:58:13,169 --> 00:58:14,087
I'll give you signal

679
00:58:14,254 --> 00:58:16,506
Then you go & stop his car

680
00:58:18,383 --> 00:58:19,301
How about you?

681
00:58:19,676 --> 00:58:22,220
We'll catch a fainted Waise
for questioning

682
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:54,461
How you drive?

683
00:58:56,504 --> 00:58:58,131
David, what are you doing?

684
00:59:04,095 --> 00:59:05,138
He's Uncle Chiu!

685
00:59:05,347 --> 00:59:06,264
What shall we do then?

686
00:59:08,266 --> 00:59:09,187
Boss is being attacked!

687
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:10,560
We'd fight back!

688
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:13,271
Take the knife!

689
00:59:13,897 --> 00:59:15,106
Watch out!

690
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:17,567
Go after them!

691
00:59:25,784 --> 00:59:26,743
Don't go!

692
00:59:29,496 --> 00:59:30,413
You dare to run?

693
00:59:47,347 --> 00:59:48,765
Mandy

694
00:59:56,815 --> 00:59:57,649
Don't go!

695
01:00:00,777 --> 01:00:01,611
Kill him!

696
01:00:52,954 --> 01:00:53,580
Where is here?

697
01:00:53,747 --> 01:00:54,372
Hotel!

698
01:00:54,539 --> 01:00:55,379
Where are my clothes?

699
01:00:55,415 --> 01:00:58,001
Yours are dirty & worn,
I've got rid of it

700
01:00:58,919 --> 01:01:02,130
Did you... touch me?

701
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,008
Sure

702
01:01:06,676 --> 01:01:08,220
Otherwise, how can I put you in bed

703
01:01:09,763 --> 01:01:10,764
You are over weight!

704
01:01:10,931 --> 01:01:12,474
Any more?

705
01:01:13,141 --> 01:01:14,100
Any?

706
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:17,062
Good figure

707
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:19,781
You've seen my body?

708
01:01:20,774 --> 01:01:24,027
No! Except the important part!

709
01:01:24,194 --> 01:01:26,363
Those clothes are wet,
it'll make you sick

710
01:01:27,989 --> 01:01:29,032
What else did you do?

711
01:01:29,491 --> 01:01:30,572
I did want to do something,

712
01:01:30,617 --> 01:01:32,035
but you awaked early

713
01:01:32,619 --> 01:01:33,453
Next time I'll do it

714
01:01:36,623 --> 01:01:37,499
How dare you?

715
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:39,543
Sorry, I don't intend to!

716
01:01:49,469 --> 01:01:51,638
You've seen me, we break even

717
01:01:52,222 --> 01:01:53,306
I didn't!

718
01:01:53,723 --> 01:01:55,725
Ok, I'll let you see once more!

719
01:01:56,476 --> 01:01:57,477
You...

720
01:02:03,567 --> 01:02:05,694
Ok, don't you think I'm scared!

721
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,447
Take if off you've guts,
I'll tease you!

722
01:02:10,115 --> 01:02:11,658
Take if off! Why not?

723
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,995
Don't be serious!

724
01:02:16,496 --> 01:02:19,708
I've brought you a suit, try it

725
01:02:23,962 --> 01:02:27,883
I think you'll look pretty, try it

726
01:02:29,801 --> 01:02:30,927
How is Dragon?

727
01:02:46,985 --> 01:02:49,446
Who's the litter bug?

728
01:02:49,654 --> 01:02:51,156
I'll call the police?

729
01:02:51,448 --> 01:02:53,325
Who did it! Come out! Bastard!

730
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:54,576
What's the matter?

731
01:02:54,743 --> 01:02:55,702
What're you doing here?

732
01:02:58,205 --> 01:02:59,789
Don't go!

733
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:00,999
Freeze!

734
01:03:21,394 --> 01:03:21,955
Go over there!

735
01:03:22,145 --> 01:03:23,063
Ok!

736
01:03:47,629 --> 01:03:49,673
No.6767 reply

737
01:03:50,757 --> 01:03:53,009
What? They're in motel now?

738
01:04:01,768 --> 01:04:03,228
Open the door!

739
01:04:03,645 --> 01:04:04,938
Sorry, I'm off!

740
01:04:05,272 --> 01:04:06,273
You're committing an ordinance!
I'll sue you

741
01:04:06,439 --> 01:04:07,607

742
01:04:21,955 --> 01:04:22,998
Don't come in!

743
01:04:23,164 --> 01:04:23,707
My friends live here

744
01:04:23,874 --> 01:04:24,875
You're stink, you can't come in

745
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,042
I can't smell it

746
01:04:40,974 --> 01:04:41,850
You're stink!

747
01:04:42,392 --> 01:04:43,143
Where's Mandy?

748
01:04:43,977 --> 01:04:44,895
Bathing

749
01:04:46,605 --> 01:04:48,106
While I was risking my life,

750
01:04:48,273 --> 01:04:49,858
you took her here?

751
01:04:50,692 --> 01:04:51,985
What's that mean?

752
01:04:52,569 --> 01:04:53,490
What did you do to her?

753
01:04:53,653 --> 01:04:55,906
This is my privacy,
none of your business!

754
01:04:56,281 --> 01:04:57,882
You want to court her,
that's my business

755
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:01,411
Is she your wife?

756
01:05:02,495 --> 01:05:03,079
No

757
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:04,372
Sister?

758
01:05:04,581 --> 01:05:05,081
No

759
01:05:05,248 --> 01:05:05,749
Your mom?

760
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:06,750
You crazy!

761
01:05:07,334 --> 01:05:09,094
That mean,
it's none of your business, right?

762
01:05:09,127 --> 01:05:10,670
Damn you!

763
01:05:14,007 --> 01:05:15,675
What are you arguing?

764
01:05:16,927 --> 01:05:18,887
Dragon, why you look like this?

765
01:05:19,095 --> 01:05:19,975
I'm worrying about you

766
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,640
I'm fine

767
01:05:22,557 --> 01:05:23,757
Are you staying here for long?

768
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:26,061
Half the night, I've just waked up

769
01:05:29,564 --> 01:05:30,899
You look pretty

770
01:05:31,274 --> 01:05:32,400
Isn't it? Dragon

771
01:05:34,194 --> 01:05:34,819
Yes

772
01:05:35,028 --> 01:05:36,321
He gives it to me

773
01:05:39,616 --> 01:05:42,410
Turn a round

774
01:05:45,288 --> 01:05:46,008
What're you doing?

775
01:05:46,373 --> 01:05:48,083
Stomach-ache...

776
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:50,835
I'm going to get the jacket

777
01:05:52,462 --> 01:05:53,422
You won't believe in me,

778
01:05:53,463 --> 01:05:54,464
you'd better ask her

779
01:05:54,756 --> 01:05:55,837
Don't you think I'm scared?

780
01:05:56,508 --> 01:05:57,228
What's the matter?

781
01:05:57,634 --> 01:05:58,634
He's something to ask you

782
01:05:59,135 --> 01:06:00,762
What? Go ahead

783
01:06:03,932 --> 01:06:05,058
You look ugly for
lacking of enough sleep

784
01:06:05,225 --> 01:06:06,893
You're even worse

785
01:06:21,616 --> 01:06:23,536
What I concern most is
how to find the money back

786
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,246
I won't care anything else

787
01:06:26,413 --> 01:06:27,831
This is your own business

788
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:33,295
I'll give you bonus
if you get the money back tome

789
01:06:34,838 --> 01:06:35,922
US$300,000

790
01:06:36,673 --> 01:06:39,384
It's such a small amount!
I've seen the case, it's filled with money

791
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:40,802
You saw the case?

792
01:06:41,261 --> 01:06:43,021
Your partner with
the case has pumped info me

793
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,681
before entering the lift

794
01:06:45,891 --> 01:06:48,768
Hold it, I saw Kent running out

795
01:06:48,977 --> 01:06:50,270
without holding anything

796
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,944
I know where the money put

797
01:07:29,726 --> 01:07:30,977
Come down!

798
01:07:37,484 --> 01:07:39,819
Sometimes, violence works

799
01:07:40,529 --> 01:07:42,906
Mandy, lady first

800
01:07:43,323 --> 01:07:45,242
We'd do such dangerous thing

801
01:07:45,575 --> 01:07:46,660
You'd better watch out

802
01:07:49,496 --> 01:07:50,497
Get up

803
01:07:51,248 --> 01:07:52,749
Watch out!

804
01:07:59,506 --> 01:08:02,008
Dragon, watch out too!

805
01:08:37,961 --> 01:08:39,170
Ok?

806
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:30,180
Did you sleep with Mandy?

807
01:09:32,098 --> 01:09:35,310
If I say no, you won't believe

808
01:09:35,602 --> 01:09:37,562
If I say yes, you'll totally believe

809
01:09:37,771 --> 01:09:38,855
You'd better ask her

810
01:09:52,452 --> 01:09:55,372
Find it?

811
01:09:59,376 --> 01:10:00,418
What is it?

812
01:10:00,544 --> 01:10:01,878
We're rich!

813
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:12,722
Mandy, cheers

814
01:10:20,146 --> 01:10:21,439
You'll deserve it

815
01:10:23,775 --> 01:10:25,819
Another one here,
I've burned a 50 note only

816
01:10:26,528 --> 01:10:28,613
Come on ABC, let's cheers

817
01:10:47,966 --> 01:10:48,842
Thanks for your help

818
01:10:49,759 --> 01:10:51,219
I do it for myself only

819
01:11:09,029 --> 01:11:10,614
Who is going to beat Waise Chow for me?

820
01:11:10,822 --> 01:11:12,199
I'll do it

821
01:11:16,369 --> 01:11:17,495
What've you planned?

822
01:11:18,163 --> 01:11:21,082
1 st, I'll go back to US,

823
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:23,627
2nd, to find a girl friend here

824
01:11:23,919 --> 01:11:25,921
Girl friend? How's she look?

825
01:11:27,714 --> 01:11:29,315
Have a look of this photo,
you'll know it

826
01:11:38,225 --> 01:11:39,601
Have a look, come on...

827
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:43,355
It's me!

828
01:11:58,161 --> 01:12:03,083
I always think of getting rich

829
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:07,420
But I've never think of
the life after rich

830
01:12:07,587 --> 01:12:08,922
Now, I've got it!

831
01:12:12,175 --> 01:12:17,138
I'll go to Caribbean Sea for sun bath

832
01:12:18,849 --> 01:12:21,393
I've heard that the girls
there are easily hooked

833
01:12:22,477 --> 01:12:23,895
Do you know where's Caribbean Sea?

834
01:12:24,062 --> 01:12:24,938
I don't know

835
01:12:25,272 --> 01:12:27,774
You're jealous only

836
01:12:30,443 --> 01:12:32,237
I'm not qualified to jealous,

837
01:12:32,571 --> 01:12:33,780
but I can drink...

838
01:12:34,656 --> 01:12:35,866
I know who I am!

839
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,743
Best wishes to you two

840
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:44,040
My regards to you two!

841
01:12:46,126 --> 01:12:49,588
To us? That means we're gays?

842
01:12:56,219 --> 01:12:58,013
I'll take this money
to Uncle Chiu tomorrow

843
01:12:59,139 --> 01:13:01,308
Don't you afraid of Waise Chow?

844
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:05,562
He can do nothing cause Chiu's here

845
01:13:05,729 --> 01:13:06,897
Give me the bonus

846
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:17,657
Take it yourself

847
01:13:20,702 --> 01:13:25,457
Dragon, which is more important?
Money or friend?

848
01:13:25,624 --> 01:13:27,125
Both are important to me

849
01:13:28,418 --> 01:13:29,753
I'll go with you tomorrow

850
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,255
Thanks, this is my family business

851
01:13:33,256 --> 01:13:34,799
Do you treat us as friends?

852
01:13:36,968 --> 01:13:39,679
Ok, let's go together

853
01:13:40,138 --> 01:13:41,139
But now,

854
01:13:41,348 --> 01:13:43,016
let's enjoy ourselves first

855
01:13:43,517 --> 01:13:44,476
Sure!

856
01:13:45,352 --> 01:13:47,854
Let's play the guessing game,
drink a glass of wine if you loss

857
01:13:48,021 --> 01:13:50,524
If I loss, I'll drink double

858
01:13:50,982 --> 01:13:52,025
No. Let's make it equal!

859
01:13:52,192 --> 01:13:54,194
Be fair!

860
01:13:54,528 --> 01:13:55,111
Ready, go!

861
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:59,908
6, 1 0, 8, 6

862
01:14:01,034 --> 01:14:02,160
You loss!

863
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:12,128
Why the glass shakes?

864
01:14:12,337 --> 01:14:13,418
Hold it tight for me please

865
01:14:14,548 --> 01:14:16,633
Ok... Come again!

866
01:14:17,133 --> 01:14:21,680
Six... Six... Ten

867
01:14:22,097 --> 01:14:24,224
You loss again, drink it

868
01:14:24,391 --> 01:14:25,725
Ok, I'll drink it

869
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,408
Again?

870
01:14:43,994 --> 01:14:45,912
Sorry? Buddy, take this first

871
01:14:47,038 --> 01:14:48,456
Later on, I'll pay you the rest

872
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,174
You'd not make him drunk

873
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:58,758
if you treat us friends

874
01:14:59,593 --> 01:15:01,761
Sorry, I didn't mean it

875
01:15:02,429 --> 01:15:03,972
Can you stop going?

876
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,559
Are we better than yesterday we are?

877
01:15:07,976 --> 01:15:10,187
That's why we'd have a better tomorrow

878
01:15:19,321 --> 01:15:20,697
See you

879
01:15:24,284 --> 01:15:27,621
Goodbye

880
01:15:30,207 --> 01:15:30,916
Wake up!

881
01:15:31,082 --> 01:15:31,750
Is it snowing?

882
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:33,001
Wake up! Hey

883
01:15:39,966 --> 01:15:42,761
Uncle Chiu, I've found the money back

884
01:15:43,303 --> 01:15:47,057
I've enough evidence that

885
01:15:47,224 --> 01:15:48,864
Waise is the one
who masterminded the case

886
01:15:51,353 --> 01:15:54,606
Uncle Chiu,
the money is here please judge it

887
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,693
He said that he'd enough evidence,

888
01:15:58,902 --> 01:16:00,278
then judge it

889
01:16:00,862 --> 01:16:02,239
Oh! He can't talk!

890
01:16:03,073 --> 01:16:04,199
He can't judge it!

891
01:16:10,705 --> 01:16:13,333
See, they're fighting!

892
01:16:18,588 --> 01:16:21,007
Let them be! Let's watch

893
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:46,611
Go to hell!

894
01:18:56,454 --> 01:18:58,164
What're you doing?
You'd sneeze to the wall

895
01:18:58,331 --> 01:18:59,457
Sorry

896
01:19:00,834 --> 01:19:02,961
Hurry up, he is coming

897
01:19:08,466 --> 01:19:10,010
David...

898
01:19:11,386 --> 01:19:12,512
Don't move...

899
01:19:15,265 --> 01:19:17,851
Don't come over, or I'll shoot!

900
01:19:18,685 --> 01:19:20,312
I mean it...

901
01:19:30,655 --> 01:19:31,907
Let's go, Mandy

902
01:19:49,966 --> 01:19:52,636
How are you, you should not die

903
01:19:54,596 --> 01:19:56,640
We've agreed to go together,
why you go alone?

904
01:19:56,806 --> 01:19:57,682
You deserve it

905
01:19:57,891 --> 01:19:59,226
Shut up!

906
01:20:00,268 --> 01:20:03,438
I don't want to put you into trouble

907
01:20:03,939 --> 01:20:07,442
You'll be ok, David!

908
01:20:07,567 --> 01:20:10,820
You can't die! You'd pay me the bonus

909
01:20:10,987 --> 01:20:11,988
You cannot die

910
01:20:12,656 --> 01:20:17,327
We're good friends, let's pay it later, ok?

911
01:20:17,536 --> 01:20:18,337
If you don't pay we,

912
01:20:18,495 --> 01:20:19,704
you'd not die!

913
01:20:20,956 --> 01:20:22,290
Mandy

914
01:20:25,961 --> 01:20:28,338
I think we can earn money together!

915
01:20:30,006 --> 01:20:32,676
We will be partners

916
01:20:34,427 --> 01:20:38,890
Our business will be so busy.
We'll work happy together

917
01:20:49,109 --> 01:20:50,569
David!

918
01:21:19,431 --> 01:21:20,056
The goods will be loaded today

919
01:21:20,265 --> 01:21:23,018
in Kong Tai Godown, Yau Tong

920
01:24:57,566 --> 01:24:59,776
Let's leave HK together
with the money ok?

921
01:24:59,943 --> 01:25:02,696
No, we've not committed any crime

922
01:25:02,904 --> 01:25:05,156
If we leave now,
we'll be wanted criminals forever

923
01:25:05,448 --> 01:25:07,367
We can't let Waise Chow go!

924
01:25:08,243 --> 01:25:10,912
Are you crazy? He is powerful here

925
01:25:11,121 --> 01:25:13,915
The police are wanting us,
we can't do anything!

926
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:15,834
You can leave alone

927
01:25:16,209 --> 01:25:17,969
I want to be proved innocent
even I'm killed!

928
01:25:19,921 --> 01:25:20,881
You'll deserve it!

929
01:25:21,256 --> 01:25:22,132
Don't block my way,

930
01:25:22,757 --> 01:25:24,217
I'm not like you!

931
01:25:24,384 --> 01:25:25,093
You've money in mind only!

932
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,470
I don't want to be a chicken!

933
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:28,889
It's none of your business

934
01:25:29,055 --> 01:25:30,223
Stay where you are!

935
01:25:34,102 --> 01:25:37,314
What is this?

936
01:25:37,814 --> 01:25:39,774
If I were a money lover, I'd have left

937
01:25:39,941 --> 01:25:40,817
who will help you?

938
01:25:40,984 --> 01:25:42,110
If I am a chicken,

939
01:25:42,277 --> 01:25:45,030
who's staying here safely? Lawyer Chang!

940
01:25:45,197 --> 01:25:46,448
Hands off me!

941
01:26:22,776 --> 01:26:24,110
Boss...

942
01:31:44,681 --> 01:31:45,932
Tak!

943
01:31:50,312 --> 01:31:52,063
Don't hide up! Get out now!

944
01:31:52,272 --> 01:31:55,692
Or, I'll shoot him! Come out!

945
01:31:56,026 --> 01:31:59,154
Ok, I'll shoot!

946
01:32:01,281 --> 01:32:02,115
Leave me alone!

947
01:32:02,282 --> 01:32:05,327
If I die, kill him for me!

948
01:32:08,788 --> 01:32:10,290
Come out, or I'll shoot more!

949
01:32:12,792 --> 01:32:13,877
You bastard!

950
01:32:14,044 --> 01:32:16,630
I'm here! Come on... Shoot!
