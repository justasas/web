00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,040
♫<i> Yet couldn't find the way to your heart. </i>♫

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,530

<i>Episode 11</i>

20
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

21
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,740
You don't like to make others wait, thus, I don't mind. It's okay.

22
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,760
You still remember grudges.

23
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,800
Okay,what would you like to drink? It's on me.

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,440
Let me do it.

25
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,840
Waitress.

26
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,050
Sir, Miss. What would you like to order?

27
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,240
- Coffee. <br>- Same for me. No cream and sugar.

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,980
Okay, please wait.

29
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,950
You are drinking something so bitter. Are you not in a good mood?

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,050
Forget it. What about the collaboration I discussed with you previously?

31
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:04,060
I'm going to leave Huzhou. My apologies, Miss Lu. I disappointed you again.

32
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,600
It's okay. I have been rejected by you a few times.

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,700
It's not unusual.

34
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,550
Here's your coffee.

35
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,950
Please enjoy.

36
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,420
But are you really happy to leave Huzhou?

37
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,820
It's like taking a step backwards.

38
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,080
Jiang Yu has already bullied you into this state and you still want to swallow it?

39
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,990
This is not the Boss Zhou that I know.

40
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,460
It would be false to say that I'm not unhappy

41
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,390
but I think certain things should be left on its own.

42
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,550
Why?

43
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,360
Because of a woman?

44
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,340
Listen more to the music.

45
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,260
It's not easy to find a day like today to come here and have a quiet time.

46
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,900
I really can't tell if you are just a fool for love.

47
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,000
Sorry, Miss Lu, to have disappointed you again.

48
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,510
But I would still like to advise you to think it over again.

49
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,220
Even if you change the location, is that the life you want?

50
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,860
Thank you for your concern during this period of time.

51
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,940
I have an appointment with a friend later.

52
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,140
I'm leaving first.

53
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,650
He is really a fool.

54
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,050
Love can't be touched.

55
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,340
Only with the hand of Fu money and power

56
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,420
it won't leave then.

57
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Here is your money.

58
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,730
It's no hurry.

59
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,610
Boss, thank you for your money.

60
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,840
Okay.

61
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,510
Boss, here is your money.

62
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,740
Let me check. The amount is right.

63
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,830
Ah Li.

64
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,010
Brother, you are here.

65
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,200
I'm still in the same line. (of work)

66
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,180
- Just blame me. <br>- How could I blame you?

67
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,600
I don't care about which job I take.

68
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,390
- Take this. <br>- Brother, what are you doing?

69
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,250
You have been with me for a long time.

70
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,070
This is what I have.

71
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,840
Sorry.

72
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,830
Brother, take back your money. I won't accept it.

73
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,350
Keep the money.

74
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:22,350
Brother, we grew up together. Without you, I wouldn't have survived.

75
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,210
You are now having a difficult time. How could I use your money?

76
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,250
If you don't accept this money, don't call me your brother again.

77
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,010
-Brother... <br>- Keep it!

78
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,900
Don't worry.

79
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,950
Once I succeed in Tianjin, I will contact you. We will establish Fu Sheng again.

80
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,340
Brother, I will wait for your good news.

81
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,050
Boss Jiang. Are you free this evening?

82
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,050
Tonight my close friend, Miss Cui Quan, is getting married. I would like to attend.

83
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,890
Go then.

84
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,030
Brother. Why don't you know what's in my heart?

85
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,050
What are you thinking about?

86
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,470
Everyone will bring along their partner.

87
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,100
You have many friends. Just choose anyone.

88
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,940
But everyone is taking along a male partner.

89
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,610
Brother. Go with me this evening.

90
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,930
I'm still busy. When will I find time go with you?

91
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,430
Find someone to go with you.

92
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,870
I will just find anyone to go with me this evening.

93
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,580
You are not worried?

94
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,960
With such a temper like yours, it's already good enough that you don't boss anyone around.

95
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,910
Brother. You only just have a sister like me. You are not even going to help me with this?

96
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,350
Okay then. I will find someone else then.

97
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,390
What if someone were to sell me off?

98
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,320
Remember to tell mother not to be sad.

99
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,650
What time is it this evening?

100
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,350
7 pm.

101
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,970
- I get it. <br>- Thanks, Brother.

102
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,930
I'm going home to get ready. I will wait for you at home.

103
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,750
- Hello. <br>-Boss Jiang.

104
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,720
This is Mr Shi from the bank.

105
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,940
What's wrong? What's the matter?

106
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,370
I received news that Wu Cai Hong took a loan from the underground lenders with a high interest.

107
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,120
The money is being used to pay back to the small workshops.

108
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,380
How did that Zhou Shao Tian survive?

109
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,860
He let a woman go and borrow money?

110
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,310
There is no movement from Zhou Shao Tian lately.

111
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,220
- Is your news reliable? <br>- Of course.

112
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,950
She is taking a loan with high interest at this time. What is she going to use to return it?

113
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,270
Does Wu Cai Hong, with her payments, think she is the Robin Hood of the paladin. <i>a knight renowned for heroism</i>

114
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:06,890
It's not that. Those people are capable of burning and killing.

115
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,980
Miss Wu really has the guts.

116
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,650
Okay, wait for my news.

117
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay.

118
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,390
Hello, Mrs Li.

119
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,610
When Miss returns home, tell her that I had some matters to attend to. I will pick her up tonight.

120
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,270
Okay.

121
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,940
<i>What I regretted</i>

122
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,610
<i>is knowing an evil person like you. I don't want to see you again.</i>

123
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,180
<i>Keep your hatred self away from me. </i>

124
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,830
<i>Wu Cai Hong.</i>

125
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,550
What? She ran away?

126
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,370
Don't panic. She won't get far away.

127
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,820
I am not worried. It is not my money that is being floated away.

128
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,540
Let's do this. Send men to the dock and train station.

129
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,280
Also, block off all the exits.

130
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,910
Well I'll find Zhou Shao Tian. He is like a big eyed dragon.

131
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,780
Wait.

132
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,300
It's useless to look for him.

133
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,900
He is Wu Hong Da's good friend. Why would he help you to capture his good friend's daughter?

134
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,930
What should we so then?

135
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,010
Just wait, I have contacted Director Lee.

136
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,120
Boss, your wish is my command.

137
00:10:52,540 --> 00:11:02,540
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

138
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,080
Move aside. Don't let her get away.

139
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,630
Move aside. Continue to search thoroughly.

140
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,940
Quick. Go over there.

141
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,310
Cai Hong. Boss Qian is searching here.

142
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,680
Leave with me now.

143
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,980
Stepmom, let's leave now.

144
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,460
Move aside.

145
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,180
Hide yourselves now. Cai Hong and I will see if we distract them.

146
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,020
Be careful.

147
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,430
- What's going on? <br>-- Move aside.

148
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,860
Run with me.

149
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,740
They are over there. Go after them.

150
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,900
Quick.

151
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,890
Over there! Quick!

152
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,780
They are over there. Move aside.

153
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,470
Move aside. Over there.

154
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,070
Get down. What are you doing?

155
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,510
- Quick. Are you okay? <br>- I'm fine.

156
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,860
Bastards. Go after them now.

157
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,890
Quick. Hurry up.

158
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,830
Don't let them get away.

159
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,530
Over there. Go after them.

160
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:52,190
It's so hot. Cai Yun, let's go home.

161
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,850
The boat is leaving.

162
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,570
Where are the tickets?

163
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,920
I don't have them.

164
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,040
You don't have them. Let 's go back home then.

165
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,810
Mom, be careful.

166
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,060
Go inside here first.

167
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,680
They are over there.

168
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,470
Go after them.

169
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,420
Cai Hong.

170
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,950
They are over there.

171
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,640
Let's go now, Cai Hong.

172
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,430
- Let's go. <br>- Zhou Shao Tian.

173
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,390
Move aside.

174
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,990
They are over there. Zhou Shao Tian!

175
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,060
Quick. Move aside.

176
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,100
Stop there.

177
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,730
Young Master. It's getting dark.

178
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,570
We have already searched the entire Huzhou.

179
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,720
- Why don't we go back? <br>- Continue to search.

180
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,500
Yes.

181
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,830
Stop there.

182
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,970
What are you doing? Why did you push my cart?

183
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,430
Move aside.

184
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,740
Move aside.

185
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,720
Let's go.

186
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,030
Stop them.

187
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,860
Let's go.

188
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,080
The ambience is great. Congratulations.

189
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,660
Congratulations.

190
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,880
Fei Fei.

191
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,990
Fei Fei.

192
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,270
Yan Yan, long time no see.

193
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,280
This is...

194
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,660
My boyfriend, Jia Ming.

195
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,610
Jia Ming. This is our class beauty who I have been telling you. She is Fang Fei Fei.

196
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,540
- Hello. <br>- Hello.

197
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,840
Yan Yan mentions you often. It is nice to meet you today.

198
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,600
Sure enough, it's just as she says. <br>Thank you.

199
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,050
Yan Yan. You haven't seen each other for a long time and must have a lot to talk about. I will wait for you inside.

200
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,780
Okay.

201
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,480
Your boyfriend is not bad.

202
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,350
He's okay. Let's not talk about him. Let me take a look at you.

203
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,790
Fei Fei. You are becoming more beautiful.

204
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,340
How can I be compared to you? You have such a good looking boyfriend. You must be really blessed.

205
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,550
I can't be compared to you. You have a childhood love, Boss Jiang.

206
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,420
He is your senior buddy and husband too.

207
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,490
Don't talk nonsense.

208
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,030
Why don't I see Mr Jiang?

209
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,830
He has some matters to attend to for the time being. He will be here later.

210
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,890
I should be able to be at yours and Mr Jiang's wedding banquet soon.

211
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,550
Don't be happy for me.

212
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,790
Who says so? Frankly speaking, our cohorts are already at a marriageable age.

213
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,060
Today is Sister Cui's day,

214
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:29,690
my wedding is set for the spring of next year. We could celebrate two weddings in the same year!

215
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,030
In this case, you and Mr Jiang's wedding banquet shouldn't be that far ahead.

216
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,500
It's late. I wonder how is my stepmom and sister are doing.

217
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,930
I will arrange for us to find them later.

218
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,380
Let's take a break first.

219
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,300
I am afraid they are behind. I can go on.

220
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,030
Let's take a break.

221
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,250
Cai Hong. I'm useless.

222
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,700
Driving you to desperately flee with me.

223
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,750
Are you afraid?

224
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,390
As long as you are with me, I'm not afraid of anything.

225
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,400
Ma Li told me that in the past,

226
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,520
they lived in the slums

227
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,590
and fought over a hot bun.

228
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,460
I have never imagined that there would be this kind of life.

229
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,440
When my dad was still around, I couldn't even phantom the feeling of starvation.

230
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,910
Not until after my father's death did I understand that reality is harsh.

231
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:55,990
Also experience the pain that brother Shao Tian experienced in the past.

232
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,650
Cai Hong. Everything is in the past now.

233
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,020
Everything will get better.

234
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,170
Let's work hard together.

235
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,100
There is a carriage over there. Let's go.

236
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,350
Wait!

237
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,950
Wait.

238
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,120
Wait!

239
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,480
You don't want your life? What if I had knocked you down?

240
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,250
Please help us.

241
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,490
We have urgent matters and need to leave the city. We would like to hitch a ride from you.

242
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,650
Sir, please help us. We are really in a hurry.

243
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,320
It's not that I don't want to help you. Can't you see that my cart is full?

244
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,680
How could I take in any passengers?

245
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,060
Sir, take this. Please help us.

246
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,570
I can tell.

247
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,480
You two are not guilty of anything? <i>referring to a crime</i>

248
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,130
I am not blinded by the dark.

249
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,660
Is someone out there trying to capture you?

250
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,950
Sir, you see our need. What else can we do?

251
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,930
Good people will have good karma. Please help us.

252
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,770
Yes, please help us.

253
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,590
It is obvious that the two of you eloped.

254
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,320
If I were to give you a ride, they will capture me.

255
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,080
I don't want to involved myself. Chances are not only your family but the police will accuse me of it. (helping them.)

256
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,280
I can only bring one of you. That way when I get stopped, I can justify it.

257
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,140
No. We must both leave together.

258
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,770
Look. My cart is very small.

259
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,280
It doesn't matter which goes...

260
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,030
I can't do too much to help.

261
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,430
Forget it. It's still better that you wait...

262
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,800
Sir. Please take him out of the city.

263
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,270
Please help me.

264
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:50,980
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

265
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,190
Little rascal. You have a good life.

266
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,980
You met such a good lady.

267
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,020
I really envy you.

268
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,990
<i>Brother Shao Tian. When you wake up,</i>

269
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,010
<i>please don't be angry with me.</i>

270
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,920
Cai Hong?

271
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,510
Stop the carriage.

272
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,150
Wu Cai Hong.

273
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,610
Wu Cai Hong.

274
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,040
Wu Cai Hong.

275
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,760
You dare to leave without saying goodbye?

276
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,150
We are not even friends. Why should I tell you when I leave?

277
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,970
You can't leave.

278
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,880
I'm not your slave. You don't have the right to make that request.

279
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,060
Let go.

280
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,810
Jiang Yu, let me down!

281
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,020
Jiang Yu!

282
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,680
Let me down!

283
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,450
What are you doing?

284
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,730
Come here now.

285
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,140
- There is food. <br>- Go ahead.

286
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,320
Come, stop and come over here.

287
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,020
What's your name?

288
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,140
It's late. What are you doing?

289
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,910
Leave.

290
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,140
What exactly is going on? Why are they checking so thoroughly?

291
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,850
Open the cover.

292
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,640
It can't be connected to this little rascal and that lady.

293
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,690
- Slowly. <br>- Open that.

294
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,840
You. Come here. Open this.

295
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,310
Okay, go over there.

296
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,480
Those behind, go first.

297
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,850
Next.

298
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,380
Stop there!

299
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,730
Stop there!

300
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,100
- What's your name? <br>- It's Li Er Gou.

301
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,310
-What is all this? <br> -Miscellaneous things. Mainly groceries from town.

302
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,290
- Where are you taking them? <br> - Out of the city to my village.

303
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,930
Who is he?

304
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,950
He is my nephew.

305
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,040
Nephew?

306
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,900
He is sick.

307
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,100
Why didn't you tell me earlier? Leave now.

308
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,850
Stop the cart.

309
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,230
- Little rascal. <br>- Where is Cai Hong?

310
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,470
Cai Hong.

311
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,270
- You are looking for that lady? <br>- Where is she?

312
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:23,040
The lady gave you one whack and you were on the ground.

313
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,570
I carried you onto the cart. She didn't get onto the cart.

314
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,100
She didn't get on.

315
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,850
She insisted that I bring you out of the city

316
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,900
before I agreed to take you out of the city.

317
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,580
Little rascal. The police are waiting there to capture you.

318
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,880
If you go back now, you will be beaten to death.

319
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,000
Big brother, I can't abandon Cai Hong. I need to find her.

320
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,590
My name is Zhou Shao Tian. I will remember your kindness. I will thank you in the future.

321
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,520
Thanks.

322
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,090
Little rascal, be careful.

323
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,090
This is a passionate and decent kid.

324
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:08,060
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

325
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,520
What are you doing?

326
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,950
Okay, we are leaving.

327
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,020
We are going back then.

328
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,560
Do you want to say farewell to your friend?

329
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,870
Forget it. She doesn't look like she's in a good mood. We might get snubbed.

330
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,200
Let's go.

331
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,420
<i> Thank you. </i>

332
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:10,770
<i>Brother. You promised me that you would come. You clearly did.</i>

333
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,270
<i>How could you not keep your word?</i>

334
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,980
<i>How could you?</i>

335
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,120
It's just a small gesture. It has been hard on you last night.

336
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,070
Since you have already found the person,

337
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,400
I would advise you that you take her home immediately.

338
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,030
Thanks.

339
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,890
I'm not just a policeman. It's such an expensive item. I can't accept it.

340
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,060
Take this back.

341
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,520
I have never taken back my gifts.

342
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,470
If you like it, keep it. If you don't,

343
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,490
just throw it away.

344
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,850
I will help you to give it to someone who needs it.

345
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,860
Do whatever you want.

346
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,310
Sit down.

347
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,100
Where is Cai Hong?

348
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,440
Tell me where Cai Hong is.

349
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,790
If you dare to harm her, I will never let you off.

350
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,970
She is safe with me.

351
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,860
As long as she is not with you, everything will be fine.

352
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,910
Don't be rash.

353
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,820
There are many people out there who want to get you into trouble.

354
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,470
As long as you hand over the money to me,

355
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,010
I can help you to settle this issue.

356
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,810
How can you just stare at money

357
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,330
without it being an ulterior motive?

358
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:17,110
Hand over the money. The most you will get is a few years in jail.

359
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,160
As for the other matters, I won't pursue them.

360
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,610
Once you are out of jail, you can go anywhere.

361
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,980
If you still want to do business, I can give you some money.

362
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,160
Is that so?

363
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,840
But why do I still feel that you think I'm the killer?

364
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,030
They haven't caught the killer of Wu Hong Da.

365
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,130
Although the police have now closed the case,

366
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,940
Wu Cai Hong hasn't given up yet.

367
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,950
There are merchants in Huzhou, for their own interests, also urging the police to catch the murderers.

368
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,530
I think

369
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,990
the murderer must have sleepless nights.

370
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,920
What a pity.

371
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,080
I don't have that money.

372
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,600
Nor did I kill Wu Hong Da. I must have disappointed you.

373
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,540
Tell me. If Wu Cai Hong knows that you have a

374
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,380
unknown origin, she would like you?

375
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,030
I predict that she will hate you for the rest of her life.

376
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,290
Stop this despicable underhanded tactics of yours to split us apart.

377
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,830
Do you think you are that noble?

378
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,880
Say whatever you like. If you have the substance, show me the evidence.

379
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,980
Yes, I have a big sum of money.

380
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,170
Where is the money? Where is the evidence? Do you have them?

381
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,000
Boss Jiang, you have always had to justify it.

382
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,200
Let's wait and see then.

383
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,940
Let's see how long you can hide that money.

384
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,490
Boss Jiang. Boss Jiang. <br>Did you find the rascal?

385
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,170
Not yet.

386
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,090
Don't worry. I'm in this line.

387
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,220
In this world, there isn't anyone who doesn't need my money.

388
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,000
It's not that easy as you think.

389
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,130
We already have him in our hands.

390
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,270
I don't trust that devil anymore.

391
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:51,040
If he refused to admit it, what can you do?

392
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,990
Boss Jiang. What are your plans? I will listen to you.

393
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,970
Zhou Shao Tian. You can leave.

394
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,710
Why?

395
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:37,120
When I say you can leave, just leave. Stop asking irrelevant questions.

396
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,610
Let me tell you. Return the money soon.

397
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,320
Don't think of running away again.

398
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,020
When it comes to money, don't mess with the boss.

399
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,490
He has friends with the mafia. You won't be able to escape from him.

400
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:53,940
A small fry like you, even if Boss Qian kills you, you are just like an ant.

401
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,250
Where is this place?

402
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,610
Why did you bring me here?

403
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,890
I brought you here to meet the Brother Shao Tian that you wanted to meet.

404
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,140
Brother Shao Tian?

405
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,420
What exactly do you want?

406
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,900
To show you that he gave you a magic potion to drink. <br><i>expression - he is lying to you.</i>

407
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,550
If you are angry, just direct it at me.

408
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,150
Don't harm Brother Shao Tian.

409
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,090
Don't worry. I won't harm him.

410
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:05,020
I guarantee that after tonight, you won't want to see him again.

411
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,140
What exactly are you trying to do?

412
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,900
You took Ling Long away.

413
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,480
You bankrupted Fu Sheng.

414
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,950
What else are you going to do?

415
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:19,030
I want you to see clearly which exactly is the evil person instead.

416
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,340
What are you doing?

417
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,490
Let me go. Let me go.

418
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,970
Let me go.

419
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,810
Jiang Yu. What are you doing?

420
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,000
Let me go.

421
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,760
Sorry. You will have to suffer for a while first.

422
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,690
If you want to find out who the real killer is,

423
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,960
be a bit more patient.

424
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,450
You didn't want to pay back the loan and tried to run away?

425
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,690
- I already told you that I don't have the money. <br>- No money?

426
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,060
Zhou Shao Tian. Your really know how to pretend.

427
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,900
No wonder Miss Wu has been tricked by you more than three times.

428
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,210
Who told you this? I have never tricked her.

429
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,430
You didn't?

430
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:17,060
You and Old Cai split half of the money you stole from Ling Long.

431
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:23,530
I loaned you the money then because I knew that you would be able to pay me back.

432
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,980
Did you really think that I believed that you could expand your business?

433
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:33,910
Shao Tian, did you actually kid yourself and believe you could

434
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,490
actually pack up and run away?

435
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:42,290
I already told you that I will think of a solution to pay you back.

436
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,430
Think of a solution?

437
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,090
What solution would you have?

438
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,160
You owe money to many debtors. Will you be able to pay them back?

439
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,150
How much will be left to pay me?

440
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,850
Boss Qian. Don't force me into a corner.

441
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:02,220
Okay, I won't press you. You should also be frank.

442
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,170
The return of the money from Ling Long will be good enough for me.

443
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:10,210
The balance of the money will help you and Miss Wu to start anew.

444
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,940
Let's do this. Pay me back the money and we are even.

445
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,040
I don't have it. I already told you that I didn't.

446
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,590
Zhou Shao Tian, if I don't use force,

447
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,960
do you think I'm that weak?

448
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,680
Let's see if your mouth is stronger than my fist.

449
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,120
Beat him.

450
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,470
Enough.

451
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:42,820
Zhou Shao Tian. I advise you to pay me back soon so that you will suffer less.

452
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,870
I already said that

453
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,030
I really don't have that money.

454
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,430
Fine.

455
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,020
Bring him here.

456
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,290
Let me go.

457
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:01,060
Do you see him? He is just like you. He owes me money and he didn't pay me back.

458
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,670
Come, cut him.

459
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,060
Don't!

460
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,270
Did you see this? You will be next.

461
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:21,950
Don't kid yourself and just give up.

462
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,810
If you don't return the money, I will cut off your ear.

463
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,040
Tell me now. Are you going to pay me back or not.

464
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,500
Are you going to pay me back or not? Speak.

465
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,150
Are you going to pay me back or not?

466
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,120
If you don't return the money, I will cut off your ear.

467
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,080
Are you going to pay me back or not?

468
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,070
I...

469
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,340
Speak now.

470
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,350
You should be happy to talk.

471
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,470
Speak!

472
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,540
Jiang Yu!

473
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,720
You are really despicable!

474
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,100
What is this trick?

475
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,380
Shameless!

476
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,340
Small minded person!

477
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,420
Brother Shao Tian.

478
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,040
- Brother Shao Tian. <br>- Today, I must...

479
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,420
Cai Hong.

480
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,030
-Cai Hong<br>-Cai Hong

481
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:36,090
Cai Hong! I'm taking you to the hospital.

482
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,040
Cai Hong.

483
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,430
Just kill me.

484
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,060
Bring it on!

485
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,860
Are you a man?

486
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,980
My greatest skill is to take away your riches and repossess them.

487
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,370
- Miss. <br>- Why are you back alone?

488
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,100
Where is my brother?

489
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,780
Young Master had some matters to attend to.

490
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,880
What matters?

491
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,630
Tell me quick. What exactly is it?

492
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,800
Where is he?

493
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,480
Young Master is with Wu Cai Hong.

494
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,260
Wu Cai Hong is injured now.

495
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,950
Young Master is with her at the hospital. I'm back here to take some stuff for him.

496
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,130
I get it.

497
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,070
Go and get it.

498
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,110
<i>No. It's Mrs Jiang who is not like the rest.</i>

499
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,650
<i>Mrs. Jiang. Those two words have a nice right to them. </i>

500
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,690
<i>Don't talk nonsense. If brother hear this, I'm in trouble.</i>

501
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,340
<i>Who says I'm talking nonsense? You and Boss Jiang,</i>

502
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,660
<i>No. You and your brother were in fact friends since childhood. </i>

503
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,230
<i>The post of Mrs Jiang is yours forever.</i>

504
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:48,780
<i>That's right. There is no difference whether we call you this now or in the future.</i>

505
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,900
<i>Mrs Jiang.</i>

506
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,600
<i>No one can be compared to you. You have a childhood sweetheart, Boss Jiang, who grew up together with you.</i>

507
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,100
<i>He is senior buddy and also a husband.</i>

508
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,030
<i>We should be able to attend yours and Mr Jiang's wedding banquet soon.</i>

509
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,790
<i>This home is mine.</i>

510
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,920
<i>I will never lose everything.</i>

511
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,650
Doctor. What is her condition?

512
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,870
Her injury is a bit deep but unfortunately, it didn't affect her bones.

513
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,030
She will be fine if she has a proper rest.

514
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,730
If there is anything, just call me.

515
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,520
Thanks.
