The Cage of Love

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,380
<i>Episode 22</i>

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,730
Why isn't Jiang Yu not making any moves?

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,820
Eh?

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,630
Why is he standing there and not making any moves?

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,940
Looks like he will be out soon.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,840
<i>Why isn't he moving? There is not much time left.</i>

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,810
<i>That's right. The incense stick will burn out soon.</i>

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,760
<i>What's going on? What is he doing?</i>

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,730
<i>Why isn't he making any moves?</i>

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,630
<i>He's making us so anxious.</i>

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,100
<i>What is he trying to do?</i>

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,140
Boss Jiang. Is there a problem?

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,670
No.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,670
<i>He seems to be moving. Why is he holding a brush?</i>

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,090
<i>I don't know. Just watch.</i>

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,440
Cai Hong. He is not dyeing the cloth. Why is he drawing?

18
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,300
Brother, what are you drawing?

19
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,850
Look, he's using the brush to dye the cloth.

20
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,720
If God wants to give me money, no one can stop him.

21
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,300
Mom. Why isn't he dyeing the cloth? It's not like he doesn't have the materials.

22
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,250
Let me tell you. It must be that he doesn't know how to dye.

23
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:22,080
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

24
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,650
The Jiang family has been in the dyeing and weaving business for many generations.

25
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,270
Does Jiang Yu know this technique or not?

26
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,780
If he doesn't,

27
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,960
he could have sent his master instead.

28
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,840
It's like a drawing.

29
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,310
Time's up.

30
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,100
Both, please show your skills.

31
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,230
<i>Great!</i>

32
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,390
<i>Rong Da, beautiful!</i>

33
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,370
<i>Great.</i>

34
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,550
<i>Rong Da!</i>

35
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,570
<i>Beautiful! Great!</i>

36
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,550
<i>Rong Da!</i>

37
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,960
<i>Great.</i>

38
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,790
<i>That's great.</i>

39
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,200
<i>Amazing.</i>

40
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,790
<i>Great.</i>

41
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,750
Jiang Yu is really something.

42
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,200
<i>Perhaps, grudges shouldn't end in revenge.</i>

43
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,630
<i>Just like in this dirty pond,</i>

44
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,420
<i>such a clean and pure flower could even grow in it.</i>

45
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,510
<i>Great.</i>

46
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,760
Fortunately, I didn't lose everything.

47
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,830
However, it was very exciting.

48
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,320
Yes.

49
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,790
Governor Liu.

50
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,490
Is this considered a dyed cloth?

51
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,450
In regards to the remark,

52
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:22,400
there are dyes on this cloth. Don't tell me this is not considered dyeing?

53
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,120
Whether it's accepted or not, let's the audience decide.

54
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,770
Everyone, isn't this so?

55
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,320
Okay, let's start the vote now.

56
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,680
Give your lily to the one whom you like his work best.

57
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,190
Let's start with Warlord Lu and President Zhang.

58
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,560
<i>Great.</i>

59
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,730
<i>Come and vote.</i>

60
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,010
<i>Great.</i>

61
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:56,530
<i>Ling Long!</i>

62
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,500
Mr Zhang, please start first.

63
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,540
Okay.

64
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,570
I...

65
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,430
One stalk for Ling Long.

66
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,080
One stalk for Rong Da.

67
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,120
Miss Lu. Why aren't you voting?

68
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,800
For fairness, we can only vote once as contestants.

69
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,570
I will leave my vote to someone else.

70
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,290
<i>Why do you still need to consider? Of course, you should choose Rong Da.</i>

71
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,980
<i>Brother Shao Tian's cloth is indeed beautiful but it's not second to none.</i>

72
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,440
But Boss Jiang's cloth was personally drawn on.

73
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,260
It can be considered as second to none.

74
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,230
Who cares about that? I bet a lot of money on Shao Tian.

75
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,820
I will be stupid if I don't vote for Shao Tian.

76
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,370
Thirty four stalks for Ling Long.

77
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,540
Thirty five stalks for Ling Long.

78
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,380
Sixty one stalks for Ling Long.

79
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:11,810
I think we can't tell who the winner is for this first round.

80
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,500
This is how a contest should be.

81
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,230
This way, it's more interesting.

82
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,650
- Isn't that so?
- Rong Da has one hundred stalks.

83
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,490
No. There will be a clear victor soon.

84
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,050
One hundred and twenty stalks for Rong Da.

85
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,090
One hundred and twenty seven stalks for Rong Da.

86
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,170
Ling Long also has one hundred and twenty seven stalks.

87
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,740
I really didn't imagine the result would be like this.

88
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,590
Both their votes are equal.

89
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,390
Since this is the case, I will now announce that they...

90
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,600
Wait.

91
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,510
I haven't voted yet.

92
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:17,420
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

93
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,940
I remember you said that grudges

94
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,000
shouldn't end in revenge.

95
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,560
And that even in a dirty pond, a clean and pure flower could even grow.

96
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,900
At that time, I really couldn't forget my unhappiness.

97
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,500
But you also told me that

98
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,630
you couldn't forget the grudge about that person who killed your father.

99
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,890
I think

100
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,730
I can't forget it either.

101
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,810
Miss Wu Cai Hong gave the vote to Rong Da.

102
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:28,270
This is the first part of the contest.

103
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:32,760
No one could imagine that this would be the result.

104
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,660
Yet Zhou Shao Tian's cloth

105
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,600
is very deserving.

106
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,550
The winner is Zhou Shao Tian.

107
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,220
The second part of the contest will be the day after tomorrow.

108
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,380
Let our honourable guest announce the winner.

109
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,750
Xiao Man. Your silk contest is rather interesting.

110
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,150
Mr Zhang. After you first.

111
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,330
Warlord Lu, please.

112
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,050
Brother, I am not convinced about the dye.

113
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,370
What was so great about Zhou Shao Tian's cloth?

114
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,880
Leave first.

115
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,470
What's going on?

116
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,360
I couldn't dye it.

117
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,230
Why?

118
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,060
Someone tampered with my cloth. I couldn't dye it.

119
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,830
Why didn't you stop the contest then? Someone is playing around with it.

120
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,010
How am I to stop it? I was the one who personally brought the cloth.

121
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,530
Cai Hong. You did well in the voting.

122
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,340
It's right that you gave it to Shao Tian.

123
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,320
You should thank Cai Hong properly today.

124
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,210
Stop there.

125
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,260
What's wrong? Not happy with losing?

126
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,540
Competing in the silk contest with such despicable people like you

127
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,760
is only bringing us exquisite shame.

128
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,780
If you have the substance, you should compete fairly.

129
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,480
You sabotaged the cloth. Do you call yourself a righteous competitor?

130
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,930
- You...
- By the way,

131
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,290
you are not a righteous competitor at all. You are a bandit.

132
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,680
Who are you calling a bandit?

133
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,740
You should know clearly in your heart what you did.

134
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,060
Fei Fei, let's go.

135
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,930
What are you talking about?

136
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,710
Enough, stepmom. Cai Yun, go back with her. I still have matters to attend to here.

137
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,410
Okay, mom.

138
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,490
Be careful then.

139
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,620
- Mom.
- Let's keep the money.

140
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,500
I would like to check both the clothes.

141
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,050
How could this happen?

142
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,750
Did you sabotage this?

143
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,810
I don't know what's going on.

144
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,250
They were both here when we came in. I didn't do anything to this.

145
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,430
You have mistook me.

146
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,120
There are many things

147
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,940
which doesn't require sabotages.

148
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,460
The motive of this silk contest

149
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,330
is to let Jiang Yu take out his secret formula.

150
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,990
It's not important to sabotage anything.

151
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:05,070
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

152
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,630
Congratulations.

153
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,970
Don't get involved between me and Jiang Yu. I can win fairly,

154
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,580
Isn't it good enough that you win? The method is not that important.

155
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,280
If not, how will we force Jiang Yu to resort to his method?

156
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,730
- I think the last battle...
- I already told you that

157
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,870
I wanted a fair contest with Jiang Yu.

158
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:47,740
If you hadn't gotten involved today, I wouldn't have won that fairly.

159
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,350
If you didn't sabotage it, I wouldn't have any misunderstandings with Cai Hong.

160
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,620
If you get involved again, don't blame me

161
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,410
for voiding our contract.

162
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:04,330
Okay then. I promise you that I won't get involved again.

163
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,190
I will wait for your good news tomorrow.

164
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,310
Wu Cai Hong will die in my hands one day.

165
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,930
Shao Tian, you are becoming more capable.

166
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,040
Winning the silk contest is such beautiful thing.

167
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,550
My deceased husband really didn't misjudge you.

168
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,740
Cai Hong is in there. I will call her for you.

169
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,030
Cai Hong.

170
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,180
Cai Hong.

171
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:06,290
What are you doing? He came here especially to see you and you are leaving? So rude.

172
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,110
Have a good chat between the both of you.

173
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,780
Stay here for dinner. I'm going to the kitchen.

174
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,510
I know that you are angry about the silk contest.

175
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:27,020
Please believe me. I didn't do that.

176
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,200
You didn't do it? It can't be Miss Lu...

177
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,340
It was Miss Lu. She was afraid I couldn't defeat Jiang Yu

178
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,420
and that Rong Da would have to withdraw from Huzhou.

179
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,710
It's because of me again.

180
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,020
I forced Miss Lu to take this step.

181
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:57,310
Who would be willing to withdraw from the dyeing industry from Huzhou?

182
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:02,030
She doesn't has anything to do with me but she helped me.

183
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,030
It's because of you.

184
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,420
Did I give you a lot of trouble?

185
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,450
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have to owe her such a big favour.

186
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:16,730
Don't say this. If it weren't for you,

187
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,090
I couldn't have beaten Jiang Yu. I already told Miss Lu

188
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:26,430
that I could win fairly against Jiang Yu.

189
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,440
Jiang Yu already lost the first part. If he loses the second part,

190
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,140
he will have to withdraw from the dyeing industry.

191
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,820
Thus, he may use the secret formula. As long as he uses it,

192
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,730
we will have the evidence.

193
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,140
I will tell Director Chen and he won't let him get away.

194
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,960
So, the motive of the silk contest is to make Jiang Yu

195
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,410
admit that he killed Old Master Wu to get ahold of the secret formula?

196
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,170
Sit.

197
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,640
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

198
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,340
I was afraid that he would catch wind of this. If Jiang Yu finds out,

199
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,100
he will never take part in the silk contest. Especially,

200
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,640
if he use the secret formula, he will then be admitting that he is the killer.

201
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,690
Brother Shao Tian is right. Director Chen, you must help me.

202
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,770
We have been investigating this case for a long time. I will like to find out the truth too. I will be there to observe on that day.

203
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,670
If Jiang Yu uses the secret formula, it will mean that he is the killer.

204
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,910
I will arrest him.

205
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,510
A few workers resigned this afternoon.

206
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,790
One of them was a skilled master.

207
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,070
They have all gone to Rong Da.

208
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:45,980
Brother, we only lost the first time. What should we do next?

209
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,400
It's my fault. I already said that

210
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,450
I didn't want you to get involved.

211
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:01,000
Yet until the end, I still need you to take the burden with me.

212
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,230
Brother, we are family. We should share the burdens together.

213
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,210
I have watched him working so hard

214
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:16,790
and suffering so much before you could come back to Huzhou to start anew.

215
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,930
I can't just watch and see you lose everything.

216
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,780
Fei Fei, don't worry. We will never lose.

217
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,510
As long as we use the Jiang's family's secret formula,

218
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,090
we will never lose.

219
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,100
Secret formula?

220
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:49,370
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

221
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,210
Father.

222
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,760
Please don't blame me.

223
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,900
<i>- Who are you betting on?
- I'm betting on Rong Da.</i>

224
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,070
<i>Are you sure Zhou Shao Tian will win?</i>

225
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,500
<i>If you want to bet, bet now.</i>

226
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,780
<i>How much do you want to bet?</i>

227
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,250
I bet too little yesterday. Today, I placed a big bet.

228
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,000
Do you think you will win?

229
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,400
Of course.

230
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,530
- How could that be such a good thing?
- That's right. Your winnings will be big.

231
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,070
<i>Bet on this and you will get rich.</i>

232
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,760
Yesterday's contest was really exciting.

233
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,250
I thought it would end in a draw.

234
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,440
I didn't think that ultimately, the winner would be Zhou Shao Tian.

235
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,500
Human affairs are hard to predict.

236
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,280
It's not confirmed yet who will be the final winner today.

237
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
Go now.

238
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,320
You too.

239
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,970
$50? $100?

240
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,220
Let's make it $100.

241
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,100
- Governor.
- Why are you only back now? Did you buy it?

242
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,430
- Yes.
- How big is the bet?
- $100.

243
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,680
Okay, leave.

244
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,000
$100.

245
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,400
I must win back everything what I lost yesterday.

246
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,540
Everyone, the second part of the contest

247
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,080
starts now. Let's invite our four judges.

248
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,930
Everyone, let's welcome them.

249
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,700
First is the Dean He of the Jiangnu School of Dyeing.

250
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,350
He has been in the dyeing industry for over thirty years.

251
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:18,180
Second is Miss Ma Da. She is from a famous dyeing factory in Jiangnan.

252
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,470
Third is the owner of the department store in our Huzhou, Mr Li.

253
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,960
He has been engaged in fabric sourcing for more than two decades.

254
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,410
The fourth is our city's most prestigious teacher in printing transfer.

255
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,040
Master Li, whose works are real masterpieces.

256
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,290
<i>Great.</i>

257
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,290
<i>Not bad.</i>

258
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:45,860
Judges, please take a seat. Next, I would like to introduce

259
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,110
the second theme for this part of the contest.

260
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,640
The second theme is reproductions.

261
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,370
<i>Reproductions?</i>

262
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,250
Before the incense stick burns out...

263
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,170
they must reproduce an exact replica of the original cloth.

264
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,900
They will be judged by our esteemed guests.

265
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,330
Similarly, the one with the most votes will be the winner.

266
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,070
<i>How did you know that it will be reproductions?</i>

267
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,270
<i>I have my own methods,</i>

268
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,590
<i>but I want you to lose to Jiang Yu this time.</i>

269
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:16,340
<i>Why are you using this opportunity to kick out Jiang Yu?</i>

270
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,040
<i>Don't forget what our initial motive is.</i>

271
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,860
<i>What we need is the secret formula. This is just a reproduction.</i>

272
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,160
<i>Jiang Yu will definitely not use the secret formula.</i>

273
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,930
<i>Even if you win, what about the secret formula?</i>

274
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,680
<i>The last two parts will be even tougher.</i>

275
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:39,050
<i>Even if you lose, you won't embarrass yourself. Think about this carefully.</i>

276
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,060
<i>The first part, you sabotaged Jiang Yu.</i>

277
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,420
<i>The second part, you want me to deliberately lose to Jiang Yu.</i>

278
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,940
<i>Why can't Jiang Yu and I have a fair and open competition?</i>

279
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,620
<i> Fairness? You should know better than me that,</i>

280
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,520
<i>In this world, there is no such thing as fairness.</i>

281
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,500
<i>Don't forget our first goal just because you want to prove yourself.</i>

282
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,410
<i>If you win this part, you won't be able to force Jiang Yu to use his secret formula.</i>

283
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:12,250
<i>When that time comes, so what if Jiang Yu leaves the dyeing industry?</i>

284
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,830
<i>Wu Cai Hong won't be able to get the proof that Jiang Yu is the killer.</i>

285
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:21,690
<i>She will probably not forget this for the rest of her life.</i>

286
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,800
Brother Shao Tian.

287
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,400
Brother Shao Tian.

288
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,940
Brother Shao Tian. What are you thinking of?

289
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,930
Nothing.

290
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,710
I don't want you to lose just because of me.

291
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,150
You started picking up the skills when you were very young.

292
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,230
You picked up very good skills during the past ten years.

293
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,830
In this silk contest,

294
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,340
all the seniors in the dyeing industry are watching you.

295
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,770
You have your pride.

296
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,370
If you don't do your best,

297
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:02,120
how would Jiang Yu know that we are his true rivals?

298
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,140
In any case,

299
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,510
I don't want you to lose the contest just because of me.

300
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,310
Thank you.

301
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,960
Let's invite the two contestants on stage now.

302
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,020
<i>Great. Victory to Ling Long!</i>

303
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:35,560
<i>Victory to Hong Da!</i>

304
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,090
This cloth is from the Tang Dynasty.

305
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,970
It requires the use of beeswax as an anti-agent.

306
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,830
Then heating the wax into the pattern on the back will be crucial

307
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,780
to continue printing

308
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,070
on this quality of silk.

309
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,660
As experts in dyeing we have high demands.

310
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,380
Moreover, this is the most famous creation in the Tang Dynasty.

311
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,230
This art was made with superb printing.

312
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,870
It will be difficult to reproduce its charm.

313
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,320
Next, I'm announcing that

314
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,400
the contest will begin.

315
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,590
<i>Victory to Hong Da!</i>

316
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,510
<i>Victory to Hong Da!</i>

317
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:58,340
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

318
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,820
For this part of the contest,

319
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,870
that rascal, Zhou Shao Tian is working very diligently.

320
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,460
Jiang Yu is not slacking either.

321
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,270
Jiang Yu doesn't depend on it.

322
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,990
Is Zhou Shao Tian your man?

323
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,350
Didn't we agree that we would have an open and fair contest?

324
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,510
Time's up. Please display your works.

325
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,100
<i>Excellent!</i>

326
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,710
<i>It's really beautiful. It looks exactly the same.</i>

327
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,070
Rong Da will definitely win this time.

328
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,710
Rong Da's performance is not bad.

329
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,070
Time's up. Why didn't you hang it up yet?

330
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,630
<i>Did you ruin the dye?</i>

331
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,910
<i>Hang it up.</i>

332
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:03,790
That's right. If you can't do it, just admit your defeat now.

333
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,590
- What's the hurry?
- Mom, don't say anything anymore. Sit down now.

334
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,060
<i>It's great!</i>

335
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,680
<i>Ling Long!</i>

336
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,100
<i>Look, it's not bad.</i>

337
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,540
I think Boss Jiang's cloth has surpassed that of the original.

338
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,840
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

339
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,940
Why can't I see it? So what about Jiang Yu?

340
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,860
The cloth may be dyed better but why is it superfluous?

341
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,670
So what if there are extras? Shao Tian is definitely the winner.

342
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,920
<i>- That's right.
- How could you say that?</i>

343
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,540
<i>It's definitely great.</i>

344
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,880
Everyone, please tell us your views about this contest.

345
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,650
Please come up with sound advise.

346
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,470
I will speak first then.

347
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,750
We all saw the rules with the standards.

348
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,700
Based on the rule of the contest, I feel that Mr Zhou's cloth is closest to the original.

349
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,540
I don't care about new trends. Rules are rules.

350
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:40,290
Based on the rule, Mr Zhou's cloth is closer to the original. He should be the winner.

351
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,920
Fine. Well said.

352
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,180
I think Boss Jiang's is more remarkable.

353
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,360
Even though the flower motifs on his cloth

354
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,280
is not close to the original, it's very innovative.

355
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,070
It is fit for our currently developing trends.

356
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,560
People like us in this industry should go for innovations.

357
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,950
Not only does it has a new approach, Boss Jiang's innovation

358
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,060
deserves compliments.

359
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,330
But the big national development should be vigorously promoted.

360
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,710
I support Boss Jiang.

361
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,680
Dean He has already said what's in my heart.

362
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,000
I support Boss Jiang too.

363
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,840
In this case, do we still abide by the rule?

364
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,340
The newly appointed President sent Mr Zhang to purchase the goods.

365
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,890
Looking at how young Mr Zhang is, he is definitely for the new style.

366
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,640
Huzhou needs to show this side.

367
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,090
That's right. Master Lin.

368
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,300
Do you think that Boss Jiang's skill is not up to scratch?

369
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,920
Of course not.

370
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,910
On the contrary, it's excellent.

371
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,270
Since this is the case, Master Lin,

372
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,730
let's be harmonious and have a mutual consent.

373
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:56,270
That's right. Let's be harmonious.

374
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,340
Fine.

375
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,640
Everyone, please continue.

376
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,740
Development and innovation must be awakened together.

377
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:13,240
Isn't that so?

378
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,210
Brother, why did you dye it differently? You clearly could do that.

379
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,790
Regardless of how I dyed it,

380
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,670
I will definitely win this part.

381
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:29,300
How could this be possible? Why are you so sure?

382
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:49,080
After the four judges have done their assessments, their verdict is...

383
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,470
Ling Long dye factory.

384
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:59,230
<i>- Great.
- How could I lose again?</i>

385
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,320
<i>How could you say that? What's going on?</i>

386
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,110
- How could it be this way?
- Mom. keep quiet.

387
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,380
Brother, we won. You are too amazing.

388
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,210
I already said, what benefits did Jiang Yu give you?

389
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,630
Don't leave.

390
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,600
How did this benefit you? I'm not done with you yet.

391
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,470
Explain this clearly to me. I'm so angry.

392
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,160
I lost everything.

393
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,510
Brother Shao Tian.

394
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,650
Brother Shao Tian.

395
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:49,600
In my heart, you won.

396
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,550
This is very subjective.

397
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,370
If everyone goes after the new trends,

398
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:59,180
who will satisfy our clients?

399
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,660
I only care how you feel.

400
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,130
Jiang Yu can see your ability now.

401
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,470
If he wants to beat you, he can only use his secret formula.

402
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,020
He won't be complacent for too long.

403
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:22,280
<i>Wu Mansion </i>

404
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:38,230
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

405
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,590
What's wrong? Are you still frustrated about losing to Jiang Yu?

406
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:57,440
I can tell that Jiang Yu is deliberating testing us today.

407
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,930
His last piece was superfluous. <i>overdone</i>

408
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,420
But it's good too.

409
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,340
Today, other than those older Masters,

410
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,320
I'm close with the rest of them.

411
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,310
Before the contest, I already talked to them.

412
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,360
I told them that this time, I must let Jiang Yu win.

413
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:22,040
But looks like your skills today is not as strong as Jiang Yu's.

414
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,660
Miss Lu.

415
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,060
I know very well what you are up to.

416
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:34,170
If you still want to achieve your goal, keep quiet now.

417
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,860
Okay, I talked too much.

418
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,790
All men need their face and pride.

419
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,770
But don't blame me for telling you this today.

420
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,750
What you lost today is just the contest.

421
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:52,030
You still have the chance to reverse it in three days.

422
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:55,130
But if you had lost a woman today,

423
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,210
the loser will be Rong Da.

424
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,430
I'm afraid it won't be that simple as losing face.

425
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,490
I won't lose face.

426
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:07,290
Don't worry. Because of Cai Hong,

427
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:13,410
I will definitely force Jiang Yu to use his secret formula at the final part of the contest.

428
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,280
Okay, don't forget what you promised me.

429
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,400
Please do your best in three days

430
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,390
to make Jiang Yu hand over the secret formula.

431
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,280
Can't you just do it for me?

432
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,170
I just overheard your conversation with Miss Lu.

433
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,630
Suspend the competition.

434
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:05,450
If Jiang Yu really doesn't have the secret formula and Rong Da loses in the end,

435
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:09,130
I really don't know what I should do.

436
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,530
Cai Hong.

437
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:19,530
Don't you have any confidence in me?

438
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,310
Are you afraid that I will lose to Jiang Yu?

439
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,460
- No.
- Don't tell me to give up then.

440
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,850
I'm not only doing this for you.

441
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:31,700
I want to continue with this contest too.

442
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,980
Okay, go back and rest first.

443
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,540
I still need to prepare for the final part of the contest.

444
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:57,470
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

445
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:10,260
<i>Am I being too selfish and thinking only of myself?</i>

446
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,830
<i>I have never thought of Brother Shao Tian's difficulties.</i>

447
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:25,500
<i>Jiang Yu, are you affected by the impass as well?</i>

448
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,950
<i>I really hope that you don't have the secret formula.</i>

449
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,120
<i>I really hope that this didn't happen.</i>
