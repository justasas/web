<i>Ke Ke, slow down.</i>

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,100
<i>Be careful.</i>

6
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,200
<i>Slow down. Don't trip.</i>

7
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,500
<i>Slow down.</i>

8
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,700
<i>Ke Ke, slow down.</i>

00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,700
<i>Come and have your refreshments.</i>

10
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,400
<i>Slow down.</i>

11
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,800
<i>Mom.</i>

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,300
<i>Mom. Your dress is very pretty.</i>

13
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,100
<i>Your dress is just like the pretty flowers in the garden.</i>

14
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,100
<i>You are just as beautiful as the flowers.</i>

15
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,300
<i>Xiao Man. You are such a good girl.</i>

16
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,200
<i>In my heart, you are the prettiest flower.</i>

17
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,700
<i>You are the flower which I will use my life to protect.</i>

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,600
<i>Wait till I have grown up</i>

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600
<i>and when I look like you,</i>

20
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,800
<i>give this dress to me, okay?</i>

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,600
<i>Fine. Since you like it,</i>

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,400
<i>I will leave the best for you.</i>

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,300
<i>You are the best. I love you the most.</i>

24
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,700
<i>I love you too.</i>

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,100
Mom.

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,200
I know that you are in pain.

27
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,600
Sorry.

28
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,000
I didn't

29
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,680
protect you.

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,000
I couldn't even tailor

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,200
your favourite dress.

32
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,300
But don't worry,

33
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,800
now that I have the secret formula,

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,900
I can tailor the same dress for you now.

35
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,400
I will be able to do it soon.

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,000
Miss.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,800
Miss. Mr Zhou is here.

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,000
Please invite him to the guest lounge.

39
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,800
Mr Zhou.

40
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,400
I waited for you for a long time. You are finally here.

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,500
I'm afraid that you were not waiting for me.

42
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,000
You are waiting for this secret formula.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,100
Isn't it the same whether I'm waiting for you or the secret formula?

44
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,300
To add further, I'm not the only one who obtained the secret formula.

45
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,700
It's our combined efforts.

46
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,800
You are giving me the secret formula easily.

47
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,500
Shouldn't I be suspicious that you have tampered with it?

48
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,800
It's only just a secret formula.

49
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,660
Even though it will bring lots of money, to me,

50
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,800
it's not worth betraying you for this.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,200
I have already helped Cai Hong find the killer.

52
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
As for you, you have gotten the secret formula.

53
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,570
Thus, there is already no value to it.

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,800
To add further, whether it's genuine or fake,

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,400
try it and you will know.

56
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,100
Yes. Under the eyes of ordinary people like us,

57
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,100
the secret formula is precious.

58
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,200
But in your heart,

59
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,400
Miss Cai is still more valuable.

60
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,200
Of course, you look down on people like us.

61
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,500
You don't need to praise me.

62
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,800
You have already gotten the secret formula.

63
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,600
Jiang Yu was arrested.

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,400
We are considered even.

65
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,800
Fine.

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Congratulations. You eventually got your wish.

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,600
Jiang Yu will be executed.

68
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,390
He is not set to be executed yet.

69
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,800
He is like Sharenchangming, right and proper.
<i>He is a tricky/cruel.</i>

70
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,100
Jiang Yu is too sly and he thinks that the police are too stupid.

71
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,000
Thus, I only borrowed your hands

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,300
to push him.

73
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,200
Fine then. Let's not talk about this now.

74
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,700
Let's try the secret formula and see if it's genuine.

75
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,300
If it's genuine, what do you plan to do?

76
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,000
I used a lot of effort to obtain this secret formula.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,200
Of course, I can't let it go to waste.

78
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,800
I am ready for mass production.

79
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,200
After going through this silk contest, I believe that

80
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,000
we could use this recipe to expand.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,600
I want Rong Da to become the nation's biggest dyeing factory.

82
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,300
Miss Lu, you have great ambition.

83
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,400
I still need your help.

84
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Let's go.

85
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,700
Miss Wu.

86
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,200
I... would like to visit Jiang Yu.

87
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,000
Please let me go in.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Of course Miss Wu. Please feel at ease here.

89
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,200
Open the door.

90
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,800
Thank you.

91
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,200
Detention room.

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

93
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,000
During the silk contest,

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
you used the secret formula.

95
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,200
This is a fact

96
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,400
but I still don't believe that

97
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,800
you killed my father.

98
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,900
Jiang Yu. I want to personally hear this from you.

99
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,000
You already obtained so much evidence.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,900
Why don't you still believe that I killed your father?

101
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,100
I remember you said that

102
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,600
if you use evil methods to take revenge on evil people,

103
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,800
you will become like them.

104
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,200
You also said that in a dirty pond,

105
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,100
even clean and pure flowers will grow in it.

106
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,600
For the sake of revenge,

107
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,000
you turn yourself into a killer.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,800
If you let yourself get to that state,

109
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,200
you will allow your family to be in pain too.

110
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,800
This is the most stupid method that only causes suffering.

111
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,400
Thus, you would never do this.

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,800
You are full of life. (resuscitation)

113
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,600
How could you still laugh?

114
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,000
- Did you harm my father or not?
- I didn't.

115
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,500
I didn't kill your father.

116
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,000
Even though I hated him, I didn't kill him.

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,600
Is there anything else?

118
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,800
If there isn't anything else, go back now.

119
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,100
I... would like to ask you...

120
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,000
My stepmom remembered that

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,200
when my father passed away,

122
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,800
he took the secret formula with him before he left the house.

123
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,000
But after the incident, the secret formula went missing.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,800
How are do you explain why the secret formula is with you?

125
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,600
The secret formula that I had

126
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
was not your father's secret formula.

127
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,600
There are two sets of the same secret formulas.

128
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
What's going on?

129
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,800
That secret formula belongs to the Jiang family.

130
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,640
It was a family heritage

131
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,200
from generations to generations.

132
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,800
Thus, when I was young, I already memorised it

133
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,600
but I didn't know about the last step.

134
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,000
It's because the last step would have to wait for the successor to be eighteen years old

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
before it can be passed down to him.

136
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,200
But when my father passed away,

137
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,600
I wasn't eighteen years old then.

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,600
Sorry.

139
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,800
Even though it's too late

140
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,200
but on behalf of my father,

141
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,100
I would like to apologise to you.

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,200
The portion that Fei Fei gave to Zhou Shao Tian

143
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,400
was not the secret formula that was passed down to the Jiang family.

144
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,000
Furthermore, the one which I wrote on it later,

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,300
it lacked the last step for the secret formula.

146
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,200
So to say,

147
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,400
you didn't know the last step of the secret formula at all?

148
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,600
That's right.

149
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
Then, at the silk contest,

150
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,600
how did you use the missing last step of the secret formula to dye the cloth?

151
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,800
The last step involves

152
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,700
a method of straining.

153
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,000
Just add some water to my cloth and it will discolour.

154
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,700
Really?

155
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,000
If what you are saying is true,

156
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,160
will this prove that you are not guilty?

157
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Try it and you will know.

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,800


159
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,800
- Ma Li.
- Miss Wu.

160
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,000
Why are you in such a rush? Are you looking for Brother Shao Tian?

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,600
- He is not here.
- I would like to ask you.

162
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,700
Do you still remember the two clothes from the silk contest?

163
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,200
Did you keep them?

164
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,300
Brother Shao Tian told me to keep them. They are in the drawer.

165
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,700
I would like to borrow them for a while. Can you get them for me?

166
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay, please wait.

167
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,800
Is this the one?

168
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,300
Miss!

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,800
It's really very beautiful.

170
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
It's gorgeous.

171
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,200
The dye is really magical.

172
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,100
Enough. Stop looking, go back to work.

173
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,400
Let's go.

174
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,200
Hurry up.

175
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,400
It's exactly the same.

176
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,600
It's really exactly the same.

177
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,400
Thank goodness.

178
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,200
My wish has finally come true.

179
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,000
Miss Lu, the cloth is not dry yet.

180
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,000
Just now, you said that you are familiar with this silk.

181
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,900
You even said that it's exactly the same.

182
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,500
I remember

183
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,600
I was not born as nothing. <i>idiom</i>

184
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,000
In the past, I could have been considered a rich person.

185
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,400
I would feel forced to show of all my nice things.

186
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,400
I finally understand now.

187
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,400
When I helped Cai Hong to buy her family mansion,

188
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,500
you were very supportive of it.

189
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,600
This piece of silk, to you, is just like what the Wu mansion meant to Cai Hong.

190
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,880
They hold your beautiful memories in them.

191
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,200
I just remembered

192
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,200
it was also the most tender moment.

193
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,300
I can now understand why you desired the secret formula.

194
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,400
Sometimes, I really envy Cai Hong.

195
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,800
Because of her, you don't hesitate in the price

196
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,200
to help her keep her memories.

197
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,200
There is also this tender moment.

198
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,700
But I...

199
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,600
only feel pain now

200
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,020
and to want to snatch it.

201
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,700
Don't you already have it?

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,700
Zhou Shao Tian.

203
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,500
I have something to ask you.

204
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,900
Can you answer me truthfully?

205
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Speak.

206
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,400
Where am I lacking compared to Wu Cai Hong?

207
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,600
Why can't I meet a man

208
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,500
like you?

209
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,400
Someone who is willing to risk his life for my tender memories.

210
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,700
Don't you have the Military Governor?

211
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,500
In this rotten man's eyes,

212
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,400
I'm not a human being.

213
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,800
I'm just a part of his many women.

214
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,400
Someone to get rid of with as I age.

215
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,600
I wonder how I got through all these years.

216
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,200
In the past,

217
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,400
I was also from a noble family.

218
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,600
You could even say that I held a higher status than Wu Cai Hong.

219
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,400
But I had no choice.

220
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,500
I was forced.

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
When my parents died,

222
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I could only depend on myself

223
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,200
to slowly

224
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,100
become like who I am today.

225
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,200
Don't say that.

226
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,000
You also used your own capability

227
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,800
to get what you want?

228
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,200
Isn't that so?

229
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,900
Yes.

230
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,400
I have already gotten what I wanted.

231
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,600
I don't care about the others.

232
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,200
Mr Zhou.

233
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,400
Now that I have gotten the secret formula,

234
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,700
congratulations. You should congratulate me too.

235
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,200
Jiang Yu, that rascal, is very sly

236
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,700
but he can't escape this time.

237
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,700
What a beautiful piece of cloth.

238
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Mr Zhou.

239
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,400
Let's try it one more time.

240
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,900
If there is no problem, let's start production in the factory.

241
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:36,910
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

242
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,800
Jiang Yu didn't lie to me. What he said was true.

243
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,700
What should we do in the future?

244
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,800
We need to feed our families. I have children and elders to take care of.

245
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Where do you plan to go? I will go with you.

246
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,800
Miss Fang is here.

247
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,400
Miss Fang is here.

248
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Miss Fang.

249
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,600
Miss Fang. What should we do? We need to survive.

250
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,500
There is something we need to tell you. We are preparing to resign.

251
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,300
- Resign?
- Yes.

252
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,200
You are doing fine. Why are you resigning?

253
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
We heard Mr. Jiang got pulled into a lawsuit.

254
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,200
This is not a small matter.

255
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,600
How long can I last here? Ling Long will fold soon.

256
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
That's right.

257
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,100
Miss Fang. We are commoners.

258
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,400
We need to take care of our children and elders.

259
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,000
We can only back out.

260
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Miss Fang, please don't blame us.

261
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,600
My apologies. Let's go.

262
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,000
Wait. Don't leave first.

263
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,600
Listen to me first.

264
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,000
My brother was framed. He didn't kill anyone.

265
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,600
He will be cleared and back soon.

266
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,400
Miss Fang, Mr Jiang has treated us very well.

267
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,600
We know that he is a good person

268
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,200
but being locked up by the law is not a game.

269
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,000
We already heard that many clients want to cancel their orders.

270
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
If no one works with us, we will lose our business.

271
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,300
What the point of us staying here?

272
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,840
That's right, Miss Fang.

273
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,400
We are saying our goodbyes to you based on our good relationship.

274
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Please take care of yourself.

275
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,800
Everyone, listen to me. Don't leave.

276
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,200
Wait. Listen to me. My brother was framed.

277
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
He really didn't kill anyone.

278
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,600
Listen to me. Don't leave.

279
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,000
Don't leave.

280
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,100
My brother was framed. He didn't kill anyone.

281
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,700
Come back.

282
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,200
My brother didn't kill anyone.

283
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,800
What should I do?

284
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,700
<i>Brother, it's all my fault.</i>

285
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,000
<i>I harmed you and Ling Long.</i>

286
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,200
<i>What should I do now</i>

287
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,900
<i>to protect the Ling Long that you worked so hard to reclaim?</i>

288
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,600
- Brother Shao Tian.
- What's wrong?

289
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,800
Brother Shao Tian. Jiang Yu is not my father's killer. He didn't kill my father.

290
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,200
Cai Hong, don't be anxious. Take your time to tell me.

291
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,600
Let me prove it to you.

292
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,100
What are you doing? What is she doing?

293
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,000
What's wrong?

294
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,700
- Is she crazy?
- That's right. What is Miss Wu doing?

295
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,000
Cai Hong. What are you trying to do?

296
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,200
I only want to prove to you...

297
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,600
What's going on?

298
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,500
What is this for?

299
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,600
I don't know what is going on.

300
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Why is the colour running? What's going on?

301
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,000
The colour in our cloths have never run.

302
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,800
Jiang Yi used his memories to write down the formula

303
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
but he didn't have the last step.

304
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,800
With Jiang Yi's final step,

305
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,400
the colour ran

306
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,800
because he didn't know the last step.

307
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,800
The complete secret formula is with my father.

308
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,200
So to say, Jiang Yu didn't get this secret formula.

309
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,600
He didn't kill my father either.

310
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,100
Fang Fei Fei gave me this secret formula

311
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,870
which was written by Jiang Yu himself?

312
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,800
- Yes.

313
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,400
Miss.

314
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,800
Jiang Yu said that he memorised the secret formula when he was young.

315
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,900
It's just that the last step was recorded in the last formula.

316
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,400
It will only to be passed down to him when he turned eighteen years old.

317
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,200
- The secret formula is missing one last step.
- Jiang Yu really doesn't have the secret formula?

318
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Jiang Yu didn't have the secret formula in the first place.

319
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,400
Where is the secret formula?

320
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,600
Brother Shao Tian. Let's find Director Chen

321
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,400
and tell him that Jiang Yu is innocent.

322
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,600
Cai Hong. Let the police investigate this first.

323
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,400
If Jiang Yu is really innocent, they will release him.

324
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,200
We don't need them to investigate. Since we already know the truth,

325
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,800
we just need to explain to them and let them release him first.

326
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,700
- But it's a bit complicated now. We don't know anything yet...
- I don't have time.

327
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,800
I'm going to save him.

328
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,400
Cai Hong!

329
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Zhou Shao Tian!

330
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,200
We have more important task to do.

331
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,800
What do you think of this incident today?

332
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,000
Does Jiang Yu really not have the secret formula

333
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,080
or did he give us a fake secret formula?

334
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,700
What happened today was an accident.

335
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,200
Jiang Yu is very sly.

336
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,000
Let's not talk about this first.

337
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,400
The guard at Jiang Yu's cell is my informant.

338
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,500
He overheard Jiang Yu's conversation with Wu Cai Hong.

339
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,200
Jiang Yu merely told her that he didn't have the secret formula.

340
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,600
Cai Hong still went to see Jiang Yu.

341
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,100
Can't you set aside your feelings for that woman first?

342
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,800
Is this important now?

343
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,600
What's important to me now is to know whether Jiang Yu is telling the truth.

344
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,600
And whether he is holding the secret formula?

345
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,100
Wait a minute.

346
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,600
I'm looking for Director Chen.

347
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Director Chen has gone out. He probably won't be back today.

348
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,000
But I need to see him for something very urgent.

349
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,600
Just wait and tell him tomorrow.

350
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,400
Jiang Yu has been framed. Could you release him?

351
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,800
Whether Jiang Yu has been framed or not, we will investigate it ourselves.

352
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,800
If everyone is like you came here to handle the case,

353
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,200
what would you need the police for?

354
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,900
But I'm telling the truth. He didn't kill my father.

355
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,600
Please release him.

356
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,400
Why are you creating a fuss here. This is the police station.

357
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,800
Go home now. If he is not guilty, we will definitely release him.

358
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,400
He was really framed.

359
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,200
Leave.

360
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
This is Miss Lu's instructions

361
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,300
but you must keep watch of security and don't make any mistakes.

362
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Did you hear me?

363
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay. Please tell Miss Lu not to worry. We will do as we are told.

364
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,700
Let's go.

365
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,900
What are you doing?

366
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,800
Are you really going to punish me?

367
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,800
Let me tell you.

368
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,200
Whatever we ask you now, you better tell us the truth

369
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,400
-otherwise you will feel the pain on your flesh.
-I do not know who gave you the right to hurt me,

370
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,800
Who put you up to this? Who wants to harm me?

371
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,400
It's useless for you to call for help now.

372
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,000
If you don't want to suffer, answer whatever we ask you.

373
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,500
Perhaps, we may even spare your life.

374
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,200
I already told you many times that I didn't kill Wu Hong Da.

375
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,200
We don't care about who killed Wu Hong Da.

376
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,800
We only want to find out where Wu Hong Da's secret formula is.

377
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,900
I don't know. I didn't take the secret formula.

378
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,500
It seems you are trying to play tough guy.

379
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,800
Speak!

380
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,800
Speak!

381
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,200
Where is the secret formula?

382
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Aren't you going to talk or not? If you don't, I will beat you to death.

383
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Let's see who will last longer.

384
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,400
Talk!

385
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,800
Father, I have wronged the Jiang family.

386
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,200
I have wronged you and mother.

387
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,200
You raised and treated me like your own daughter.

388
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,700
I caused brother to be jailed now.

389
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,300
I caused Ling Long to go bankrupt.

390
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,200
Brother said that he didn't blame me

391
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,800
but the more he tells me this,

392
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,900
I find it harder to accept in my heart.

393
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,400
Mom still doesn't know anything about this.

394
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,600
Someone needs to take care of the family

395
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,200
but

396
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,900
I don't know how to face this.

397
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,300
Father, tell me.

398
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,600
What should I do?

399
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,400
I'm giving you water to let you come to your senses

400
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,800
to think carefully over where you keep the secret formula.

401
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,600
Do you know who I am?

402
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,300
If you have the guts,

403
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,600
just beat me to death.

404
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,200
Only you and us know about this incident tonight.

405
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,600
If you die, we will just report tomorrow that you committed suicide.

406
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,800
You better think about yourself and don't worry about us.

407
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,600
Mr Jiang.

408
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,200
Heroes don't feel immediate loss. We don't want to kill you.

409
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,700
We only want the secret formula. I'm going to ask you one more time.

410
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Where is the secret formula?

411
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,500
Since you are using so much energy to find out where the secret formula is,

412
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,900
you must definitely know about the grudges between the Wu and Jiang families.

413
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,100
Let me tell you this now.

414
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,200
When Wu Hong Da died that day, other than me,

415
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,600
Zhao Shao Tian and Old Cai met him too.

416
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,800
Thus, if the secret formula is not with me,

417
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,600
it's possible that it could be with Zhou Shao Tian or Old Cai.

418
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,200
Did you hear what he said?

419
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,700
You aren't looking in the right spot.

420
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
If there was really a secret formula,

421
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,000
why would I keep it secret? Jiang Yu is scheduled to be executed.

422
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,400
If this is the case, wouldn't I be a fool?

423
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,900
Since we do not know it, how can we judge?

424
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,200
I think I heard him say they were going to beat him with a bar.

425
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,700
He is only simply just saying it.

426
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,200
Fine, let's just watch.

427
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,800
Mr Jiang.

428
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,600
If you don't tell the truth, you will really lose your life.

429
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,400
The secret formula is really not with me.

430
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,800
It's useless even if you beat me to death.

431
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,000
Father.

432
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,100
I just realised that Jiang Yu is not the killer.

433
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,100
This is considered good news too. Right?

434
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,100
In any case, the grudges between our families can be resolved.

435
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,000
I have decided to find Director Chen tomorrow

436
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,800
to release Jiang Yu as soon as possible.

437
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,100
Our Wu family already owe the Jiang family a lot.

438
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,000
I misjudged them unjustly.

439
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,200
But father, don't worry.

440
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,090
I will definitely

441
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,000
find the person who harmed you as soon as possible.

442
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,700
You must help me.

443
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:58,100
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

444
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Miss Lu.

445
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,100
What are you waiting for? Do it!

446
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,000
Wait.

447
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's getting late. We should pack up now.

448
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,200
Jiang Yu has already been beaten into this state.

449
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,400
If he really has the secret formula, he would have spilled it out earlier.

450
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,800
If you continue to beat him, he will really lose his life.

451
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,500
What you want is the secret formula, not to kill him.

452
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,600
Miss Lu. You must not beat him to death.

453
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,200
Mr Jiang is also an influential person in the community.

454
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:50,400
Moreover, he has a very good relationship with Police Chief Ting.

455
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,000
Let him go or things will end badly.

456
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,400
Huzhou has already lost Wu Hong Da.

457
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,830
If Jiang Yu died without any known reasons,

458
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,400
I'm afraid the entire community won't be able to let it go.

459
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,500
Jiang Yu has been beaten into this condition and he's still not talking.

460
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,400
Could it be that the secret formula is really not with him?

461
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,600
I was skeptical before

462
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,560
but now I believe Jiang Yu.

463
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,600
Don't tell me that Jiang Yu really didn't kill Wu Hong Da?

464
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,100
But what we can be sure of is that the secret formula was with Wu Hong Da on the day of the incident.

465
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,000
He was definitely upstairs when he fell.

466
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,400
The secret formula must have been with him.

467
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,200
But it went missing.

468
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,100
Don't tell me that Jiang Yu didn't do it.

469
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,400
The day that Wu Hong Da died, he only saw three people.

470
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,900
Jiang Yu, Old Cai

471
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,200
and you.

472
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,600
I really didn't take the secret formula.

473
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,400
Looking at the other options, there is only one possibility.

474
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,700
The secret formula is with Old Cai.

475
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,900
I'm asking you now. Where is Old Cai?

476
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,500
How would I know where he is?

477
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,100
I say, Shao Tian. Stop pretending.

478
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,400
You and Old Cai first stole the money from Ling Long.

479
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,600
I helped you to launder the money.

480
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,000
You trick others but not me.

481
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,800
Since you have hidden Old Cai that well,

482
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,800
even Director Chen and Jiang Yu can't find him.

483
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,400
But if I want to call Old Cai out,

484
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,000
you only just need to tell me.

485
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,100
That won't work. Old Cai won't show up.

486
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,800
You don't want to find Old Cai?

487
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,100
But if you don't hand over Old Cai,

488
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,700
I may tell Wu Cai Hong that

489
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,600
you are the real owner of Rong Da.

490
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,400
The money that you used to established Rong Da was from Long Ling.

491
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,500
Are you threatening me?

492
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,600
When we first started to be friends, you should have already known that

493
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,700
a day like this would definitely come.

494
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,500
Thus, I will advise you to be smart.

495
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,180
You should also know that

496
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,600
I only care about the secret formula and not about Old Cai.

497
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,000
As long as you are willing to help me, Old Cai's recipe can be yours too.

498
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
We both get what we need,

499
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,700
I can give you a deadline.

500
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,900
Go in.

501
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,700
You asked for it.

502
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,600
Stop. What are you doing?

503
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,200
I'm here to see Jiang Yu. Please let me go in.

504
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,400
Who are you? Jiang Yu is our criminal. He is guilty of murder.

505
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,200
You can't just see him whenever you want.

506
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,300
But I went in yesterday.

507
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,400
That was because it was yesterday. You could enter because I wasn't on duty.

508
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,000
Let me tell you, I'm fair and transparent.

509
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,800
Jiang Yu is not a killer.

510
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,300
He was framed.

511
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,600
Nine out of ten people here were framed,

512
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,000
but the truth is that no one was framed.

513
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,400
Don't waste your time talking to me.

514
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,600
Mr Policeman. Will this do?

515
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,600
Please let me go in for a while.

516
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,000
If you had the money, just give it to me. Why waste my time?

517
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,400
Go in.

518
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,500
Jiang Yu! What's wrong with you?

519
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,400
What's wrong?

520
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,800
Don't you have any laws here? How could you beat him into this state?

521
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,000
Jiang Yu, wake up.

522
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,200
How could he have been injured like this? I'm going to report to my superior.

523
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,800
Go now!

524
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Jiang Yu.

525
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,000
How could you be beaten into this state?

526
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,500
It's my fault. I should have saved you yesterday.

527
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,400
I clearly knew that you were framed.

528
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,100
Jiang Yu. How do you feel now?

529
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,900
- I'm fine.
- You are still saying that you are fine?

530
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,600
You have been beaten up until you became in this condition

531
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,200
Why did the police beat you up?

532
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,000
- It wasn't them.
- Who then?

533
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,600
It's those people who wanted the secret formula.

534
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Brother Shao Tian?

535
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,200
Don't move. Jiang Yu.

536
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,400
Jiang Yu. What you told me yesterday,

537
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,200
I already did the test. You didn't lie to me.

538
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,600
I will definitely find a way to get you out of here.

539
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,900
I'm going to find Superintendent Li. Wait for me.

540
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,400
Okay, get this done.

541
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,200
Superintendent Li. Please save Jiang Yu.

542
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,100
Miss Wu.What's wrong with Jiang Yu?

543
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,000
Jiang Yu was tortured last night.

544
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,400
He has injuries all over his body now. Please save him.

545
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,400
What? I only locked Jiang Yu in the detention cell.

546
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,800
Who had the guts to torture him in my station?

547
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,200
Jiang Yu was framed. He really didn't have the secret formula.

548
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
He didn't use it at the silk contest.

549
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,600
Those people who tortured him wanted to force him to hand over the secret formula.

550
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,500
Enough, Miss Wu. Let's go to the detention cell to save him now. You can tell me about the rest on the way there.

551
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,800
Let's go.

552
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,400
- Police Chief.
- Chen Zhi Jie.

553
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,500
What's going on?

554
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,300
It was under my management. The guards on duty for last night went missing

555
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,200
but I will definitely catch them and bring them back.

556
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,260
Enough. Send men to protect Jiang Yu now.

557
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:42,200
Report to me later about the incident today.

558
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,600
Both of you, keep guard here.

559
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Director Chen.

560
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,200
- Director Chen.
- Miss Fang.

561
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
How is my brother?

562
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,400
Miss Fang. Don't panic.

563
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Your brother's life is not in danger. The doctor is administrating medicine now.

564
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,000
Thank you.

565
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,820
Wu Cai Hong.

566
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,400
What wrong did the Jiang family do to you?

567
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,800
Why must you keep harming us?

568
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,400
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

569
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,060
Sorry.

570
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,000
What's the use of apologising?
