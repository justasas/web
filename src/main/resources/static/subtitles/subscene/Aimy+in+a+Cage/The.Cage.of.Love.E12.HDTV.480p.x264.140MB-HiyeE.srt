The Cage of Love

00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,900
<i>Episode 12</i>

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,750
- Does it still hurt?
- Don't come over.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,540
What did you do to Brother Shao Tian?

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,020
What did you do to him?

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,030
Don't worry. He's not dead yet.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,410
You are a killer and a monster.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,180
I don't believe what you said. I'm going to find Brother Shao Tian.

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,040
Without my consent, you are not going anywhere.

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,810
Why should I listen to you?

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,830
Why must I get your consent?

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,050
If you don't want your Brother Shao Tian to die a quick death,

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,790
you better keep quiet.

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,790
Let me go in.

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,920
Let me go. Let me go in.

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,060
Jiang Yu!

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,090
Why are you not letting me in?

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,650
Jiang Yu.

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,720
I want to see Cai Hong. Let me go.

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,940
- Stop.
- Why are you not letting me in?

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,210
Stop. What are you doing?

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,770
What right do you have to imprison Cai Hong. You are breaking the law.

23
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,100
You dare to talk to me about laws?

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,670
You keep up with them through your own methods.

25
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,810
What do you mean?

26
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,880
Still pretending?

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,920
Money, to you, is more important than life.

28
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,170
You are personally saying that I stole Ling Ling's money.

29
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,610
Where is the evidence?

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,180
I hold to it <i>follow the law</i> but

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,470
you just want to hide

32
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,310
Isn't that so?

33
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,180
Cut the crap.

34
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,790
Let's see how far he can get away.

35
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,590
Let's go.

36
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,480
Cai Hong. Have a good recovery. I will think of a way to visit you.

37
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,380
<i>Jiang Yu, will never let this go. </i>

38
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,750
<i>Brother Shao Tian.</i>

39
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,020
<i>I will wait for you.</i>

40
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,940
Da Chuen.

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,770
Mr Jiang. Why did you come?

42
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,950
I came to take a look.

43
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,520
Da Chuen.

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,390
Did Shao Tian notice any loopholes yesterday?

45
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,910
He definitely didn't.

46
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,060
Is there really anyone in this world who values money more than life?

47
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,750
This is impossible.

48
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:31,320
If one has no money but is still alive, he can still work. But if one is not alive...

49
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,870
what's the use of having money?

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,480
Sorry, Mr Jiang. I'm an unrefined person. I talk without thinking.

51
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,750
Please forgive me.

52
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:51,300
You are right. Zhou Shao Tian was definitely acting that day. Where did we go wrong?

53
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,130
Mr Jiang. What are you looking for? Let me help you to find it.

54
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,550
No need. I will do it on my own.

55
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,480
Okay.

56
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,970
<i>Put it on for me.</i>

57
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,580
<i>You agreed?</i>

58
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,310
Miss Wu. Does your wound still hurt?

59
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,790
No, thank you.

60
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,430
It's time for your medicines. This is for the fever and pain.

61
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,750
I have almost recovered. Can I be discharged?

62
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,940
You can't. Mr Jiang has instructed that you should stay here until you are fully recovered.

63
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,230
Nurse. I took a loan with high interest. They won't let me off.

64
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,130
I'm afraid that they will find my home. They will use cruel tactics. They will definitely not let my family off.

65
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,890
Please help me to check if I can go home.

66
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,370
Miss Wu. It's not that I don't want to help you. It's that you can't leave the hospital in your condition.

67
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,930
Our hospital is responsible for our patients.

68
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,900
Here, take your medicine first.

69
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,410
Miss Wu. This is the way. As long as you take your medicine regularly, you will recover faster from your wound.

70
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,310
Thank you, Nurse. I'm tired and would like to sleep.

71
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,230
Come. Let me help you.

72
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,350
Slowly.

73
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,910
Thanks.

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:32,850
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

75
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,770
What are you doing here again? Looking for a beating?

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,110
Does this hospital belong to you?

77
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,960
Does this bench belong to you?

78
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,150
Can't I even take a seat?

79
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,600
What's wrong?

80
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,860
Young Master.

81
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,350
What are you up to?

82
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,950
I'm taking a seat. So what?

83
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,880
If Wu Cai Hong were to find out your true colour, what do you think she will do?

84
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,660
I was even almost tricked by you.

85
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,940
You are being too serious over a small bracelet.

86
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:36,450
Jiang Yu, with your crafty ways and the backing of the banks, try to catch me.

87
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,250
You captured Cai Hong.

88
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,820
If you dare harm Cai Hong,

89
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,930
I won't let you off.

90
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,390
Why won't you let me off?

91
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,030
You did a lot of unethical things. Who should be the one who shouldn't be left off?

92
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,740
Take your time sitting here.

93
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,940
I'm going to visit your girlfriend.

94
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,330
Wu Cai Hong.

95
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,270
Wu Cai Hong.

96
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,260
What's wrong?

97
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,450
- Where is Cai Hong?
- Are you blind? Why are you still asking?

98
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,800
Let me tell you, Jiang Yu. You are the cause of this. If anything were to happen to Cai Hong, I won't let you off.

99
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,950
Why don't you find her and you will know? Move aside.

100
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,360
You need to give me an explanation for this.

101
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,380
Stay far away from me. Let's go.

102
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,500
The one who should stay far away from me is you. Find her now.

103
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,750
Go. What are you still doing here? Look for her now.

104
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,860
Wu Cai Hong, come out!

105
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,220
Who are you? What are you doing?

106
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,470
We are looking for Wu Cai Hong.

107
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,000
- She is not in.
- Not in?

108
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,910
She owes us money. Do you know that today is the deadline?

109
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,110
Who owes you money? Nonsense. Leave now.

110
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,570
Keep quiet.

111
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,300
Buddies.

112
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,990
Capture this young girl.

113
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,120
Sell her to the brothel.

114
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,130
Let me go. What are you doing?

115
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,980
- Let me go!
- What are you doing?

116
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,640
I'm begging you to let me go.

117
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,140
- Mom!
- Stop that.

118
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,800
- Cai Hong.
- Sis.

119
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,930
- What are you doing?
- Wu Cai Hong, you are back just in time.

120
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,060
I'm here to get back the money from you today.

121
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,230
Cai Hong, leave now. These people won't go easy on you. Leave now.

122
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,850
Leave? It's not that easy.

123
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,220
I was the one who borrowed the money.

124
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,890
If you want to kill or cut, do it to me. I would bear it all. Let go of my stepmom and my sister.

125
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,090
Fine. Buddies, let her go.

126
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,870
Sirs, let's do this.

127
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,660
Don't take away my daughter.

128
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,130
You can sell me. I'm not that bad.

129
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,770
I have been to the north and south and am a star. <i>she is worldly and a good luck charm.</i>

130
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,370
I'm not too bad.

131
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,330
Stepmom.

132
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,740
Kiddo, keep quiet when adults are talking.

133
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,210
Let me tell you. I'm not operating an old folk's home. I don't need an old hag like you.

134
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,720
Sir. You are wrong in saying this.

135
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,020
Move aside. Let's go.

136
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,960
Let me go. Let's talk.

137
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,600
Let's go.

138
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,190
Let go of my daughter.

139
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,190
Stop there. Let her go.

140
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,090
Let her go.

141
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,630
- Let her go.
- Brother Shao Tian.

142
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,830
Let her go.

143
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,140
What are you bragging about? You want to return the loan on her behalf, right?

144
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,180
Do you have the ability to repay her loan?

145
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,210
Brother Zhou. Cai Hong took out a loan with high interest for you. If you are a man,

146
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,860
you would face these people without me having to tell you.

147
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,020
Zhou Shao Tian. Do you think I don't know who you are? Don't waste my time.

148
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:30,030
You still owe me the loan with interest. Pay back the loan immediately.

149
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,610
She is such a beautiful girl. If you want to see her again, I'm afraid you will have to go to the brothel.

150
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,230
You!

151
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,330
Brother Shao Tian, stop fighting.

152
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,540
I'm begging you. Let him go.

153
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,010
Scram!

154
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,980
Cai Hong.

155
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,530
Beat him.

156
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,590
- Brother Shao Tian.
- Stop. The money that she owes...

157
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,950
Who do you think you are?

158
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,820
Stop.

159
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,710
What did you want to say just now? Speak.

160
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,990
I said that even if you beat me to death,

161
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,860
I can't pay back this loan.

162
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,330
Is that so?

163
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,730
Still pretending? You don't have the money and you are still pretending to be a Young Master?

164
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,450
Enough.

165
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,420
Stop beating him.

166
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,140
Jiang Yu, please help.

167
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,670
I'm begging you.

168
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:06,060
Still pretending? Are you going to pay back your loan?

169
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,400
I can save him but you must agree to my terms.

170
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,850
What terms?

171
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,870
Speak now.

172
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,220
I haven't thought of them yet. Agree first before I tell you.

173
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,010
Okay, I agree.

174
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,310
Who cares? What is the big deal.

175
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,390
Stop the beating.

176
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,200
How much does she owe you? What's the total?

177
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:42,440
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

178
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,270
Brother Shao Tian, are you okay?

179
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,550
I'm fine.

180
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,750
What did you want me to promise you?

181
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,500
Come back with me.

182
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,350
Why should I go back with you?

183
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,380
You just promised me that.

184
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,600
No.

185
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,000
Jiang Yu. I won't let Cai Hong leave with you.

186
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,470
That day, you clearly had the chance to help her

187
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,930
but you didn't. You already made your decision.

188
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,710
Cai Hong is a splendor woman, for that

189
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,400
you will only hinder her. <i>( hold her back) </i>

190
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,820
Mom. How could you say this to Brother Shao Tian?

191
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,710
Brother Shao Tian. Don't worry about me.

192
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:00,540
I know what I should do. I will be fine.

193
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:06,540
No. You can't leave with him. He will harm you.

194
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,040
He won't harm me.

195
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,870
Let's leave.

196
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:30,390
Cai Hong!
♫<i> So long, I have waited for so long... </i>♫

197
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:37,210
♫<i> Waited for your love to bloom. </i>♫

198
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:43,670
♫<i> Desperately, I was desperately struggling to find... </i>♫

199
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:50,070
♫<i> Yet couldn't find the way to your heart. </i>♫

200
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:59,330
♫<i> I'm not willing to give up (the love), but I can't have it either. </i>♫

201
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:05,840

202
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:12,090
♫<i> I didn't see through to your eyes or heart </i>♫

203
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:17,910
♫<i> but I've already fallen in love with your tenderness. </i>♫

204
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:27,870
<i>Zhou Shao Tian. Let's see how long you can hang on before you come and beg me.</i>

205
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:50,070
You paid back my loan and even wanted me to accept your terms.

206
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,840
Speak. What are the terms?

207
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,870
Now you are so anxious to talk to me.

208
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,240
Even if you are evil and have harsh conditions, I will not be afraid of you.

209
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,820
Speak.

210
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,990
Sign the slave contract

211
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,970
and be a servant in our family.

212
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,250
I don't agree.

213
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,820
Do you have any other choice?

214
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,740
I just don't understand.

215
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,210
You paid off such a big loan, this could have bought you many servants.

216
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,030
Why me?

217
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,730
Because torturing you has become my greatest pleasure in life.

218
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,830
You are a pervert.

219
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,760
Check this over. If there are no problems, use your finger print to seal it.

220
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,760
It's three years. You will be free after three years.

221
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,820
It's only just three years.

222
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,980
As for the day you were hurt, the day Zhou Shao Tian would have confessed...

223
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,050
Who would have wanted the money instead of life?

224
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,450
Brother Shao Tian didn't do it. Why should he admit to it?

225
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,190
You're not the devil,

226
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,400
however, with a cut hand comes labor.

227
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,880
Even if you were a monster, I would not believe you.

228
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,110
If I'm a monster, you are a fool.

229
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,900
Think whatever you want. Return the bracelet to me.

230
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,640
Starting from now, you are Jiang family's servant.

231
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,970
Where are you going? Return the bracelet to me.

232
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,250
Brother, where did you go?

233
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,390
I have been waiting for you the whole afternoon.

234
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,550
Fei Fei. Send someone to pay back Wu Cai Hong's loan with interest.

235
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,980
Brother. Why are we helping her to pay off her debt?

236
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,620
Because she signed a three year contract with me as our servant.

237
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,650
Brother, we are not lacking in any servants.

238
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,010
Even more so, what can Wu Cai Hong do?

239
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,280
Enough. Go when I tell you to. I still have work to do.

240
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,810
Finishing cleaning, I'm exhausted.

241
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:18,020
Mom. I did the cleaning and not you. Why are you tired?

242
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,380
I'm tired just by seeing you hard at work.

243
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,610
Come on. Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

244
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,260
Mom. I was scared to death today.

245
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,760
Your sister is really soft-hearted. We were unable to help ourselves,

246
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,480
but in order to help Zhou Shao Tian, she went to ask for help from the loan sharks.

247
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,390
Those robbers didn't touch her.

248
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,210
Sister is still in the hospital. I'm going to deliver some food to her.

249
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,350
You don't need to worry about this. Jiang Yu is there. She won't starve.

250
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:53,600
Don't think that he is a cold and emotionless person on the exterior. I can tell that he's interested in your sister.

251
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,870
If not, why would he spend so much money on your sister? What's the problem with going through hardship with him?

252
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:06,160
Mom. I don't like you behaving this way. Brother Shao Tian and his family treat sister very well too.

253
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,000
I support Brother Shao Tian.

254
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,590
What do you know? He is different from the past now.

255
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,000
If your sister stays with that poor guy, she won't have any future.

256
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,920
Okay, I'm not going to argue with you anymore.

257
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,190
Even if I don't need to deliver any food to sister, I'm going to deliver a change of clothes to her.

258
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:26,840
By the way, when you go there, help to bathe your sister. It's not convenient for her as she is injured.

259
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,430
Remember to tell her that I miss her.

260
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,010
When she has a good life with Jiang Yu, don't let her forget me. Understand?

261
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,660
Mom. How could you be like this?

262
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,930
What's wrong with being a rich man who will let you eat, dress and live well?

263
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,660
So vulgar.

264
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,090
You!

265
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,900
You remember that.

266
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,410
The doctor says that your body is in good health. What is the problem?

267
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,460
Thus, he prescribed some sedatives.

268
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,880
-Let's take a break now.
-Ok

269
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,840
They are now prescribing it.

270
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,980
I am a bit tired.

271
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,240
Also, I should take a break since I am tired.

272
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:16,500
The last time, you placed the lipstick in my bag and framed me for being a thief. Right?

273
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,460
Why are you saying that I framed you. If you stole,

274
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,590
why did the police catch you?

275
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,180
It was you who framed me. I have never seen anyone as bad as you.

276
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,390
You are the bad one instead. Your sister is a bad person too. Your entire family is bad.

277
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,650
You dare to scold my sister and my family? You are the bad person instead.

278
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,570
So what if I insult you. It's all because of your family's wrongdoing that karma got to you.

279
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,910
Who gives you the right to scold my family?

280
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,680
What's wrong with me scolding you?

281
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,600
- Fei Fei, keep calm.
- What are you doing?

282
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,900
- Why are you pushing me?
- So what if I pushed you?

283
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,230
- I will beat you.
- You dare lay a hand on me?

284
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,790
<i>Why does that sound like Cai Yun's voice?</i>

285
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:58,220
<i>It's Cai Yun's voice. Am I dreaming?</i>

286
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,980
Let's talk in a civilised manner.

287
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,810
Why are you grasping my clothes?

288
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,050
Stop fighting.

289
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,470
- Who says you can hit me?
- Stop fighting.

290
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,130
Let go now.

291
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,100
Mother.

292
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,160
Mother.

293
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,180
Quick.

294
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,350
-Mother

295
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,700
Mother. Mother.

296
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,650
Fei Fei.

297
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,000
Mother.

298
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,370
Mother, wake up.

299
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,720
Mother.

300
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,350
-Stop scaring me.
-Why you?

301
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,210
Mom, wake up now.

302
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,080
Sister, she won't die, right? I didn't do this on purpose.

303
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,380
Cai Yun. Remember this. Don't say anything at all.

304
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,600
Doctor. Doctor! Doctor!

305
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,840
Doctor! Doc...

306
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,170
Doctor. Doctor!

307
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,260
<i>Emergency Room </i>

308
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,660
Fei Fei. How did this happen?

309
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,800
How could this happen?

310
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,750
I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm sorry.

311
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,580
It was...

312
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,390
It was me. I pushed Madam Jiang down the stairs.

313
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,720
It was her.

314
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,820
She pushed Mom down the stairs.

315
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,020
Is this true?

316
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,870
Yes.

317
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,350
I fought with Fei Fei just now.

318
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,600
I lost my grip and pushed Madam Jiang down the stairs.

319
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,450
I didn't do this on purpose.

320
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,320
I'm really sorry.

321
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,600
Brother. Just now, Mom and I were walking to the porch to take a rest.

322
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,700
They both came over to cause trouble. They started the fight first

323
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,800
and pushed Mom down the stairs.

324
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,510
Blame me for not protecting Mom. If anything were to happen to her,

325
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,870
what would I do?

326
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,810
Let me ask you again.

327
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,910
What Fei Fei said,

328
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,810
is it the truth?

329
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,940
Yes.

330
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,360
I was the one who pushed Madam Jiang down the stairs but I didn't do it on purpose.

331
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,790
I...

332
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:07,900
I don't want to listen to your excuses. If anything were to happen to my Mom,

333
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,030
I won't let you off.

334
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,350
Doctor. How is my mother?

335
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,570
Mr Jiang, I'm sorry.

336
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,840
I prescribed whatever treatments I could for Madam Jiang

337
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,240
but she is still unconscious.

338
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,800
Madam Jiang could have a concussion and there are blood clots in her brain.

339
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,780
If the blood clots go down, she may regain her consciousness.

340
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,640
Maybe? What do you mean by that? When will my mother be conscious?

341
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,410
This will depend on God's will.

342
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:50,990
It may be a few days, months or forever.

343
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,130
I'm sorry.

344
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,350
I'm really sorry.

345
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,480
- Why? What did we do wrong?!
- Let my sister go!

346
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,700
- Why did you harm my family?!
- I'm sorry.

347
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,040
Your father already harmed my father. Why did you harm my mom?!

348
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,500
Why?! Why?!

349
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,980
Why? Why?!

350
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,940
- Keep calm.
- Let me go.

351
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,310
You better pray to God that my mother will be fine.

352
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,950
If not...

353
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:00,210
Madam Jiang, I'm sorry that

354
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,960
this has happened.

355
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,990
I'm really very sad. We really didn't do it on purpose.

356
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,940
But I believe that good people will be rewarded.

357
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,790
God will favor you.

358
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,320
You will definitely wake up.

359
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,090
What are you doing?

360
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,060
Get out.

361
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,960
Wu Cai Hong, I don't want to see you again. Get lost now and stay far away from me.

362
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:48,260
Doctor, it has been a few days. Why is my mother not a little better?

363
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:54,020
In fact, Madan Jiang's condition has been improving.

364
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,680
Really?

365
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,800
A few days ago, Madam Jiang could not swallow,

366
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,620
take medication or eat.

367
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,990
This morning,

368
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,430
Madam Jiang already swallowed on her own eating liquid food.

369
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,890
These are signs of improvement.

370
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,200
When do you think my mother will be conscious?

371
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,620
Don't be anxious about this. I can't confirm when Madam Jiang will be conscious.

372
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:29,110
Half of this will depend on her self will, the other will be Heaven's will.

373
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,130
Mr Jiang. I invited you here to have a talk with you.

374
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:39,490
Based on Madam Jiang's current condition, I feel that she can be discharged from the hospital and seek treatment at home.

375
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:45,040
If she goes back to an environment where she is familiar with, this may help her in regaining her consciousness.

376
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,510
So, I can take my mother home?

377
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,910
Based on her current condition, she can seek treatments at home.

378
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,150
Of course, we will still conduct regular tests on her.

379
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,690
Thank you, Doctor.

380
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,410
What are you doing here?

381
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,430
I came here to see if Madam Jiang is conscious. Has she woke up?

382
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:31,000
My mom will be discharged from the hospital tomorrow. Pack your stuff and get ready to go to my home.

383
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,860
What?

384
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,320
Don't forget that you signed the slave contract.

385
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:43,670
If my mother remains unconscious, I will settle the score with your entire family.

386
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:14,790
- Sis.
- Cai Yun, don't talk about this matter.

387
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,000
Cai Hong.

388
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,250
- Mom.
- Mom.

389
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,960
You drag it to no end.

390
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:31,080
Cai Hong. You are going to the Jiang mansion, right?

391
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,390
I'm going there to be a maid.

392
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,380
Don't lie to me.

393
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,510
I can tell that Jiang Yu is interested in you.

394
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,880
This is a rare opportunity.

395
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,410
You must hold on tight to this opportunity. Understand?

396
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,890
I'm going to the Jiang mansion to be a maid because I signed a slave contract.

397
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:53,050
Do you think he will waste his money in repaying my debts?

398
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,390
You are really foolish. What do you mean by a slave contract?

399
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,660
This is only just an excuse.

400
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,770
Is the Jiang family lacking in staff?

401
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:07,910
Jiang Yu is using this excuse to keep you by his side so that he can see you every day.

402
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,040
What are you talking about?

403
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,660
Wu Cai Hong. You are really stupid.

404
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,410
You have a big fish like Jiang Yu

405
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,000
but you look for a small fry like Shao Tian instead.

406
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,800
People should have ambitions.
<i>Idiom: Man should seek his way up.</i>

407
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,240
This is a good opportunity. Don't let it go.

408
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,200
Marry Jiang Yu, have a child and enjoy life.

409
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,930
Listen to your stepmother and don't be complacent.

410
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,660
I'm afraid that I will disappoint you.

411
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,640
This child is so disobedient.

412
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,750
This is the new servant. Her name is Wu Cai Hong.

413
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,410
I want to teach her the rules of the Jiang family first.

414
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:12,530
I called everyone here to give you a wake up call.

415
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,250
With the dedicated staff here, they can tell you that

416
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,200
you must listen and understand things.

417
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,990
Yes.

418
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,520
Mrs Zhang.

419
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,790
Use discipline.

420
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,780
Teach this wench a lesson. Give her twenty beatings first.

421
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,010
Yes.

422
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,750
It's not that easy to be a servant in the Jiang family.

423
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,050
You must remember what I say.

424
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,840
First, you must obey orders.

425
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,710
Second, you must be loyal.
Third, you must abide by the law and behave yourself.

426
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,310
Fourth, our family is fair in measuring out rewards and punishments.

427
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:04,600
If you commit a mistake, you must willingly accept the punishment and not be angry.

428
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,380
Miss is letting out her temper on her.

429
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,590
What's wrong today?

430
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,050
Did she do something wrong?

431
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,080
Miss is even teaching her the rules herself.

432
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,220
I heard that she pushed Madam Jiang down the stairs at the hospital.

433
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,910
She caused Madam to be in a coma now.

434
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,360
No wonder, Miss is punishing her like this.

435
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,980
It seems to me that she wants her to pay with her life.

436
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,700
Did you remember what I said?

437
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,230
I'm asking you a question. Answer me.

438
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,630
Yes, I do.

439
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:51,260
Mrs Zhang. In the future, you must monitor Wu Cai Hong and teach her well.

440
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,620
Yes.

441
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,690
Young Master.

442
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,730
Everyone can leave now.

443
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,820
Yes.

444
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,160
Young Master Jiang.

445
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,460
I'm begging you. Let me take care of Madam.

446
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,770
Did I hear correctly?

447
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,460
Do you know who caused my mother to be in this state?

448
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,640
If you dare to go clear to my mother, I will never let you off.

449
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,890
You can give me a chance to redeem myself.

450
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,400
My mom, because of blood clots in her brain also,

451
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,250
was confined to a bed.

452
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,520
This type of condition, if you don't treat it carefully, one's health will deteriorate.

453
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,020
Master Jiang, I beg you.

454
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,580
Give me a chance to redeem myself. Let me take care of Madam.

455
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,230
I will do my very best to regain Madam's consciousness.

456
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:56,500
Don't pretend to be a good person in front of us. He will never trust you again.

457
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,820
If you don't agree, I will keep kneeling down here.

458
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:17,940

Starting from today,

473
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,220
if you take one step away from my mother,

474
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:11,780
and my mother doesn't wake up, don't think you will have good days ahead.

475
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:19,010
I will take good care of Madam.
