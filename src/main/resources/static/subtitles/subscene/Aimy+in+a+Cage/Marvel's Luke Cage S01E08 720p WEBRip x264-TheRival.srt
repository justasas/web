1
00:00:12,014 --> 00:00:14,850
-[Claire] Luke, stay with me.
-[groaning]

2
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:17,937
Breathe. Breathe.
Just breathe.

3
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:23,693
Don't move. Okay?
I've got you.

4
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,197
[groaning loudly]

5
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:41,669
[engine starting]

6
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:52,930
[breathing heavily]

7
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:10,239
Hey there, you.

8
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:15,160
-[straining]
-Okay.

9
00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:16,746
Come on.

10
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:18,497
Relax.

11
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:20,124
[breathing heavily]

12
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:21,291
Relax.
You're okay.

13
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:24,920
-Where am I?
-Uh, you're in an ambulance.

14
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:26,922
You went into shock.

15
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:28,924
I called my friend Manny.

16
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:30,843
He used to run with my uncle
back in the day.

17
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:32,261
He's driving.
He's discreet.

18
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:34,138
[groans] What the hell
did you do that for?

19
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,598
-What do you mean?
-No hospitals.

20
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:39,644
-I can't be in the system.
-He borrowed it.

21
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:41,771
Like I said, he's discreet.

22
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:44,273
But you bleeding out
in the back of a gypsy cab?

23
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:46,233
That would get even more attention.

24
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:49,737
We need to keep you safe.
Drink this.

25
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,989
You can't dehydrate.

26
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:59,079
I saw you looking for the shooter
before you passed out.

27
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:01,206
Did you see who it was?

28
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:02,917
No.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,584
-[groans]
-On a scale from one to ten,

30
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:06,086
how much pain are you in right now?

31
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:09,089
[breathing heavily] Three.

32
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:11,133
Liar.

33
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:12,927
I'm okay.

34
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:15,304
You're not okay.

35
00:02:16,388 --> 00:02:19,183
The bullet penetrated through your skin.
I didn't even think that could happen.

36
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,145
That makes two of us.

37
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:27,066
[breath trembling]

38
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:29,526
-I looked for an exit wound, but--
-I know.

39
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:31,821
It's still in there.

40
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:37,159
The sound that it made,
like it was drilling into you...

41
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:40,120
I wanna get a closer look.

42
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:43,791
See what's going on inside of you.
I know a place.

43
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:48,796
[Luke] Whatever we gotta do.

44
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:52,925
[gunshot]

45
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:15,865
[theme music playing]

46
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:27,561
[Luke] You okay?
[Claire] Yeah.

47
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:30,564
-[both groan]
-Manny?

48
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:31,899
[Manny] Who was that son of a bitch?

49
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:34,819
-[groans] Are you okay?
-I'll be fine.

50
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:36,445
But somebody took a shot at us.

51
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:39,031
You guys got to get out of here.
Go!

52
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:41,700
[groans]

53
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:55,005
[Claire] Watch out.

54
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:57,132
[both grunting]

55
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:05,349
Can you dig it?

56
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,602
[Claire] What the hell?

57
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,606
Every Friday night at the drive-in.

58
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:15,442
<i>The Warriors.</i>

59
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,156
[sing-song] Carl, come out and play.

60
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:25,995
-You know him, don't you?
-[sirens wailing in distance]

61
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,376
[man] I'm enjoying this shit, Carl.

62
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:34,003
Keep running.

63
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,257
[grunts]

64
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,717
[Claire whispering] Luke, hey.

65
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,594
You can't fight him yet, Luke.

66
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,554
[panting]

67
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:46,140
You're too weak right now.

68
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,100
Come on.

69
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:03,073
I didn't want it!

70
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:07,619
[yells and breathes heavily]

71
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:11,165
[Shades] You having second thoughts?

72
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:20,757
[Shades sighs]

73
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:24,303
What's on your mind?

74
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,682
I'm not having any thoughts.

75
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:30,850
Is that normal?

76
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:34,021
As long as you stay on the clock,
it doesn't matter.

77
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:40,735
<i>The secret to every great lie</i>
<i>is it has to run parallel to the truth.</i>

78
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:44,698
Every moment wasted
brings you one step closer to jail.

79
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:46,908
So what do we do?

80
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:51,496
[Shades] <i>DNA is our friend...</i>
<i>and our enemy.</i>

81
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,290
<i>We must treat her carefully.</i>

82
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:56,168
Head straight to the bathroom
and clean up.

83
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:58,170
I don't have any clothes.

84
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:01,215
I had Alex take care of it.
They're in there.

85
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:05,635
<i>-To make this stick, we'll need a patsy.</i>
-[camera shutter clicking]

86
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:13,936
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

87
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:15,520
Karma is a cruel mistress.

88
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:19,108
She does not like being a side chick.
She eventually gets hers.

89
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:21,235
-Brace yourself.
-It's that bad?

90
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:22,361
Yeah.

91
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,449
Did you forget anything?

92
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:29,284
The bottle.

93
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:30,660
[Mariah screams] No!

94
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:34,581
I hit him on the head with a bottle.

95
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,875
Did it break?

96
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:40,504
-No.
-That's good.

97
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,590
[Misty] Make sure we photograph the stage.

98
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:46,385
Compare the photos
with the last performance filmed here.

99
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:48,637
See if there's anything missing.

100
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,598
Microphone stand, a monitor, anything.

101
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:55,185
What do you think?
You're the visualist.

102
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:03,152
[Misty] <i>You see all that trauma</i>
<i>to the head and the face?</i>

103
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:05,779
<i>The fall couldn't have done that.</i>
<i>It's not enough height.</i>

104
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:08,948
[groans]

105
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:13,953
[groaning]

106
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:17,791
[Stokes breathing heavily]

107
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:19,959
[Misty] <i>But he's not dead yet.</i>

108
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,008
So let's say our perp did hit him
over and over again

109
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:28,468
with a blunt instrument until he's dead.

110
00:08:28,552 --> 00:08:31,263
The trash bag is for the clothes
you're wearing.

111
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:34,391
Every stitch goes in.
Jewelry, too.

112
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,601
Spurlock will incinerate them.

113
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:41,440
The towels you use, the rugs...
They all go in that trash bag.

114
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:45,735
Get dressed from the clothes
in the garment bag.

115
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:48,197
I look like I'm in shock.

116
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:52,617
Is that why you're speaking to me
as if I'm a child?

117
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:55,912
I need you to hear me.

118
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:58,123
I want you to win.

119
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,917
Do what I say...

120
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:03,420
and when you get away with this...

121
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:07,382
you can go back to being the sexy...

122
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:11,803
domineering bitch...
that we all hate to love.

123
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:14,348
Now go.

124
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,228
[sighs and sniffles]

125
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:30,780
That's the last time
you will ever call me a bitch.

126
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:40,039
Look at what you did.

127
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,961
Destroying the face...

128
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,131
[grunting]

129
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:49,466
...that's rage.

130
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:53,095
But walking away
without leaving a trail of blood?

131
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:54,554
Who's ever done that?

132
00:09:54,638 --> 00:09:56,765
Temper, temper, Carl.

133
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:07,192
[Misty] Councilwoman Dillard,
my condolences.

134
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:09,903
Oh, please.

135
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:13,907
My cousin's still laid out on the floor
and you're talking about condolences.

136
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,617
What's the condolence?
The sheet?

137
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:18,912
I think you're taking this personally.

138
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:20,205
Why aren't you?

139
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:26,336
We are working as fast as we can.

140
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,297
They said you called this in.

141
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:35,720
Around noon, I called Cornell
and told him that we needed to talk.

142
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:39,266
He said he was busy
and that he would get back to me.

143
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:42,519
So I went in to work.
I mean, what could I do?

144
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:46,856
Thanks to him,
I had a million fires to put out.

145
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:51,361
Around 10:00,
I realized that I hadn't heard back so...

146
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:53,155
[inhales]

147
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:54,864
I decided to come here.

148
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:58,327
"Thanks to him."
So you were mad.

149
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:03,373
Frustrated, yes.
Mad? Never.

150
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:09,713
He was my first cousin,
but I practically raised that boy.

151
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:14,551
I loved him.

152
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:18,472
So when you got here
was the door locked?

153
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:25,144
There is a code on the VIP entrance.
It keeps the paparazzi away.

154
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:26,563
It changes every week.

155
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:29,107
Yes, I had access.

156
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,568
So you let yourself in.
Then what?

157
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:37,699
Then I found him,
sprawled out like a goddamn rag doll.

158
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:40,660
So he was already dead
when you got here.

159
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:44,373
Yeah.

160
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,043
But then I heard someone else crying.

161
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,004
Who?

162
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,091
Candace. [sobbing]

163
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:57,761
[sniffles] Candace Miller.

164
00:11:57,844 --> 00:12:00,472
Candace is Cornell's VIP hostess.

165
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:05,226
Candy's worked here at Harlem's Paradise
since we re-opened.

166
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:15,904
Ms. Miller...
I'm Detective Misty Knight.

167
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,239
What did you see?

168
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:21,785
Take your time to collect your thoughts.

169
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:25,038
I don't need time.
I saw who did it.

170
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:26,706
It was Luke Cage.

171
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,177
[reporters clamoring]

172
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:44,140
[reporter 1] Councilwoman!
[reporter 2] Right here! Over here!

173
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:47,936
[reporter 3] Can you confirm that
it was Luke Cage who killed your cousin?

174
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:49,563
Is Harlem's hero a cold-blooded murderer?

175
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:50,939
Or did he just take out the trash?

176
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:52,607
-[Mariah] Who said that?
-I did. Frank--

177
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:57,153
My cousin Cornell Stokes
was a complex man.

178
00:12:57,236 --> 00:13:01,658
Conflicted, but underneath all the bluster
was the soul of a musician.

179
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:05,161
<i>He was a true Harlem original.</i>

180
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:08,206
[stammers] But what about this stranger?
That's the garbage.

181
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:11,793
But in your media rush
to anoint a savior after the explosion

182
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:16,214
at Genghis Connie's,
no one asked the crucial question.

183
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:19,258
Who the hell is Luke Cage?

184
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:22,721
You label Cornell Stokes
a gangster, a thug.

185
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:26,683
<i>But as many people</i>
<i>recently witnessed at Mount Olivet,</i>

186
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:30,520
<i>Cornell was a repentant man</i>
<i>dealing with his violent past.</i>

187
00:13:30,604 --> 00:13:32,439
<i>Making amends for his wrongs.</i>

188
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:36,150
<i>He had every intention of...</i>
<i>of cooperating with the police.</i>

189
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:39,028
Goddamn vigilantes
who call themselves heroes,

190
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:42,699
like Luke Cage,
they are dangerous.

191
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:45,326
<i>They are a menace</i>
<i>to the safety, the security,</i>

192
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,997
<i>and the sanctity of our community.</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

193
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,207
People have used a lot of words
to describe my cousin,

194
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,168
but one word they have
never used is "coward."

195
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:56,630
<i>And only a coward</i>
<i>would hide in the shadows</i>

196
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:58,757
and kill an innocent man.
[stutters] That's it.

197
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,841
[reporters clamoring]

198
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:03,052
[reporter] One more question.
Councilwoman, was he innocent?

199
00:14:03,136 --> 00:14:04,638
[clamoring continues]

200
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:07,807
[Luke breathing heavily]

201
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:11,102
[Claire] That guy's putting
innocent people in danger to get at you.

202
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:16,650
I'm gonna put a stop to it,
but I need your help.

203
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:21,696
[groaning]

204
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:24,533
[breathing heavily]

205
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:30,497
Hold on to this.
I can't lose it.

206
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,831
[Claire] Okay.

207
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:36,711
[groans]

208
00:14:41,508 --> 00:14:43,009
[Claire] I'm going to sterilize the area.

209
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,766
[wincing]

210
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:52,477
-You feel that?
-[groans] A bit.

211
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:55,188
Keep going.

212
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:57,524
No. I'm gonna see what kind
of anesthetic they have here first.

213
00:14:57,607 --> 00:14:59,568
-No drugs.
-Luke...

214
00:14:59,651 --> 00:15:01,611
I can't be compromised.

215
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:04,573
Innocent people could die.
I can't risk it.

216
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:07,992
All right, macho man.

217
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:10,620
Actually, it's Power Man.

218
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:13,331
That's what Pop used to call me.
[chuckles]

219
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:16,125
-That's even cornier.
-[chuckling]

220
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:17,251
[groans]

221
00:15:18,462 --> 00:15:19,546
Okay.

222
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:22,799
-I'm going in.
-[groaning]

223
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:28,888
All right,
I'm gonna press even harder, okay?

224
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:33,101
[Luke groaning]

225
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:36,438
[scalpel scraping]

226
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,397
[Luke groans]

227
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:41,776
Wild.

228
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:43,862
This is supposed to be soft tissue,

229
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:46,865
but it's almost
as impenetrable as your skin.

230
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:48,407
Give it to me.

231
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,455
[breathes deeply]

232
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:00,169
[scraping]

233
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:01,379
[Luke groaning]

234
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:04,591
[exhales]

235
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:06,300
[scraping]

236
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:07,969
-[breathing heavily]
-[scalpel clanging]

237
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,597
[grunts]

238
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,973
I gotta get it out.

239
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:14,726
It's getting hard to breathe.

240
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,937
Okay, let's look inside.

241
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:28,990
[door closes]

242
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:31,826
[Misty] Anybody waiting for you at home?

243
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,202
My parents.

244
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:35,747
I'm moving out
as soon as I finish night school.

245
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,831
Nice.

246
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:41,294
The quicker you answer my questions,
the quicker you can go. Okay?

247
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:42,504
Okay.

248
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:45,799
State your name and address
for the record.

249
00:16:45,882 --> 00:16:48,342
Candace Miller.
555 Edgecombe Avenue.

250
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:50,720
-How do you know Mr. Stokes?
-He was my boss.

251
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:53,932
-I noticed your hair was wet.
-I took a shower.

252
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,811
Crime scene officers combed
every inch of Harlem's Paradise.

253
00:16:57,894 --> 00:16:59,228
We also noticed that the shower

254
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:01,648
in Mr. Stokes' private bathroom
had been used.

255
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:03,608
-I used it.
-When?

256
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,277
After I was saw Mr. Stokes.

257
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:10,364
So, you're one of his... friends?

258
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:12,992
Yes.

259
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:15,620
He has several?

260
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:19,833
So I assume you have his code
for his private entrance.

261
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,043
What private entrance?

262
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:23,670
[door opens]

263
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:27,090
Don't say another word, Ms. Miller.
I'm representing you now.

264
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,925
Is this snake your lawyer?

265
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:33,512
Candace, if you're not guilty,
you'll answer my questions.

266
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:35,974
Nice try.
My client isn't under arrest.

267
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:37,516
-Ms. Miller--
-I'm not guilty.

268
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:38,852
What else do you want to know?

269
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:40,436
Ms. Miller, don't say another word.

270
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,065
We used luminol and found traces of blood
in Mr. Stokes' shower,

271
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:46,610
even though it had been heavily bleached.

272
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:47,694
Stand up and walk out.

273
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:49,904
It's a good thing
you got this high-powered flunky.

274
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:52,281
I'm about to nail your ass to the wall.

275
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,950
It was Luke Cage!

276
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:57,453
[sighs]

277
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,377
After I showered,
I came out to see Cornell.

278
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,671
I still needed my paycheck.

279
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,592
I heard loud voices and a struggle.

280
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:12,135
That's when I walked out

281
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:15,013
and I saw Mr. Stokes
down below on the floor.

282
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:16,472
[sighs]

283
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:21,144
Luke Cage saw me and ran away.

284
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:24,689
He was wearing bright yellow gloves,

285
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:27,984
like the kind he used to use
when he washed dishes.

286
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:31,404
And you're positive it was Luke Cage?

287
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:33,406
You would know.

288
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:36,075
I saw you two at the bar together
the other night.

289
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,119
I saw you talking outside, too.

290
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:40,038
May I go now?

291
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:43,082
Candace, look me in the eye.

292
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:49,047
You were too scared to go upstairs
and serve Cottonmouth without Luke.

293
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,258
Table number seven, right?

294
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,552
And then you started sleeping with him?

295
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:57,806
But you still call him Mr. Stokes.

296
00:18:57,889 --> 00:18:59,974
And you can't even tell me
about his private entrance.

297
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:04,395
What do they have on you, huh?
Is it money?

298
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,772
How much are they paying you?

299
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,441
This is over.
We're done.

300
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:12,445
Your delivery arrived right on time.

301
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:15,156
Yes, thank you.

302
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,492
Okay, gotta go.

303
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:21,620
-[sighs]
-You killed it out there.

304
00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:24,958
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

305
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,877
Just get that clip up
on the website within the hour.

306
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:31,005
Send the link to all my supporters,
the donors.

307
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:34,383
-If we play this right...
-[slow clapping]

308
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:37,721
And the Oscar goes to...

309
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:40,014
Alex, would you wait in the car with Tony?

310
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:46,980
Detective, do you have a problem?

311
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:48,898
Just call 'em like I see 'em.

312
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:51,484
So you have your suspect,
Luke Cage.

313
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,362
Who says I only have one suspect?

314
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:57,031
You ready for our interview?

315
00:19:57,115 --> 00:20:00,659
Your cousin was attacked
by somebody he was close to.

316
00:20:00,744 --> 00:20:02,829
That's what those wounds tell me.

317
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:05,707
It was passion.
And hatred.

318
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,961
And Luke Cage didn't hate my cousin...
and me,

319
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:13,631
when he showed up at my brownstone
trying to intimidate me?

320
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:15,674
What do you have on Candace?

321
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,469
What do you have on me?

322
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:23,808
Other than the fact
that your edges are a little damp?

323
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,898
That's what I thought.
You ain't got shit.

324
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:31,733
You know what?

325
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:35,486
I'm not under arrest,
and I changed my mind.

326
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,364
You want to talk to me,
you call my lawyer.

327
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:40,950
[sighs]

328
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,162
Where's your partner?

329
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:45,955
Oh, I forgot.

330
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,623
-Sorry.
-Who the hell

331
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,918
-do you think you're talking to?
-[Ridley] Detective.

332
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:53,922
Priscilla, you need to teach
your people some manners.

333
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:56,758
Mariah, I'm so sorry for your loss.

334
00:20:56,841 --> 00:20:59,010
-Thank you for being there for me.
-Of course.

335
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:01,888
Oh. It has been a very hard day.

336
00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:04,432
-I'm sure.
-Hey.

337
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:06,642
Are you gonna make it
to the Founders' Day Lunch at Cecil's?

338
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,895
-You know I'll be there.
-Oh, great.

339
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:10,729
[Mariah chuckles]

340
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,442
[whispers] Bye-bye.

341
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:19,823
You hugged her.

342
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:23,201
She's my soror.
I had to.

343
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:24,953
You like Mariah for this?

344
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:27,705
-I do.
-You have an eyewitness, Detective.

345
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:31,209
-Who I can't trust.
-Who puts Luke Cage in the box.

346
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:33,002
The evidence points to two suspects.

347
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:35,254
One of them was someone
Cottonmouth was close to.

348
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:36,881
Because the door was locked?

349
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:39,508
Because they got to gangster number one
without catching a bullet.

350
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:40,759
Come on!

351
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:45,098
-Mariah called us.
-Then she called the press.

352
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:47,725
And she put Luke Cage on blast.

353
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,353
Look, I was just about to compel her
to make a statement

354
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:53,439
before you let your little soror
skee-wee on out of here.

355
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:54,941
Where is Cage?

356
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:58,444
Because Mariah's not going anywhere,
guilty or not.

357
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,322
But your real number-one suspect is ghost.

358
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,450
What are you gonna do about it?

359
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:16,963
-[Luke gasping]
-[Claire] Okay.

360
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:20,799
[breathing heavily]

361
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:25,054
[heart beating]

362
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,266
[Luke] Is it a boy or a girl?

363
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:29,767
[Claire chuckles]

364
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,978
It's either twins or you need
to start doing some sit-ups.

365
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:33,271
[chuckles]

366
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:35,023
[groaning]

367
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:42,655
What is it?

368
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:45,992
There's no bullet.
It's just shrapnel.

369
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:48,119
Yeah, the bullet drilled into your skin
and exploded.

370
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,829
All the pieces that are left
are just trapped.

371
00:22:51,915 --> 00:22:53,166
How much?

372
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,002
A lot.
And they're moving.

373
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:57,878
We couldn't get the scalpel in.

374
00:22:57,962 --> 00:22:59,797
How you gonna take the bullet out?

375
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:02,758
Remember when Jessica shot you?

376
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,803
I've been trying to forget that. [sighs]

377
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,847
[sighs] Well, I drained the fluid
in your skull

378
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:10,516
by going behind your eye socket.

379
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,187
I'll figure this out.

380
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,314
-[cell phone vibrating]
-[sighs]

381
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:19,525
Blocked ID.

382
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:22,946
Whoever it is has called three times.

383
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:24,405
-See who it is.
-[cell phone beeps]

384
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:27,241
-Hello?
-Hello?

385
00:23:27,325 --> 00:23:29,702
This is Detective Misty Knight.
Who is this?

386
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:33,497
Uh, Claire Temple.
Um...

387
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:36,584
We met the other night.
I'm the nurse with the van...

388
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,962
and, uh... Scarfe.

389
00:23:40,129 --> 00:23:41,380
[Luke] <i>Misty.</i>

390
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:42,840
I need you to come down to the station.

391
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:45,384
We've already been through this.

392
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:46,469
No.

393
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:48,846
<i>Cottonmouth's dead.</i>

394
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:53,351
He was killed earlier tonight.

395
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:56,270
<i>I need you to come down</i>
<i>to answer some questions.</i>

396
00:23:56,354 --> 00:23:57,730
You think I did it?

397
00:23:57,813 --> 00:23:59,565
A witness puts you at the scene.

398
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:02,401
-Oh, this has got to be a joke.
<i>-Claire, stay out of this.</i>

399
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:04,445
He's been with me all night.

400
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:05,821
<i>He hasn't killed anyone.</i>

401
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:09,325
[Misty] Luke, listen,
I've got crime scene guys

402
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,910
combing through the barber shop
and the apartment upstairs.

403
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:14,205
<i>Just make it easier on yourself, okay?</i>

404
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:17,375
Claire, hang up.
They're trying to trace the call.

405
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,751
[phone beeps]

406
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,212
Luke. Luke!

407
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:24,465
They're close.
I've got a target area.

408
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,175
He's near the park.
Do you want to send a unit?

409
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:27,801
No. What's in the area?

410
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,054
Uh, a few shops, a women's clinic.

411
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:35,518
-I know that look. You're about to--
-I'm bringing him in myself.

412
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,853
I didn't finish my sentence, Misty.

413
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:40,273
You're about to do something stupid.
Don't.

414
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:42,858
Listen, don't tell the inspector.

415
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:44,152
Don't tell anybody.

416
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:20,854
[Shades] I thought you went back
down south, Sugar.

417
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:23,857
Ain't nothing down there for me.
I'm back.

418
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:25,901
What do you guys want?

419
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,821
[Zip] Well, Cottonmouth's gone, so...

420
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:30,364
Yeah.

421
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:32,616
You guys did a real bang up job
protecting him.

422
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,453
What are you talking about?
He sent us away.

423
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:37,996
Anyhow, shit done changed.

424
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:40,833
So we gonna need to
work out some type of--

425
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:41,917
What?

426
00:25:43,211 --> 00:25:44,337
Severance?

427
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:52,303
Y'all work for me now.

428
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:55,055
-[Amos] What about the club?
-It belongs to Mariah.

429
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:57,850
But I'm in charge.

430
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,561
Do you understand?

431
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:05,608
Good.

432
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:07,943
And do me a favor.

433
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,572
Buy some new clothes.

434
00:26:12,615 --> 00:26:13,866
Please.

435
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,951
We're first class all the way.

436
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:21,124
You ain't worried about Luke Cage?

437
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:22,416
[sighs]

438
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:26,837
Leave.

439
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:38,349
[takes deep breath]

440
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,918
[camera shutter clicks]

441
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,213
[Luke breathing heavily]

442
00:27:16,554 --> 00:27:18,138
We gotta hurry.

443
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:20,349
I just want to examine
your soft tissue cells,

444
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:22,810
see if there's another way in
I haven't thought of yet.

445
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:24,102
[Luke] Just make it quick.

446
00:27:24,187 --> 00:27:26,647
Holy shit.

447
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:31,985
Your epithelial cells are simultaneously
super elastic and energy absorbent.

448
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,533
The cells that line your organs

449
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:39,243
are stuck together like Legos,
which is normal.

450
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:42,580
But when I try to pull them apart,
they snap back together.

451
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:44,415
What does it mean, for real?

452
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:48,001
[sighs] Don't quote me on this
because I'm not 100% sure,

453
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:50,754
but it looks like the thing that makes
you super strong is the same thing

454
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:53,299
that's trapping the shrapnel
and forcing it in deeper.

455
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:54,967
[Misty] Did I miss the party?

456
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,846
Is that a gunshot wound?

457
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,390
I thought bullets couldn't hurt you.

458
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:02,891
Join the club.

459
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,978
Luke, who shot you?

460
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,063
I never saw him.

461
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:11,359
We were walking in Mount Morris Park.
The shot came out of nowhere.

462
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:14,528
Sniper.
Medium range.

463
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:16,780
I went with him in the ambulance,
but then the shooter attacked.

464
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:19,950
-We barely got out.
-The ambulance that got flipped over?

465
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:22,828
Well, then that's your alibi.

466
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:26,374
-Alibi?
-[cell phone vibrates]

467
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,208
Hello?

468
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:31,879
Yeah.

469
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:35,966
Okay.

470
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:39,136
Okay.

471
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,472
Thanks, Bailey.

472
00:28:46,352 --> 00:28:47,728
Luke Cage...

473
00:28:49,355 --> 00:28:52,525
you're under arrest
for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

474
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:54,943
You're kidding me.

475
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,200
Get down!

does that?

482
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,103
I got him!

483
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,156
I'm gonna go check it out.

484
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,616
Your backup isn't here yet.

485
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,203
When we get through this,
I'm still arresting your ass.

You okay?

488
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,756
Maybe she got him.

I see Carl's taste in women
hasn't changed.

504
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:07,993
He likes frizzy hair and a tight frame.

505
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:11,246
Carl? Who's Carl?
You mean Luke?

506
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:14,833
No, I mean Carl, Misty.

Oh, come on.
Aren't you gonna beg?

514
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:42,570
Not even a little bit?

515
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:47,491
If you're going to shoot me,
then do it.

516
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,202
Hmm.

517
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:53,330
[groaning] I have to go after him.

518

Help me up. [grunting]

[Luke] Stryker!

529
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:14,452
[Claire] Oh, my God.

530
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:20,709
Go.

531
00:33:20,793 --> 00:33:22,044
End this.

532
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:20,978
[Luke] Stryker?

533
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:26,274
Stryker!

534
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:33,741
[Stryker] You left me to rot, Carl.

535
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,163
We can work this out.

536
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:43,041
[Stryker] Work what out?
My life?

537
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:46,003
My mother destroying herself?

538
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:49,632
Being away for so long?

539
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,092
Nah.

540
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:55,888
There's nothing left to work out.

541
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:59,224
"I did not come to bring peace...

542
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:01,559
but a sword."

543
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:07,858
Ain't that what the great
Reverend James Lucas used to scream at us?

544
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:11,153
Preached peace and prosperity...

545
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:14,447
every Sunday on the pulpit,

546
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:17,367
but come Friday night on the sideline?

547
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,788
Nothing but fire and brimstone.

548
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:25,375
Guess he saved the sin
for Saturday night like everybody else.

549
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,837
And everybody else caught hell but you.

550
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:32,966
All the world's a stage
for the preacher's son...

551
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,093
and I was a quarterback.

552
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:38,764
And no matter how many passes I threw...

553
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,726
he was all about running the ball.

554
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:46,563
Because he wanted the game in your hands.

555
00:36:01,704 --> 00:36:03,246
Hello, Carl.

556
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:07,584
Willis.

557
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:09,795
I prefer Diamondback.

558
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:11,296
Because you're a snake...

559
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:14,174
just like Cottonmouth.

560
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,428
I am a snake.

561
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:22,725
I've shed my skin for something better.
Stronger.

562
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:26,228
You left me to rot, Carl...

563
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,772
in a gutter.

564
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:33,193
But I changed that sewer into a garden.

565
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,862
I wasn't a good friend.

566
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:37,823
I should've stood tall...

567
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:42,327
but I didn't.

568
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:44,705
And you paid the price.

569
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,342
I've been watching you.

570
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,097
Harlem doesn't realize
they're worshiping a false idol.

571
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,266
-False idol?
-You, Carl. You.

572
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,268
You're the golden calf.

573
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:08,979
But I got commandments for your ass.

574
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:11,356
I'm gonna bring the pain.

575
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:12,900
Reva's death?

576
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:14,401
Keep her name out of your mouth!

577
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:16,153
The crimes you went to jail for?

578
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:18,613
The torture you endured
once you were inside?

579
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:20,824
All me, I'm afraid.

580
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,743
Well, not Reva's death.

581
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:25,954
I just like saying her name
just to watch you squirm.

582
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,000
-You ruined my life.
-I gave you wings.

583
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,294
[voice breaking]
I sent you to hell...

584
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:36,089
and you come back with superpowers.

585
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:40,677
[inhales deeply]
Ain't that a bitch?

586
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:42,470
-[yelling]
-[gunshots]

587
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:48,143
[Stryker yelling]

588
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:03,325
[groans]

589
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:04,868
[grunts]

590
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,544
[both grunting]

591
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:29,184
[exhales]

592
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:32,520
[Stryker yelling]

593
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:41,363
[both panting]

594
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,288
[both grunting]

595
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:13,061
-[coughing]
-[straining]

596
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:16,398
[spits]

597
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,441
You're bleeding, Carl.

598
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,236
[grunts]

599
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:27,034
[clattering]

600
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:32,372
[Stryker yelling]

601
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,293
[grunting]

602
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:39,171
[gags]

603
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:58,273
-Cooper went at her for about an hour.
-What did she say?

604
00:39:58,356 --> 00:40:00,317
[Ridley] Not much of anything.
Nothing we need

605
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,277
in terms of finding Cage
or your attacker.

606
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,736
I got it from here.

607
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,907
-You're in no shape to talk to her.
-I'm fine!

608
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,116
Are you?

609
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:11,828
She'll talk to me, I promise.

610
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:13,455
We have rapport.

611
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,007
[sighs]

612
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:28,803
The attacker.
Who was he?

613
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:31,306
[sighs] I already told the other guy
I don't know.

614
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:35,978
You know, I helped you.
I helped your partner. Luke helped you.

615
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,563
-Why are you--
-Mmm-mmm. No, no, no.

616
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:41,399
The shooter, when he attacked,
what did he say?

617
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:43,651
What's his connection to Luke?
Did Luke say?

618
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:46,904
[sighs] You know, it's a blur.

619
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:48,573
Who's Carl?

620
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:52,369
Look, it is critical that I find Luke.

621
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,412
So why aren't you outside
looking for him?

622
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:56,206
Why won't you help me find him?

623
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:58,166
-I want a lawyer.
-Why?

624
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,876
You're not under arrest.

625
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,836
But I can do that.
I can arrest you.

626
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:03,588
For what?

627
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,382
Cottonmouth's dead
and you gave Luke an alibi.

628
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,592
That's accessory to murder.
That's hard time.

629
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:11,388
I'm not scared of you.
I did nothing wrong.

630
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:15,225
That son of a bitch
is out there hurting people.

631
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:19,479
But you won't do anything
to bring Luke Cage in and end this.

632
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:21,189
I'm out of here.

633
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:22,815
Sit your ass down!

634
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:27,320
Now, people have been
walking out on me all day.

635
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:30,532
No more lies
and no more deception.

636
00:41:30,615 --> 00:41:33,910
You are going to tell me what happened
and where I can find Luke.

637
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:36,079
Back off.

638
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:37,580
What, you think just because
you got jumped

639
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:38,915
by a psycho and lost your gun,

640
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:40,292
you get to talk to me like that?

641
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,544
-Do your job.
-What do you know about the job?

642
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:44,504
You're either too weak
to stand up to pressure,

643
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:46,464
or too stupid to see
that Luke is innocent.

644
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:49,176
You probably couldn't find
your own ass with both hands.

645
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,931
Who's weak now, huh? Huh?

646
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:56,474
[door opens]

647
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:57,559
[Claire grunts]

648
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:00,978
Detective Knight.

649
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,858
I apologize for how
you've been treated, Ms. Temple.

650
00:42:05,942 --> 00:42:08,111
Would you like to press charges
against Detective Knight?

651
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:10,863
[Claire scoffs] Please.

652
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:14,242
Luke Cage is innocent, Misty.

653
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:17,120
You're after the wrong man.

654
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:20,457
That's my statement.
Write it down.

655
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,501
Look, Inspector, I, um...

656
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,177
[breathing heavily]

657
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,511
Willis!

658
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:01,956
You done good, baby girl.

659
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:04,084
I know you were uncomfortable.

660
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:07,462
I didn't like your cousin,

661
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:09,256
and I would never sleep with him.

662
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:14,344
But now I'm on record with that.

663
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:17,347
I'm not a whore.

664
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,848
No, you're not a whore.

665
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,934
You're a businesswoman.

666
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:27,023
And that, in your lap,
represents a chance to change your life...

667
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,111
and that of your whole family.

668
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:33,738
That's power.

669
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:40,162
Did Luke really do all of that?

670
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:46,000
You never really know
what anyone is capable of.

671
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,631
[sighs] Go on, get some rest.

672
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:55,135
You'll come back to the club
in a few days when it opens.

673
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,483
[Shades] You think it worked?

674
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:14,821
She's a good girl.
She won't fold.

675
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,282
What if she does?

676
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:20,910
We'll have to kill her.

677
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:24,121
And everybody else in that apartment.

678
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:26,040
Make it look like a home invasion...

679
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,793
which would be a damn shame.

680
00:44:29,877 --> 00:44:32,214
You know, Duke Ellington
used to live in that building.

681
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:34,090
And Count Basie, too.

682
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:38,261
I'd hate to bring down the market value.

683
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:41,764
[Shades] That's my girl.

684
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,777
[sighs]

685
00:45:03,828 --> 00:45:05,705
I'm not like you.

686
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:23,806
[Stryker] Carl!

687
00:45:35,693 --> 00:45:38,571
They call this bullet the Judas.

688
00:45:40,698 --> 00:45:43,410
You barely survived the first blast.

689
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:47,121
You won't survive the second.

690
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:53,210
Any last words?

691
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:55,254
Willis...

692
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:58,257
I'm sorry.

693
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:02,219
You don't have to do this.

694
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:05,307
I loved you like a brother.

695
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:08,225
Nigga...

696
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,020
I am your brother.

697
00:46:16,484 --> 00:46:18,110
[grunts]

698
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:24,492
[bullet whirring]

699
00:46:44,053 --> 00:46:46,055
[funk music playing]
