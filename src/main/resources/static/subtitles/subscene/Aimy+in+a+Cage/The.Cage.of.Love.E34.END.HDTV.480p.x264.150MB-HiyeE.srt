The Cage of Love

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,260
<i>Episode 34</i>

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,090
Tell me then.

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,740
What should I use to make you talk?

5
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,440
Why don't we try this needle

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,320
and see if you will talk?

7
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,480
Tell me about the secret formula now

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,940
and I will let you live.

9
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,980
Dream on.

10
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,850
If it doesn't belong to you, it won't.

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,660
You will never be able to get the secret formula.

12
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,300
Does it hurts?

13
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,570
It hurts.

14
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,650
I believe now that

15
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,620
you really don't have the secret formula.

16
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,500
<i>For you, in the future, you can teach him too.</i>

17
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,170
<i>So, we were actually friends.</i>

18
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,950
<i>It will be a beautiful cycle of reincarnation.</i>

19
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,530
<i>Remember what you told me.</i>

20
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,920
<i>You will never make me regret</i>

21
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,380
<i>by handing Cai Hong to you.</i>

22
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:27,420
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

23
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:35,650
Shao Tian. Is something troubling you?

24
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,370
No. Don't guess blindly.

25
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,790
Here, have more food.

26
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,010
Shao Tian. I'm your mother. Don't lie to me.

27
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,840
Even though you don't want to say anything,

28
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,340
I know that you have something on your mind.

29
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,260
Mom. You must believe me.

30
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,110
Look...

31
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,520
all these years,

32
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,960
I already experienced what I should experience.

33
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,450
My hard work has paid off.

34
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,360
I have loved.

35
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,370
Earned love.

36
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,260
After letting it go, I finally understood the choice you and Dad made.

37
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,570
Sometimes when you hold it tightly and don't let go,

38
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,330
it doesn't mean that it's good for the other party.

39
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:46,900
When one choses to left go and leave, perhaps, it's another way to love.

40
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,270
Staying together is a kind comfort,

41
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,800
letting go is difficult.

42
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,250
Dad chose another method

43
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,360
to protect us.

44
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,350
All these years,

45
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,490
I didn't do well.

46
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,030
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,200
Shao Tian, let's not talk about this.

48
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,130
Eat.

49
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,300
Tonight,

50
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,770
I'm going out to settle some matters. I may be home a bit late.

51
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,070
Sleep early and don't wait for me.

52
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,340
It's almost time, I should leave now.

53
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,080
Mom, take your time eating.

54
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,100
Shao Tian.

55
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,030
Be careful.

56
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,030
Don't worry.

57
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,010
Mr Jiang, you are punctual.

58
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,070
Did you bring anyone else here?

59
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,680
Don't worry. I came alone.

60
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,690
Mr Jiang, let's go then.

61
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,770
Go.

62
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,880
You two, stay here and keep watch. Check if we are being followed.

63
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,360
Yes.

64
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,030
Speed up.

65
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,930
Let's go.

66
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,630
Old Master.

67
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:57,780
Please protect Cai Hong and Yu Er. Let them come back safely.

68
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,440
- Mom, Madam.
- Don't stop me.

69
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,040
- Mom, don't do this.
- Dont stop me.

70
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,770
Let's talk in a civilised manner.

71
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,760
- Mom.
- Madam Jiang.

72
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,480
I heard that Cai Hong has been kidnapped. Is this true?

73
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,750
Madam Wu. Let's talk calmly.

74
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,820
It's true.

75
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,690
Mom, get up now.

76
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,880
Madam Jiang. I know that the Jiang family hates us.

77
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,710
My husband has wronged you

78
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,010
but Cai Hong is a kind and good girl.

79
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,510
She is really sincere in paying for her father's crimes.

80
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,950
She's really seeking your forgiveness.

81
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,160
Madam Wu. What are you doing? Get up.

82
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,920
- Get up now.
- Madam Jiang, I'm begging you.

83
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,320
I'm begging you to save Cai Hong.

84
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,650
I know that the kidnappers want the Jiang family's secret formula.

85
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,090
I also know that the secret formula is very important to your founders.

86
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,470
But this child didn't do anything wrong.

87
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,300
She didn't sin. If she made any mistakes

88
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,440
I don't want to live anymore.

89
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,670
Madam Jiang. I'm begging you. Please save my sister.

90
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,820
My sister didn't do anything wrong.

91
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,520
Madam Wu. Yu Er has already taken the secret formula to save Cai Hong.

92
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,230
- Really?
- Yes, get up now.

93
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,930
Really? Jiang Yu went to save her?

94
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,440
It's true.

95
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,680
That's great.

96
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,360
Madam Wu. Even though the secret formula is important

97
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,370
no matter what, our children are more important.

98
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:51,820
If at this time, I don't hand over the secret formula, am I still a human?

99
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,520
Madam Jiang. Thank you very much.

100
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,000
- Enough.
- Thank you very much.

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,710
Thank you, Madam Jiang.

102
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,130
It's late and I called you here

103
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,590
because we need to undertake a special mission.

104
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,560
The motive is to save Jiang Wu and Wu Cai Hong.

105
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,640
Everyone, listen carefully. One part of the team will start from here.

106
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,300
The second team will start from here.

107
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,640
We'll meet in the middle.

108
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,230
Remember this. The people we are going against tonight

109
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,000
may have heavy weapons.

110
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,900
It's extremely dangerous. You must be very careful.

111
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,590
Get ready to set off.

112
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,240
Hurry up.

113
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,050
We are back again. Didn't we just pass here?

114
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,510
Did we take the wrong path?

115
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,470
I...

116
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,610
We are almost done.

117
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,480
When we tell you to walk, just walk. Cut the crap.

118
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,460
Go now.

119
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,370
You two stay here. We are leaving.

120
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,540
Yes.

121
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,310
Quick, after them.

122
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,520
Quick.

123
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,610
Watch carefully.

124
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,400
Come here.

125
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,400
Don't move.

126
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,360
Let's go, quick.

127
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,380
Kneel down.

128
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,430
- Speak now.
- I will talk.

129
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,520
Take them over there and check if there is anyone else.

130
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,460
Yes. You both, go over there. You two, come with me.

131
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,070
Director. We already searched. There is no one else here.

132
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,510
Come here. Where is Jiang Yu?

133
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,810
He's not here. It's only just me.

134
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,710
I'm telling the truth.

135
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,420
Kneel down.

136
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,360
Before Jiang Yu left, he told me that he would leave some markers.

137
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,250
Did he tell you what the markers are?

138
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,250
He only said to bring this along.

139
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,850
Listen carefully.

140
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,480
Use your torchlights and check

141
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,260
if there are any special markers.

142
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,010
Director Chen.

143
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,230
There is phosphor.

144
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,490
What are you looking at? Let's go.

145
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,110
It's not honest.

146
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,060
Mr Zhou.

147
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,850
Following this florescent path, we have circled the path a few times.

148
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,110
What I see here is that it isn't pink enough anymore.

149
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,640
Mr Zhou, there again is phosphor over here.

150
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,630
What should we do?

151
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,920
Let's do this.

152
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,410
Let's not waste any time. There are only two paths.

153
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,690
You go there and I will go here.

154
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,250
Junior Superintendent, make the arrangements.

155
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,900
Yes.

156
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,400
Let's split.

157
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,290
Okay.

158
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,120
The rest, follow me. Come, buddies.

159
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,710
Over there.

160
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,540
Go in.

161
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,680
Cai Hong.

162
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,400
Cai Hong.

163
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,610
Cai Hong.

164
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,760
Cai Hong.

165
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,960
Cai Hong. Don't be afraid, I'm here.

166
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,170
Why are you here?

167
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,390
Of course, I would come.

168
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,720
If I were captured by someone,

169
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,150
wouldn't you come and save me too?

170
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,290
I was used to lure you.

171
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,290
Even if you came,

172
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,320
Lu Man will never release us.

173
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,040
Don't be afraid.

174
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,840
This is really touching.

175
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,080
Seeing the two of you like this.

176
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,280
If this continues on, it will really make me believe that there is love in this world.

177
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,750
So, it's you.

178
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,600
It's me.

179
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,610
Mr Jiang, now that you see

180
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,900
hand over the secret formula to me.

181
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,400
The secret formula is here.

182
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,900
I can give it to you but you must ensure the safety of Cai Hong.

183
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,330
You must not give it to her. This is from your founder. You must protect this.

184
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,160
Don't do this.

185
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,010
Enough.

186
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,180
The two of you are now my Zushang fish. <i>you are my prisoners.</i>

187
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,240
What right do you have to discuss terms with me?

188
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,280
Mr Jiang. I won't look at the secret formula you are holding in your hand.

189
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,060
Who knows if it's real or fake?

190
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,050
Thus, please dye a piece of cloth for me now

191
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,210
to prove if it's real.

192
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,030
Uncle Lai, prepare a few brushes.

193
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:00,150
Record Mr Jiang's each and every step.

194
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,820
Yes.

195
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,670
Let's go.

196
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:31,330
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

197
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,100
Are you really going to give her the secret formula?

198
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,760
Don't be afraid.

199
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Trust me.

200
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,310
Because this hasn't ended, it may not be a bad ending yet.

201
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,210
What if the ending is bad?

202
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,170
Even if the ending is bad,

203
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,650
we will still die together, right?

204
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,440
You are really foolish.

205
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,040
Enough.

206
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,640
Your time is imminent.

207
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,700
Dye it now.

208
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,860
It's only one garment. It won't take long love.

209
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,220
Come.

210
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,390
Director. This path is not right.

211
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,560
Go back now. Quick.

212
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,580
Ahead.

213
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,340
Director. It's Xiao Shi and Kang Zi.

214
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,760
It's dangerous here now.

215
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,140
Leave now.

216
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,800
Ke Ke. We already tried it.

217
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,310
The colour doesn't run.

218
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,620
<i>Thank you.</i>

219
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,240
<i>Man Man.</i>

220
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,350
<i>Man Man, are you okay?</i>

221
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,280
<i>Mom.</i>

222
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,440
<i>I want to grow up soon.</i>

223
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,560
<i>I want to grow up.</i>

224
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,330
<i>Man Man. You want to grow up.</i>

225
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:11,390
<i>It's because you want to be able to wear my clothes soon. Isn't that so?</i>

226
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,490
<i>My Man Man. Think about it.</i>

227
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,860
<i>If you were to grow up,</i>

228
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,920
<i>when the time comes, you will be old like me.</i>

229
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,700
<i>My mom will never grow old.</i>

230
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,180
<i>My mom will never grow old.</i>

231
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,270
<i>Mom.</i>

232
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,170
<i>You smell very nice.</i>

233
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,700
This is the feeling.

234
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,120
This is really the secret formula.

235
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,110
You already know the secret formula.

236
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,210
Can we leave now?

237
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,390
Since you have already decided to die together,

238
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,100
do you still need to leave here?

239
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,120
Let's go.

240
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,050
Don't move.

241
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,800
- Cai Hong.
-Jiang Yu.

242
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,000
Lu Man. You are too despicable.

243
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,760
I just want to be ruthless.

244
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,110
I'm not like your father.

245
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,170
I'll be lenient and let you go to the Jiang home early.

246
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,720
Otherwise we will experience Jiang Yu's revenge.

247
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,110
There won't be today either.

248
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,710
Ke Ke!

249
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,080
Leave now. Ke Ke.

250
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,450
Zhou Shao Tian.

251
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,040
Brother Shao Tian.

252
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,940
So how? Are you okay?

253
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,080
Be careful.

254
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,690
Uncle Lai. How are you?

255
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,120
So how? Are you okay?

256
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,670
I'm fine.

257
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,270
Uncle Lai.

258
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,790
Uncle Lai, don't die.

259
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,790
You promised me that

260
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,410
you would take care of me forever.

261
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,790
You promised me that you would take care of me forever.

262
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,710
I'm begging you.

263
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,840
If you leave, what would I do?

264
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,630
Can you bear it?

265
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,250
Brother Shao Tian.

266
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,790
Uncle Lai.

267
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,790
I will take revenge for you.

268
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,690
Come out.

269
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,600
Come out.

270
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,740
Come out.

271
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,780
Quick.

272
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,970
Stop there.

273
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,400
Kneel down.

274
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,640
Are you okay?

275
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,950
Come out.

276
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,980
What's wrong?

277
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,990
Police!

278
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,780
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

279
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,970
Take them away now.

280
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,940
Quick, let's go.

281
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,310
Leave.

282
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,800
I will bomb you to death!

283
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,590
Quick!

284
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,840
Jiang Yu!

285
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,770
I will bomb you to death!

286
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,640
Brother Shao Tian.

287
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,670
Let go.

288
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:01,370
- Brother Shao Tian.
- What are you doing here? Why aren't you protecting Cai Hong?

289
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,900
Let's go.

290
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,310
Brother Shao Tian!

291
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,630
Shao Tian!

292
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,890
Jiang Yu!

293
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,630
Shao Tian!

294
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,170
Brother Shao Tian!

295
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,540
Let me go.

296
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,590
Don't!

297
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,570
Jiang Yu!
- Don't!

298
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,890
- You are awake?
- How is Brother Shao Tian?

299
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,300
The doctor said that you can't move around. Go back and rest first.

300
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,560
I'm going to look for him.

301
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,470
- Sit down first.
- Let me look for him.

302
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,440
Listen to me. Let me finish first.

303
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,180
- I want to find Brother Shao Tian.
- Listen to me. Don't move around.

304
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:25,570
- Cai Hong, listen to me.
- He is already dead.

305
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,540
Sorry, Cai Hong.

306
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,610
That can't be.

307
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,970
Cai Hong, don't be like this.

308
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,920
Cai Hong, listen to me. You must be strong.

309
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,500
Cai Hong, don't be like this.

310
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,860
Cai Hong, don't be like this.

311
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,570
You must be strong.

312
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,340
I couldn't do anything at all.

313
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:12,970
You must continue to live.

314
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,430
Don't let Shao Tian sacrifice his life for nothing.

315
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,340
Cai Hong.

316
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,220
Brother Shao Tian. I'm here to visit you.

317
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,120
Do you still remember

318
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,230
what you told me?

319
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,090
If you could turn back time,

320
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,210
you don't where you will go back to.

321
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,130
If you really could start over

322
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,230
I rather I never met you.

323
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,710
This way,

324
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,340
you will be able to live well.

325
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,290
But we already met.

326
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,270
I want to thank you

327
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,180
for always doting on me.

328
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,410
For letting me feel the tenderness

329
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,710
and being very blessed.

330
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,320
Thank you.

331
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,250
Thank you.

332
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,270
Shao Tian.

333
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,510
What I promised you,

334
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,990
I will definitely do it.

335
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,830
Don't worry.

336
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,870
It's my fault.

337
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,180
I harmed Brother Shao Tian.

338
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,990
It's because of me.

339
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,010
Aunt.

340
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,700
I'm sorry.

341
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,880
Child.

342
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,260
This was Shao Tian's own choice.

343
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,110
I think he will be very happy to use another way to protect you.

344
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,810
Aunt, don't worry.

345
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:33,170
In the future, I will definitely

346
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,910
treat you like my mother.

347
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,880
I will be filial to you on behalf of Brother Shao Tian.

348
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,830
To serve you.

349

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

350
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,250
Is this for me?

351
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,390
Of course.

352
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,890
Do you like it?

353
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,100
It's such a beautiful necklace.

354
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,010
My mom just said the same thing.

355
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,560
If Aunt likes this, you should give it to her.

356
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,930
- If not, she won't be happy.
- Who says so?

357
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:15,970
She even asked me why I took such a long time to give this to you?

358
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,880
If you are all like this, it will be hard for me.

359
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,970
Who's making it hard for you?

360
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:25,800
Did you know when my mom said that to me, Aunt Wu and Aunt Zhou were there too?

361
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,570
They were both talking about me.

362
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,690
What did they say?

363
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,840
In any way, them all living together, they all share the same voice.

364
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,560
I still have a surprise for you.

365
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,620
What is it?

366
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,160
I'm taking you to a place.

367
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,860
Where are we going?

368
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,840
Where exactly are we going? Just tell me.

369
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,710
Don't ask anymore. You will find out later.

370
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,890
Why isn't there anyone in the factory today?

371
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,830
That's right. I gave them the day off.

372
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,520
Is this your surprise?

373
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,690
Is this considered a surprise?

374
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,960
Of course, it's a surprise.

375
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,730
Only when there is a special day at the factory can the employees take leave.

376
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,620
It's really very beautiful.

377
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,590
I finally understand now.

378
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,810
Everything can be let go.

379
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,440
♫<i> So long, I have waited for so long... </i>♫

380
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,380
Including the pain betrayals and revenge.

381
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,580
Even if it's life or death.

382
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,320
♫<i> Waited for your love to bloom. </i>♫

383
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,910
But you are the only one whom I can't let go.

384
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:18,610
♫<i> Desperately, I was desperately struggling to find... </i>♫

385
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,370
If I see you in pain,

386
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:25,000
I will be in more pain than you.

387
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,300
When I see you smile,

388
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,200
I'm happier than you.

389
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,060
I think

390
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,550
this is what love is.

391
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,040
♫<i> but did not ask you whether I was your fated love. </i>♫

392
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,920
♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

393
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,300
So, I told myself that

394
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,920
♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

395
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,410
I must protect you for the rest of my life.

396
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:54,160
♫<i> In the end I did not get your heart. </i>♫

397
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,600
♫<i> I'm not willing to give up (the love), but I can't have it either. </i>♫

398
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:07,140
♫<i> I fight a bitter battle between advancing and retreating. </i>♫

399
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:13,470
♫<i> I didn't see through to your eyes or heart </i>♫

400
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:19,200
♫<i> but I've already fallen in love with your tenderness. </i>♫

401
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,370
Cai Hong.

402
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,350
Marry me, okay?

403
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:39,770
♫<i> Gently, I gently tried to inquire </i>♫

404
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:46,080
♫<i> but did not ask you whether I was your fated love. </i>♫

405
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:52,560
♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

406
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:59,280
♫<i> In the end I did not get your heart. </i>♫

407
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:07,800
♫<i> I'm not willing to give up (the love), but I can't have it either. </i>♫

408
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,330

409
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:20,570

412
