Don't bother yourself with this.

21
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,420
What arrangements? I didn't see any.

22
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,090
She's making your mind restless!

23
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,900
Brother. Don't forget

24
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,710
how father died and mom fell sick.

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,750
I'm calculating it in my head.

26
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,920
I don't need you to teach me what to do. Go back to work.

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,260
I have already done this.

28
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,320
<i>I wonder how Uncle Fu is doing lately.</i>

29
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,320
<i>I deserve to die. I even forgot about this.</i>

30
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,330
It's time to eat. Come.

31
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,640
<i>Let's eat. It's time to eat.</i>

32
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,070
<i>Everyone , come over and eat.</i>

33
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,350
- Is anyone there? <br>- Coming.

34
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,520
- Miss. <br>- Uncle Fu.

35
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,780
I won't trouble you. I still need to go back to the factory to work.

36
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,570
I came over to visit you. These are snacks.

37
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,110
Dan Ke!

38
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,920
Miss is here. Greet her now.

39
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,760
- Dad. <br>- No need.

40
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,690
Hello, Miss.

41
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,760
I'm fine.

42
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,850
Miss. You are really our great saviour.

43
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,880
I'm not a saviour. Actually, I'm really sorry for last time.

44
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,480
Thus, I specially came here to ask if you had found a new job.

45
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,850
Miss, didn't you already arrange for Dan Ke to work at Ling Long?

46
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,280
You are really a saviour to our family.

47
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,590
Look.

48
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,530
You didn't blame me for my mistake and even got Dan Ke a job. I can grow old without worries.

49
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:35,350
I really don't understand how I could have secured Dan Ke a job if my own position is still unstable.

50
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,940
Other than you, who would treat us that well?

51
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,020
<i>Could it be Shao Tian?</i>

52
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,970
- Mom, look! <br> - That's not good, it's so dirty!

53
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,930
Cai Yue. What do you think of this dress?

54
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,670
It's very pretty.

55
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,680
- Mom. <br>- Why did you stop me?

56
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,280
Don't go in. It's not like you don't know that we can't afford these things now.

57
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,360
- Can't I just take a look? <br>- You can't.

58
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,880
- Just a glance. <br>- No.

59
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,270
One glance.

60
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,880
Just a glance.

61
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,980
- Let's go. <br>- Mom.

62
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,610
- Mom, don't go in. <br>- We are already in.

63
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,910
Let's take a look first.

64
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,040
Get a cup of tea for me.

65
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,280
Look at this. Isn't it beautiful?

66
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,940
It looks especially nice.

67
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,430
It's really nice.

68
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,990
Look.

69
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,740
Look at the embroidery...

70
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,170
Isn't this Madam Wu from Ling Long?

71
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,100
I said the wrong thing.

72
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,860
It should be Mrs Jiang.

73
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,570
Madam Zhang, you are here.

74
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,330
- Madam Zhang.<br>- What nonsense are you spouting? We own a factory and

75
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,140
our business is big.

76
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,130
We have made enough money and are tired.

77
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,500
We want to take a break.

78
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,320
Enjoy life!

79
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,570
Miss, don't say anymore.

80
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,940
Madam Wu. This dress is very expensive.

81
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,770
It can easily get snagged on something!

82
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,730
That's right. This dress

83
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,210
was specially prepared for Madam Zhang.

84
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,100
That's right. If you want to buy this, you wouldn't be able to afford it.

85
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,680
- Just don't touch anything. <br>- That's right.

86
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,170
Who says I can't afford it?

87
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,730
I like this very much. I'm buying this today. Wrap it up.

88
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,110
- Mom. <br>- Xiao Lin.

89
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,840
Wrap up this dress for me.

90
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,510
Yes, Madam Zhang.

91
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,020
Give it to me.

92
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,280
Mom, let go.

93
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,760
- Mom! <br>- Forget it.

94
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,670
The dress depends on who the owner is.

95
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,150
With your identity, this dress doesn't suit you.

96
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,920
Who says that it doesn't suit me?

97
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,820
What's so great about you? In the past, you were trailing behind me.

98
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,780
- What are you acting like right now? <br> - What kind of person are you?!

99
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,980
Madame Zhao, don't mind her!

100
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,180
- It's not worth it. <br>- Who do you think you are?

101
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,330
Do you think you are still Madam Wu of the past?

102
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:18,300
You have no factory, no money, and no house! I'm being polite by calling you Madam!

103
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,200
Who says I don't have any money? I can't even spend what I have.

104
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,640
- You must be dreaming. <br>- Why did you push me?

105
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,340
So what if I push you?

106
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,300
Your husband is already dead and you still want to dress well? Who's going to look at you?

107
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,270
I know now. It must be for that Zhou Shao Tian.

108
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,340
That Zhou Shao Tian is really something, going around with you three people!

109
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,710
What are you talking about? So shameless. <br>What has it got to do with my daughter?

110
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,470
- So what if I say that about you? <br>- Nonsense!

111
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,250
- Who's spouting nonsense <br>- Who's spouting nonsense?

112
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,140
I'm going to hit you today.

113
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,950
- I'm going to hit you! <br>- Mom!

114
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,440
- Who says you can spout nonsense? <br>- Stop fighting.

115
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,310
- Mom... <br>- Leave now.

116
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,030
Don't shut the door.

117
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,320
Mom, forget it. Don't be so angry.

118
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,840
I'm furious. I have never been this furious before.

119
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,110
Just wait and see. Wait until I'm living well.

120
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,430
I will be back to see you kneel in front of me and beg.

121
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,290
Mom. They have poor taste.

122
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,720
Don't argue with them anymore.

123
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,530
Let's go home now.

124
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,490
Look. Your hair is a mess.

125
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,770
So embarrassing. Let's leave now.

126
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,130
Listen well, daughter. It's up to you whether I can vent my anger in this lifetime.

127
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,880
Mom. What can I do?

128
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,050
You fool.

129
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,870
Youth? Youth is an asset.

130
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,560
Look at you now. You are so beautiful.

131
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,920
You have to find a man with money and power. Help me vent my anger.

132
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,450
Don't be like your sister! That Zhou Shao Tian,

133
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,940
he's so poor.

134
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,770
When I talk about him, I feel so frustrated.

135
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,550
Don't be angry. Actually, I think Brother Shao Tian is a good man.

136
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,110
Mom. Why did you hit me?

137
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,330
Can't I hit you? Just like your sister.

138
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,280
Seriously.

139
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,310
- You are so hateful. <br>- You are hateful.

140
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,210
Let's go. So hateful.

141
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,780
Miss.

142
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,320
- Hello, Miss <br>- Don't call me this anymore.

143
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
It's still the same.

144
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,760
Where is Uncle Fu's son working now?

145
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,990
That guy might not be very smart, but he's pretty strong.

146
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,980
He's in the warehouse.

147
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,510
Go back to work then.

148
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,400
I will teach you how to carry goods today.

149
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,330
Look carefully. I will demonstrate it to you.

150
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,960
Kneel down first.

151
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,800
Grab the rope.

152
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,460
Put it on your shoulder.

153
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,910
Come.

154
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,480
Get up slowly.

155
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,340
Use your shoulder to lift it.

156
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,650
These are very heavy, you have to bend your back.

157
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,510
You won't get hurt this way. Try it.

158
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,370
Not this way.

159
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,490
Bend down first so that you won't get hurt.

160
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,970
Get up slowly.

161
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,690
It's okay. Let's do it again.

162
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,960
Okay.

163
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,680
Are you hungry?

164
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,690
Here. Wipe your sweat.

165
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,530
- Okay. <br>- I will take you to have a feast later. Okay?

166
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,010
- Okay. <br>- Okay. What do you like to eat?

167
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:50,860
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

168
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,240
What's wrong?

169
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,880
Thank you.

170
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,910
For what?

171
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,460
Thank you for helping the Fu family.

172
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,700
I'm not concerned about him.

173
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,530
I just pity him.

174
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,480
As for you, don't be so sweet with your words.

175
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,280
You will very quickly regret thanking me.

176
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,520
I'm not surprised that you say that.

177
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,050
Its because I am ready any time.

178
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,840
You are not afraid?

179
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,860
You should be the one who's afraid.

180
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,780
Harming someone is just like harming yourself.

181
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,400
You don't need to worry about this.

182
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Go out.

183
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,550
Wu Cai Hong.

184
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,960
I'm warning you.

185
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,590
You don't need to be concerned about my brother.

186
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,400
If you plan to remain here at Ling Long,

187
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,030
you will definitely regret it.

188
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,850
Perhaps, the person who will regret it is not me.

189
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,860
Do you know that

190
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,070
people like you who are full of yourself... other people find you very hateful.

191
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,540
I don't need anyone to like me.

192
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,440
Don't say that I didn't advise you.

193
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,620
My brother is a good person. But to you,

194
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,750
he is a monster.

195
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,100
There will come a day when he will make you miserable.

196
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,020
Thank you for your advice.

197
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,450
I will personally watch you fall into despair.

198
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,530
You're wrong, I was already in a pit of despair.

199
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,970
Thus, the one who will fall won't be me.

200
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,880
It will be you both.

Wu Hong Da's daughter, Wu Cai Hong, has risen to a high position under Jiang Yu!

00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,750
Wish them a good future relationship!

206
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,340
Wait. What did you say?

207
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,780
Give me one.

208
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,700
- Here. <br>- Thanks.

209
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:27,590
Headline, Headline! Wu Hong Da's daughter, Wu Cai Hong...

210
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,970
This wench has been hiding from me.

211
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,560
Cao Hong, you are back.

212
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,270
Look at you. Why do you look so tired?

213
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,320
A girl should put on more make-up

214
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,000
and have a trendier hairstyle.

215
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,800
Your identity is different now.

216
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,320
You can't be so casual anymore.

217
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,020
What kind of identity do I have now?

218
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,820
Look at you. You don't need to feel bad anymore. You are even hiding it from me.

219
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,200
Look. Everyone in Huzhou already knows.

220
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,940
I definitely agree and give you my consent to be with Jiang Yu.

221
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,030
Aunt, don't believe this rumour.

222
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,560
This child. In terms of wealth and appearances,

223
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,730
he may have nothing to say.

224
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,280
Don't just choose anyone. Don't tell me you are going to choose that poor guy, Zhou Shao Tian?

225
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,110
Who says so?

226
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,910
If it wasn't for Jiang Yu, would our family have come to this state?

227
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:38,120
You must not say this. The police already investigated and said that he's not the killer.

228
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,100
If you talk about him acquiring Ling Long, then, in the future, you can be Mrs Jiang.

229
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,840
Ling Long will belong to you too.

230
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,390
How can you think like this! If you want to push me to the enemy,

231
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,310
you should ask my father in heaven!

232
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,180
How could you say this?

233
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,760
How could you not understand? I'm doing this for our family.

234
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,430
I only want you and your sister to live a good life and find a good man.

235
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,350
What's wrong with Jiang Yu? What are you still not satisfied with?

236
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,020
What's with wealth and power? Are you living just for wealth?!

237
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,020
After father passed away, I haven't seen you do anything for him!

238
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,890
Sis, Mom. What are you doing?

239
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,300
No matter what, I'm still your stepmother.

240
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,280
I don't need you to teach me.

241
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,320
Stop there.

242
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,210
Cai Hong.

243
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,760
Cai Hong. What's wrong with you?

244
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,630
Look at your face.

245
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,270
Wasn't everything going well? Why did you start fighting?

246
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,380
I'm fine.

247
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,810
My aunt just talks without thinking. I won't take her words to heart.

248
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,980
You're always like this, always carrying the burdens by yourself.

249
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,900
I already told you that I can help you to shoulder your burdens

250
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,640
Although I'm still thankful to Madam Wu.

251
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,940
Why?

252
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,440
By doing that, she let me reflect a lot on myself.

253
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,940
I have alway been someone didn't dare to make any decisions.

254
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:29,700
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

255
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,820
I think that this is a declaration of war, not a resignation letter.

256
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,730
It's good that you know.

257
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,960
Whatever harm you caused Cai Hong, I will give it back to you.

258
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,620
I will be waiting.

259
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,390
Starting from now, I will do everything to protect Cai Hong

260
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,420
and make you leave Ling Long. I will make you unable to continue your dyeing industry in Huzhou.

261
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,520
I will also find the evidence that you killed Boss Wu.

262
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,890
Don't let me be disappointed in you.

263
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,330
Goodbye.

264
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,820
Cai Hong, come here.

265
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
It's just ahead.

266
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,080
Brother Shao Tian. Where are we going?

267
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,610
Close your eyes first.

268
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Close your eyes first.

269
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,870
Okay, I will close my eyes. Tell me where we are going.

270
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,740
Okay.

271
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,490
Wait.

272
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,050
Be careful. Don't make me trip.

273
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,130
Don't go anywhere else. Just follow me.

274
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,280
We will be there soon.

275
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,640
- Don't open your eyes. <br>- We are not there yet?

276
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,710
We will be there soon.

277
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,580
We are here.

278
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,970
Don't move.

279
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,290
Brother Shao Tian. Can I open my eyes now?

280
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,080
Okay.

281
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,060
Open your eyes now.

282
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,300
It's yours?

283
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,090
- Is this for real? <br>- Yes.

284
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,770
But where did you get the money from?

285
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,990
It's from the bank.

286
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,060
It's great that you are able to start your own shop. I'm happy for you.

287
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,510
You are right. This shop doesn't only belong to me.

288
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,640
It's yours too.

289
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,530
It should make us happy.

290
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,980
I didn't help you at all.

291
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,490
It's just a small shop now

292
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,070
but I believe that with our hard work,

293
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,420
we can quickly pay off all our debt.

294
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:30,250
There will come a day with Fu Sheng will be like Ling Long. Moreover, it will also surpass Ling Long.

295
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,130
Brother Shao Tian. Do you know that I have always had a guilty conscious?

296
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,680
I dragged you down and caused you to leave Ling Long.

297
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,340
I didn't imagine that you would start a small shop on your own when you left Ling Long.

298
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,990
I'm really very happy.

299
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,720
Thanks.

300
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,730
By the way, I will operate my shop tomorrow. I hope that you would come.

301
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,190
Of course. I will take leave and come here.

302
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,100
The rest are not important. It's more that important that you will be there alone.

303
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,790
Me alone?

304
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:12,230
I was just joking. I really need a hand now. I hope that you will come over and help me.

305
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,370
I can't leave Ling Long now.

306
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,060
Why?

307
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,020
Is it because of your father's case?

308
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,520
Even if many people forgot about it, I won't.

309
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,100
Father fell to his death in front of my eyes. If I don't get to the bottom of this,

310
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,960
I won't feel assured.

311
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,520
Aso that I can find out the truth, I can't leave Ling Long.

312
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,720
But I'm worried about you staying with Ling Long.

313
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,660
Why would you worry?

314
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,180
Jiang Yu doesn't have a hold on me, he won't do anything to me.

315
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,040
Don't worry about me.

316
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,770
Okay.

317
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,980
I respect your decision

318
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,290
but Fu Sheng and I will wait for you.

319
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,310
You are welcome to come back anytime.

320
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,700
Thanks.

321
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,270
Thank you too.

322
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,910
<i>-Congratulations. <br> -This way, please.</i>

323
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,570
<i>- May you prosper. <br>- Please take a look around.</i>

324
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,930
<i>I hope your business prospers.</i>

325
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,300
<i>Please look around.</i>

326
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:10,920
Boss Jiang. I would like to take time off. I'm going out at noon.

327
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,540
You still need to memorise over thirty types of flowers.

328
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,990
Manage your time.

329
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,730
I know. I will be back.

330
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,490
You are not allowed to go.

331
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,940
But you already gave me your consent this morning.

332
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:31,010
It's because I just found out that today is the opening of Fu Sheng.

333
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,480
I don't care whether you agree now or not, I'm going.

334
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,750
Fu Sheng won't last for long. It will be a waste of time for you to go.

335
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,590
Are you really going to be like this?

336
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,970
You are really so petty.

337
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,350
I just remembered that I have a party to go to as well.

338
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:57,260
If you want to go that much, if you don't mind, you can go with a petty person like me.

339
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,990
So how?

340
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,030
Didn't you want to go? Why aren't you moving?

341
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,440
What are you trying to do?

342
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,850
What do you think I'm trying to do?

343
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,650
Someone like you is capable of doing anything.

344
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,500
He personally gave me an invitation.

345
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,970
If I don't go, it will be a waste of his sincerity.

346
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,210
<i>Thank you for hosting this today.</i>

347
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,450
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

348
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,150
<i>I hope that everyone will drink and enjoy themselves.</i>

349
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,100
<i>Please stay.</i>

350
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,020
<i>Don't mention it.</i>

351
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,180
Cai Hong.

352
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,980
Brother Shao Tian.

353
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,900
I want to thank your boss.

354
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,280
Without you, Cai Hong wouldn't have come to this event today.

355
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,920
Without you, there won't be a Fu Sheng today.

356
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,300
So polite?

357
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:05,700
I have seen a lot of this kind of business in Huzhou where they start operations today and fold the next day.

358
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,010
If I didn't come today, I would have made a mistake. <i>missed seeing the business open.</i>

359
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,380
No matter what, I'm better than a person who lives off others.

360
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,080
Looks like I really wronged you.

361
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,820
You both drank quite a lot. Please talk less.

362
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,370
- I will let you talk then. <br>- Boss Jiang, I would like to ask a favour from you.

363
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,350
Let Cai Hong go.

364
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,720
It's me who doesn't want to let her go now

365
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,350
or is it you instead?

366
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,600
Leave with me.

367
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,040
Okay, you can go back on your own today. I will do this myself.

368
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,030
Shao Tian. Who is that?

369
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,270
The new boss of Ling Long, Jiang Yu.

370
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,130
Jiang Yu?

371
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,820
His family name is Jiang.

372
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,900
It's really Young Master Jiang.

373
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,720
Be careful.

374
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,620
Be careful.

375
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,120
Stop the carriage. Jiang Yu, are you crazy?

376
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,700
If you want to die, I don't.

377
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,300
What? Do you want to find your Brother Shao Tian?

378
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,990
I won't allow you.

379
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,480
Stop the carriage.

380
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,530
Are you crazy? You don't even want your life?

381
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,240
I can tell that you drank too much. You are the one who doesn't want your life. Let go.

382
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,650
I'm not letting you go.

383
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,760
- Let me go. <br>- I won't. So how?

384
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,050
- Let go. <br>- No.

385
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,920
I don't want to see you again.

386
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,110
- <i>Let me go.<br>- No.</i>

387
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,640
- <i>Let me go.<br>- No.</i>

388
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,990
<i>Let me go.</i>

389
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:25,090
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

390
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:53,150
<i>Fine. I respect your decision.</i>

391
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,910
<i>But Fu Sheng and I will wait for you.</i>

392
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,090
- Miss Wu. <br>- Why is it you?

393
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,720
Cai Hong.

394
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,210
- You know each other? <br>- You know him?

395
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,350
He was my neighbour when we were young. His name is Ma Li.

396
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,650
I needed a new employee to help me manage the shop. It just so happens that he also needed money to raise his family.

397
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,010
Thus, he came to help me.

398
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,680
How do you know each other?

399
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,800
You are still talking about it? Previously...

400
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,990
Brother, it's like this.

401
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,080
I was driving a carriage not for long when Miss Wu was my customer.

402
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,170
I wasn't familiar with the road and got lost with Miss Wu.

403
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,220
Miss Wu took me for a bad person and hit me.

404
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,940
I see. This is definitely a misunderstanding.

405
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,050
Ah Li and I grew up together. I know what kind of person he is.

406
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,350
He wouldn't dare to do that kind of stuff.

407
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,930
That's right, too.

408
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:18,510
If you weren't a bad guy, I shouldn't have bullied you.

409
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,780
Since this was a misunderstanding, don't talk about it anymore. Go back to work now.

410
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,020
Okay.

411
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,110
Cai Hong. Why are you here looking for me?

412
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:38,990
Actually, I have been thinking about something for a long time.

413
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:43,810
I think you are right. I shouldn't remain at Ling Long.

414
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:49,000
Thus, I will come and help you out here.

415
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,230
Really?

416
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,440
Hello, Boss.

417
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,500
Boss. The dye for this month will be running out soon.

418
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,520
Which house is the closest?

419
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,390
Also, we decreased by 10%.

420
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:27,340
There's also thirteen accounts receivable left, and we reminded them to hurry up with it.

421
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,960
Brother.

422
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,120
Please sign this document.

423
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,640
Wu Cai Hong is becoming more impossible.

424
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,700
She is still not at work yet. Help me to check. You must punish her properly.

425
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,920
Brother, no need.

426
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,540
Wu Cai Hong already sent someone to deliver a letter.

427
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,340
She said that she quit.

428
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,250
Who says she can resign?

429
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,340
What's wrong? You can't bear to see her go?

430
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,030
Ling Long is not a place where she can simply come and go.

431
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,890
Brother, leaving her here is a burden. She finally wants to go,

432
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,380
why must you insist that she comes back?

433
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,620
To add further,

434
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:51,710
with her here, we'll always be looking behind our backs. Who knows, maybe one day we'll get sent back to the police station!

435
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,260
Where did she go?

436
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,620
How would I know?

437
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,650
But I guess that, other than Zhou Shao Tian,

438
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,950
where else would she go?

- Come out now. <br>- What are you doing?

461
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:07,020
The cat made a lot of noise last night. I couldn't sleep.

462
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,070
The cat cried the entire night?

463
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,960
I think it's your heart which had been crying the whole night instead.

464

Wu Long.

468

Brother Shao Tian. Don't be affected by what my aunt said.

469
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:55,840
If not, I really don't know how to face you.

470
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:02,520
Cai Hong. Whatever others say or think, I don't care about them.

471
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,960
What I care about is what you you think.

472
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,100
When my father passed away,

473
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:16,640
I remember that you had always been helping me.

474
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,780
You took care of my family.

475
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,980
I'm really very grateful to you.

476
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,680
I don't want to hear your words of thanks.

477
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:33,780
It's because it makes me feel that I'm very distant from you.

478
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,410
I don't mean that.

479
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:42,410
I know that.

Cai Hong.

00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,640
Even though you only take me for a brother, I will always take care of you,

482
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,750

♫<i>I can't help but believe in fate</i>♫

484

This is not something precious, but I made this bracelet from strands I dyed myself.

485
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:15,510
The bracelet is very similar to you and has the same name.

486
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:20,280
Frankly,

487
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:26,680
I didn't know how to hand this to you.

488
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:32,970
I thought about this for a long time for many reasons too but it couldn't represent my heart.

489
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,740
I finally thought it through.

490
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,070
What I want to say is this.

491
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,370
Cai Hong.

492
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,970

Are you being serious?

Of course, I want to rush it.

528
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,160
I have waited for a long time and you finally agreed. How could I not be in a rush?

529
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,120
I will listen to you.
