3
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:38,765
[Pop] They lose 65 games only to end
up with the fourth pick in the draft.

4
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,892
Did they tank that shit on purpose?

5
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,562
Read the words, Pop. Right
there on the wall.

6
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,523
Brother's got a point, Henry,
much as I hate to admit that.

7
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,149
That's right. Pay up.

8
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,276
You're right, you're
right. I shouldn't have cursed.

9
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,947
- My bad, Lonnie.
- It's okay, Pop.

10
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,031
[Pop chuckles] All right.

11
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,325
What's their record this
year, anyway, like?

12
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,869
[Pop] 17 and 65.

13
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,456
You know that Russian kid they
drafted? He better be good.

14
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,790
He's Latvian.

15
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,167
What they need to do
is fire Phil Jackson.

16
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,688
[Pop] Wait a minute, Phil Jackson
ain't out there playing no more.

17
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,464
Phil Jackson overrated, B.

18
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,591
Anybody can win with Jordan and Kobe.

19
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,343
Phil ain't no Pat Riley.

20
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,513
- [all groaning]
- Aw, Riley, again?

21
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,639
- [Pop] Yeah.
- Here we go.

22
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,265
[Chico] I mean, Pacino...

23
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,726
Now, I get why that white
boy makes your free haircut list.

24
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:28,398
The Godfather and Scarface guaranteed
that man an eternal ghetto pass.

25
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,584
- Carlito's Way, too.
- [Shameek] Mmm-hmm.

26
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,317
- [Chico] But Pat Riley?
- [Pop] Yeah.

27
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,420
[Chico] Why does Pat Riley get
so much love in this shop?

28
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:37,240
Right. Even punk-ass Derek
Fisher got more rings than Pat Riley.

29
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,408
Uh-uh.

30
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,618
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,871
'Cause the Knicks played like
men when Pat Riley was head coach.

32
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,123
Oakley and Ewing went hard in the paint.

33
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,626
Plus Anthony Mason and John Starks?

34
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,336
Drive the lane, you might
go home in a body bag.

35
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,963
All right, now I heard that.

36
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,715
Later with all that Instagramming,

37
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,176
"let's all max contract on the
same team together" bullcrap

38
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,154
- passing as competition nowadays.
- [all laughing]

39
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,846
[Pop laughs] Mmm. Yeah.

40
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,016
[scoffs] Didn't Pat Riley sign those
Instagram dudes down in Miami

41
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,851
when he became the GM?

42
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,477
[scoffs] Maybe.

43
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,691
But King James is the
truth. LeBron can ball.

44
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,568
[Pop chuckles] Yeah.

45
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,903
Now pay up, Luke. You said "bullcrap."

46
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,405
"Bullcrap" ain't a
curse, man. I don't curse.

47
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,658
- [imitating Luke] "I don't curse."
- [laughs]

48
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,284
You don't cut hair either, negro.

49
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,454
Like, really, what do
you do up in here, bruh?

50
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,832
I sweep hair, Shameek.

51
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,751
I also mop, I wash the towels,

52
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,629
and I make sure that plate
glass window stays spotless.

53
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,882
It's called work. Something
you would never understand.

54
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,050
[scoffs]

55
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,304
Slam Magazine... Hmm?

56
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,725
Coaches used to live
up in this piece, son.

57
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,103
Kevin Ollie got a
shape-up right there from Pop's.

58
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,395
Pitino, too.

59
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,150
Stylin' and profilin', that's my work.

60
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,152
- See what I'm sayin'? Yeah?
- Yeah. Tell him.

61
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,696
For real?

62
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,116
Doc Rivers, uh, call you yet, Shameek?

63
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,118
[chuckling] Whoa, all right. Play nice.

64
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,079
- You can't even afford a haircut.
- [Shameek] Hey, you know what?

65
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,039
- I'm about sick and tired of...
- [Luke] What?

66
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,752
Hmm?

67
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,461
You sick and tired of what?

68
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,093
About sick and tired of the
Knicks losin' all the time, man!

69
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,303
- [Shameek sighs]
- [chuckles]

70
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,805
[chuckling]

71
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,516
You got some hair, too, right there.

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,019
- I'm not finished.
- Yes, you are.

73
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,228
[door opens and bell dings]

74
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,107
- Hey, Counselor.
- Aw, don't jinx me, Pop.

75
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,401
I haven't even passed the bar yet.

76
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,070
- Oh, you will.
- [chuckles]

77
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,782
Lonnie, you got Kumon tonight. Let's go.

78
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,159
Come on, boy, you heard your mama.

79
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,326
Let's get moving.

80
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,578
Don't make me repeat myself.

81
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,623
[chuckles]

82
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,169
Hey, Luke.

83
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,755
What time you get off?

84
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,385
I got another job I go to
right after I leave this one.

85
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,389
[sighs] Black man working. Ain't
nothing wrong with that.

86
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,518
[inhales] Well, we should at least
try to get some coffee some time.

87
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,700
Maybe you'll need a lawyer one day.

88
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,286
Hopefully, you'll have
some cards by then.

89
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,663
[chuckles]

90
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,749
[Pop chuckles] Hey.

91
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,960
Be sure and tell Bessie I said hey.

92
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,795
- I will.
- Mmm-hmm.

93
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,848
How's a woman that fine with a briefcase

94
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,141
gonna throw it at a
brother with a broom?

95
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,185
That's what you don't get, youngin.

96
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,062
Either you have it or you don't.

97
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,189
- [chuckling]
- Oh, I know I got it.

98
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,483
Shit. [indistinct muttering]

99
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,444
[Pop] Whoa, whoa. See the
words... right there on the wall.

100
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,947
- [scoffs]
- Hmm?

101
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,783
- [Pop] Pay up.
- Come on, Pop.

102
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,744
[dryer whirring]

103
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,302
[Pop] Huh, there you go again.

104
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,598
I shook everything else after I got out.

105
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,184
Cigarettes, paranoia...

106
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,978
But the pacing?

107
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,356
I do it, too. [grunts softly]

108
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,984
Reva again?

109
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,236
Reva always.

110
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,617
Look, it's been long enough.

111
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,328
Give Patty a call. She's a good woman.

112
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,496
[scoffs]

113
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,041
I don't drink coffee much.

114
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,709
I don't think she does either.

115
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,838
[chuckles] Like she said, "Ain't
nothing wrong with that."

116
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,341
When I'm ready, I'm ready.

117
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:10,221
But you'll want a cup of something
hot and dark sooner or later...

118
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,182
Mr. Bulletproof.

119
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,101
- [chuckling]
- There you go with the nicknames, Pop.

120
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,564
You said your rebound chick took
a shotgun at point-blank range...

121
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,317
pointed it under your chin,

122
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,152
and pulled the trigger.

123
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,029
I still get the occasional headache.

124
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,823
Not a problem for you, Power Man.

125
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,449
[chuckling]

126
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,160
[Luke grunts]

127
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,373
Mmm-mmm. [chuckles]

128
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,461
I love it when you do
stuff like that. [chuckling]

129
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,880
You should be out there helping
people, that's all,

130
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,882
like them other fellas downtown.

131
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,467
Reva used to say the same thing.

132
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,635
Yeah, well, she was right.

133
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,555
You don't ever think about all
the people you could help?

134
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,975
You should be more ambitious.

135
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,896
What if my ambition is to sweep hair...

136
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,314
wash dishes...

137
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,025
and be left the hell alone?

138
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,194
Well, that would be a waste.

139
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,071
You think I asked for any of this?

140
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,158
I was framed, beaten...

141
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,120
and put in some tank
like an exotic fish.

142
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,041
Came out with...

143
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,459
abilities.

144
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,044
Saved your life.

145
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,880
More like ruined it.

146
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,758
Reva's dead. [exhales]

147
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,344
I'm a fugitive.

148
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,096
So?

149
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,723
Take my advice, brother.

150
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,102
The past is the past.

151
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,147
And the only direction in
life that matters is forward.

152
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,648
Never backwards.

153
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,985
I'm just living my life...

154
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,487
day to day.

155
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,697
[hip-hop music playing over speakers]

156
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,706
Why don't you watch
where you going, man?

157
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,969
What's the gun for, Chico?

158
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,890
[scoffs] Is your name Wilfredo Diaz?

159
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,351
'Cause he walked out on me
and moms when I was nine.

160
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,313
I ain't need a daddy
then and I don't need one now.

161
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,441
[car engine starts]

162
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,698
- Let's get this money.
- Yeah.

163
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,537
Tsk.

164
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,376
Hey, Pop, I gotta go. I'm runnin' late.

165
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,630
Hey. Look, if I wasn't paying you
in cash, I could be paying you more.

166
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,092
You wouldn't have to
be workin' two jobs.

167
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,011
I gotta do what I gotta do.

168
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,805
Always forward.

169
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,890
Forward. Always.

170
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,393
[sighs]

171
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,147
[indistinct chatter]

172
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,622
[vendor] Hey, yo, my man, my man.

173
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,916
All HD. Got it right here. Blu-ray,
too, 'cause I'm nice like that.

174
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,462
Tony Stark, the big blonde
dude with the hammer,

175
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,713
the old dude with the shield,

176
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,341
the green monster, and I
don't mean Fenway.

177
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,593
You can't get better raw
footage of the incident

178
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,553
anywhere else than right here.

179
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,855
- Hey, Luke.
- [Luke chuckles]

180
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,232
Every time.

181
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,360
It's the bleach. I can smell
it from around the corner.

182
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,321
Pop has got you washing
towels again, huh?

183
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,618
Yeah, I took a New
Yorker off the top for you.

184
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,246
Can't tell you what's
on the cover, though.

185
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,666
Hey, I hope you got Connie's rent money.

186
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,084
She's on the warpath.

187
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,502
- [chuckles]
- Thanks, Ollie.

188
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,921
[Ollie] Mmm-hmm.

189
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,522
Ten days late, Mr.
Cage. I need my rent money.

190
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,068
[sighs]

191
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,866
Here.

192
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,911
I count $300. Not enough.

193
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,664
Let me go to work and get the rest.

194
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,124
Tonight.

195
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,635

198
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,398
- [music continues playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

199
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,266
I need a favor. Short one
bartender. Dante's sick.

200
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,809
You got the cash you promised me?

201
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,478
- End of the week.
- Come on, Nate.

202
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,243
You can keep all your
tips out there, okay?

203
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,707
When was the last time you made drinks?

204
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,192
I know the drill.

205
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,693
Okay, okay. Clean up.

206
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,028
Put a shirt and jacket
on. Mr. Stokes has standards.

207
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,697
Though you can't tell by what he pays.

208
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,948
Excuse me?

209
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,509
Raphael Saadiq.

210
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,596
- He's as good live as you said he was.
- Even better.

211
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,248
So you're not impressed by all this?

212
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,686
I've always been proud of you.

213
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,565
[Stokes] This place was a roach
trap by the time Mama Mabel died.

214
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,024
Now look at it.

215
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:24,405
Harlem's Paradise. May as
well be the new Cotton Club.

216
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,407
Then I shouldn't be up in here tonight.

217
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,785
Well...

218
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,496
Madam Councilwoman...

219
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,083
Colon's Gym is ready to make a
sizable donation to my pocket...

220
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,419
and your real estate project.

221
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,546
Sometimes you need a face-to-face.

222
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,382
"Colon's Gym"?

223
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,636
Is that what that two-bit drug
dealer is puttin' on his tax returns?

224
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,304
[laughs]

225
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,972
Why do you even waste time with him?

226
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,810
Politics is where the power is, Cornell.

227
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,730
Forget about all this other noise.

228
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,690
My noise keeps you flush.

229
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:05,154
All that "keep Harlem black" rack-a-bully-ack
might get you re-elected.

230
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,324
- Damn skippy.
- But when the smoke clears...

231
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,785
it's niggas like me that let
you hold on to what you got.

232
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,828
You know I despise that word.

233
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,289
I know.

234
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,542
It's easy to underestimate a nigga.

235
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,795
They never see you coming.

236
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,847
- What's that?
- It's a cosmo.

237
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,688
[chuckles] Your jacket's a little small.

238
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,691
So is your dress.

239
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,903
Touché.

240
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,744
- Cornell, my man.
- Champagne.

241
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:55,723
- [Stokes] All right.
- Councilwoman.

242
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,749
- What are you two celebrating?
- Success.

243
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,503
Partnership that should have
happened a long time ago, had...

244
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,423
my uncle and your brother had their way.

245
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,174
Uncle Pete was good people.

246
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,594
Salvador really liked Pete.

247
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,305
Anytime.

248
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,189
- [Luke] Lookin' for somethin'?
- No.

249
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,736
Saadiq's still got it. [chuckles]

250
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,237
Stone Rollin' was a dope album.

251
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,574
[chuckling] "Album"? Now
I know you're an old head.

252
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,870
You ain't no spring
chicken neither, sucker.

253
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,456
Touché.

254
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,794
[chuckling]

255
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,130
[man] All right. So let
me get this straight.

256
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,257
I give your cousin a contribution

257
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,718
and it's like a get out of
jail free card for me, right?

258
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,302
That's something to celebrate.

259
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,764
No, I don't do that.

260
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,349
[chuckles]

261
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,183
[inhales] See, me...

262
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,937
I celebrate when things are
finished. Not when it's just starting.

263
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,023
[woman] Listen to him.

264
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,942
This is nothing to celebrate.

265
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,778
You saw what happened to Fisk.

266
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,572
You two shouldn't even
be seen together...

267
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,866
let alone having me all
up in the Kool-Aid.

268
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:18,454
But you're here anyway. Something
must be right about it.

269
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,666
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
fronted me if you didn't agree.

270
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,419
I have no illusions about
our family's legacy.

271
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:29,757
But you are now turning legitimate
money illegal all over again.

272
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,719
[chuckles] What's illegal about it?

273
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,806
Our product is protected
by the Constitution.

274
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,934
But you came to me because
you trust me, Domingo.

275
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,227
[R&B music playing]

276
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,071
In your business, people need my
product like a fish needs water.

277
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,657
- He can buy his water anywhere.
- Nah.

278
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,284
What I sell is pure.

<i>This the kind of shit that
could blow a hole in a battleship.</i>

to hold in your hand.</i>

281
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,626
<i>Trust me, Domingo.</i>

282
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,754
<i>You can brighten someone's
day permanently with this shit.</i>

<i>The crème de la crème.</i>

<i>This that grade A, military,
Justin Hammer-level shit.</i>

286
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,558
A hundred large per
case. Ten cases, a cool mil.

00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,436
<i>Wholesale. Brand spanking new.</i>

288
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,023
<i>No serial numbers... because
my connect is nice like that.</i>

289
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,267
[Domingo] <i>Who's your connect?</i>

290
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,819
[Stokes] <i>He's real and
his inventory runs deep.</i>

291
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,113
- So that's it.
- That's it.

292
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,617
- Easy-peasy.
- Nothing's ever that easy.

293
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,119
So what happens after
they call to confirm?

294
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,329
Everyone walks away happy.

295
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,166
UPS ain't the only brown that delivers.

what I'm talkin' about.

Yeah.

Yo, you see this? Damn!

supposed to kill nobody, man!

Dante. Shit went left. My bad.

gag you with your panties.

Yo, this shit is like
some Hollywood shit for real.

309
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,088
[Dante] Shameek, what am I gonna
do? They're gonna know it was me.

310

B, there's, like, a
million dollars right here.

311
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,324
Cottonmouth always lookin'
down at me at the bar.

312
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,327
He's gonna know I'm gone. They
gonna know it was a inside job.

313
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,788
- You right.
- [gunshot]

314
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,875
What'd you do?

00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,501
- [breathing heavily]
- Yo, shit works.

316
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,378
Yo, this shit works, Chico.

317
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,505
Dante would have snitched.

You see... you see how shook he was?

Come on, man. I ain't...

320
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,303
Ain't no way I'm splitting that
shit three ways no how, man.

Dante was crew, B. That's Dante!

Yo, I made a
decision. I'm gonna be rich.

[R&B music playing]

326
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,389
So you're a bench-warmer?
Or did you miss the cut?

00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,557
Excuse me?

328
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,560
I just figured you were... one of his.

329
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,396
One of Cottonmouth's?

330
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,523
[chuckles] I hear he hates that name.

331
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,568
- Mr. Stokes'...
- Cottonmouth's...

332
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,821
Models.

333
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,699
What makes you assume that?

334
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,160
You're beautiful. But...

335
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,829
But what?

336
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,667
You're a little older than
he usually likes them.

[chuckles]

338
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,922
Yeah, you're definitely not
getting a tip tonight.

Mmm.

Me?

I ponder a woman.

Why don't you...

345
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,736
ponder me another cosmo?

347
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,157
[Candace] Luke.

348
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,451
Hey, Candace.

349
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,787
You got promoted?

350
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,248
Dante's out sick.

351
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,792
You okay?

352
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,504
Table seven wants six
bottles of Ace of Spades.

353
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,047
I need you to help me carry them up.

354
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,889
I don't like being up there by myself.

355
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,392
I'm right behind you. Give me a second.

356
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:31,160
Why don't you... ponder
that 'til I get back.

357
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,724
You're a big one, eh?

358
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,726
He's wearing a little jacket.

359
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,813
[Stokes laughs]

360
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,732
Haven't seen you behind the bar.

361
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,484
Where's Dante?

362
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,446
Called in sick, I guess.

363
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,199
You want a job?

364
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,579
I can find something more
suitable for a man your size.

365
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,957
Better paying, too.

366
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,293
You ever carried a gun?

367
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,337
No.

368
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,882
I'm good. Thanks.

369
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,225
[Dante groaning]

370
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,650
[cell phone ringing]

371
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,615
Yeah?

372
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,997
Shit. Fuck.

373
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,212
[speaking indistinctly]

374
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,100
[typing]

375
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:26,501
You got to walk over
to Adam Clayton Powell

376
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,068
if you wanna catch the bus.

377
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,615
Uber?

378
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,411
- That's what you were gonna press, right?
- What are you?

379
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,414
- A cop?
- [chuckles] No.

380
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,542
You just look cold.

381
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,717
If you're looking for
Mr. Stokes, he just left.

382
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,345
Who?

383
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,639
Black Escalade.

384
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,225
Tinted windows.

385
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,481
Don't you have... somewhere
you need to be?

386
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,152
Yeah.

387
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,196
Home.

388
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,489
Just got off.

389
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,658
Congratulations.

390
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,167
You wanna go grab a coffee?

391
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,719
I don't like coffee.

392
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,013
Neither do I.

393
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,643
[keys clatter]

394
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,909
[Luke exhales]

395
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,871
[moans]

396
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,804
[both breathing heavily]

397
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,414
[Luke grunts]

398
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,882
[Luke exhales]

399
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,807
[men grunting]

400
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,226
[cell phone ringing]

401
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,522
- [gasps]
- [woman] When?

402
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,442
I'm on my way in.

403
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,695
[sighs]

404
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,242
You talk in your sleep.

405
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,245
What was I saying?

406
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,333
Shades? Comanche?

407
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,625
[Luke sighs]

408
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,216
The job is calling me in.

409
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,967
Can I call you later?

410
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,887
[sighs] You'd need my
phone number for that.

411
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,395
I know where you work.

412
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,314
I'll find you.

413
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,067
What is it you do again?

414
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:02,824
[zipping]

415
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,743
I'm an auditor.

416
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,747
What's that?

417
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,002
Basically, I look at
the financial books.

418
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,380
Make sure everything's on the up and up.

419
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,924
And you need a short dress for that?

420
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,890
Sometimes you got to blend in.

421
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,475
Impossible.

422
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,770
You stand out in any room you're in.

423
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,420
[machinery whirring]

424
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,256
[camera shutters clicking]

425
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,185
Dominicans? Cubans?

426
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,478
Puerto Ricans.

427
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,146
[Scarfe] Thought that
parade was last week.

428
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,898
- Who can keep track?
- [both chuckling]

429
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,279
Who do you think this
guy was trying to call?

430
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,948
- Ghostbusters.
- [chuckles]

431
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,617
He can laugh. You can't.

432
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,412
Hey, Bailey. How you doing?

433
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,207
It's another beautiful day at
the office. What's not to love?

434
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,876
Don't you start
singing show tunes on me.

435
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,631
Oh, shit.

436
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,049
Dante Chapman.

437
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,426
You know him?

438
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,679
I know his mama.

439
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,894
[Stokes] Of course it
wasn't a inside job.

440
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,438
We had people die, too.

441
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,484
Look... I don't have the stuff.

442
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,905
Hmm. We need to talk
about this in person.

443
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,948
My word is still my bond.

444
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,827
Hello?

445
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,291
That's Domingo?

446
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,752
Yo, what's up?

447
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,961
[sighs]

448
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,507
It's above your pay grade.

449
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,716
What?

450
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,761
[man] Tell your man what's
going on, Cornell.

451
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,849
Nice digs.

452
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,894
Even nicer than when Mama Mabel ran it.

453
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,438
Shades.

454
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,816
When'd you come home?

455
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,569
[takes deep breath] Ooh, a while ago.

456
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,362
Seagate wasn't shit.

457
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,863
Hmm.

458
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:34,703
[clears throat]
So... what can I do for you?

459
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,913
It's the other way around.

460
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,666
Y'all got hit last night.

461
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,627
That expensive, exclusive,

462
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,297
hard-to-get hardware that
Diamondback gave you

463
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,215
is in a police evidence lockup.

464
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:52,721
And the money... that Domingo and
his crew were supposed to give you...

465
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,180
is gone.

466
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,435
I'm with Diamondback now.
You knew that, right?

467
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,743
Well, tell
Diamondback, it's about time...

468
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,482
Uh-uh... Diamondback tells you.

469
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,151
[laughs]

470
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,945
I'm his number one seller.

471
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,655
I ain't here to spank you.

472
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,951
But I do need to look
you in your eyes...

473
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,664
Was it an inside job?

474
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,166
No.

475
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,002
Hell no.

476
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,629
I needed that money, too.

477
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,171
[sighs]

478
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,299
It took forever to build
up that kind of trust.

479
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,552
We're here to get you back on your feet.

480
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,678
Whatever you need.

481
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,556
Who is "we," you fake-ass Ray Charles?

482
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,351
[chuckles]

483
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,481
I got your back, B.

484
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,108
Just like back in the day.

485
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,277
Forget about back in the day.

486
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,739
Why is this feeling like a takeover?

487
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,240
[chuckling softly] It's not.

488
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,285
If it was...

489
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,913
you would never even
see Diamondback comin'.

490
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,665
He wants you to win.

491
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,001
How can I help?

492
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,513
[indistinct chatter]

493
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,444
[Pop] <i>Dante was one of
my kids. So was Chico.</i>

494
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,404
And Shameek, too.

495
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,073
Just like those kids playing over there.

496
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:39,077
[scoffs] You know, that's
how you get 'em on your side.

497
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,080
Sweepin' up hair. Runnin'
errands. [chuckling]

498
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:47,001
Lettin' 'em hang out, play video games.

499
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,797
Anything is better than what's waiting
for them out there on the street.

500
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,427
They want a way out...

501
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:01,558
but they have too much
pride to ask for help.

502
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,562
So you gotta Jedi mind-trick
them into something. [chuckles]

503
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,940
Everyone has a gun.
[sighs] No one has a father.

504
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,150
Ain't that the truth.

505
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,652
You sure they did it?

506
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:16,740
People started callin' me half
an hour after it happened.

507
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,702
Shameek has always been the spark plug.

508
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,372
And Chico... a follower.

509
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,544
I just can't believe that
either one of them...

510
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,005
would just turn around...

511
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:37,218
and kill... Dante.

512
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:43,558
You didn't see anything going
on with either one of 'em, did you?

513
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,063
No.

514
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,446
You live and die by your choices.

515
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,408
This is Harlem's garden. That's
what's happening here.

516
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,703
You are the ones that are
gonna keep this community...

517
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,622
[chuckles and gasps]

518
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,625
Where have... Oh, God.
This is Marisol. Baby...

519
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,503
Oh, my God, known her
since she was first born.

520
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,422
And here you are
upturnin' Harlem around.

521
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,924
I'm so proud of you.

522
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,010
Ah! I saw you running
for the bus this mornin'.

523
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,846
All right, darling.

524
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,601
I'm happy you made it, darling.

525
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,937
Uh-uh, uh-uh, cut him off at three.

526
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,565
I know this young brother.
He'll eat five hamburgers.

527
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,482
I've seen you do it.

528
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:43,743
Now, Harlem is a community that
welcomes everyone. All people.

529
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,162
But at the same time,

530
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,665
since the days of Langston Hughes,

531
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:53,127
Malcolm X, Zora Neale
Hurston, Duke Ellington,

532
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,673
Harlem has been the
jewel of black America.

533
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:02,554
It's a perpetual symbol of... of
hope and prosperity and excellence.

534
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,222
For black lives to matter,

535
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,642
black history and black
ownership must also matter.

536
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:12,480
Now, my multifaceted plan for
the Crispus Attucks Complex

537
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,775
is just yet another way to
bring hope to a new generation,

538
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:19,613
to incubate the kind of
innovation and creativity

539
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,448
and progress that Harlem's famous for.

540
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:26,285
Thank you again for your
time, Madam Councilwoman.

541
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,246
Oh, Megan, you're
always welcome in Harlem.

542
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,664
- All right.
- All right, darling.

543
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,711
Y'all need to fall the hell back.

544
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,005
Zip, give her some space.

545
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,965
I don't like the thugs.

546
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,467
- You need them for security.
- Mmm, they scare people.

547
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,721
They pass out flyers, get
contributions, tributes.

548
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,390
[in Jamaican accent] Just
like in Jamaica, you know?

549
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:51,102
- Yeah, well, we ain't Jamaican, Cornell.
- [chuckling]

550
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,856
You shouldn't be here. We don't
need to be photographed together.

551
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,900
Why?

552
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,610
You ashamed of me?

553
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,739
That hurts, Mariah.

554
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,323
- Tony.
- Hmm?

555
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,992
Will you give us a moment?

556
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,794
I need the money you promised me ASAP.

557
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,629
Now you want the money?

558
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:22,050
I used federal grant and
tax-deductible donation money

559
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,385
to complete construction on your club

560
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,222
and to facilitate that meticulous
deal that just fell apart.

561
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,976
I don't get the money,
I'm facing an audit.

562
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,436
We all go to jail.

563
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,647
It'll be there.

564
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,152
What happened at the
junkyard last night?

565
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,947
And who's the dude in
the sunglasses behind you?

566
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,574
Is he after the money, too?

567
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,161
Either you want the
details, cuz, or you don't.

568
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,668
That's what I thought.

569
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,714
What's the word?

570
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:04,676
Confirmation of what Dante
told us while he was dying.

571
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,053
His friends, the one that
play on your summer league team

572
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,722
at the Rucker, jacked your shit.

573
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,307
Shameek and Chico.

574
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,601
Any bites yet?

575
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:16,980
No.

576
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,566
Double down.

577
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,112
Twenty large to find those fools.

578
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,157
[hip-hop music playing]

579
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,933
Tone, Passion is
twerking for him right now.

580
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:57,353
He ain't going nowhere soon. Not
with all that ass in his face.

581
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,733
You want me to keep him
here, you need to pay me.

582
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,994
Hey, yo, my man. You
know what time it is?

583
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,168
8:15.

584
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,253
[men laughing]

585
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,926
Stay Harlem.

586
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,971
Stay black.

587
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,566
[playing jazz music]

588
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,156
[cutlery clattering]

589
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,118
- Hey, man.
- Watch your hands.

590
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,202
You need to pay me.

591
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,346
I'm paying you under the table,

592
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,123
which means I'll pay you whenever
I goddamn feel like it.

593
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,963
What you worried about?

594
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:49,086
[Shameek] I'm not worried.

595
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:50,775
I just never met Cottonmouth
before, that's all.

596
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,844
[Tone] Mr. Stokes.

597
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,764
Mr. Stokes. That's
important. Never Cottonmouth.

598
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,933
All right, okay, my bad.

599
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:02,561
After what happened with
Dante, we circling the wagons.

600
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,355
They after us, B.

601
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,858
Who?

602
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,734
Nigga, it don't matter who.

603
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:14,490
Mr. Stokes wanted me to
check on you... personally.

604
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,668
[Tone] Yo, what you doin'? Come on.

605
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,866
Shades.

606
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,925
You like my Biggie photo?

607
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,970
Me, too.

608
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,515
You know what draws your
eye when you look at that?

609
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,560
The crown.

610
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,397
Wanna know why?

611
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:31,985
Huh?

612
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,950
'Cause everybody wants to be the king.

613
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,330
- [grunts and sighs heavily]
- [Shameek groans]

614
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,541
[chuckles]

615
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,255
I slapped you like a little bitch.

616
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,423
[breathes deeply]

617
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:57,551
I'm not the kind of man to
use a closed fist on a woman.

618
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,347
Where's my money?

619
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,517
[Shameek] I... I didn't...

620
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,893
Uh-uh.

621
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:11,774
Only thing worse than
a thief is a damn liar.

622
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,237
[grunting] Where's... my...

623
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,738
- money?
- [Shameek groans]

624
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,573
[Stokes breathing heavily] Hmm?

625
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,783
[coughs]

626
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:25,829
You left Dante alive. He called Tone.

627
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:29,917
And with his dying words, gave
up you and your homeboy.

628
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,669
We got your money.

629
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,546
[breathing heavily]

630
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:38,134
Now you're gonna tell us where
Chico is so we can get the rest.

631
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,638
[spits]

632
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,724
[laughing]

633
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,188
Yeah. Thank you.

634
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,732
Now I can hit you like a man.

635
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,776
[mumbles] No...

[panting]

00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,823
Get his ass out of here.

[breathing heavily]

646
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,203
And go fetch my money.

647
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,129
[breathing heavily]

648
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:04,512
He didn't recognize you.

649
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,888

00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,578

[cell door buzzing faintly]

652
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:39,004
Loneliness never goes away,
especially in places like Seagate.

653
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,675
If you don't make
attempts to befriend someone...

654
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,680
loneliness is guaranteed
to... eat you alive.

- [cell door buzzing faintly]
- [men shouting indistinctly]

[exhales]

658
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,629
I'm clear. [sighs]

659
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,716
I'm focused.

660
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,220
I promise, baby...

661
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,722
I'm ready.

00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,772
[siren wails]

00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,111
- [female detective sighing]
- Shameek Smith...

664
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,990
based on what they found in his pockets.
We'll need dental to confirm ID.

665
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:50,075
[chuckles] His face is jacked.

666
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:54,372
Mmm. They definitely dumped him
here. They got him somewhere else.

667
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:57,333
Mmm. Looks like he got hit by a truck.

668
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,667
Yeah.

669
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,338
- A truck with two fists.
- [Scarfe chuckles]

670
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,340
You know, Benjamin Franklin said,

671
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:08,927
"The only way that three people can
keep a secret is if two of 'em are dead."

672
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,806
First Dante, now Shameek. Chico's
the last man standing.

673
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,475
Benjamin Franklin...

674
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,645
Didn't he electrocute
himself flying a kite in a rainstorm?

675
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,409
I wouldn't base any
theories on that fool.

676
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,400
Benjamin Franklin is on
the $100 bill, Scarfe.

677
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,068
[scoffs] So? He wasn't a president.

678
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,822
That's even more impressive. Come
on, give the man some credit.

679
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,201
Well... So you think
Chico did this to Shameek?

680
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:38,541
Chico is what? A buck 50 soaking wet?

681
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,043
But we won't know for
sure until we find him.

682
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,588
You said Dante wasn't bartendin'
the night you were at the club.

683
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:45,798
No.

684
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,942
Well, did you talk to the
guy that replaced him that night?

685
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,511
[scoffs] I barely talked to the guy.

686
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,013
I mean... [inhales] all
I did was order drinks.

687
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,183
Well, maybe there's some
pattern, somethin' we're missin'.

688
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,226
We need to go talk to that guy.

689
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,813
That sounds like a
complete waste of time.

690
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,566
That's entirely possible.

691
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,234
But it's worth a shot.

692
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,278
[scoffs] All right.

693
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,899
You've been in this
country for how long?

694
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:50,404
And you still... can't speak English?

695
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,990
My English is just fine.

696
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,950
Show Mariah Dillard some love.

697
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:58,120
Contribute and we'll go away.

698
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,329
It's a family thing.

699
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,457
I own this restaurant.

700
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,959
My father owned this building.

701
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:08,296
Tell Mariah Dillard I am
not contributing to her complex.

702
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:11,592
We voted for her and

Excuse me?

I don't even like these niggas, man.
