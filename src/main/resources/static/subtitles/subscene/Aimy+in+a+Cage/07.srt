<i>Episode 7</i>

20
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,660
Did you see this? Just do accordingly to the instructions.

21
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,120
I get it.

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,450
Boss. Take a look. This is our new product.

23
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,740
It is easier to dye with color.

24
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,580
It simplifies the dying process.

25
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,100
Right. Take it to the workshop to test the dying process.

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,510
Okay.

27
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,640
Why do you keep staring at me?

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,750
Did you force Old Cai's family to move?

29
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,830
In your heart, you are already sure that

30
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,830
I was behind this.

31
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,240
Furthermore, you are very clear that no matter how you ask,

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,670
I won't admit to it.

33
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,170
Don't tell me you don't want to explain this?

34
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,550
What is there to explain?

35
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,430
You will find out the truth sooner or later.

36
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,630
You don't need to accompany me today. Go to the rickshaw.

37
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,850
Take record of the newly dyed fabrics.

38
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,910
I'm returning these clothes to you. I have already washed them.

39
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,290
If you are going to complain, you can throw them away.

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,080
Fei Fei.

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,170
You are looking for me?

42
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,580
Brother. Ah Fa came just now.

43
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,560
She said the mistress of the house is looking for accommodations.

44
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,950
- Put these away for me. <br>- Where are you going?

45
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,370
To speak to Lao Cai's mistress.

46
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,150
I'm going with you.

47
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,500
Don't go. I'm not going there for fun.

48
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,360
Wait for my news.

49
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,880
Come, let's go.

50
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,060
Come with me to a place.

51
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,580
Jiang Yu. If you don't tell me anything, I'm not getting in the rickshaw with you.

52
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,930
There is no time. I will explain to you.

53
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,220
- Quick, get in the rickshaw now. <br>- I don't want to listen to your explanation.

54
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,010
If you want to find Old Cai, get in the now.

55
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,510
<i>He doesn't allow me to go but he pulled Wu Cai Hong along.</i>

56
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:30,100
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

57
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,410
- Hello, Mr Zhou. <br>- Did you see Cai Hong?

58
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,720
Cai Hong? Boss Jiang just took her away.

59
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,980
It seems to be something urgent.

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,610
You can leave.

61
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,890
Where did Cai Hong go?

62
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,830
It seems like she got into Boss Jiang's rickshaw.

63
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,050
Do you know where they went?

64
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,100
I don't know anything about this.

65
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,260
Do you know where Jiang Yu and Cai Hong went?

66
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,970
I know. But why should I tell you?

67
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,760
Because you are just like me.

68
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,970
You don't want to see them together, right?

69
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,930
Is anyone there?

70
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,700
- Be careful. <br>- Okay.

71
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,500
We are a step behind again.

72
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,910
You killed her just to prove your innocence.

73
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,930
What are you saying?

74
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,760
I was at Ling Long the whole day. Everyone, including you,

75
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,070
can be be my alibis. How could I have killed her?

76
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,780
If you wanted to kill anyone, you don't need to do this yourself.

77
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,340
- Wu Cai Hong! <br> - Let me go.

78
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,860
You need to tell the truth.

79
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,900
Look for yourself. These doors and windows are perfectly intact.

80
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,660
Nobody forced their way in. Also,

81
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,160
this room doesn't have the slightest sign of a fight.

82
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,760
The table also has two cups of tea, which shows that the aggressor

83
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,320
was very familiar with the victim. And I

84
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,040
don't even know this girl.

85
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,150
What you said, couldn't it have been done after the murder?

86
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,970
You schemed to harm my father and to take away Ling Long.

87
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,170
You say a weak woman was killed.

88
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,060
Why did you take me along with you?

89
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,240
You originally planned for me to be beside you.

90
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,950
You are simply awful!

91
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,780
You think that I'm the killer?

92
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,050
In order to clear my name I need to prove my innocence?

93
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,960
That's right. Not only are you a killer, your killer tactics are even scarier.

94
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,250
You are a monster.

95
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,320
Cai Hong.

96
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,490
Brother Shao Tian. Jiang Yu killed someone.

97
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,560
Let's report to the police now.

98
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,060
What's going on?

99
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,190
What brings you here?

100
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,520
What brings you here?

101
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,570
Cut the nonsense. Let's go back now.

102
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,960
Let's go now, Brother Shao Tian.

103
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,160
Cai Hong, is what I am hearing the truth?

104
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,310
It's just that I don't have any concrete evidence.

105
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,290
This is the latest results after the death.

106
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,390
You may leave.

107
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,820
Based on this new report, your father's injury

108
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,690
was caused by a small wound from a metal pen.

109
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,990
It left debris (evidence),

110
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,250
that is only found in a rare Parker pen tip.

111
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,440
Cai Hong. Does your father have such a pen?

112
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,130
Jiang Yu has this fountain pen too.

113
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,040
If we can test Jiang Yu's pen in a laboratory,

114
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,540
we may be able to explain it.

115
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,070
Can I tell Jiang Yu to come here

116
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,700
to examine his fountain pen?

117
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,980
Last time, we already confirmed his innocence.

118
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,360
Also, the witness was my superior, Chief Li Ting.

119
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,060
If you think that Jiang Yu used the fountain pen to kill someone,

120
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,070
let's test the pen thoroughly.

121
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,270
Brother Shao Tian. Did I make a mistake?

122
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,340
In case I hadn't insist on checking on her identity,

123
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,070
she wouldn't have died.

124
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,710
You are not at fault.

125
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,380
You are investigating your father's death to take revenge.

126
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,720
As it is something you swore to do.

127
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,030
Blame the cruelty of the murderer who

128
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,990
covered up the murder through silence.

129
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,310
If I hadn't forced the situation,

130
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,760
this matter wouldn't have come to this stage.

131
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,430
Cai Hong. Leave this matter to me now.

132
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,800
First Lao Cai and now his mistress...

133
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,380
I'm worried that if this continues, it won't bring you any benefits.

134
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,070
I am not going to be afraid. The more he threatens me,

135
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,620
the more I'm committed to removing his mask of hypocrisy,

136
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,160
and investigating the reason of my father's death.

137
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,240
Also,

138
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,160
I must get hold of Jiang Yu's fountain pen.

139
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,830
Brother.

140
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,580
So how? Did you meet Old Cai's mistress?

141
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,720
Yes,

142
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,640
- but she is already dead. <br>- Dead?

143
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,320
When I arrived there, she was already dead.

144
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,330
Who did it?

145
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,030
I don't know who did it.

146
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,490
How each time someone is always one step ahead of me..

147
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,470
it is like someone is being given clues (information) in advance.

148
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,440
Brother. What are you suspicious of?

149
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,660
I suspect this individual wants to stop people from being questioned <br><i>(giving out information</i>

150
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,920
around us.

151
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,390
Brother.

152
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,900
Who do you suspect then?

153
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,290
Fei Fei. When I went to find Old Cai's mistress,

154
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,150
did you tell anyone about it?

155
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,450
I... didn't.

156
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,230
You really didn't?

157
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,610
It's that Brother Shao Tian.

158
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,640
When he couldn't find Wu Cai Hong, he was like a maniac.

159
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,910
He forced me to tell him.

160
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,710
I was thinking that place isn't safe.

161
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,510
He may be able to help when he is there.

162
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,700
Thus, I told him.

163
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,120
Could Shao Tian have done something?

164
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,370
Brother. Ever since Wu Cai Hong came to Ling Long,

165
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,690
she keeps bringing troubles.

166
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,190
When do you plan to let her go?

167
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,940
Wait till I have investigated fully

168
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,160
about who stole the money from Ling Long,

169
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,910
she can go whenever and wherever she wants.

170
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,530
Brother, don't overdue it.

171
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,180
Regardless of who stole the money from Ling Long,

172
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,840
I think we should thank him instead.

173
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,600
If it weren't for him, it won't have been that easy for us to acquire Ling Long.

174
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,550
Why are you always grabbing a hold of that man? <br><i>(Why do you always suspect him?)</i>

175
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,400
The person who stole the money from Ling Long,

176
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,770
should also be the one who burnt the ledger.

177
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,410
He is also the same person who harmed Old Cai's mistress.

178
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,580
Furthermore, he should be near us.

179
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,750
If we don't get rid of him soon,

180
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,880
one of these days, he'll back us into a corner.

181
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,000
Shao Tian.

182
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,960
Shao Tian.

183
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,050
Shao Tian. You are here just in time. Think of a solution quickly

184
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,960
- to let my wife, children and I leave here. <br>- You are the killer.

185
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,720
I... I didn't have a choice.

186
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,720
What you did is suicidal.

187
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,610
Shao Tian. Listen to me.

188
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,900
I did according to your instructions.

189
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,620
I gave her money to leave

190
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,640
but I never would have thought that that person wanted more money,

191
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,230
she even used Ling Long to threaten me.

192
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,630
She said that she will report to the police.

193
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,800
I was in a panic. Thus...

194
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,390
I didn't kill her intentionally.

195
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,720
Shao Tian.

196
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,960
You are the only one who can help me to leave.

197
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,680
We're in the same boat.

198
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,750
Nothing must happen to me.

199
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,480
Are you threatening me?

200
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,120
I... wouldn't dare.

201
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,450
Master Shao.

202
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,310
Master Shao. I'm begging you.

203
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,200
Please save him. If you don't save him today,

204
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,400
he will be doomed.

205
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,920
Get up first.

206
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,340
Let's do this. I will think of a way

207
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,340
but you must listen to me next

208
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,650
time there is a plan.

209
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,910
Yes.

210
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,650
Okay, thanks.

211
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,270
Thanks.

212
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,430
Thank, Master Shao.

213
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,640
What are you doing?

214
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,790
Brother Shao Tian's mother is sick.

215
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,180
Thus, I'm cooking some porridge. He doesn't have time to take care of her.

216
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,890
I will take his mother to the hospital later.

217
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,010
Cai Hong. Have you thought it through

218
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,230
about being with Shao Tian?

219
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,780
Aunt.

220
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,970
Don't say that I talk too much.

221
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,980
When a girl marries someone,

222
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,720
they will be reborn for the second time.

223
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,170
This is an opportunity to turn your life around.

224
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,050
Of course, you must choose well.

225
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,670
Zhou Shao Tian isn't on your level.

226
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,640
A lowly husband and wife will live in misery.

227
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,400
This is not a game.

228
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,600
I think you have misunderstood.

229
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,080
I don't have the mood to be in love now.

230
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,930
Ever since my father passed away,

231
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,140
Brother Shao Tian has helped us a lot.

232
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,530
I'm just expressing my gratitude.

233
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,250
You should show your gratitude in a suitable fashion.

234
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,740
You are so close to him now.

235
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,930
It's inevitable that he'll misunderstand.

236
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,190
He still thinks he has a chance, no?

237
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,700
Come, Aunt.

238
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,780
Miss Wu, thank you.

239
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,580
It's okay, Aunt.

240
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,170
Brother Shao Tian is like a family member to me.

241
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,440
Thus, it's a given that I should take care of you.

242
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,410
Then, in the future,

243
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,700
could I treat you like my family member?

244
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,920
Of course. Just tell me if you want to eat anything.

245
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,780
When I have cooked it, I will have it delivered to you.

246
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,870
You are really a good girl.

247
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:36,580
Shao Tian, is really a blessing from the heavens.

248
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,300
Have some again.

249
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,810
Come.

250
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,970
Aunt?

251
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,070
It's really you.

252
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,240
Wench. So, it's you.

253
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,930
Why are you here again? Did you disobey the doctor's orders again?

254
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,720
No. My son is just anxious about me.

255
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,100
I'm getting older. I was feeling a bit dizzy and had a fever, but he was getting worried.

256
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,200
He brought me here for a medical check. Look at me.

257
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,070
Okay.

258
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,020
- I'm great. <br> - Don't overexert yourself.

259
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,660
I think you're still a little weak when walking.

260
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,260
When one is old, how could they not have any illnesses?

261
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,190
What are you doing at the hospital?

262
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,370
I came to visit someone who also didn't take good care of herself

263
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,660
but Aunt, why are you here alone?

264
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,470
No one is with you?

265
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,710
Yes, there is.

266
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,150
My daughter is here with me.

267
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,170
Just now, I had a craving.

268
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,100
I wanted to eat Rose Candy.

269
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,160
I sent him to go buy some for me.

270
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,950
You like to eat Rose Candy as well?

271
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,470
I have been eating this for several years.

272
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,470
I really like this too

273
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,700
but if we eat too many sweet things,

274
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,300
it won't be good for recovering from illnesses.

275
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,610
Consider that you are fated.

276
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,310
I will share it with you when she has bought it.

277
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,070
Are you bribing me?

278
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,990
That's good too.

279
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,010
Wench. I have met you many times.

280
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,550
I still don't know your name.

281
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,390
Aunt. You can call me Cai Hong.

282
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,470
Cai Hong?

283
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,560
This is a nice name.

284
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,230
Sorry to disturb you, Madam.

285
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,500
Could you please verify this hospital form?

286
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,390
I can't read clearly.

287
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,340
Cai Hong, read this to me.

288
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,500
To the patient, Wang Mei Feng.

289
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,740
The address is Xian Hu Street, number 25.

290
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,490
The hospital stay was three months and eight days.

291
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,140
Principal doctor was Zhao Hai Yang. I filled it in correctly, right?

292
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,730
Yes.

293
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,150
Thank you, Nurse.

294
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,760
Don't mention it.

295
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,700
Cai Hong, thank you.

296
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,920
It's okay, Aunt.

297
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,540
After one reaches a certain age,

298
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,050
coming to the hospital is a common occurence.

299
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:06,600
I can't even read the words clearly on the paper.

300
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,370
My daughter is very busy. I didn't want to impose on them

301
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,790
to tell them to keep me company.

302
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,660
I wanted to read the newspaper

303
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,110
but I realised that I forgot my reading glasses.

304
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,790
Cai Hong. If you could,

305
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,100
could you go to my house to get my reading glasses?

306
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,760
Go to your house?

307
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,130
Well...

308
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,080
Am I making it inconvenient for you?

309
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,640
Of course not.

310
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,010
I will come back here after I have gotten it.

311
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,900
No need. Let's do this.

312
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,270
Bring it for me tomorrow. This way,

313
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,130
you will have time to stay and talk to me.

314
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,260
When the time comes, you'll think I'm annoying.

315
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,830
How could I?

316
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,590
It's okay. I will bring it for you tomorrow.

317
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,130
Okay.

318
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,150
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

319
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,900
Miss Wu. What's up?

320
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,540
I'm here to get Madam's reading glasses.

321
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,030
Okay, this way, please.

322
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,980
Come.

323
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,170
- Hello Housekeeper Qi. <br> - Where are you going?

324
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,940
The flowers in Young Master's room are wilting. I'm changing them.

325
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,710
Okay, go to the backyard and change them. Quickly now.

326
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,070
Your Young Master is staying there?

327
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,320
Yes. His room is over there.

328
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,820
It's pretty exquisite.

329
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,530
Housekeeper Ji! The accountant is over there looking for you.

330
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,850
He says there's an urgent matter.

331
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,490
Okay, I will go over now.

332
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,380
Miss, I have to go attend to some urgent matters.

333
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,010
I will bring the reading glasses to you later.

334
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,270
Thank you for the trouble.

335
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,890
Hello, Young Master.

336
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,750
What are you doing here?

337
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,310
I met Madam Jiang at the hospital.

338
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,490
She wanted me to come her to pick up something for her.

339
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,610
I was looking around your house.

340
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,630
What is there to look around?

341
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,430
You are not welcome here. Leave.

342
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,800
Miss Wu. Why are you here?

343
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,680
I brought Madam's reading glasses for you.

344
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,380
Okay, I know.

345
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,230
I'm leaving first.

346
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,410
Miss Wu. This is Madam's reading glasses.

347
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,570
Since Mr Jiang is back, he can deliver them to her.

348
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,130
Thank you.

349
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,700
Miss.

350
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,040
From the looks of it, the wound on his shoulder

351
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,870
was definitely caused by this fountain pen.

352
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,580
It's Jiang Yu.

353
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,170
Cai Hong, don't be rash first.

354
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,260
Even though, the wound was caused by a fountain pen,

355
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,940
we can't determine if it was this pen or not.

356
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,160
Superintendent Chen, you and my dad have been acquainted for more than ten years.

357
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,490
Based on your past friendship,

358
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,580
you must help me to find out the truth.

359
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,660
On the day the incident happened to Boss Wu, that day Jiang Yu came to find me.

360
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,620
Furthermore, Jiang Yu has always been planning to acquire Ling Long.

361
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,500
Thus, Cai Hong and I think that

362
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,590
he killed Boss Wu.

363
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:08,400
Even though this fountain pen is not strong evidence,

364
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,200
we could probably find more evidence with further investigation.

365
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,930
Don't talk about my friendship with your father first. <br>(It isn't just about our friendship.)

366
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,580
Even if we didn't have one <i>(relationship)</i>, I would still investigate this and find the killer.

367
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,880
I'm very thankful after hearing what you have said.

368
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,480
You don't need to thank me. I'm the police.

369
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,220
I'm only doing what I should do.

370
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,070
Hello. Go to Ling Long and tell Boss Jiang to come here.

371
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,610
Immediately.

372
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,840
Sorry. Who is Jiang Yu?

373
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,450
It's me.

374
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,360
Please come with us to the police bureau.

375
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,260
Wait.

376
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,400
What are you doing? Why are you taking my brother?

377
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,810
Sorry. We are only just following orders.

378
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,280
Let Mister Jiang assist in the investigation of Wu Hong Da's death.

379
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,670
Please understand.

380
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,280
What does Wu Hong Da's death have to do with my brother?

381
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,430
Do you have any evidence? Can the police just take him away like this?

382
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,770
We are only just following orders, Miss.

383
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,150
If you obstruct our duties,

384
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,270
I'm afraid you will have to go to jail with us too.

385
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,070
- You... <br>- Fei Fei.

386
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,210
No problem. I will go with you.

387
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:37,490
- Brother... <br>- Contact Lawyer Zhang and tell him to meet me there.

388
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,910
Mr Jiang. Do you recognise this fountain pen?

389
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,640
Of course, I know that this is a Parker pen

390
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,450
but how does this fountain pen concern me?

391
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,270
On Wu Hong Da's corpse,

392
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,270
we found a gold fragment

393
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,100
that was proven to belong to the Parker fountain pen.

394
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,510
So to say, the owner of this fountain pen,

395
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,190
could be the killer we are looking for.

396
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,360
This fountain pen is Jiang Yu's, you're smiting me!

397
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,290
You are trying to frame my brother.

398
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,670
Mr Jiang, sorry.

399
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,300
I'm just doing my work. I hope that you will cooperate with me.

400
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,540
Superintendent Chen,

401
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,600
let me ask you. Before you called me here,

402
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,190
did you thoroughly check this fountain pen?

403
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,020
You told me just now that you found a

404
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,960
golden piece of the Parker pen on the corpse.

405
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,140
But this fountain pen

406
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,550
doesn't seem to have any wears or tears.

407
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,400
Also, I know that this Parker pen is rare.

408
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,750
How long has it been since Wu Hong Da's case?

409
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,190
- More than a month. <br>- More than a month?

410
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,380
One month is enough for you,

411
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,940
you and especially you,

412
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,350
or perhaps someone else,

413
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:03,630
could have ordered the exact fountain pen from overseas.

414
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,520
Isn't this so?

415
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
Also,

416
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,480
how can you prove that this fountain pen

417
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,670
belongs to me?

418
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,730
Sorry. This fountain pen is really mine.

419
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,850
I would like to ask you. I just lost this fountain pen in my home.

420
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,450
Where did you pick it up from?

421
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,330
Can I formally file charges against

422
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,170
the person that stole the fountain pen from my home?

423
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,520
Don't make up stories! It's you who killed my dad!

424
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
Return my father to me!

425
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,560
- Cai Hong! <br> - What excuses are you making?!

426
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,940
Forget it. Don't be rash. Mr Jiang, sorry.

427
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,260
Forgive me for wasting your precious time.

428
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,460
Cai Hong is just a little girl, she doesn't know her manners.

429
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,290
Please forgive her.

430
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,680
Superintendent Chen, if you want to find me in the future,

431
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,470
don't waste your efforts.

432
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,380
Just call me and I will be here any time.

433
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,890
<i>Dad, don't worry.</i>

434
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,740
<i>I guarantee that</i>

435
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,040
<i>I will find the killer</i>

436
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,140
<i>and take revenge for you.</i>

437
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,470
<i>Stop making excuses, I know you killed my father!</i>

438
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,500
<i>Return my father to me.</i>

439
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,950
<i>It's you who killed my father.</i>

440
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,920
<i>It's her.</i>

441
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,280
<i>Why is she here? How dare she come here?</i>

442
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,180
<i>She's here again.</i>

443
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,470
<i>This...</i>

444
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,900
<i>Isn't this because of her?</i>

445
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,710
<i>She still dares to come here?</i>

446
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,160
Do you have documents for the boss?

447
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,510
Thank you.

448
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,670
<i>She is really brave.</i>

449
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,130
Wu Cai Hong.

450
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,810
You still dare to come back here?

451
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,450
<i>How could she come back here?</i>

452
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,650
Are you here to be scolded?

453
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,900
I came back just to work.

454
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,900
I think you are crazy.

455
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,050
Boss Jiang didn't sack me. I'm still an employee here.

456
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,480
Give me this.

457
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Before I lose my temper,

458
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,300
get lost.

459
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,300
<i>That Wu Cai Hong is too stubborn.</i>

460
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,060
Hello, this is Ling Long.

461
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,180
Wu Cai Hong. Why are you still there?

462
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,650
<i>Is Miss Fang there? Hand over the phone to her.</i>

463
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,590
Boss Jiang.

464
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,260
If there is anything, just instruct me to do it.

465
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:35,200
Immediately go and send someone to retrieve the log from the meeting two days ago.

466
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,960
Where are you? I will deliver it to you.

467
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,430
You don't need to bother about this. After going through what happened yesterday,

468
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,000
you are no longer my secretary.

469
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,040
I admit that I was at fault.

470
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,890
If you want to punish me, I will accept it.

471
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,700
However, I didn't break the secretary code.

472
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,100
I would like to continue to be your secretary.

473
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,740
Fine.

474
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,860
If you can bring that meeting log to me,

475
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,680
I will reconsider it.

476
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,690
Where are you now?

477
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:10,260
I'm next to a tree where the flowers have bloomed.

478
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,030
What? I...

479
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,390
Boss Jiang wants me to deliver this document to him.

480
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,770
Please pick up the documents from the floor.

481
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,980
You!

482
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,160
I wish you good luck and hope that you can find him.

483
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:10,100
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

484
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,260
What did you do?

485
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,210
I already told you so many times and you still don't understand?

486
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,920
Revise this. If you don't get it done by today, don't report back for work.

487
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
Yes.

488
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,340
Miss Fang, it's a call for you.

489
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,390
Hello, brother.

490
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,410
Zhou Shao Tian?

491
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,390
Sorry.

492
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,390
I'm late.

493
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,650
If I really want to continue to work at Ling Long?

494
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,060
If you think that by staying,

495
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,740
you can depend on your endless thinking ability

496
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,490
to find

497
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,570
evidence of your father's death...

498
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,400
Then I will fight until the end.

499
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,950
I don't want to fight with you.

500
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,120
- I'm really very tired. <br>- I'm only stating the facts.

501
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,020
You wanted me to find a tree with flowers that had bloomed.

502
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,730
I can find any street, large or small,

503
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,870
any park, any tree,

504
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,930
as long as Boss Jiang gives the order, anything's fine.

505
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,400
In your eyes,

506
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,000
am I that hateful?

507
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,240
Think whatever you like.

508
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,180
Cai Hong.

509
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,470
Brother Shao Tian.

510
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,900
I heard you were trying to find an absurd place.

511
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,950
I was worried and came over.

512
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,410
It's getting late. I will take you home.

513
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,480
Can I continue to work at Ling Long?

514
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,040
Where are the documents?

515
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,590
It's the same old time at 8 am.

516
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,170
Why do you want to work at Ling Long?

517
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,110
Cai Hong. I know you want to find out the reason for your father's death

518
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:33,000
but have you thought about what kind of a man Jiang Yu is?

519
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,680
You came over here that late in the night. Do you know how worried I was about you?

520
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,750
I'm fine, Brother Shao Tian.

521
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,060
Go back then.

522
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,160
Wu Cai Hong. You still have the face to sit here?

523
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,240
If you are smart, you should leave Ling Long.

524
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,830
Leave my brother. Or else, I will not let you off.

525
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,790
Miss. I'm really rushing the documents now.

526
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,870
If there is nothing else, please go back.

527
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,650
Stop acting.

528
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:46,490
What are you trying to do? What are you scheming?!

529
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,900
Boss Jiang has already gave me the consent to come back here.

530
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,460
My brother has been deceived by you, but I haven't!

531
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,810
- Men! <br>- Miss.

532
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,170
Drag her out of Ling Long.

533
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,220
Miss. Would you like to check with Boss Jiang first?

534
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,660
Why should I ask him? My word counts.

535
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,180
Get lost now.

536
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,710
Fei Fei.

537
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,710
Brother.

538
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,380
Come out with me for a while.

539
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,670
Brother. She caused us harm

540
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,950
and also Ling Long. Why are you retaining her?

541
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,190
Come out.

542
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,940
Brother. What is on your mind?

543
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,630
What do you mean?

544
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,170
Why did you let Wu Cai Hong come back to work?

545
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,400
Aren't you afraid that she will harm you again when she's back?

546
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,590
You don't need to bother about this.

547
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,780
I have my own plans.

548
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,230
What are your plans?

549
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,400
I didn't see you make any plans.

550
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,110
Is she making your mind restless?

551
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,990
Brother, don't forget

552
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:04,770
about how father died and how mom got sick.
