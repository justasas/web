The Cage of Love

19
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,430
<i>Episode 30</i>

20
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,660
People such as Lu Man are vicious like snakes and scorpions.

21
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,420
Moreover, she is obsessed with the recipe. There is an 80% chance that she killed your father.

22
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,440
But to find a flaw in Lu Man's actions or any criminal evidence,

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,980
I'm afraid it won't be that easy.

24
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,210
What should we do then? Are we going to just sit here and wait?

25
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,040
As police, we need evidence in our line of work.

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,030
I can't do anything without any evidence.

27
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,490
Why don't we do this?

28
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,570
Let's start from her subordinates first.

29
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,070
I'm know some of her employees. I will check with them to see if there are any leads.

30
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,920
- Let me give you a lift. <br>-I'm walking back.

31
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,780
After being in jail for some time, I would like to have some fresh air and walk around a bit.

32
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,060
- Brother Shao Tian I... <br>-It's getting late. Go home now.

33
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,780
<i>Cai Hong. I must get used to not being with you anymore.</i>

34
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,060
<i>I will continue to walk alone.</i>

35
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,590
-Brother Shao Tian.<br>- Zhang Xuan, I hope you can help me with something,

36
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,890
Brother Shao Tian. Don't say this. It was fortunate that you took care of me when I was with Rong Da.

37
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,300
I heard about what happened to you.

38
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,720
Don't worry. I'm a righteous person.

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,560
I know. If this isn't the case, I wouldn't have looked for you.

40
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,930
You have been with Miss Lu for many years. I would like to you find something for me discreetly.

41
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,320
Brother Shao Tian, please tell me.

42
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,830
At that time, if it weren't for you, I would have been living in the ghettos.

43
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:12,140
Fortunately, your money has helped my mother to cure her illness. I will repay you properly.

44
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,750
I want you to find out for me

45
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,030
about Miss Lu's schedule the day of Wu Hong Da's incident.

46
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,710
This...

47
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,380
- Brother Shao Tian, this is not about money. <br>- I know that it's about money.

48
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,320
This money can help you get through the critical times.

49
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,020
This is very important to me.

50
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,010
Take it as you are doing me a favour.

51
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,830
Okay?

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,140
Brother Shao Tian, I will do my best. Wait for my news.

53
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,570
Whether I'm successful or not, I will contact you.

54
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,220
Thank you, Zhang Xuan.

55
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,080
After this is done,

56
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,150
I will thank you again.

57
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,340
Brother.

58
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,150
Where are you going?

59
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,780
Since when do I need to report to you before I go out?

60
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,770
Every day, you leave the house and come back late.

61
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,170
Do you know that I haven't seen you for a long time?

62
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,920
I haven't recovered from my injuries yet.

63
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,300
I don't want Mom to see me in this condition.

64
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,090
She will worry about me.

65
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:54,310
That's right. If Mom were to find out that you were beaten into this condition because of Wu Cai Hong,

66
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,440
it won't be that simple as being worried about you.

67
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,060
Brother, the murderer will be caught. Mother does not even need to know Cai Hong's identity.

68
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,490
Stay home and take good care of Mom. Don't bother about other matters.

69
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:31,970
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

70
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,060
Jiang Yu. Now what?

71
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,560
Director Li said we have to find hard evidence,

72
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,550
so that we can find an excuse for Lu Man to be investigated at the police station.

73
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,910
If not, it will be hard to explain to the Military Governor.

74
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,950
It's okay. There will definitely be a way.

75
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,150
The investigation has been going on for a long time.

76
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,990
In fact, you have already been cleared of all suspicions.

77
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,800
Thank you for still helping me.

78
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,880
By the way, will you be going to Ling Long?

79
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,790
No. I'm going to the hospital for a check up.

80
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,290
Can I go with you?

81
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:49,310
I'm not a three year old kid. Why would I need someone to go with me to the hospital?

82
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:55,310
I let you go with me to investigate the case. Why can't I go with you to the hospital?

83
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,990
Just regard this as I'm paying you back.

84
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,100
Let's go then.

85
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,150
Brother. Can I move back to stay here now? <i>Huzhou</i>

86
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,150
Wait a while more.

87
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,070
Wait until we capture Lu Man, then you can move back.

88
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,070
I asked around. They gave up after looking for me for a few days.

89
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,630
I think they will not give me any problems again.

90
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,330
Lu Man didn't find you to create trouble because she doesn't want you to expose her identity.

91
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,000
This woman is very shady and toxic.

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,060
Most likely she is already planning a surprise attack. We better be careful.

93
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,110
This is not the first day I was beaten up and harmed.

94
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,060
Don't worry. I will be careful.

95
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,080
Brother, look at yourself. You look more haggard.

96
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,990
Have a good rest. Don't overwork yourself.

97
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
Brother.

98
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,990
Are you thinking about Wu Cao Hong again?

99
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,710
I must manage Rong Da properly because of Cai Hong

100
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,020
and also help her to find her father's killer.

101
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,990
Okay.

102
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,170
This is great wine. Where did you get this great wine from?

103
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,330
Brother, you are Miss Lu's favourite person now.

104
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,020
Since Miss is favouring you, you could do few things for me, right?

105
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,860
There's nothing bad with ripping the benefits. Tell me.

106
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,290
What can I help you with?

107
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,760
What do you mean, brother.

108
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,250
I only want to get closer to you.

109
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,040
Every time Miss Lu goes out to handle some major matter,

110
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,740
she only takes Uncle Lai along.

111
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,240
Not only that.

112
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,230
Now even the warlord's people treat me with respect.

113
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,440
All the big and small dyeing factories in Huzhou. That Ling Long and Hua Mei,

114
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,570
I know them very well.

115
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,660
Yes.

116
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,800
When Miss Lu went to see Wu Da Hong of Ling Long,

117
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,020
that old man died after that.

118
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,520
How do you know about this?

119
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,840
Uncle Lai mentioned this when we came here for a meal.

120
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm only just guessing.

121
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,990
This is really a good wine.

122
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,470
Don't talk any nonsense.

123
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,930
If you talk any nonsense,

124
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,990
you will die.

125
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,400
Look. I already told you many times.

126
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,830
Fei Fei. Why don't I see your brother lately?

127
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,970
He is too busy with work.

128
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,510
He leaves the house early every day and comes home late.

129
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,550
It could be that he doesn't have the time to come here.

130
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,540
But no matter how busy he is, he should also find time to visit you.

131
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,490
Don't worry, I will lecture him on your behalf.

132
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,650
This little cotton-padded jacket will suffice for his attention.

133
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,590
Let your brother do what a man is supposed to do.

134
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:51,070
But you must advise your brother to take care of his health.

135
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,530
I know.

136
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,100
The doctor already said that you shouldn't let water touch your wounds.

137
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,390
It will heal fast, but can be very itchy. It would be good to use a clutch for a while.

138
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,440
Okay, I know.

139
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,060
Yu Er.

140
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,170
Mom.

141
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,720
Yu Er, Cai Hong.

142
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,750
What are you doing here?

143
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,120
I had some injuries and came here for treatments. I'm better now.

144
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,860
Everything is already fine.

145
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,780
How did you get hurt?

146
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,990
You should ask Cai Hong about this.

147
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,750
I'm sorry, Madam Jiang. Master Jiang got injured because of me.

148
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,010
I will personally apologise to you another day.

149
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,400
Cai Hong. Ever since you left, I have been missing you.

150
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,140
Why didn't you visit me?

151
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,200
What do you want to tell me?

152
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,520
Mom.

153
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,760
Do you want me to start from your family name?

154
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,920
Fei Fei. What are you trying to say?

155
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,160
Mom, don't stand here.

156
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,690
I will take you home first. Come.

157
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,990
Come with me. I have something to tell you.

158
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,380
What did you wanted to tell my mom just now?

159
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,090
I wanted to apologise to her for what my father did.

160
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,950
You should keep quiet.

161
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,360
Do you know why my brother didn't want you to say anything just now?

162
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,530
My mom is an ill person which was caused by your father.

163
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,770
Your presence will only agitate her.

164
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,240
If my mom gets sick again,

165
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,090
when that time comes, the first person who won't let you off is my brother.

166
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:58,090
It was my father's fault. Thus, I wanted to do something for the Jiang family and your brother.

167
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,470
If you really feel a guilty conscious and want to do something for my mom,

168
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,280
please stay far away from her.

169
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,370
Our family is finally enjoying peaceful days. Don't trouble us, please.

170
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,420
I'm not trying to create a mess.

171
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,860
- I only want to... <br>- I know very well what you are thinking

172
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,160
but you will never get rid of your debt.

173
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,900
If you continues on, the matter will only get worse.

174
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,550
My mom can't take on any more traumas.

175
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,910
She would go crazy when she hears Wu Hong Da's name.

176
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,990
How could she able to accept you?

177
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,960
She'd rather my brother never marry or have children.

178
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,980
She will also never accept Wu Hong Da's daughter.

179
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,270
- Hello. <br>- Brother Shao Tian. I found out what you wanted.

180
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,620
Let's meet at the usual place later.

181
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,020
Okay.

182
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,060
What did you tell Cai Hong at the hospital just now?

183
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:34,020
Other than the grudges between our families, what else do you think I would tell her?

184
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,590
Fei Fei. Cai Hong is different from her father.

185
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:45,810
We shouldn't let our grudges run through the next generation.

186
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,930
You are right

187
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,780
but would you dare to tell Mom this?

188
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,070
Do you think Mom will accept her?

189
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:57,030
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

190
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:25,720
Sister. It's late. What are you looking for?

191
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,560
I'm looking for my slave contract.

192
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,910
I'm going back to the Jiang family.

193
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:34,300
It wasn't easy for you to leave from the Jiang family. Why are you jumping back in the fire?

194
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,100
There are certain things you wouldn't understand.

195
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,680
Yes, I don't understand.

196
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:44,760
Dad is already dead and Ling Long has been returned to Jiang Yu. What else do we owe them?

197
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,770
We owe them a healthy mother

198
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,360
and remorse for what happened to deceased Master Jiang.

199
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,160
I'm going back to the Jiang family and will seek forgiveness from Madam Jiang.

200
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,450
If not, I won't have peace for the rest of my life.

201
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,900
Are you really doing this to redeem yourself of the crimes?

202
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,820
Yes.

203
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,760
I'm also doing this for myself.

204
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,970
Don't tell me that this is Zhang Xuan's corpse.

205
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240
I caused him to die.

206
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,920
What exactly is going on?

207
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,620
Don't be anxious. Take your time to tell me.

208
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,470
He was Lu Man's employee. I met him a few days ago.

209
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,980
I wanted him to find out the schedule of Lu Man on the day of Wu Hong Da's incident.

210
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,650
I didn't imagine that...

211
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,360
It's another victim again.

212
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,440
Lu Man must be behind this.

213
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,700
Let's do this.

214
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,520
I will call Jiang Yu first and then find someone to pick up Cai Hong.

215
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,060
Let's have a meeting to see what we should do next.

216
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,080
I will go and pick up Cai Hong.

217
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,960
Be careful on the way. Lu Man may take action.

218
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,190
- Hello. <br>- Is that Mr Jiang?

219
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,450
- Yes, I am. <br>- This is Director Chen.

220
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,750
We found a corpse this morning.

221
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,410
He probably is Lu Man's employee, Zhang Xuan.

222
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,910
He should have something to do with our investigation on Lu Man.

223
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,190
I hope you can come down to the police station and help decide what our next step is.

224
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,420
Okay, no problem.

225
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,940
I will bring Wu Cai Hong along with me.

226
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,970
No need. Zhou Shao Tian has already gone to pick her up.

227
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,480
Also, be careful. Lu Man will find men to take revenge.

228
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,980
Don't worry, we will.

229
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,150
What are you doing here?

230
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,770
I'm a maid with the Jiang family. I came back willingly.

231
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,930
Don't tell me you need to see the slave contract?

232
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,830
Didn't you always want to leave?

233
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,900
Since you have already left, why did you come back?

234
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,070
You know the reason why I'm back.

235
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,120
Do you really need to do this?

236
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,590
Whatever has happened has already happened.

237
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,320
What we can only do

238
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,450
is to remember what we should remember.

239
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,450
You must accept that we wouldn't be able to change anything.

240
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:01,860
Before we can't change everything, I must work hard.

241
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:09,230
I want to seek Madam Jiang's forgiveness. If she doesn't forgive me, I won't leave.

242
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,990
What if my mom really won't forgive you?

243
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,970
If I don't work hard, how would we know the result?

244
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,070
If you want to remain here, fine. Do whatever you want.

245
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,540
But you should know that

246
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,650
no one in the Jiang family will welcome you.

247
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,470
I know

248
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,980
but there will always be someone to help me.

249
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,000
- Brother Shao Tian. <br>- Xiao Yun. Where is your sister?

250
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,520
She went out early this morning.

251
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,220
Where did she go?

252
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,590
She went to find Jiang Yu.

253
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,740
Brother Shao Tian. Is anything the matter? I will relay to the message to her.

254
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,060
No need. Thanks.

255
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,040
Mr Zhou. You are here just in time.

256
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,290
The report of Zhang Xuan's corpse is out.

257
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:43,610
There are stab wounds on his neck, but also some traces of a nail grip.

258
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,170
Thus, we are sure the river is not the scene of the crime.

259
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,980
Rather a place where body was dumped.

260
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,570
I caused him to die.

261
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,970
Zhang Xuan called me that day.

262
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,570
He said that he found out what happened with Boss Wu that day.

263
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:05,330
If he looked for you, this clearly proves that he found evidence of my father's killer.

264
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,620
That's why they took action on him. It's a pity we were one step behind.

265
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,300
Lu Man has already gone insane.

266
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,490
I think not before long we will be able to find the evidence and bring her to justice.

267
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,560
What we need to do now is to keep the secret formula in a safe place.

268
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,520
Lu Man's motive is to get the secret formula.

269
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,550
Thus, the three of you must watch your safety.

270
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,030
The police will also protect you.

271
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:44,530
Cai Hong. You must remember what Director Chen said.

272
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,090
I know Lu Man. She is very cruel.

273
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:51,560
She will never let it rest. You must watch your safety.

274
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,950
Don't worry. Cai Hong will be staying with my famiiy for the time being.

275
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,910
Why?

276
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,400
Because my slave contract hasn't expired. Thus...

277
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,830
Jiang Yu. Did you forget that I bought the contract and returned it to you personally?

278
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,400
Why did you go back on your words?

279
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,970
It was my own decision to go back to the Jiang family.

280
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,490
Did you forget how the Jiang family treated you?

281
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:16,980
It's because of how they treated me, that's why I want to seek Madam's forgiveness and apologise to her.

282
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,920
Don't worry about this.

283
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,120
It's the safest place for Cai Hong to stay at my home.

284
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,090
Brother Shao Tian. Don't worry about me. I know what I'm doing.

285
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,070
Since you have already thought it through,

286
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,970
fine then.

287
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,090
If you are not comfortable staying at the Jiang's home,

288
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,030
just come back.

289
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,970
- Young Master. <br>- Prepare a clean guest room for Miss Wu.

290
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,610
- Yes. <br>- No need. I can stay at the staff quarters.

291
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,160
Ignore her. Take Miss Wu's suitcase to the guest room first.

292
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,240
Okay.

293
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,790
Brother.

294
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,580
Why did you bring her back again?

295
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,240
Didn't you understand what I told you yesterday?

296
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,870
I thought about it and think that it's still best I come back to seek your mother's forgiveness.

297
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,990
What are you trying to do?

298
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,360
Your family already caused my mom to be in this condition.

299
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,070
Are you going to traumatize her here?

300
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,930
- Fei Fei. <br>- Don't stop me.

301
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,570
I just don't understand.

302
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,290
You are a refined woman. Why is your skin so thick?

303
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:50,410
You still insist on coming here even though we beat and scolded you.

304
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:56,500
I know that you don't like me. No matter how you scold me, I don't care about it.

305
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,960
I wanted to say that Madam Jiang has been sick for so many years, living in the shadow of the past.

306
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,080
If I can really seek her forgiveness and make her let go of everything in the past,

307
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,710
perhaps, this may be of help in her recovery.

308
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,280
Impossible. I will never let you do this.

309
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,750
I have been taking care of my mom for many years.

310
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:22,140
I know her condition. I will never let anyone traumatize or harm her.

311
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,320
I will slowly talk to her. I can wait for her.

312
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,090
One month, a year or even forever until she forgives me.

313
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,670
Stop dreaming.

314
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,080
As long as I'm here, I will never let you go near my mom

315
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,020
and traumatize her.

316
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,360
Cai Hong?

317
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,800
Cai Hong, it's you.

318
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,720
Did you miss me and came to see me?

319
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,110
Madam. I plan to come back here today to take care of her.

320
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,120
Really?

321
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,520
I heard from my son that you found a boyfriend and will be getting married.

322
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,840
What happened?

323
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,770
We already broke up.

324
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,920
Child. Let bygones be bygones.

325
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,460
Starting from now, regard this as your home and stay here in peace.

326
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,760
Thank you, Madam Jiang.

327
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,070
I only know that you are Cai Hong. I don't know your family name.

328
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,980
- My family name is Wu. <br>- Wu Cai Hong?

329
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,590
Madam. If you are willing, I will slowly tell you about myself.

330
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,340
I will slowly tell you stories about me and let you get to know the real me.

331
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,850
Okay. I can tell that you must have suffered.

332
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,730
Take time to tell me your stories.

333
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,940
If you have any difficulties, you must tell me. I will help you.

334
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,030
Yu Er will also help you.

335
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,890
Brother. Why did you let Wu Cai Hong into our family again?

336
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,280
What you promised in the past,

337
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,430
did you forget all about it?

338
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,700
This morning a dead body was found in the river.

339
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,190
Director Chen suspects that Lu Man killed him to silence him.

340
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:37,120
Director Chen hopes that everyone connected to the Wu Da Hong's case

341
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,460
must be extra careful.

342
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:45,720
I allowed Wu Cai Hong to move in with us. It's all entirely for her safety.

343
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,950
Why are we considering her safety?

344
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,650
No matter what, she is still our enemy.

345
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,600
Even more so when she is just a common stranger.

346
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,140
We don't need to accept her into our family and protect her twenty four hours a day.

347
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,050
Our grudge with the Wu family has already ended.

348
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:13,860
No matter what you say, you can't change the fact that Wu Cai Hong's father killed our father.

349
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,440
You can forget about this deep grudge

350
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,070
but mom and I will never forget this.

351
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,610
I think you should make Wu Cai Hong leave this house as soon as possible.

352
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,140
Since Lu Man is such a maniac,

353
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,230
you shouldn't let her stay here with us.

354
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:39,090
You should be concerned for your and the Jiang family's safety.

355
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,220
I dare to guarantee that

356
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,210
at least Lu Man wouldn't dare to kill us here.

357
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,700
You don't have to worry safety.

358
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,210
I'm already involved in the Wu Hong Da's case.

359
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,490
If I were to stop now, I'm afraid Lu Man will never let me off.

360
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:05,070
Only when we lock her up, we will then be truly safe.

361
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,970
What you mean is that

362
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,080
before Lu Man is caught,

363
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,910
Wu Cai Hong will be staying with us.

364
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,880
I think that even if Lu Man is caught,

365
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,910
Wu Cai Hong will never leave the Jiang family.

366
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,250
Everything that you are doing

367
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,540
is only an excuse for you to keep her with you.

368
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,810
Am I right?

369
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,360
Child. When your brain and heart are in trouble,

370
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:15,040
you should have sunlight. You won't have any shadows in your face then.

371
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,410
Thank you, Madam.

372
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,050
Are you willing to tell me your stories now?

373
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,480
Are you really willing to hear my stories?

374
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,700
I'm ready.

375
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,510
I actually have a complete and happy family.

376
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:41,530
Even though my mother died young, I had a father who doted on me.

377
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,960
Under the love, care and protection of my father,

378
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,890
I temporarily forgot the pain of losing my mother.

379
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,920
But not long after that,

380
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,600
my life stopped suddently when I was nineteen years old

381
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,160
and my father was killed.

382
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,230
With the murderer still at large,

383
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,290
my family's business went bankrupt too.

384
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,750
I also have a stepmother and sister.

385
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,520
We were kicked out of the house by the debtors.

386
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,050
Overnight, we became homeless.

387
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,870
No wonder

388
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,130
you are young but on your face,

389
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,640
your age does not match your sorrow.

390
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,780
This wasn't only due to what happened to your family,

391
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:38,990
you also lost your most beloved one.

392
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,930
Cai Hong. If you are willing,

393
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,890
I can be your mother

394
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,410
and you can regard Jiang Yu as your brother.

395
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,070
Frankly, in my heart, you are just like Fei Fei.

396
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,880
We are different.

397
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,310
I don't deserve you being nice to me.

398
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,010
I...

399
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,340
Actually, I'm...

400
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,080
I am actually...

401
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,370
When my father passed away, I then realised that

402
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:19,590
he did many things in the past that I wasn't aware of.

403
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,930
In my eyes he was a respected and competent man.

404
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:31,400
But later, because of a moment of greed, he hurt many people.

405
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,610
He did many unethical things.

406
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,440
I really don't understand

407
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,610
how my kind father could be so ruthless.

408
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,950
I also don't want to believe that he was the same person.

409
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,570
I realised now

410
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,530
your grief must stem from your father's case then.

411
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,020
It's not only this.

412
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:00,520
I think I am also very sorry towards all victims of that time.

413
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,360
For the past days,

414
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,620
I have been living in pain and felt utmost remorse.

415
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,280
Child, this is your father's fault.

416
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,110
It's not your fault.

417
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:17,180
Out of my selfishness, I wanted to forgive him

418
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,530
but when I thought about what he did,

419
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,970
I really can't forget about it.

420
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,490
I don't want to forgive him either.

421
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:31,160
That's because you love your father very much and can't accept that he is corrupted.

422
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,220
You will feel a more guilty conscious to those he had harmed.

423
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:41,480
But Cai Hong, it was your father that committed the wrong deeds.

424
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,540
Your grief will not change his wrongdoings.

425
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:50,040
but talking about this, he is just your father.

426
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,770
He only just wanted to be a good father.

427
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,470
You don't have any other reasons to hate him.

428
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,330
As his daughter,

429
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,920
you only need to think about how well he treated you.

430
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,780
Don't hate him again.

431
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,930
Child, we must learn to let it go.

432
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,180
Can I really let it go?

433
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,740
Letting go is easy to say but hard to do.

434
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,370
Don't look at me for an answer to your plight.

435
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:25,150
For the more than ten years, I find it hard to let it go too.

436
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,890
Hard to?

437
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,990
Wu Cai Hong. I overheard your conversation with my mom.

438
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,090
I haven't told Madam about this yet

439
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:10,740
but I believe in Madam. She is a very kind person.

440
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,210
- She will definitely forgive me. <br>- Stop dreaming.

441
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:19,150
I'm here to tell you not to think that my mom will really forgive you.

442
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,040
My mom is definitely a very kind person

443
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,720
but her kindness

444
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,600
caused her family to go bankrupt. To her enemy,

445
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,730
it will be totally useless.

446
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,760
She said that to you because she sympathises and pities you.

447
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,610
What's even more important is that

448
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,470
she doesn't know that it was your father who ruined our Jiang family.

449
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,970
No matter what,

450
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:48,910
I will use my sincerity to seek forgiveness from your mom.

451
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,980
Are you being sincere or selfish?

452
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,510
You want my mom to forgive you

453
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,520
so she can support you and my brother through thick and thin.

454
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:05,510
You want her to accept you because you want to be with my brother. Am I right?

455
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,480
You have misunderstood me.

456
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:13,150
All this hatred stems from my father's deeds.

457
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,680
Thus, I want to use my sincerity

458
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,400
to end the grudge.

459
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,760
Whether it's a misunderstanding or not,

460
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,060
I still want to tell you that

461
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:32,060
my mom and the Jiang family will never accept a woman who is tainted with the blood of our enemy.

462
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,270
Whether you believe it or not, or whether you will accept it or not,

463
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,900
my repentance is sincere.

464
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:57,390
When it was getting dark, Zhang Xuan said that he wanted to go home. After he left, he was never seen again.

465
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,600
I don't know who killed him.

466
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,490
Did you say anything to him before he died?

467
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,120
No.

468
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,020
- Any abnormalities? <br>- I saw none.

469
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,380
Wasn't he fine?

470
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,450
- Who was he close with? <br>-How would I know?

471
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,090
How can I answer it when I have no idea?

472
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:18,020
- I'm really not close to him. <br>- I really don't know.

473
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,220
Enough, let them go.

474
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,940
Let's go.

475
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:31,930
Director, this Lu Man employees acted really arrogant toward the society.

476
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,860
We interrogated them for the entire afternoon. They all know nothing.

477
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,060
It's very obvious that they all came prepared.

478
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,200
They are very clear about what they should say and not say.

479
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,960
It's okay. Think of another solution.

480
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,190
Yes.

481
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,670
Brother Shao Tian, Brother Ma Li. My sister is not at home.

482
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:52,050
I know that Cai Hong is not here. I came to visit you and Madam Wu.

483
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,030
Ma Li, bring the stuff in.

484
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,640
Cai Yun. We have been investigating your father's case lately.

485
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,320
Murderers kill people in order to conceal their crimes.

486
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,730
Thus, for this period of time, don't leave home unnecessarily.

487
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,590
Try not to go to remote places. It might be gangerous for the time being.

488
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,040
Dangerous?

489
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,920
In this world, who else is more dangerous than you?

490
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,280
- Mrs Wu, don't you know that good people...<br>- I see you are no good person!

491
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,030
- I... <br>- Ma Li.

492
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,150
Mom.

493
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,700
Madam Wu, Cai Yun. I only hope that you will be careful about your safety.

494
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,720
I understand.

495
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,620
We are taking our leave then.

496
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,790
You are still not leaving?

497
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,550
Yu Er. Cai Hong has suffered a lot.

498
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,870
Try to spend more of your free time with her and cheer her up.

499
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:58,360
Mom. What did Cai Hong tell you?

500
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,130
Cai Hong told me

501
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:11,590
that when she was young, her biological mother passed away.

502
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:17,040
The only family who loved her was her father was killed subsequently.

503
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,120
When her family went bankrupt,

504
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,040
she found out that her father did many unethical things.

505
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:32,260
On one hand, she cannot accept such brutal facts,

506
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,460
on the other hand, she feels guilty about the victims.

507
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,580
This was her father's fault. What has it to do with Cai Hong?

508
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,450
The way Cai Hong thinks about this, it show that

509
