1
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:16,686
[Green] All right, here's
the plan. Triple-cuff him.

2
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:19,522
Alpha team, you take point
positions in the convoy.

3
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,816
Bravo team will bring up the rear.

4
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,275
Remember, we're clear to engage,

5
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:26,486
so if he so much as looks
at you funny, light him up.

6
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:27,905
[officer 1] Copy that.

7
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:30,825
You hear that, freak? I got
something special for you.

8
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:35,788
This isn't necessary.

9
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:38,332
Yeah, it is.

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,461
[indistinct chatter]

11
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:46,966
[groans]

12
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:50,344
No. You need to let us
finish. Ms. Knight. Ms. Knight!

13
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:53,430
It's Detective Knight, and I'm fine.

14
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:58,018
I need a moment with Cage.

15
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:00,479
[Green] Misty, we have special orders.

16
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:02,898
Mario, come on.

17
00:01:03,816 --> 00:01:05,317
I was just held hostage.

18
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:07,862
I just need a minute with him.

19
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:14,869
All right. We'll be right
here. We got your back.

20
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:17,204
[officer 2] Clear!

21
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:19,414
You going down.

22
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,251
It's about damn time.

23
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:27,381
Cottonmouth, Officer Albini,
what just popped off in there...

24
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:31,761
Look, your friend is in the wind.

25
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:39,059
They've got public enemy number one in
handcuffs for the whole world to see...

26
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:42,104
so they're not looking for anybody else.

27
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:48,443
Every officer in your detail
has those modified Judas bullets.

28
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:51,321
I wouldn't try anything if I were you...

29
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:54,700
before I got to the precinct.

30
00:01:57,244 --> 00:01:59,538
You're not that crazy, are you?

31
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,457
Always.

32
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:09,006
Take his ass to jail.

33
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:12,134
Come on.

34
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,187
[officer 2] All right,
let's go. We're rolling.

35
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,104
[sirens wailing]

36
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,279
Three sets of cuffs?
Isn't that overkill?

37
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:35,157
The camera's on. We need to
look like we're in control.

38
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:38,285
[officer 1] It's a shit detail.

39
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:41,371
You'd think ESU would be in the
back with those guns pointed at him.

40
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:43,290
We've got the same guns
and bullets they do.

41
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,668
You know, my wife says
it's the end of days,

42
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:47,586
people like him popping up.

43
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:51,506
They've been saying that
since Eve bit the apple.

44
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,175
Cage? He's evolution.

45
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:56,136
[stammers] Whatever
he is, it's just scary.

46
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,723
Makes me feel small. Insignificant.

47
00:02:58,806 --> 00:03:00,640
Insecure?

48
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:03,894
You know what they say. Once
you go black, you never go back.

49
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:05,896
At least that's what your
wife keeps telling me.

50
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,026
I was fast asleep when she came home.
Your daughter already wore me out.

51
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,569
[officer 2] Just sit tight.

52
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:19,243
God damn it.

53
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,829
Homeless lady. Can't they
move her out of the way?

54
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:24,224
[Green on loudspeaker] You are
in the path of a police convoy.

55
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:25,916
Clear the road immediately.

56
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:28,961
[tires screeching]

57
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,963
[officer 3] Come on!

58
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:33,758
[Green on loudspeaker] Cage
must not escape. Fire at will!

59
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:36,468
[officer 3] Go, go, go, go, go!

60
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,013
He went down the south side.

61
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:42,307
[guns firing]

62
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:45,310
[officers shouting indistinctly]

63
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:47,538
[officer 4 on radio] <i>Somebody
give me a sitrep right now!</i>

64
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,857
[officer 5] Team two...
Let's go, let's go!

65
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:53,110
[officers shouting indistinctly]

66
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,046
[sirens wailing]

67
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:16,133
[shotgun cocks]

68
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:23,640
Young cops always wanna chase somebody.

69
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:26,143
Me, I'd rather be where
they're already going.

70
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:30,773
They told us these Judas bullets
can kill someone like you.

71
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:33,650
You don't want to die? Don't run.

72
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,735
I'd rather die than go back to prison.

73
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,822
[scoffs] Live free or die?

74
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:39,715
You wanna get all New
Hampshire about this shit?

75
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,075
Fine with me.

76
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:44,578
- Cop killers don't survive these streets.
- I didn't kill a cop.

77
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:48,290
My problem isn't with you or yours.

78
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:50,000
It's much bigger than that.

79
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:52,586
Some people are calling
you a hero for what you did.

80
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,713
Connie's, Pop's...

81
00:04:55,214 --> 00:04:57,091
I'm no hero.

82
00:04:57,174 --> 00:05:00,135
But I do need to take out the
person responsible for all this.

83
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:04,264
- You don't recognize me, do you?
- [sirens continue wailing]

84
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:10,020
I've seen you at Pop's before.

85
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:13,523
Pop cut my hair for 12 years.

86
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:15,359
He didn't think he was a hero, either.

87
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:18,112
He was just trying to do some
right after years of wrong.

88
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,202
I hope I'm right about you.

89
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:29,081
More people rooting
for you than you think.

90
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:32,835
- What are you gonna tell your people?
- The truth.

91
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:34,837
I had you in my sights,
but you outran me.

92
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,338
I'm getting old.

93
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:39,967
Luke?

94
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:43,262
You better catch that
slippery son of a bitch.

95
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:56,650

Moments after the tumultuous
events at Harlem's Paradise,

98
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:15,479
<i>fugitive and alleged cop killer Luke
Cage was brought out in handcuffs.</i>

99
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:17,064
<i>And now the city's most...</i>

100
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:19,191
[Turk] Hey, I'm glad
you called me, Willis.

101
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:22,444
Luke Cage is on the run.
They got Shades in bracelets,

102
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:24,696
but they're gonna be onto
you before long, brother.

103
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,573
Best believe that.

104
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:29,659
Getting ghost and liquidizing
your cash, that was the right move.

105
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:33,830
<i>- Luke Cage must be approached with...</i>
- [Stryker] I wouldn't touch any of that.

106
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:34,914
[door opens]

107
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,584
[door closes]

108
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,212
People don't test me more than once.

109
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,632
- I overstand.
- Hmm.

110
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:47,677
What you need me for?

111
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:51,556
I understand you're a man
of discretion and taste

112
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,103
with numerous connections willing
to pay full price for my wares.

113
00:07:56,186 --> 00:07:58,438
I can still collect from the shadows.

114
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:00,857
- Bad news, Diamondback.
- Take those off!

115
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:06,863
I went to your crib. The
files you had are gone.

116
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:15,539
[choking]

117
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,624

[laughs]

120
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:29,428
- I had you, didn't I?
- [coughing]

121
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:31,430
[Stryker continues laughing]

122
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:36,185
I couldn't resist.

123
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:40,939
I like you, Zip.

124
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:44,068
You've got ambition.
It'll take you far...

125
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:46,320
as long as you stay in your place.

126
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:49,281
The first of the 48 laws of power.

127
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:52,617
Never outshine the master.

128
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:55,412
That was the mistake Shades made.

129
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:58,707
He questioned me. He doubted
me. He tried to reach too far.

130
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,585
He was on some Icarus shit.

131
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:05,464
Do you know who that is?

132
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:08,550
Yeah, he had a verse with Kendrick.

133
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,053
- Right?
- No...

134
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:15,140
Icarus was the boy who flew too
close to the sun with fake wings.

135
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:19,018
Shades is no problem.
He's still in custody.

136
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,562
Not for long.

137
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,400
- You gonna blow the joint up?
- No, he's going to be bailed out.

138
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:29,488
The hell for? That don't make no sense!

139
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:31,823
See? The questioning.

140
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:33,783
That's how it starts.

141
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:35,327
[sighs]

142
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:44,961
I'm gonna have an opening.

143
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,964
You gonna step up?

144
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,259
I'm down to do whatever you need.

145
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:53,387
- No problem.
- [Stryker] Good boy.

146
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,014
So are you down?

147
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:58,808
I'm down.

148
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:02,061
As long as the business is
business, I'm good with it.

149
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:04,314
Till then, I'm out of here, man.

150
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:06,900
Show Turk out, Zip.

151
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:15,909
Romeo would roll over in his grave,

152
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:18,828
the way you hop-skipping
with these cats nowadays.

153
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:21,248
He was a man on these
streets. You's a boy.

154
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:23,167
What the hell are you talking about?

155
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,877
You're down here in
his pocket, same as me.

156
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,796
I'm doing business with him, yes.

157
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:32,634
But I ain't his boy. And I
definitely ain't his bitch.

158
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:44,604
- [door slams]
- [Zip scoffs]

159
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:47,941
These old-ass niggas talkin' about
shit they don't even know about.

160
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:50,569
So... what's in the box?

161
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:54,489
One of the seven deadly sins, my boy...

162
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:57,534
which I plan to unleash
on dear old Carl.

163
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:58,785
Which one?

164
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:01,913
Wrath.

165
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:08,044
[in Spanish] This Diamondback
needs to be dealt with.

166
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:15,260
Ernesto is right, Domingo. This
is the perfect time to do it.

167
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:17,637
We've got the muscle.

168
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:24,143
Plus, with the Cuban, Jamaican,
Dominican and Haitian leaders dead,

169
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:29,107
we can control the
drugs, guns, all of it...

170
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:32,277
and walk out like kings.

171
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:36,240
[in English] I was there
when he took them all out.

172
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:38,617
Right next door.

173
00:11:40,452 --> 00:11:42,496
We got the drugs.

174
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:44,456
We got that money.

175
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:48,042
But with the guns, we
can control everything.

176
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:51,255
Here, the islands, further south...

177
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:56,260
We'd be unstoppable. Hmm?

178
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:59,178
[Ernesto in Spanish]
So what are you saying?

179
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:03,141
[in English] We take him out.

180
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,270
We go after what's ours.

181
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:08,522
[Ernesto scoffs and chuckles]

182
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:12,191
Let's go find Diamondback.

183
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:16,112
[sighs]

184
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,991
- [camera shutter clicking]
- [officer 1] Turn and face the camera.

185
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:27,973
[officer 2] All right,
let's go. Move it.

186
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:46,393
You're supposed to be in the hospital.

187
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:51,022
Push yourself too hard too soon and
you could make it worse, you know.

188
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,567
- I appreciate your concern.
- No, you don't.

189
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:57,612
I need you at 100%.

190
00:12:57,696 --> 00:13:00,490
I need to prove Luke Cage is innocent.

191
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:03,410
Well, the hostages
have all been consistent

192
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,173
that Luke Cage never
held them at gunpoint.

193
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,706
[Misty] He was set up.
You know it, Priscilla.

194
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:09,541
Half this damn department knows it.

195
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,544
We need to be going
after Willis Stryker.

196
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:14,671
Well, then why is Luke Cage running?

197
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:19,926
He's a black man being
chased by the cops...

198
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:21,511
oh, with special bullets.

199
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:24,639
Accused of killing a cop,

200
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:27,016
and you're asking why
he's running? Come on.

201
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:35,984
Look at how relaxed
Hernan "Shades" Alvarez is.

202
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,528
He knows he's not going
anywhere anytime soon,

203
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:40,113
so he's resting up.

204
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,949
He knows he's guilty.

205
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,834
See this perp?

206
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:57,964
Look how his foot is bouncing. Nervous.

207
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:01,426
- No wonder his street name is Sugar.
- [chuckles]

208
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,571
I don't even have to say a word,
and here come the waterworks.

209
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:05,514
He's probably innocent...

210
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:08,767
or less guilty than whoever
he's about to give up.

211
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,268
That's a detectives' wives' tale.

212
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:12,396
You can't prove guilt
or innocence by that.

213
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,814
Oh, but you can...

214
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:16,691
- because Luke gave you his word.
- Luke...

215
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:19,528
Right now, his actions are
speaking louder than his words.

216
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:20,987
Luke Cage...

217
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:23,740
saved my life.

218
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:28,161
I don't dispute that we should
be bringing in Diamondback,

219
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:31,330
but to get to the truth, we
need to bring them both in.

220
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:34,459
[indistinct chatter]

221
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:40,465
Okay, well, let me lead the charge.
Make sure Luke is brought in safely.

222
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:43,051
He threw away his chance when
he jumped out that damn van.

223
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:46,137
Now they will shoot him on
sight with the mayor's blessing.

224
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:54,187
You know what? At least let
me take a crack at Shades.

225
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,565
He's in deep with all the players.

226
00:14:58,107 --> 00:14:59,401
He doesn't scare me.

227
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:00,902
- Detective...
- I can handle him.

228
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:02,654
You just got shot.

229
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:05,364
- I need you to go home, get some rest.
- [sighs]

230
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,536
I'll interview Shades.

231
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:24,217
[Mariah] My grandmother
loved Harlem's Paradise.

232
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:31,433
She took care of all the small details.

233
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:32,976
She loved it.

234
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:38,648
From the murals...

235
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:41,860
the glasswork, all the way
down to the table linens.

236
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:45,321
No fine point was overlooked.

237
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,034
- [glass shattering]
- This was her legacy.

238
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:55,749
My family's in tatters, and it's
all because of Diamondback. Shit!

239
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,959
[stammers]

240
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,919
Uh, I know, I know...

241
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,839
[sighs] I need to get
out in front of this.

242
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:08,302
Release a statement about Damon
Boone and how much I respected him.

243
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:10,179
That is not what I was gonna say.

244
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:13,141
Well, yeah, just... Please, no lectures.

245
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,147
This is just a thing.

246
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,193
Things can be rebuilt, and when you
do, you rebuild it as your legacy.

247
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:25,779
Not just the clubs.

248
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:32,827
I want to be a part of that.

249
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,459
Here's what I think.

250
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:43,505
Controlling the narrative is everything.
We can't have any loose threads.

251
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:44,964
So anyone who might have overheard

252
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:48,301
anything you said to
Diamondback or Shades in here...

253
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:49,803
is a threat.

254
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:52,597
You're absolutely correct.

255
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:55,349
[chuckles]

256
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:57,393
How may I be of service?

257
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:04,651
I wouldn't want you to
do anything untoward.

258
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:06,736
Never.

259
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:09,864
Okay.

260
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,784
[indistinct chatter]

261
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:38,852
I don't have time for this.

262
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:41,896
- [cash rustling]
- [man 1] Don't move.

263
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,940
He'll blow your head
off. He's crazy like that.

264
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:45,609
Don't try no shit.

265
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:52,824
My bad, Meth. I grew
up on that Wu-Tang shit.

266
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:55,368
- But you know how it is.
- [Method Man] Are you serious?

267
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:58,162
Are you really trying to
have a conversation right now?

268
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:00,432
I'm just tryin'... I'm just
sayin'... You're the man, yo.

269
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:02,852
Pull your mask down! You supposed
to be watchin' the damn door, Bryce!

270
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:05,003
What I say about using my
government name, Michael?

271
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:06,337
[door chimes]

272
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:09,483
Damn, homie. You look like you
went through a cheese grater.

273
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:10,967
Oh, snap, you Luke...

274
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,719
- [gun firing]
- [bullet ricocheting]

275
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:15,221
- [glass shattering]
- [gasping]

276
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,018
I ain't mean that.

277
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:25,774
Give me your phone.

278
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:27,025
The phone, fool.

279
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:30,045
Yo, my bad, man. You know, I
just got a little nervous and shit

280
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,697
- when you threw my mans across the...
- [grunts]

281
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:36,660
It's you.

282
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:40,747
- Yeah, it's you.
- [chuckles]

283
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,331
No, man, it's you.

284
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:46,210
Yo, man, "P.L.O. Style" was
my joint back in the day.

285
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:48,797
Sweet Christmas. [chuckles]

286
00:18:49,422 --> 00:18:50,924
Yeah, man, one second.

287
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:57,096
Hey. It's me.

288
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:00,141
Yeah, they'll be looking for me.

289
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,103
I'll lay in the cut.
I'll see you in a few.

290
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,652
You a double XL?

291
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:12,278
[scoffs] Way ahead of you, homie,

292
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:28,544
Call the cops.

293
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,981
I know a lot of people who would
pay you for this kind of protection.

294
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,882
They can keep their money.

295
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:35,760
Salute.

296
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,432
[laughs]

297
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,268
You ever see anything like that before?

298
00:19:44,352 --> 00:19:45,979
Harlem, baby.

299
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:48,189
Harlem.

300
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,733
[cell phone ringing]

301
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:53,027
- Hello?
- [Candace] <i>Detective Knight?</i>

302
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,654
- Candace?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

303
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,741
<i>What number are you calling me from?</i>

304
00:19:57,824 --> 00:20:00,576
A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS.

305
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,078
I need to see you.

306
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:05,248
- Come into the precinct.
<i>- No. No.</i>

307
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:08,918
You saw how quickly Mariah sent
that lawyer and got me out of there.

308
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:13,297
You didn't wanna talk to me
before. What makes you trust me now?

309
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:15,216
<i>Because Luke Cage does.</i>

310
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,345
He saved my life. And
you saw right through me.

311
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:24,726
<i>- You want the truth, right?</i>
- Where are you?

312
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:26,853
<i>- Look, if you can't help...</i>
- Candace.

313
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:29,438
<i>Tell me a place, and I will be there.</i>

314
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:37,488
[Ridley] You should be at Rikers
right now, but I held you...

315
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:41,242
because I think you
have something to say.

316
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:43,787
Lawyer.

317
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,832
[chuckles] I know your
record, Mr. Alvarez.

318
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,961
Came up in Harlem, rolled around
with Cottonmouth in the late '90s,

319
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:54,047
spent some time at Spofford, Sing Sing,

320
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,841
then you made it to the
big time, went to Seagate.

321
00:20:57,842 --> 00:20:59,052
[sighs]

322
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,638
Lawyer.

323
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:06,100
Cornell Stokes is dead,
but you're still alive.

324
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:09,728
And I've never seen an
arraignment happen so quickly.

325
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:11,773
Two million dollar bail...

326
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:14,275
and someone paid it in cash.

327
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:17,611
Who's your new sponsor?
Is it Willis Stryker?

328
00:21:18,696 --> 00:21:19,781
Law...

329
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:21,825
yer.

330
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:26,579
You were part of a
hostage situation, Hernan.

331
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:30,541
Even if your lawyer does get you out...

332
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:34,045
you won't be walking away from that.

333
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:37,590
That's multiple kidnapping
and weapons charges.

334
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:41,302
How does 25 years to life
sound to you? Minimum.

335
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,387
Are you serious?

336
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:46,099
Yep.

337
00:21:50,103 --> 00:21:51,354
Okay.

338
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:53,857
[scoffs]

339
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:56,275
Okay.

340
00:21:57,443 --> 00:21:58,486
[scoffs]

341
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:01,447
I... I was in the club.

342
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,698
[clears throat]

343
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,368
I saw what happened.

344
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,662
I know who did it.

345
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:12,541
- Okay.
- [inhales deeply]

346
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:16,462
We can protect you, but
I need a name to verify.

347
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,589
Who was it?

348
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:23,761
Was it Stryker?

349
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:29,976
He goes by...

350
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:33,938
lawyer.

351
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,484
You need me to spell it?

352
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,861
[laughing]

353
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:44,490
[door slams]

354
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:00,798
- You call this safe?
- We're hiding in plain sight.

355
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:04,052
I've got you. For now.

356
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:07,471
Lie to me again, Candace, I walk away
from here, and you are on your own.

357
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:09,807
- It's not bullshit.
- We'll see.

358
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:14,270
How did you even get out of Harlem's
Paradise without being stopped?

359
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:18,024
They were so busy trying to
arrest Luke, I just walked away.

360
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:22,736
So what is it?

361
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,700
What do you need to tell
me that's so important?

362
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,949
[sighs]

363
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,911
I was at the club the
night Cottonmouth died.

364
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,789
I already know that.

365
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,584
I mean right after.

366
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:45,801
[sighs]

367
00:23:56,145 --> 00:23:57,188
[beeps]

368
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,651
Mariah killed him.

369
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:06,405
[Shades] The trash bag is for
the clothes you're wearing now.

370
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:09,617
Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too.

371
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,995
Someone from Spurlock's
will incinerate them.

372
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:17,291
The secret to any good lie is it
has to run parallel to the truth.

373
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:20,294
[Misty] <i>How do you know this?</i>

374
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:22,421
[Candace] <i>I heard them talking about it.</i>

375
00:24:22,505 --> 00:24:23,672
[Shades] Do what I say.

376
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:26,759
[Candace] <i>The guy who always</i>
<i>wears sunglasses, he was there.</i>

377
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,681
<i>It was his idea to say Luke
Cage killed Cottonmouth.</i>

378
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:39,147
[grunts]

379
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:43,901
I was so scared.

380
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:46,362
I snuck out of there,
back to the lockers.

381
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:49,282
And, um, I was trying
to calm myself down.

382
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:52,868
When I went upstairs,
the guy with the glasses

383
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,579
offered me $50,000 to tell a story.

384
00:24:57,748 --> 00:24:58,957
So I told one.

385
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:03,754
- Why are you coming clean now?
- 'Cause I can't live with this.

386
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,091
Especially after Luke saving my life.

387
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:11,054
If you can guarantee my safety,

388
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:14,223
I will testify about
everything I just told you.

389
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:18,477
[phone beeps]

390
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:25,984
Mariah scares me more than Cottonmouth.

391
00:25:27,195 --> 00:25:32,533
I asked her if she thought Luke did
it, mostly to see if I could trust her.

392
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:35,035
To see if she would tell me the truth.

393
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:42,793
She looked me right
in my eye and said...

394
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,423
"You never know what
anyone is capable of."

395
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:51,427
[breath trembling] It
was the way she said it.

396
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:55,598
She... she would kill me if
she knew I was speaking to you.

397
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:57,391
I truly believe that.

398
00:25:59,477 --> 00:26:01,061
Thank you for helping me.

399
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:07,110
I'm gonna nail Mariah
Dillard's ass to the wall.

400
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,200
- Who else knows that you're here?
- Just my friend Leslie.

401
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:17,828
Don't call anyone else, not even Leslie.

402
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:20,763
As a matter of fact, give me your phone.

403
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,376
Come on.

404
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:31,342
Okay. Now, I picked this
up... on the way, just in case.

405
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,845
It's already got my
number programed in there,

406
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:37,556
so if I call or text, you know it's me.

407
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,853
Is your arm okay?

408
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,689
[sighs] My trigger finger is just fine.

409
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,693
Come on, let's go.

410
00:26:49,777 --> 00:26:51,862
- Where?
- Soledad's.

411
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,281
Her daughter Claire

412
00:26:53,364 --> 00:26:55,741
is the one who treated your
ankle at Harlem's Paradise.

413
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:56,992
She'll be there, too.

414
00:26:57,993 --> 00:26:59,828
I'm gonna take you there myself.

415
00:27:14,802 --> 00:27:17,388
[Method Man] No lie. Bullets
was flying everywhere and shit.

416
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:22,268
You trying to tell me that
those are bullet holes?

417
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,937
Man, Meth, I love you,
but get out of here.

418
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,272
I... I don't believe that.

419
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:29,024
HB, I thought the same thing...

420
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:33,404
until shorty pulled the
biscuit and let two off on Cage

421
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,030
and they bounced off.

422
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:36,699
Bullets ricochetin' and shit.

423
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:38,542
[stammers] Look, I'm
telling y'all the truth.

424
00:27:38,576 --> 00:27:40,345
I see y'all over there,
y'all don't believe it.

425
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:41,412
Trust me, it's the truth.

426
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:44,332
[stutters] And after he
smacked fire out these dudes,

427
00:27:44,415 --> 00:27:47,918
he left the hoodie, told me
and Gomez to call the police.

428
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,296
You know I ain't calling
no po-po. Then he bounced.

429
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:52,756
- Say word.
- Word, Sway. I'm telling you.

430
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,343
He even balled the dude's
gun up like some old homework.

431
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:59,930
But my thing is, though, if he
innocent, so what he running for?

432
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:03,183
Bulletproof always gonna
come second to being black.

433
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:06,019
HB, you should know
that. You from Jers. Jers!

434
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:08,314
Wow! Sound like he
stunted on you right there.

435
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:10,083
He did stunt. It was a
stunt. It was a stunt.

436
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,775
- Why you gotta stunt on me?
- [laughs]

437
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:12,901
No, I mean, seriously.

438
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:16,405
Seriously, though, what I'm just
saying, like, if that was me...

439
00:28:16,489 --> 00:28:18,407
- [Heather B] Right.
- And I was on the run.

440
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,118
- Why even get involved?
- [Sway] Hmm.

441
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,245
But he did.

442
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:26,790
And those dudes was nervous,
so anything could've happened.

443
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,752
As far as I'm concerned,
Luke Cage saved my life, man.

444
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:31,504
That's what's up, man.

445
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:34,507
You know what, that don't
sound like no cop killer to me.

446
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,133
For real, for real.

447
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:41,305
You know, there's somethin'
powerful about seeing a black man

448
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:44,099
that's bulletproof and unafraid.

449
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:46,143
- Come on, y'all. You know?
- Yeah, yeah.

450
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:47,787
[Method Man] Streets
got mad love for Cage.

451
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:51,064
I got mad love for Cage, man,
and... and he one of ours.

452
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:52,900
Yeah, yeah. But you know what?

453
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,693
We got mad love for you, too.

454
00:28:54,777 --> 00:28:56,404
- No doubt.
- You one of ours, man.

455
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:58,882
You know, the show's almost
over, man. You gonna spit for us?

456
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:01,575
- Of course.
- Oh, man! He 'bout to spit!

457

00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:24,635
[man] <i>Yo, I remember when Larry Davis
was on the run back in the day.</i>

511
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:27,054
<i>Cops came at him 'cause
they were just as corrupt,</i>

512
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:29,056
<i>dangerous and jacked up as he was.</i>

513
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:33,310
<i>I don't think we're getting the full
story on Luke Cage yet, for real.</i>

514
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:35,396
[Sway] <i>I wouldn't put it
past the government, man.</i>

515
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:38,607
<i>Um, you know, we're gonna be
searching for the answers for you,</i>

516
00:31:38,691 --> 00:31:39,983
<i>and once we get the facts,</i>

517
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:42,653
<i>we're gonna put it right here
on Sway's Universe, all right?</i>

518
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:45,322
<i>Thanks for your call, citizen. We
got another person on the line.</i>

519
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:47,658
- [beeps]
- [smooth jazz playing]

520
00:31:49,702 --> 00:31:51,579
- [man] Now. Come on!
- [woman] All right.

521
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:53,581
[indistinct shouting]

522
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:56,750
Oh, come on, man. You
know he's not here.

523
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:09,262
I understand playing against the computer,
but, um, how do you beat yourself?

524
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:11,181
Chess is a game of anticipation.

525
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,144
If you know every single possible move,

526
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:20,023
you can anticipate your adversary's
next move before he does.

527
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:21,149
Oh.

528
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,110
That's deep.

529
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:26,697
If we find out you've been hiding
him, there'll be hell to pay.

530
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,342
Yeah, well, just don't break the
hinges on that door on your way out.

531
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:31,910
I just got it fixed.

532
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:02,107
[smooth jazz continues on radio]

533
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:10,866
That was a close shave.

534
00:33:11,784 --> 00:33:12,910
Bad pun.

535
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:17,164
What the hell did you
even come back for, man?

536
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,959
[sighs] I had to.

537
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:22,795
For Harlem.

538
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:25,380
Take care of Diamondback before
he made it bad for everybody.

539
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:28,216
Well, forget Harlem.
Forget your brother!

540
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,012
You're on the road in a brand
new car and a woman that fine?

541
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,181
And you're bulletproof.

542
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,600
[scoffs] You'd have never
seen my black ass again.

543
00:33:36,684 --> 00:33:39,269
I'd rob the occasional
bank and never look back.

544
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:40,646
[chuckles]

545
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:46,401
You got every cop in the
city looking for you, brother.

546
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:50,531
Negroes writing Luke
Cage ballads and shit.

547
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:54,952
So... what's the plan?

548
00:33:57,871 --> 00:33:59,832
To box in all the players.

549
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:04,628
Well...

550
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:08,716
Shades is in jail.

551
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:12,094
Mariah's out, but she
ain't exactly on your side.

552
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:13,679
Now you could tail both of 'em,

553
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:17,099
but no telling how long that'll take
for them to lead you to your prey.

554
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:22,771
What about Misty?

555
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:25,482
No, she's got her hands full already.

556
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:27,335
She's trying to clear my
name inside the precinct

557
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,402
and bring me in at the same time.

558
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:31,614
- We gotta be careful with her.
- [sighs]

559
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,407
That leaves you one other option.

560
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:37,953
Someone else to find Diamondback.

561
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:41,665
[softly] Here.

562
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:43,792
Turk.

563
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:47,420
Turk may be a pawn, but he's not dumb.

564
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:49,590
If he thinks he's being
set up, he'll disappear.

565
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:50,924
[dialing]

566
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:53,218
You let me worry about that.

567
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:56,805
Hey, Turk, it's Bobby.

568
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,017
Listen, I might be able to get my
hands on about 30 pairs of Jordans.

569
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:03,228
They're the vintage Air Jordan 5s.

570
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:06,481
Let's just say they fell
off the back of a truck.

571
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,067
Okay, when?

572
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:19,828
Who's this?

573
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:22,998
First name Law, last name Yer.

574
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:28,003
Must be pretty damn connected to get
a lawyer and not even know who she is.

575
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,963
Membership has its privileges.

576
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:33,425
[indistinct chatter]

577
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:39,472
He sprung you?

578
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,977
You think this is funny, don't you?

579
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,230
You got this all figured out, huh?

580
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:50,233
No...

581
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:52,903
actually, I don't.

582
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,226
When did Diamondback bring in new hires?

583
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:26,937
Well, after the club, he
had to change things up.

584
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,939
Recruit some new faces.

585
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:42,619
I bet while you were inside,

586
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:45,247
cops tried to do some
recruiting of their own.

587
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,209
Don't ever question my loyalty.

588
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:10,981
- The man upstairs?
- [scoffs]

589
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:13,525
You are just full of questions.

590
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,111
Matter of fact...

591
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:17,821
[groans]

592
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:22,409
[straining]

593
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:23,827
[thudding]

594
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:39,092
[grunting]

595
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:43,638
[Shades gasping]

596
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,780
[gunshot]

597
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:02,950
[panting]

598
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,496
[laughs]

599
00:38:09,497 --> 00:38:11,333
Let's go to the penthouse.

600
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:16,213
[groans]

601
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:18,506
[breathing heavily]

602
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,182
- [door slams]
- [breath trembling]

603
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:30,268
I was just following orders!

604
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:39,777
You're a goddamn puppet.

605
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:42,155
Who gave you the order?

606
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,532
[grunts]

607
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:49,746
- Who?
- [grunts]

608
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:53,500
Diamondback!

609
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:58,296
You stopped playing your
position. Asked too many questions.

610
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,883
Diamondback said you
needed to be dealt with.

611
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,471
Romeo would be ashamed of you.

612
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:07,890
[Zip laughing]

613
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:10,558
You're such a disappointment.

614
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:13,478
You're the second person
who told me that today.

615
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:17,149
I'm my own man, Shades.

616
00:39:20,193 --> 00:39:21,819
Tell him yourself.

617
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,047
[chuckles]

618
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:51,016
Nice.

619
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:59,482
[sighs] Sorry, Romeo... He had to go.

620
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:02,319
[sirens wailing in the distance]

621
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:07,782
It's a good thing her friend
Leslie knew where she was.

622
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:09,993
- I'm glad you found the park.
- Mmm-hmm.

623
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,328
So where is she now?

624
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,915
She left with Detective Knight.
Traffic got thick and I lost them.

625
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:17,084
I'm sorry. I'm not used to
doing anything like this.

626
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,418
We'll find her again.

627
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:21,338
Just knowing that she
can't be trusted is helpful.

628
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:24,299
You did a good job, Alex.

629
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:26,093
Hey, you're my rock!

630
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:30,180
Later.

631
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:32,057
[cell phone ringing]

632
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,862
What do you want?

633
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:48,781
[Stryker] <i>That's no way to
speak to a business partner.</i>

634
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,409
After what you did to my club,

635
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:53,620
do you really think I'm
gonna shuck and jive with you?

636
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:56,331
<i>You might wanna check your attitude.</i>

637
00:40:56,414 --> 00:41:00,293
<i>If you're not of any use to me,
then you're not useful to anyone.</i>

638
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:04,131
<i>Shades would tell you,
if he was still alive.</i>

639
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,759
What the hell are you talking about?

640
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:09,802
<i>I had to let him go.</i>

641
00:41:09,886 --> 00:41:14,641
<i>So now, I'm giving you the chance
to tell me where you stand.</i>

642
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:18,811
<i>I've taken Shades and Damon Boone
off the table so you can grow.</i>

643
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:21,064
<i>I'd hate for us to part, too.</i>

644
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:25,318
I wasn't particularly fond of Shades...

645
00:41:26,694 --> 00:41:31,074
and the death of Damon
Boone, although unnecessary,

646
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:32,950
was appreciated.

647
00:41:35,203 --> 00:41:39,291
But you need to know this.
I'm out of the political game.

648
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:43,878
I'm focusing on Harlem's
Paradise. Using it for a...

649
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:48,633
a power base for community relations.

650
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:51,386
That's a smart move.

651
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:53,263
But you've made some dumb ones also.

652
00:41:53,346 --> 00:41:57,017
You should never talk about
murder on an open line.

653
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:04,857
Open it.

654
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:23,751
Seed money... for your New
Harlem Renaissance project

655
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:25,712
and refurbishing the club.

656
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:28,173
My apologies.

657
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:35,055
It's a very generous donation...
but nothing in this world is free.

658
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:36,514
You're right.

659
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,062
My only condition is loyalty.

660
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,024
Stick with me and Harlem will
be remade in your own image.

661
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:50,320
We'll be doing this for years to come.

662
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:54,241
Harlem is already in my image.

663
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,329
You staying?

664
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:02,749
Once I'm finished with
Carl, I'll evaporate.

665
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,460
But don't worry.

666
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:09,131
You'll still feel the
occasional cool breeze.

667
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:13,718
Sweet dreams, Mariah.

668
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:20,433
[door opens]

669
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:21,851
[sighs]

670
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:22,977
[door closes]

671
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:45,417
- [thudding]
- [Turk gasps]

672
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,377
- You ratted out Chico.
- [breathing heavily]

673
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,045
You got Pop killed.

674
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:51,173
Man, the writing was on the wall.

675
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:54,592
Somebody would have seen
him. Might as well be me.

676
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:57,470
How was I supposed to know Tone
was gonna shoot up the shop?

677
00:43:57,554 --> 00:44:01,308
Whole damn world know Pop's
was Switzerland. Forever.

678
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:02,600
I should crush you.

679
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:05,853
[chuckles] You won't,
though. You need me.

680
00:44:05,937 --> 00:44:07,480
[inhales sharply] Where's Diamondback?

681
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:10,608
I don't know... [screaming]

682
00:44:12,485 --> 00:44:13,778
What the... [yelps]

683
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:18,115
- Hey!
- You still stalling?

684
00:44:20,493 --> 00:44:22,078
[Turk whimpering]

685
00:44:23,246 --> 00:44:24,706
All right! All right!

686
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:27,209
He's at a warehouse by the Harlem River.

687
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:29,126
Near 145th, all right?

688
00:44:30,962 --> 00:44:34,757
I gave you what you
wanted! Now let me out!

689
00:44:34,841 --> 00:44:36,968
Sit tight, Mr. Barrett.

690
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:38,970
Trash pickup is tomorrow.

691
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:42,474
You can breathe just fine.
There's food in there, too.

692
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:45,893
[banging]

693
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:48,313
You can't leave me in here!

694
00:44:48,396 --> 00:44:51,107
There's baby diapers in here, man!

695
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:53,067
Hey!

696
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:56,153
Come on!

697
00:44:56,238 --> 00:44:57,614
[door opening]

698
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,372
[door slams]

699
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:25,308
[Domingo] Looks like you downgraded.

700
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:28,060
I liked the club better.

701
00:45:29,312 --> 00:45:31,648
I'm a man who needs his space.

702
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:35,192
Space is a good thing.

703
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:38,464
- Especially when you come to kill a man.
- [guns cocking]

704
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:39,656
Whoa, whoa.

705
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,077
[guns cocking]

706
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:53,085
Someone did your boy
Zip and his two homies.

707
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:55,672
That's not Cage's style...

708
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:59,091
so I'm guessing Shades didn't
appreciate you bailing him out.

709
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:10,520
You know when a rattlesnake is
at its most dangerous, Domingo?

710
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,399
When it's cornered.

711
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:43,428
I'm gonna rip your head off!

712
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:49,183
[groans]

713
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:06,826
[gunshots continue]

714
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:14,041
- [whirring]
- [chuckles]

715
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,547
"And behold a pale horse...

716
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:24,469
and he that sat upon
him, his name was Death."

717
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:35,104
[exhales]

718
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:36,313
[sniffs]

719
00:48:13,017 --> 00:48:15,061
You really need a security system.

720
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:20,066
- You waiting for me?
- No.

721
00:48:21,651 --> 00:48:23,903
I bet he told you I was dead.

722
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:28,199
Diamondback got to you, didn't he?

723
00:48:28,282 --> 00:48:30,409
No, he didn't.

724
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:32,454
[scoffs]

725
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:38,209
What are you doing with
a gun? It's not you.

726
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:39,544
Shut up.

727
00:48:41,713 --> 00:48:42,880
[sighs]

728
00:48:44,048 --> 00:48:45,800
I have something for you.

729
00:48:51,055 --> 00:48:52,389
Figured...

730
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,269
you'd want this.

731
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,694
Your prints... Cornell's blood.

732
00:49:12,368 --> 00:49:14,871
Then you'll have nothing
to blackmail me with.

733
00:49:16,038 --> 00:49:17,206
I don't need it.

734
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:19,876
We're in this together now.

735
00:49:22,962 --> 00:49:24,046
[bottle thuds]

736
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:28,134
You and I have come a long way.

737
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:34,348
You know, sometimes you have to reach
across the aisle to get things done.

738
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:38,394
You're talking about Luke Cage?

739
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:43,315
It's incredible... how
much you and I think alike.

740
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:46,819
We're at war.

741
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:51,824
And right now, the enemy
of my enemy is my friend.

742
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,579
Maybe. But it might not take.

743
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,166
You did beat his ass
and give him his powers.

744
00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:01,876
- Mmm-hmm.
- And...

745
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:06,172
Cornell's flunky killed Pop. You
think he really is gonna jump?

746
00:50:06,255 --> 00:50:07,757
Just jump on our bandwagon?

747
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,801
Absolutely.

748
00:50:09,884 --> 00:50:13,304
'Cause we have something that
he wants more than anything.

749
00:50:16,891 --> 00:50:17,975
His old life.

750
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,979
A chance to clear his name. Right here.

751
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:29,904
If we send Luke after Diamondback
and they kill each other...

752
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:32,740
all of our problems are swept away.

753
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:34,533
- [exhales]
- No matter who wins.

754
00:50:34,617 --> 00:50:37,411
[chuckles] Even better.

755
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:36,721
[Domingo groaning]

756
00:51:42,476 --> 00:51:44,771
I should've known you'd
turn up. [breathing heavily]

757
00:51:45,897 --> 00:51:47,649
What the hell happened here?

758
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:51,068
Diamondback.

759
00:51:51,152 --> 00:51:52,444
[groaning]

760
00:51:52,528 --> 00:51:54,864
[faint beeping in distance]

761
00:52:07,418 --> 00:52:09,211
[beeping continues]

762
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,894
Sweet sister.

763
00:52:24,977 --> 00:52:26,688
[beeping continues]

764
00:52:43,537 --> 00:52:45,915
[Luke panting] Slow.

765
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:48,710
Take it easy.

766
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,880
What did he use?

767
00:52:52,964 --> 00:52:55,049
How did Diamondback do that?

768
00:52:56,592 --> 00:52:58,886
[breathing heavily] Something
I've never seen before.

769
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,972
[siren wailing in the distance]

770
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:03,140
Even you can't stop him.

771
00:53:05,517 --> 00:53:07,353
[exhales softly]

772
00:53:19,824 --> 00:53:21,242
These just came in.

773
00:53:22,284 --> 00:53:25,496
- [sighs] Elephant punches all over again.
- Mmm-hmm.

774
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:26,705
That's gotta be Cage, right?

775
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:28,540
[cell phone ringing]

776
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,340
- Hello?
- [Luke] <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

777
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:39,010
<i>You guys find Domingo?</i>

778
00:53:39,093 --> 00:53:40,928
- Yeah.
<i>- Meet me.</i>

779
00:53:41,012 --> 00:53:42,221
Where?

780
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,497
Should I thank you for this?

781
00:54:09,498 --> 00:54:11,625
All credit goes to Diamondback.

782
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:14,378
I don't suppose we'll find his body.

783
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:17,673
We found Zip's, though, and two
other thugs in an old building.

784
00:54:17,756 --> 00:54:20,509
Shot up. Right after they
picked up your other boy.

785
00:54:21,552 --> 00:54:22,761
Shades.

786
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:26,682
Don't you ever get tired
of people getting out?

787
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:28,684
Yes.

788
00:54:30,561 --> 00:54:34,648
Look, it's not safe for you to be
here. If you don't find Diamondback...

789
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:37,609
Then he wins, and my life
is forever a living hell.

790
00:54:40,279 --> 00:54:41,864
Is there anything I can do?

791
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:44,450
See what else Turk knows.

792
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:46,994
He's in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd.

793
00:54:47,078 --> 00:54:49,288
Near Mount Olivet and the shop.

794
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:52,166
A Dumpster?

795
00:54:58,297 --> 00:54:59,340
[sighs]

796
00:55:06,848 --> 00:55:09,516
Even if we handle Diamondback...

797
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,104
he's not gonna forgive us for
framing him for Cornell's death.

798
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:15,731
We could hurdle that easy.

799
00:55:16,815 --> 00:55:19,193
The only people who know what
really happened in the club

800
00:55:19,276 --> 00:55:21,070
are you and me.

801
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:26,909
I'll regret that night
for the rest of my life.

802
00:55:28,035 --> 00:55:29,495
You did what you had to do.

803
00:55:29,578 --> 00:55:31,622
You shouldn't regret that.

804
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:37,253
What were you even doing
at the club that night?

805
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:44,218
I was going there to kill him.

806
00:55:46,095 --> 00:55:47,679
You beat me to it.

807
00:55:53,269 --> 00:55:55,354
Cornell never needed my political money.

808
00:55:56,272 --> 00:55:58,607
And he was never going to pay it back.

809
00:56:00,526 --> 00:56:04,613
He just wanted me in all the way.

810
00:56:05,907 --> 00:56:07,074
So what are you saying?

811
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:16,167
He saw things in me... that
I avoided my whole life.

812
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:24,175
Now I am becoming that
person he always saw...

813
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:28,845
and I always denied.

814
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:35,061
You ready?

815
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:38,564
I stay ready, baby.

816
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,675
I should've kept my coat
on. Hell just froze over.

817
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:07,801
[door closes]

818
00:57:07,884 --> 00:57:10,972
- Where's Luke Cage?
- I'm right here.

819
00:57:12,974 --> 00:57:14,600
- We have a problem.
- So do I.

820
00:57:14,683 --> 00:57:17,937
I can't decide which one of
you I'm gonna knock out first.

821
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,814
- Where's Diamondback?
- I don't know.

822
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:24,026
The parley between the three
of us is more important.

823
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,112
You have the nerve to use that term?

824
00:57:26,195 --> 00:57:28,322
Right here? Where Pop died?

825
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,950
Cough up Diamondback's location,

826
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:33,160
or I'll stomp you like
we were back at Seagate.

827
00:57:33,244 --> 00:57:34,870
Luke, be cool, brother.

828
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:38,207
Whoa, whoa. No one
needs to stomp anyone.

829
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:41,085
Pops made this place
Switzerland for a reason.

830
00:57:41,168 --> 00:57:43,504
Cage, we have a mutual enemy,

831
00:57:43,587 --> 00:57:46,632
and the only way to bring him down
is for us all to come together.

832
00:57:46,715 --> 00:57:48,842
There's no way I'm helping you.

833
00:57:48,925 --> 00:57:51,512
We came to offer you a truce.

834
00:57:51,595 --> 00:57:54,765
In exchange for helping
you find Diamondback,

835
00:57:54,848 --> 00:57:56,350
you drop your beef with us.

836
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:58,560
You both framed me for murder.

837
00:57:58,644 --> 00:58:01,397
There's nothing you can offer me
that's going to make me let that go.

838
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,525
Uh... how about your freedom?

839
00:58:05,734 --> 00:58:08,862
Right here is everything you need

840
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:11,907
to prove that Diamondback
framed Carl Lucas.

841
00:58:22,126 --> 00:58:25,046
Even if Carl Lucas is exonerated...

842
00:58:25,129 --> 00:58:28,049
Luke Cage is now wanted for
the murder of Cottonmouth.

843
00:58:28,132 --> 00:58:29,966
I'll tell them the truth.

844
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:33,429
Diamondback killed
Cornell and Damon Boone.

845
00:58:33,512 --> 00:58:35,056
You'll go free.

846
00:58:37,433 --> 00:58:38,934
What the hell is this?

847
00:58:39,018 --> 00:58:42,646
Mariah Dillard, you're under arrest
for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

848
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:44,416
I thought you said you
were going after Turk?

849
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,126
[Misty] I've been tracking
you since you called.

850
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,444
I wasn't going to let
you just ghost me again.

851
00:58:48,527 --> 00:58:52,156
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Shades, back off!

852
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:55,034
Misty, stand down.
We're working this out.

853
00:58:55,117 --> 00:58:56,785
Oh, so you workin' with them now?

854
00:58:56,868 --> 00:58:59,580
- He knows where Diamondback is.
- I didn't say that.

855
00:58:59,663 --> 00:59:03,125
Well, whatever you know, Hernan, you
should share it with the whole class.

856
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:05,086
I ain't telling you shit.

857
00:59:08,089 --> 00:59:09,173
Grenade!

858
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:11,217
[screaming]

859
00:59:15,846 --> 00:59:17,764

What type of Jean Paul
Gaultier shit is this?

What are you, a pimp stormtrooper?
