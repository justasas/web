<i>Episode 25</i>

20
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,080
Why must you keep harming us?

21
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,610
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,460
- Sorry. <br>- What's the use of apologising?

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,990
How is my brother?

24
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,930
The injuries are only superficial wounds.

25
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,490
Those people were set on harming him but not critically.

26
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,220
So to say, even though he has many wounds his life is not in danger.

27
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,310
He is already conscious. You can go in to see him but there shouldn't be too many visitors.

28
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,250
Doctor. I would like to know more about the injuries.

29
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,990
Fine. Come with me to my office.

30
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,010
What are you doing? Do you still have the face to see my brother?

31
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,770
- Fei Fei. <br> - How is your injury?

32
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,010
I'm fine.

33
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,070
Does it hurt very much?

34
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,530
I'm fine.

35
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,610
How could they beat you into such a state?

36
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,920
Didn't they do this because of the secret formula?

37
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,980
It's because of the secret formula again.

38
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,320
Sorry, Brother. It's all my fault.

39
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,880
If I didn't take away the secret formula,

40
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,450
I wouldn't have caused you to be jailed.

41
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,510
This wouldn't have happened.

42
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,070
Sorry.

43
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,850
Fei Fei.

44
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,820
Don't blame yourself.

45
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,420
This is not your fault.

46
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,490
Listen to me. Everything was

47
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,910
planned by me.

48
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,970
What did you just say?

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,450
It started from the first day when they approached me for the silk contest.

50
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,000
I already knew what their motive was.

51
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,970
I made use of you to hand over the secret formula to them.

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,870
Sorry.

53
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,570
I used and tricked you.

54
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,940
That secret formula is fake.

55
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,970
Fei Fei. All these years, I know that you have been good to me.

56
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,540
Everything that you have done for my family,

57
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,800
I can see very clearly.

58
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,950
I remember it all.

59
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,460
I'm very thankful that during our most difficult times,

60
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,010
you have always been with us.

61
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,220
You will always be my sister.

62
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,020
I will always be your brother.

63
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,630
We will forever

64
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,160
be a family.

65
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,420
Fei Fei.

66
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,090
Do something for me.

67
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,980
Tell Wu Cai Hong to come in here.

68
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,090
Why do you still want to see her?

69
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,590
Be good.

70
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,510
Go now.

71
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,000
How is Jiang Yu? Is he okay?

72
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,010
Go in. He wants to see you.

73
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:07,900
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

74
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,510
Sorry.

75
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,940
It's my fault.

76
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,990
You didn't kill my father.

77
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,070
What I can do for my father now

78
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,360
is to apologise.

79
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,130
And also for what I did in the past,

80
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,990
I would like to apologise to you.

81
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,610
You don't need to apologise to me.

82
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,960
I don't care about what you did. Also regarding your father,

83
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,330
I went to see him on the day he died.

84
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:06,700
When he found out about my identity, he kneeled down in front of me

85
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,010
to seek my forgiveness.

86
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,340
My father

87
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,020
really did that?

88
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,480
Did you forgive him then?

89
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,070
I'm not that magnanimous.

90
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:36,990
Even if your father knelt down in front of me forever, I wouldn't have been able to bring back my father.

91
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,820
But...

92
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,700
I didn't kill your father.

93
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:52,390
Today I have set myself as bait in this game.

94
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,930
The motive was to find our father's killer.

95
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:02,210
Regarding your father's death, I owe you an explanation.

96
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,710
I don't understand.

97
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,380
What is the meaning behind setting yourself as bait?

98
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,870
The truth about your father's death will be revealed soon.

99
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,930
When that day comes,

100
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,980
we will clear our debts and will be even.

101
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,710
Enough.

102
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,450
I have already said what I needed to say.

103
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,140
You can leave now.

104
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,870
Brother. What did you tell her?

105
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,710
Brother. Isn't this bitter for you?

106
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:54,030
Ever since Wu Hong Da harmed your father,

107
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,930
the fate was already decided between the both of you.

108
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,660
You and Wu Cai Hong

109
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,330
are like a bird in the sky and a fish in the water.

110
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,860
You will never be together.

111
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,990
Mr Jiang. I would like to talk to you.

112
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,300
Why is Mr Zhou so anxious to find me? What's the matter?

113
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,060
I don't know either. See for yourself and you will know.

114
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,990
I'm leaving.

115
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,260
Old Cai. I waited for you for a long time.

116
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,130
Come with me.

117
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,320
This is not a kind request. Lao Cai, you are the prime suspect in Wu Hong Da's case.

118
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,630
This is a warrant.

119
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,320
I would advise you not to rebel. Junior Superintendent.

120
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,970
Take him away.

121
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,160
Uncle Lai. Miss wanted us to follow Ma Li.

122
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,170
Ma Li may have stolen it. <i>secret recipe</i>

123
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,010
But now, the police are one step ahead of us.

124
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,880
How are we going to explain this to her when we get back?

125
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,390
How to explain it to her?

126
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:41,060
We can only tell her the truth. If not, why don't we snatch him from the police?

127
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:50,620
Based on my plan, I finally forced Old Cai to come out from hiding.

128
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,470
I say, Jiang Yu. Don't blame me for being angry with you.

129
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,820
Why didn't you tell me about this first before you took actions?

130
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,890
You're actions are desperate.

131
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,280
If anything should happen to you under the hands of my staff,

132
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,830
how could I make amends to you and what should I tell your family?

133
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,610
If I told you about my plan in advance, how would I be able to play the game?

134
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,960
If I didn't allow them to beat me half to death,

135
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,310
how would they have believed that the secret formula is not with me but with Old Cai instead?

136
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,370
Enough, buddy.

137
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,170
In any case, you risked your life for this.

138
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,520
No matter what, in the future, you must discuss it with me in advance.

139
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,830
Fine. Have some tea to cool down our temper.

140
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,430
Don't be like this.

141
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,460
If everything is going well and Old Cai has been captured,

142
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,740
we should be able to close the Wu Hong Da's case soon.

143
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,290
Don't worry. This afternoon, Director Chen will personally apprehend Old Cai.

144
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,720
I believe that this case can be closed soon.

145
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,010
Didn't you instruct these people to torment Jiang Yu? Did you do it?

146
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,750
Yes, I did it.

147
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,310
You answered very cleanly.

148
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,940
Do you know that by doing this, it's a crime?

149
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,600
When did you become so ruthless?

150
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,750
Cai Hong.

151
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,460
I don't believe that Jiang Yu is not the killer of your father.

152
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,040
I also don't believe that he didn't take the secret formula from your father.

153
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,540
I did this to force him to show his true colours so that you would know sooner.

154
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,770
You are talking too lightly about this.

155
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,140
You let those men beat Jiang Yu into that state.

156
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,770
Did you force the truth from him?

157
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,650
Cai Hong. I know that, in your heart,

158
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,530
you chose to believe Jiang Yu.

159
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,060
Thus, no matter what I do, you won't believe me.

160
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,300
I'm only stating facts.

161
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,100
Even if he really is a suspect,

162
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,650
he should be questioned by the police again first.

163
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,760
I would never use such a ruthless method.

164
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,480
Cai Hong, you are not stating facts.

165
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,060
You like him.

166
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,090
Do still remember that day

167
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,830
I heard you say those words

168
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,800
that you wanted to go back to the ways things were with your heart before.

169
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,100
You only had eyes for me. Trust me.

170
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,770
Don't forget that your father forced Jiang Yu's family to become bankrupt?

171
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:25,060
The feud between your both families gave him the motive to kill your father.

172
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,630
You are as far away from each other as heaven and earth.

173
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,980
Cai Hong, the more you tend to his heart, the more hurt you will be.

174
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,380
I don't want you to get hurt.

175
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,970
I want to protect you.

176
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,980
By doing this now,

177
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,990
you are only distancing yourself from me.

178
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,100
Second... Second Miss.

179
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,700
You are here.

180
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,520
I...

181
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,060
Are you here to see Brother Shao Tian?

182
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,200
Mom.

183
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,050
What's wrong with Xiao Bao? Is he asleep?

184
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,220
Hello, Madam Wu.

185
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,880
What are you doing here?

186
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,980
I heard that Brother Shao Tian came here to look for Miss Wu. I need to find him regarding some urgent matters.

187
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,070
Cai Hong, go and call Shao Tian.

188
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,050
Wait.

189
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,930
I will go and call him.

190
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,050
Go back to your room.

191
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,060
Look after Xiao Bai for me.

192
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,020
Are you cooking porridge for Jiang Yu?

193
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,850
Yes. Look at what you have done to him. I want to apologise on your behalf.

194
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,010
I don't want you to go.

195
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,970
Did you forget about the grudge between the two companies?

196
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,400
I remember Jiang Yu telling me this.

197
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,080
Hate does not necessarily end in hate.

198
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,090
Even in a dirty pond, a clean and pure flower could grow in it.

199
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,150
You are too naive.

200
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:58,200
Even though, from mud flowers can grow, there are still thorns.

201
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,090
The years of sowing the seeds of hatred is many.

202
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:06,020
Flowers with thorns won't only just hurt you.

203
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,960
I can't change what happened previously

204
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,180
but now if I don't work hard to try, how could I know?

205
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,880
You can't change the consequences.

206
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,400
Shao Tian, Cai Hong. Whats' wrong?

207
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,820
Aunt, it's nothing. We are only having different views.

208
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,000
By the way, Ma Li is looking for you. He said it's important. He's waiting for you at the front door.

209
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,910
I'm going to see him first.

210
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,990
Thanks, Aunt.

211
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:55,080
Listen to my advice. Our Wu family is not that glorious life before.

212
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,960
You should change your temper. Frankly, Shao Tian is not bad.

213
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,900
He is good at business.

214
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,550
Catch hold of this opportunity and your happiness. Understand?

215
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,670
I feel that we are not compatible.

216
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,500
Sometimes, I feel that he treats me too well.

217
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,710
The more he does this, I have more of a guilty conscious.

218
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,680
There are certain things that I can't express.

219
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,370
You only see yourself. Always such a stubborn temper.

220
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,540
Frankly, between men and women, it's that complicated.

221
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,030
It's simple. Take advantage of his youth and good looks.

222
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,290
Get married, have children and live a good life.

223
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,510
Isn't it that simple?

224
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,070
Frankly, men who have good qualifications

225
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,340
are slightly bad tempered.

226
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,360
But I can tell that Zhou Shao Tian is not really bad. He treats you well.

227
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,490
Don't spoil this opportunity and think about it first.

228
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,370
- Ma Li. <br>- Brother.

229
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,160
What happened? Why did you come all the way here to find me?

230
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,920
Old Cai has been caught by the police.

231
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,980
Those little bastards are not capable of anything!

232
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,070
Come in.

233
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,030
- Are you being discharged? <br>- What are you doing here?

234
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,480
I personally cooked this porridge.

235
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,870
I don't know if it suits your taste. Would you like to try it?

236
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,110
You are no longer our servant.

237
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,890
You don't need to do this.

238
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,370
I would like to this

239
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,100
to make amends for our past.

240
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,130
Didn't I already tell you very clearly?

241
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,120
You don't need to apologise again.

242
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,200
You don't even need to apologise to me because of your father.

243
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,770
But it's good that you are here.

244
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:13,430
I promised myself that I owe you an explanation regarding your father's death.

245
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,490
Come with me.

246
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,620
Where are we going?

247
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,960
To a show.

248
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,460
You can say that it's show because you'll regret if you don't watch it.

249
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,990
Old Cai. It really wasn't easy to find you.

250
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,280
We have been watching you for a long time.

251
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,990
Do you know why?

252
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,940
Director Chen. The police were looking for me?

253
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,390
Old Cai. You are a smart man.

254
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,460
I won't beat around the bush.

255
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,520
When you first stole Ling Long's money, you were discovered by Wu Hong Da.

256
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,740
You then killed him. Isn't that so?

257
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,800
Director Chen, this is arbitrary and

258
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,950
I didn't kill Old Master Wu or steal his money. How could there be such a misunderstanding?

259
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,120
Misunderstanding?

260
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,730
When Wu Hong Da died, you went missing.

261
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,970
Is this a misunderstanding?

262
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,720
Director Chen. The police should have evidence.

263
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,500
You can't say that just because I went missing,

264
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,530
I killed Old Master Wu and even stole his money. This is a major crime.

265
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:34,720
Don't talk about killing someone. I wouldn't even dare kill a chicken.

266
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,710
Old Cai, cut the crap.

267
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:44,410
After Wu Hong Da died, where did you go? Speak.

268
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,130
It's like this.

269
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,460
Before Old Master Wu's incident,

270
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,710
he had to borrow money to a company named Dachang Trading Company.

271
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,470
Subsequently, there was a problem with the company and he couldn't get back the money.

272
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,400
I was making good earnings at Ling Long just at this same time.

273
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,950
I was afraid that I couldn't explain. Thus, I left.

274
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,050
Based on what you said, you cleared all your responsibilities legally, right?

275
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,990
Yes. Wu Hong Da died.

276
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,070
Undoubtedly he deserved to die, right?

277
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,130
Chen Suo Chang, this matter affects me personally.

278
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,340
If there was anything wrong, as the main supervisor at Lin Ling,

279
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,960
I would have not risked my lord's health but called the police .

280
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,240
Do you think we will fall for your tricks?

281
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,260
- I... <br>- As police, what we say is based on evidence.

282
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,030
Did you think that we would arrest you without any evidence?

283
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,380
This is what we investigated.

284
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,940
These are the transcripts.

285
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,280
Dah Chong Hong is a very small company

286
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,510
What a coincidence.

287
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,760
It is registered under the name of one of your relatives.

288
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,320
You have been with Wu Hong Da for many years.

289
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,360
You should be familiar with his signature.

290
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,530
Can you tell me

291
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,580
whether this is Wu Hong Da's signature?

292
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,850
Or did you find someone to forge it?

293
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,680
This already happened a long time ago.

294
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,920
Someone must be intentionally trying to frame me.

295
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,650
Yes, Lin Long borrowed a lot of money from Da Chang trading company.

296
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,490
It lost a big amount.

297
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,100
And for me, as the treasurer, I had been only monitoring it.

298
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,680
Also, when Old Master Wu passed away, I didn't stay back to clarify matters.

299
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,810
As it was my fault, I could have not done it.

300
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,720
I knew you would say this.

301
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,410
The evidence that you stole Ling Long's money is all here.

302
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,300
Don't even try to deny it.

303
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,900
If you cooprate with us and give out your accomplices,

304
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,040
perhaps, we may give you a lighter sentence.

305
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:17,050
I already said what I should say. I didn't commit any crime. I didn't have an accomplice.

306
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,560
Fine then.

307
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,610
I will give you some time to think about this carefully.

308
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,910
Take him away.

309
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,040
Cai Hong.

310
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,050
You heard everything.

311
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,740
His confession was very smooth.

312
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,310
Does that prove he's telling the truth?

313
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,590
He had to think about things from long ago. Everything came back to him.

314
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,470
Then what will we do if he strenghtens his defense?

315
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,790
It's okay. I will get the witness here next time

316
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,290
I will do it directly

317
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,830
and see how he denies it.

318
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,960
My father wronged your father

319
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,170
and the Jiang family.

320
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:07,250
It was also disastrous from my father's end.

321
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,890
Old Cai has been with us for several years.

322
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:15,810
My father regarded his as his right hand man. I never thought he would embezzle so much money.

323
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,710
Old Cai has been arrested.

324
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,870
We will soon get to the bottom of things.

325
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,170
Everything will then return to its original state.

326
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,310
<i>Could everything return to its original state?</i>

327
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,970
<i>Can everything that has happened be forgotten?</i>

328
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,010
<i>Would you take it as it didn't happen?</i>

329
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,090
Shao Tian. You must save me.

330
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,260
I'm here to tell you that

331
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,330
now that we are at this stage, you should know what you can say and shouldn't say.

332
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,970
Shao Tian, don't worry. I won't say anything.

333
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,590
I have already cleaned up my tracks.

334
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,240
Cleaned up your tracks?

335
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,540
You are too naive.

336
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,440
Now that it has come to this stage, do you think you can still clean up your tracks?

337
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,340
I...

338
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,560
Why?

339
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,510
Think about it. Ling Long lost such a big sum of money.

340
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,110
Wu Hong Da is also dead.

341
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,830
There is only one theory regarding this.

342
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,600
At this point you should disappear

343
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,790
since all the evidence points to you.

344
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,950
If you don't get caught, it will be considered very lucky for you.

345
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,810
But you don't have a good fate.

346
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:16,210
You are the only one who can bear the consequences.

347
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,070
You... You are adding insult to injury.

348
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,070
Old Cai. Take this fall.

349
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,990
I guarantee your wife and child's safety and will take care of them for the rest of their lives.

350
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
If you drag me down along with you, you should know the consequences.

351
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,980
Why don't you think about your wife and child?

352
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,130
After the testimony,

353
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,090
take care of yourself.

354
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,620
Brother, you should have your lunch.

355
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,820
What is this?

356
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,980
Porridge. Pour it away for me.

357
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,330
Pour it away?

358
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,530
Don't you love to eat porridge?

359
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,960
It's already cold. Pour it away.

360
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,820
Did Wu Cai Hong bring this?

361
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,020
Just pour it away when I tell you to.

362
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,980
I think I will throw it away as it is.

363
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:03,570
♫<i> So long, I have waited for so long... </i>♫

364
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:09,960
♫<i> Waited for your love to bloom. </i>♫

365
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:16,290
♫<i> Desperately, I was desperately struggling to find... </i>♫

366
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:22,690
♫<i> Yet couldn't find the way to your heart. </i>♫

367
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:29,180
♫<i> Gently, I gently tried to inquire </i>♫

368
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:35,490
♫<i> but did not ask you whether I was your fated love. </i>♫

369
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:41,980
♫<i> Rushing, rushing to capture you. </i>♫

370
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:47,960
♫<i> In the end I did not get your heart. </i>♫

371
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,970
Go in.

372
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,190
Sit down.

373
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:06,360
Old Cai. We invited a few witnesses here today.

374
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,080
Director Chen. You didn't need to invite the witnesses here.

375
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,550
I was clueless in the past. I denied it. Now, I'm admitting my crime.

376
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,430
I stole Ling Long's money.

377
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,190
I used a relative's name to set up a fake company.

378
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,070
I then forged Old Master Wu's signature and transferred the money over.

379
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,670
Yesterday, if we were to beat you to death, you wouldn't admit it but you are suddenly confessing now?

380
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,780
Old Cai. What game are you playing?

381
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,880
I came to my senses after going through last night.

382
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,140
Since there are witnesses, I can't deny it anymore.

383
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,450
Why don't I confess instead?

384
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,490
Perhaps, based on my attitude,

385
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,370
you could give me a lighter sentence.

386
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,900
I get it.

387
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:53,130
You are taking the fall for your accomplice. That's why you are reversing your words.

388
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:57,460
I don't have an accomplice. I'm telling the truth.

389
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,330
Director Chen. I took Ling Long's money. Accept my confession.

390
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:05,130
Fine. Let's say that when you stole the money, Wu Hong Da discovered it

391
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,620
and you killed him to shut him up. Right?

392
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,690
I didn't.

393
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,390
- Director Chen, I swear that I didn't kill Old Master Wu. <br>- Cut the crap.

394
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,710
I will ask you again. Was there an accomplice?

395
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,640
I already made a mistake by taking Ling Long's money.

396
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,050
I wouldn't dare to kill anyone, even more so, Old Master Wu.

397
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,890
I will give you one last chance. Did you have an accomplice?

398
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,020
You must know that covering up a crime is a very serious offence.

399
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,920
I really didn't have any accomplice. It's already hard enough to protect myself now.

400
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,200
If I really had an accomplice, I would cooperate with you and lighten my sentence.

401
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,930
Fine. Get him to sign the statement.

402
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,710
Take him out.

403
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,320
Do you think that Old Cai was speaking the truth?

404
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,970
Part of it was.

405
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,220
At the least, he hid the most important fact.

406
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,010
That is another accomplice.

407
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,950
Why do you think so?

408
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,340
His attitude was a complete turn around from yesterday.

409
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,740
It's too suspicious.

410
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,140
I think this matter is not that simple.

411
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,070
We will continue to investigate this.

412
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:20,000
I think, perhaps, you are thinking too much.

413
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,070
We already know that Old Cai took the money on the day of my father's incident.

414
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,980
It's just that we couldn't catch him.

415
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,440
Perhaps, he has thought it over carefully now

416
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,970
and thinks that he can't deny it any further. That's why he confessed.

417
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,990
- Did anyone visit Old Cai yesterday? <br> - Zhou Shao Tian visited him yesterday

418
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,820
I heard that Zhou Shao Tian visited you yesterday.

419
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,740
Him?

420
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,530
He did come to visit me yesterday.

421
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,710
He visited you yesterday and you confessed today. Why?

422
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,080
No.

423
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,940
He is the Wu family's future son-in-law. He came here to seek justice for Ling Long.

424
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:28,430
Seek justice for Ling Long? Did he want you to take the fall alone?

425
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,140
This is what you said, not me.

426
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,880
What did he use to threaten you?

427
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,590
Have you heard the term "murder for money?"

428
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,830
Do you think it's that simple for you to take the fall for this?

429
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:46,630
The police can use this to decide that you killed Wu Hong Da.

430
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,170
Killing a person is a life sentence.

431
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,100
Think carefully about this.

432
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,210
I admit that I was involved in it

433
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,980
but I really didn't kill him.

434
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,760
Mr Jiang. You must believe me. Tell the police that I really didn't kill anyone.

435
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,580
You were only an accessory?

436
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,490
That's right.

437
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,540
Who is your accomplice then?

438
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,920
Was it Zhou Shao Tian?

439
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,270
Don't pressure me.

440
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:19,350
Mr Jiang. I admit that I stole Ling Long's money but I'm not guilty of murder.

441
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,470
But if I say something that I shouldn't say, my wife and child will die.

442
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,140
I'm doomed.

443
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,940
I'm doomed.

444
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:46,980
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

445
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,770
Mr Jiang.

446
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,020
Why are you looking for me?

447
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,350
I think Old Cai suddenly confessing is very strange.

448
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:03,700
Thus, I went to the detention centre to have a chat with him.

449
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,420
Did you find anything new?

450
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,900
I found out the truth.

451
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,650
He is not the main culprit of stealing Ling Long's money.

452
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:12,030
He was only an accessory.

453
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,730
Okay then. Give me time and I will interrogate Old Cai immediately.

454
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,840
There is no use interrogating him now. He won't say anything.

455
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,110
Because the main culprit already has his family under control.

456
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,520
He is being threatened.

457
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,960
If this is the case, let's save Old Cai's family first.

458
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,000
If not, he won't dare to tell the truth.

459
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,830
I was tortured in the detention centre.

460
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:43,080
This proves that there are informants in the police station.

461
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,850
This was indeed negligence on my part

462
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,700
to let you suffer.

463
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,690
Sorry.

464
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,360
These informants are great for us.

465
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,030
They can help us.

466
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,160
Let's do this.

467
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,970
I will leak out the news tonight that Old Cai is willing to cooperate.

468
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,720
The condition is that we will save his family.

469
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:19,220
I will make preparations for my men to go to Old Cai's home to save his family.

470
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:24,490
As soon as the mastermind behind this gets wind of it, he will try to get to Old Chai's family first. As long as we track those people,

471
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:28,580
we will then find the location of Old Cai's home.

472
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,870
But Huzhou is so big. Who should we tail?

473
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,010
Zhou Shao Tian.

474
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,290
- Miss. <br>- Why are you so flustered?

475
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,760
I received news that the police have gotten wind of where Old Cai's home is located.

476
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,060
They are going to save his family tonight.

477
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,010
Let's go.

478
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,210
The sky is going to fall soon. Mr Zhou, you still don't know?

479
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,150
What has happened?

480
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,750
My informant at the police station told me that...

481
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,560
What did he say?

482
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,100
Mr Zhou. Do you want to owe me another favour?

483
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,930
What I want,

484
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,090
- you already know, right? <br>- Yes.

485
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,400
The secret formula. Moreover, I already promised you that

486
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,910
as long as I obtained the secret formula, I would deliver to to you immediately.

487
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,510
Miss Lu. You can speak now.

488
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:39,690
Old Cai voluntarily told the police his address.

489
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,570
He promised the police that as long as they save his family,

490
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,470
he would cooperate.

491
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:51,560
They are going to save Old Cai's family tonight.

492
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,360
This Old Cai...

493
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,020
is crap.

494
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:03,230
Miss Lu. Tell me what we should do.

495
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,780
If the police were to save them,

496
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,320
what should we do?

497
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,380
Of course, they won't be able to. You are so smart.

498
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,190
Even more so,

499
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,500
I already told you the news.

500
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,020
Remember this favour that you owe me.

501
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,470
Follow Zhou Shao Tian's henchman and bring Old Cai's family here.

502
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:40,990
Miss. Why are you doing this?

503
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,170
Of course, it's because of the secret formula that Old Cai is holding.

504
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,110
Once we get his family,

505
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,510
we will have more pieces to bargain with, right?

506
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,970
But Zhou Shao Tian already promised that

507
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:55,670
he would deliver the secret formula to you once he has gotten it.

508
00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:00,760
Whether it falls into his hands or your hands, isn't it the same?

509
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,480
Of course, it's not.

510
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,870
Save yourself first before others.

511
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,580
Go now.

512
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,660
It's here.

513
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,340
Keep watch over here.

514
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,520
You... Get the child and come with me.

515
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,930
Get the child and come with me!

516
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,000
Quick.

517
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,560
There is someone there. Stop them now.

518
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,030
