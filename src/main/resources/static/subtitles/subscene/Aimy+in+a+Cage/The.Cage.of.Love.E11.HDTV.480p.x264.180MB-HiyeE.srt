The Cage of Love

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,780
<i>Episode 11</i>

3
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,540
You don't like to make others wait, thus, I don't mind. It's okay.

5
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,560
You still remember grudges.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,600
Okay,what would you like to drink? It's on me.

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,240
Let me do it.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,640
Waitress.

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,850
Sir, Miss. What would you like to order?

10
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,040
- Coffee.
- Same for me. No cream and sugar.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,780
Okay, please wait.

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,750
You are drinking something so bitter. Are you not in a good mood?

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,850
Forget it. What about the collaboration I discussed with you previously?

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,860
I'm going to leave Huzhou. My apologies, Miss Lu. I disappointed you again.

15
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,400
It's okay. I have been rejected by you a few times.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,500
It's not unusual.

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,350
Here's your coffee.

18
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,750
Please enjoy.

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,220
But are you really happy to leave Huzhou?

20
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,620
It's like taking a step backwards.

21
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,880
Jiang Yu has already bullied you into this state and you still want to swallow it?

22
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,790
This is not the Boss Zhou that I know.

23
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,260
It would be false to say that I'm not unhappy

24
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,190
but I think certain things should be left on its own.

25
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,350
Why?

26
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,160
Because of a woman?

27
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,140
Listen more to the music.

28
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:14,060
It's not easy to find a day like today to come here and have a quiet time.

29
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,700
I really can't tell if you are just a fool for love.

30
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,800
Sorry, Miss Lu, to have disappointed you again.

31
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,310
But I would still like to advise you to think it over again.

32
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,020
Even if you change the location, is that the life you want?

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,660
Thank you for your concern during this period of time.

34
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,740
I have an appointment with a friend later.

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,940
I'm leaving first.

36
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,450
He is really a fool.

37
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,850
Love can't be touched.

38
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,140
Only with the hand of Fu money and power

39
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,220
it won't leave then.

40
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,880
Here is your money.

41
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,530
It's no hurry.

42
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,410
Boss, thank you for your money.

43
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,640
Okay.

44
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,310
Boss, here is your money.

45
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,540
Let me check. The amount is right.

46
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,630
Ah Li.

47
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,810
Brother, you are here.

48
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm still in the same line. (of work)

49
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,980
- Just blame me.
- How could I blame you?

50
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,400
I don't care about which job I take.

51
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,190
- Take this.
- Brother, what are you doing?

52
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,050
You have been with me for a long time.

53
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,870
This is what I have.

54
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,640
Sorry.

55
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,630
Brother, take back your money. I won't accept it.

56
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,150
Keep the money.

57
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:28,150
Brother, we grew up together. Without you, I wouldn't have survived.

58
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,010
You are now having a difficult time. How could I use your money?

59
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,050
If you don't accept this money, don't call me your brother again.

60
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,810
-Brother...
- Keep it!

61
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,700
Don't worry.

62
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,750
Once I succeed in Tianjin, I will contact you. We will establish Fu Sheng again.

63
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,140
Brother, I will wait for your good news.

64
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,850
Boss Jiang. Are you free this evening?

65
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,850
Tonight my close friend, Miss Cui Quan, is getting married. I would like to attend.

66
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,690
Go then.

67
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,830
Brother. Why don't you know what's in my heart?

68
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,850
What are you thinking about?

69
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,270
Everyone will bring along their partner.

70
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,900
You have many friends. Just choose anyone.

71
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,740
But everyone is taking along a male partner.

72
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,410
Brother. Go with me this evening.

73
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,730
I'm still busy. When will I find time go with you?

74
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,230
Find someone to go with you.

75
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,670
I will just find anyone to go with me this evening.

76
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,380
You are not worried?

77
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,760
With such a temper like yours, it's already good enough that you don't boss anyone around.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,710
Brother. You only just have a sister like me. You are not even going to help me with this?

79
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,150
Okay then. I will find someone else then.

80
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,190
What if someone were to sell me off?

81
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,120
Remember to tell mother not to be sad.

82
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,450
What time is it this evening?

83
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,150
7 pm.

84
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,770
- I get it.
- Thanks, Brother.

85
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,730
I'm going home to get ready. I will wait for you at home.

86
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,550
- Hello.
-Boss Jiang.

87
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,520
This is Mr Shi from the bank.

88
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,740
What's wrong? What's the matter?

89
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,170
I received news that Wu Cai Hong took a loan from the underground lenders with a high interest.

90
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,920
The money is being used to pay back to the small workshops.

91
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,180
How did that Zhou Shao Tian survive?

92
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,660
He let a woman go and borrow money?

93
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,110
There is no movement from Zhou Shao Tian lately.

94
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,020
- Is your news reliable?
- Of course.

95
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,750
She is taking a loan with high interest at this time. What is she going to use to return it?

96
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,070
Does Wu Cai Hong, with her payments, think she is the Robin Hood of the paladin. <i>a knight renowned for heroism</i>

97
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,690
It's not that. Those people are capable of burning and killing.

98
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,780
Miss Wu really has the guts.

99
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,450
Okay, wait for my news.

100
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,800
Okay.

101
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,190
Hello, Mrs Li.

102
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,410
When Miss returns home, tell her that I had some matters to attend to. I will pick her up tonight.

103
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,070
Okay.

104
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,740
<i>What I regretted</i>

105
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,410
<i>is knowing an evil person like you. I don't want to see you again.</i>

106
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,980
<i>Keep your hatred self away from me. </i>

107
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,630
<i>Wu Cai Hong.</i>

108
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,350
What? She ran away?

109
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,170
Don't panic. She won't get far away.

110
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:19,620
I am not worried. It is not my money that is being floated away.

111
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,340
Let's do this. Send men to the dock and train station.

112
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,080
Also, block off all the exits.

113
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,710
Well I'll find Zhou Shao Tian. He is like a big eyed dragon.

114
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,580
Wait.

115
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,100
It's useless to look for him.

116
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,700
He is Wu Hong Da's good friend. Why would he help you to capture his good friend's daughter?

117
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,730
What should we so then?

118
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,810
Just wait, I have contacted Director Lee.

119
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,920
Boss, your wish is my command.

120
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:08,340
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

121
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,880
Move aside. Don't let her get away.

122
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,430
Move aside. Continue to search thoroughly.

123
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,740
Quick. Go over there.

124
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,110
Cai Hong. Boss Qian is searching here.

125
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,480
Leave with me now.

126
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,780
Stepmom, let's leave now.

127
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,260
Move aside.

128
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,980
Hide yourselves now. Cai Hong and I will see if we distract them.

129
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,820
Be careful.

130
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,230
- What's going on?
-- Move aside.

131
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,660
Run with me.

132
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,540
They are over there. Go after them.

133
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,700
Quick.

134
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,690
Over there! Quick!

135
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,580
They are over there. Move aside.

136
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,270
Move aside. Over there.

137
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,870
Get down. What are you doing?

138
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,310
- Quick. Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

139
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,660
Bastards. Go after them now.

140
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,690
Quick. Hurry up.

141
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,630
Don't let them get away.

142
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,330
Over there. Go after them.

143
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,990
It's so hot. Cai Yun, let's go home.

144
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,650
The boat is leaving.

145
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,370
Where are the tickets?

146
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,720
I don't have them.

147
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,840
You don't have them. Let 's go back home then.

148
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,610
Mom, be careful.

149
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,860
Go inside here first.

150
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,480
They are over there.

151
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,270
Go after them.

152
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,220
Cai Hong.

153
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,750
They are over there.

154
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,440
Let's go now, Cai Hong.

155
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,230
- Let's go.
- Zhou Shao Tian.

156
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,190
Move aside.

157
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,790
They are over there. Zhou Shao Tian!

158
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,860
Quick. Move aside.

159
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,900
Stop there.

160
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,530
Young Master. It's getting dark.

161
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,370
We have already searched the entire Huzhou.

162
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,520
- Why don't we go back?
- Continue to search.

163
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,300
Yes.

164
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,630
Stop there.

165
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,770
What are you doing? Why did you push my cart?

166
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,230
Move aside.

167
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,540
Move aside.

168
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,520
Let's go.

169
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,830
Stop them.

170
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,660
Let's go.

171
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,880
The ambience is great. Congratulations.

172
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,460
Congratulations.

173
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,680
Fei Fei.

174
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,790
Fei Fei.

175
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,070
Yan Yan, long time no see.

176
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,080
This is...

177
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,460
My boyfriend, Jia Ming.

178
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,410
Jia Ming. This is our class beauty who I have been telling you. She is Fang Fei Fei.

179
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,340
- Hello.
- Hello.

180
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,640
Yan Yan mentions you often. It is nice to meet you today.

181
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,400
Sure enough, it's just as she says.
Thank you.

182
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,850
Yan Yan. You haven't seen each other for a long time and must have a lot to talk about. I will wait for you inside.

183
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,580
Okay.

184
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,280
Your boyfriend is not bad.

185
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,150
He's okay. Let's not talk about him. Let me take a look at you.

186
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,590
Fei Fei. You are becoming more beautiful.

187
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:52,140
How can I be compared to you? You have such a good looking boyfriend. You must be really blessed.

188
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,350
I can't be compared to you. You have a childhood love, Boss Jiang.

189
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,220
He is your senior buddy and husband too.

190
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,290
Don't talk nonsense.

191
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,830
Why don't I see Mr Jiang?

192
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:15,630
He has some matters to attend to for the time being. He will be here later.

193
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,690
I should be able to be at yours and Mr Jiang's wedding banquet soon.

194
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,350
Don't be happy for me.

195
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:27,590
Who says so? Frankly speaking, our cohorts are already at a marriageable age.

196
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,860
Today is Sister Cui's day,

197
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:35,490
my wedding is set for the spring of next year. We could celebrate two weddings in the same year!

198
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,830
In this case, you and Mr Jiang's wedding banquet shouldn't be that far ahead.

199
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,300
It's late. I wonder how is my stepmom and sister are doing.

200
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,730
I will arrange for us to find them later.

201
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,180
Let's take a break first.

202
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,100
I am afraid they are behind. I can go on.

203
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,830
Let's take a break.

204
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,050
Cai Hong. I'm useless.

205
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,500
Driving you to desperately flee with me.

206
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,550
Are you afraid?

207
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,190
As long as you are with me, I'm not afraid of anything.

208
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,200
Ma Li told me that in the past,

209
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,320
they lived in the slums

210
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,390
and fought over a hot bun.

211
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,260
I have never imagined that there would be this kind of life.

212
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:49,240
When my dad was still around, I couldn't even phantom the feeling of starvation.

213
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,710
Not until after my father's death did I understand that reality is harsh.

214
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:01,790
Also experience the pain that brother Shao Tian experienced in the past.

215
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,450
Cai Hong. Everything is in the past now.

216
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,820
Everything will get better.

217
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,970
Let's work hard together.

218
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,900
There is a carriage over there. Let's go.

219
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,150
Wait!

220
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,750
Wait.

221
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,920
Wait!

222
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,280
You don't want your life? What if I had knocked you down?

223
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,050
Please help us.

224
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,290
We have urgent matters and need to leave the city. We would like to hitch a ride from you.

225
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,450
Sir, please help us. We are really in a hurry.

226
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,120
It's not that I don't want to help you. Can't you see that my cart is full?

227
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,480
How could I take in any passengers?

228
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,860
Sir, take this. Please help us.

229
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,370
I can tell.

230
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,280
You two are not guilty of anything? <i>referring to a crime</i>

231
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,930
I am not blinded by the dark.

232
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,460
Is someone out there trying to capture you?

233
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,750
Sir, you see our need. What else can we do?

234
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,730
Good people will have good karma. Please help us.

235
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,570
Yes, please help us.

236
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,390
It is obvious that the two of you eloped.

237
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,120
If I were to give you a ride, they will capture me.

238
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,880
I don't want to involved myself. Chances are not only your family but the police will accuse me of it. (helping them.)

239
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,080
I can only bring one of you. That way when I get stopped, I can justify it.

240
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,940
No. We must both leave together.

241
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,570
Look. My cart is very small.

242
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,080
It doesn't matter which goes...

243
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,830
I can't do too much to help.

244
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,230
Forget it. It's still better that you wait...

245
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,600
Sir. Please take him out of the city.

246
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,070
Please help me.

247
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:56,780
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

248
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,990
Little rascal. You have a good life.

249
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,780
You met such a good lady.

250
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,820
I really envy you.

251
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,790
<i>Brother Shao Tian. When you wake up,</i>

252
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,810
<i>please don't be angry with me.</i>

253
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,720
Cai Hong?

254
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,310
Stop the carriage.

255
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,950
Wu Cai Hong.

256
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,410
Wu Cai Hong.

257
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,840
Wu Cai Hong.

258
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,560
You dare to leave without saying goodbye?

259
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,950
We are not even friends. Why should I tell you when I leave?

260
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,770
You can't leave.

261
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,680
I'm not your slave. You don't have the right to make that request.

262
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,860
Let go.

263
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,610
Jiang Yu, let me down!

264
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,820
Jiang Yu!

265
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,480
Let me down!

266
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,250
What are you doing?

267
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,530
Come here now.

268
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,940
- There is food.
- Go ahead.

269
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,120
Come, stop and come over here.

270
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,820
What's your name?

271
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,940
It's late. What are you doing?

272
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,710
Leave.

273
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,940
What exactly is going on? Why are they checking so thoroughly?

274
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,650
Open the cover.

275
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,440
It can't be connected to this little rascal and that lady.

276
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,490
- Slowly.
- Open that.

277
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,640
You. Come here. Open this.

278
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,110
Okay, go over there.

279
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,280
Those behind, go first.

280
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,650
Next.

281
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,180
Stop there!

282
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,530
Stop there!

283
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,900
- What's your name?
- It's Li Er Gou.

284
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,110
-What is all this?
-Miscellaneous things. Mainly groceries from town.

285
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,090
- Where are you taking them?
- Out of the city to my village.

286
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,730
Who is he?

287
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,750
He is my nephew.

288
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,840
Nephew?

289
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,700
He is sick.

290
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,900
Why didn't you tell me earlier? Leave now.

291
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,650
Stop the cart.

292
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,030
- Little rascal.
- Where is Cai Hong?

293
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,270
Cai Hong.

294
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,070
- You are looking for that lady?
- Where is she?

295
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,840
The lady gave you one whack and you were on the ground.

296
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,370
I carried you onto the cart. She didn't get onto the cart.

297
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,900
She didn't get on.

298
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,650
She insisted that I bring you out of the city

299
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,700
before I agreed to take you out of the city.

300
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,380
Little rascal. The police are waiting there to capture you.

301
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,680
If you go back now, you will be beaten to death.

302
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,800
Big brother, I can't abandon Cai Hong. I need to find her.

303
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,390
My name is Zhou Shao Tian. I will remember your kindness. I will thank you in the future.

304
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,320
Thanks.

305
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,890
Little rascal, be careful.

306
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,890
This is a passionate and decent kid.

307
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:13,860
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

308
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,320
What are you doing?

309
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:32,750
Okay, we are leaving.

310
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,820
We are going back then.

311
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,360
Do you want to say farewell to your friend?

312
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,670
Forget it. She doesn't look like she's in a good mood. We might get snubbed.

313
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,000
Let's go.

314
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,220
<i> Thank you. </i>

315
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:16,570
<i>Brother. You promised me that you would come. You clearly did.</i>

316
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,070
<i>How could you not keep your word?</i>

317
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,780
<i>How could you?</i>

318
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,920
It's just a small gesture. It has been hard on you last night.

319
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,870
Since you have already found the person,

320
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,200
I would advise you that you take her home immediately.

321
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,830
Thanks.

322
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,690
I'm not just a policeman. It's such an expensive item. I can't accept it.

323
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,860
Take this back.

324
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,320
I have never taken back my gifts.

325
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,270
If you like it, keep it. If you don't,

326
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,290
just throw it away.

327
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,650
I will help you to give it to someone who needs it.

328
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,660
Do whatever you want.

329
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,110
Sit down.

330
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,900
Where is Cai Hong?

331
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,240
Tell me where Cai Hong is.

332
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,590
If you dare to harm her, I will never let you off.

333
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,770
She is safe with me.

334
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,660
As long as she is not with you, everything will be fine.

335
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,710
Don't be rash.

336
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,620
There are many people out there who want to get you into trouble.

337
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,270
As long as you hand over the money to me,

338
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,810
I can help you to settle this issue.

339
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,610
How can you just stare at money

340
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,130
without it being an ulterior motive?

341
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,910
Hand over the money. The most you will get is a few years in jail.

342
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,960
As for the other matters, I won't pursue them.

343
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,410
Once you are out of jail, you can go anywhere.

344
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,780
If you still want to do business, I can give you some money.

345
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,960
Is that so?

346
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,640
But why do I still feel that you think I'm the killer?

347
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,830
They haven't caught the killer of Wu Hong Da.

348
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,930
Although the police have now closed the case,

349
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,740
Wu Cai Hong hasn't given up yet.

350
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:59,750
There are merchants in Huzhou, for their own interests, also urging the police to catch the murderers.

351
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,330
I think

352
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,790
the murderer must have sleepless nights.

353
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,720
What a pity.

354
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,880
I don't have that money.

355
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,400
Nor did I kill Wu Hong Da. I must have disappointed you.

356
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,340
Tell me. If Wu Cai Hong knows that you have a

357
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,180
unknown origin, she would like you?

358
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,830
I predict that she will hate you for the rest of her life.

359
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,090
Stop this despicable underhanded tactics of yours to split us apart.

360
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,630
Do you think you are that noble?

361
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:55,680
Say whatever you like. If you have the substance, show me the evidence.

362
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,780
Yes, I have a big sum of money.

363
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,970
Where is the money? Where is the evidence? Do you have them?

364
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,800
Boss Jiang, you have always had to justify it.

365
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,000
Let's wait and see then.

366
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,740
Let's see how long you can hide that money.

367
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,290
Boss Jiang. Boss Jiang.
Did you find the rascal?

368
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,970
Not yet.

369
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,890
Don't worry. I'm in this line.

370
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,020
In this world, there isn't anyone who doesn't need my money.

371
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,800
It's not that easy as you think.

372
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,930
We already have him in our hands.

373
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,070
I don't trust that devil anymore.

374
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,840
If he refused to admit it, what can you do?

375
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,790
Boss Jiang. What are your plans? I will listen to you.

376
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,770
Zhou Shao Tian. You can leave.

377
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,510
Why?

378
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,920
When I say you can leave, just leave. Stop asking irrelevant questions.

379
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,410
Let me tell you. Return the money soon.

380
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,120
Don't think of running away again.

381
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,820
When it comes to money, don't mess with the boss.

382
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,290
He has friends with the mafia. You won't be able to escape from him.

383
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:59,740
A small fry like you, even if Boss Qian kills you, you are just like an ant.

384
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,050
Where is this place?

385
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,410
Why did you bring me here?

386
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,690
I brought you here to meet the Brother Shao Tian that you wanted to meet.

387
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,940
Brother Shao Tian?

388
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,220
What exactly do you want?

389
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,700
To show you that he gave you a magic potion to drink.
<i>expression - he is lying to you.</i>

390
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,350
If you are angry, just direct it at me.

391
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,950
Don't harm Brother Shao Tian.

392
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,890
Don't worry. I won't harm him.

393
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,820
I guarantee that after tonight, you won't want to see him again.

394
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,940
What exactly are you trying to do?

395
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,700
You took Ling Long away.

396
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,280
You bankrupted Fu Sheng.

397
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,750
What else are you going to do?

398
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,830
I want you to see clearly which exactly is the evil person instead.

399
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,140
What are you doing?

400
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,290
Let me go. Let me go.

401
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,770
Let me go.

402
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,610
Jiang Yu. What are you doing?

403
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,800
Let me go.

404
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,560
Sorry. You will have to suffer for a while first.

405
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,490
If you want to find out who the real killer is,

406
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,760
be a bit more patient.

407
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,250
You didn't want to pay back the loan and tried to run away?

408
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,490
- I already told you that I don't have the money.
- No money?

409
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,860
Zhou Shao Tian. Your really know how to pretend.

410
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:10,700
No wonder Miss Wu has been tricked by you more than three times.

411
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,010
Who told you this? I have never tricked her.

412
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,230
You didn't?

413
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,860
You and Old Cai split half of the money you stole from Ling Long.

414
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:29,330
I loaned you the money then because I knew that you would be able to pay me back.

415
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:33,780
Did you really think that I believed that you could expand your business?

416
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,710
Shao Tian, did you actually kid yourself and believe you could

417
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,290
actually pack up and run away?

418
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:48,090
I already told you that I will think of a solution to pay you back.

419
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,230
Think of a solution?

420
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,890
What solution would you have?

421
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,960
You owe money to many debtors. Will you be able to pay them back?

422
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,950
How much will be left to pay me?

423
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:04,650
Boss Qian. Don't force me into a corner.

424
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,020
Okay, I won't press you. You should also be frank.

425
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,970
The return of the money from Ling Long will be good enough for me.

426
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:16,010
The balance of the money will help you and Miss Wu to start anew.

427
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,740
Let's do this. Pay me back the money and we are even.

428
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,840
I don't have it. I already told you that I didn't.

429
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,390
Zhou Shao Tian, if I don't use force,

430
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,760
do you think I'm that weak?

431
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,480
Let's see if your mouth is stronger than my fist.

432
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,920
Beat him.

433
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,270
Enough.

434
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:48,620
Zhou Shao Tian. I advise you to pay me back soon so that you will suffer less.

435
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,670
I already said that

436
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,830
I really don't have that money.

437
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,230
Fine.

438
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,820
Bring him here.

439
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,090
Let me go.

440
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,860
Do you see him? He is just like you. He owes me money and he didn't pay me back.

441
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,470
Come, cut him.

442
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:11,860
Don't!

443
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,070
Did you see this? You will be next.

444
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,750
Don't kid yourself and just give up.

445
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,610
If you don't return the money, I will cut off your ear.

446
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,840
Tell me now. Are you going to pay me back or not.

447
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,300
Are you going to pay me back or not? Speak.

448
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,950
Are you going to pay me back or not?

449
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,920
If you don't return the money, I will cut off your ear.

450
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,880
Are you going to pay me back or not?

451
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,870
I...

452
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,140
Speak now.

453
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,150
You should be happy to talk.

454
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,270
Speak!

455
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,340
Jiang Yu!

456
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,520
You are really despicable!

457
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,900
What is this trick?

458
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,180
Shameless!

459
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,140
Small minded person!

460
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,220
Brother Shao Tian.

461
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,840
- Brother Shao Tian.
- Today, I must...

462
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,220
Cai Hong.

463
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,830
-Cai Hong
-Cai Hong

464
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,890
Cai Hong! I'm taking you to the hospital.

465
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,840
Cai Hong.

466
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,230
Just kill me.

467
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,860
Bring it on!

468
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,660
Are you a man?

469
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,780
My greatest skill is to take away your riches and repossess them.

470
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,170
- Miss.
- Why are you back alone?

471
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,900
Where is my brother?

472
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,580
Young Master had some matters to attend to.

473
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,680
What matters?

474
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,430
Tell me quick. What exactly is it?

475
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,600
Where is he?

476
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,280
Young Master is with Wu Cai Hong.

477
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,060
Wu Cai Hong is injured now.

478
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,750
Young Master is with her at the hospital. I'm back here to take some stuff for him.

479
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,930
I get it.

480
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,870
Go and get it.

481
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,910
<i>No. It's Mrs Jiang who is not like the rest.</i>

482
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:35,450
<i>Mrs. Jiang. Those two words have a nice right to them. </i>

483
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,490
<i>Don't talk nonsense. If brother hear this, I'm in trouble.</i>

484
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,140
<i>Who says I'm talking nonsense? You and Boss Jiang,</i>

485
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:45,460
<i>No. You and your brother were in fact friends since childhood. </i>

486
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,030
<i>The post of Mrs Jiang is yours forever.</i>

487
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:54,580
<i>That's right. There is no difference whether we call you this now or in the future.</i>

488
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,700
<i>Mrs Jiang.</i>

489
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,400
<i>No one can be compared to you. You have a childhood sweetheart, Boss Jiang, who grew up together with you.</i>

490
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,900
<i>He is senior buddy and also a husband.</i>

491
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,830
<i>We should be able to attend yours and Mr Jiang's wedding banquet soon.</i>

492
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,590
<i>This home is mine.</i>

493
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:35,720
<i>I will never lose everything.</i>

494
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,450
Doctor. What is her condition?

495
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,670
Her injury is a bit deep but unfortunately, it didn't affect her bones.

496
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,830
She will be fine if she has a proper rest.

497
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,530
If there is anything, just call me.

498
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,320
Thanks.

499
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:21,780
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

500
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,730
Did I make a mistake?

501
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,750
Mom.
