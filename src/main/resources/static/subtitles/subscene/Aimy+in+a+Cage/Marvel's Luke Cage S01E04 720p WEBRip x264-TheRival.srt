00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:36,515
[radio chatter in distance]

00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,313
[debris shifting]

[engine revving]

00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:49,361
-[man] All the way.
-[indistinct radio chatter]

7
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:51,405
Break it up a little bit.
There you go.

8
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:54,116
Pin that area.
That needs to be cut, as well.

9
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:58,162
-Johnson. Yeah, I see it. I see it.
-Right.

10
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:00,289
[conversation continues indistinctly]

11
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:07,713
-Hey.
-Hey.

12
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:09,381
Any survivors?

13
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:11,175
Inside, your guess is as good as ours.

14
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:12,259
We're lucky only the restaurant

15
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:14,511
and the apartments above collapsed,
and not the whole structure.

16
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:15,888
This could've been a hell of a lot worse.

17
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:17,723
-Who's this guy?
-[firefighter] Chinese guy's the owner.

18
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:20,350
Says his wife and their tenant
were in the restaurant when it happened.

19
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:24,313
Can you, uh...
give me a call if anything changes?

20
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:26,440
-No problem.
-What's the matter?

21
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:30,485
This is... Luke Cage's place.

22
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:35,825
Rafe, this was outside in,

23
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:37,201
-not inside out.
-[Scarfe] Uh-huh.

24
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:40,204
Or there'd be shit
all across the street like projectiles

25
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:42,748
if the explosion had been on the inside.

26
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:50,715
If that damn thing works,
we get answers?

27
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:52,883
If that damn thing works.

28
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:55,260
I'll call the precinct,
tell 'em we're on our way,

29
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:56,929
have 'em cue up the footage.

30
00:02:57,972 --> 00:03:00,975
Hey, they got their job to do,
we got our job to do.

31
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,191
Sir.

32
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:12,486
Are you sure
Luke Cage is in there with her?

33
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,822
I think so.
Not really sure.

34
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:35,175
[Rackham] <i>Shut up!</i>
<i>In here, you got no voice.</i>

35
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:38,012
<i>You got no rights.</i>

36
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:39,679
<i>You used to be a citizen...</i>

37
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:43,600
<i>but from the moment you reached</i>
<i>the bottom of stupid,</i>

38
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:45,936
<i>your dumb asses</i>
<i>belonged to the state of Georgia.</i>

39
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,230
<i>-If you are a recidivist...</i>
-Bend over.

40
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:50,565
<i>-...then you know the rules.</i>
-Cough.

41
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:52,985
<i>-If, however...</i>
-[coughs]

42
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:55,821
...this is your first visit
to the Seagate theme park...

43
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:57,322
let me just say...

44
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:01,952
long as you follow the rules,
you'll be fine.

45
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:03,620
Rule number one.

46
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,458
You will obey every rule I say
after rule number one.

47
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:11,086
Rule number two.

48
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,423
None but the righteous shall see God.

49
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:16,508
And since we ain't got
no righteous people in here,

50
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,511
God ain't gonna have to worry about
your shitty prayers.

51
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:22,848
So that means
I'm his mean, shitty substitute.

52
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:24,016
[Luke scoffs]

53
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:27,269
Rule number three.

54
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:29,688
Ain't no talking when I'm talking.

55
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,190
[grunts and coughs]

56
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:35,027
Don't start a fight
if you can't take a punch.

57
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,239
I'm surprised I had to tell
a former law officer to follow the rules.

58
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:42,117
[straining] New life.
Not quite used to it yet.

59
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:44,036
[Rackham] Yeah, well...

60
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:48,207
Come on.
Good thing you have many years to adjust.

61
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,752
And remember, how you start...

62
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:56,924
is how you end in places like this.

63
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:59,134
No one does it alone.

64
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:06,725
-All right, get 'em to their cells.
-[guard] You heard him. Let's go.

65
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:16,110
[breathing heavily]

66
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:27,246
[yelling]

67
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:30,916
[crying]

68
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:34,044
I didn't do it.

69
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:36,130
[men shouting in distance]

70
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:51,145
Just remember who you are...
and you'll get through this.

71
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:53,772
[breathing heavily]

72
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:55,399
[softly] Carl Lucas.

73
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:59,486
I am Carl Lucas.

74
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,573
Damn it.

75
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:05,325
I'm Carl Lucas.

76
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:10,247
[Reva] If you don't make attempts
to befriend someone,

77
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,167
loneliness is guaranteed
to eat you alive.

78
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:18,964
Let's start with you, Reggie.

79
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:20,715
In here, I'm Squabbles.

80
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:25,429
Reggie...
he had a job, family, a life.

81
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:26,972
You still have a family.

82
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:29,683
I haven't seen my family in years.

83
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:34,729
I asked them for forgiveness.
It seems like they don't really care.

84
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:36,815
[Reva] How have you dealt with it?

85
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:40,235
I haven't seen my family
since the first time I was here.

86
00:06:41,153 --> 00:06:43,572
Now I just take it one day at a time.

87
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:46,783
[inmates agreeing indistinctly]

88
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:50,537
Carl?

89
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:58,795
I don't need to, want to
or have to get to know anybody.

90
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:03,633
That's like
placing yourself in solitary...

91
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:05,427
without actually going to the hole.

92
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,804
You can't trust nobody
in a place like this.

93
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:09,889
'Cause you used to be a cop?

94
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:12,017
[inmates murmuring]

95
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:13,936
I ain't the first cop to do time.

96
00:07:15,187 --> 00:07:18,523
And I ain't ever sent nobody to Seagate,
so I ain't got that problem.

97
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:24,279
But trust in places like this...
sets you up for failure.

98
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,867
[Squabbles]
You know she ain't mean no harm.

99
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:31,578
Reminding you of what you ain't got
can be pretty damn mean.

100
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,538
Or it can help you focus.

101
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:36,833
You know, this type of loneliness in here,
it can kill.

102
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,628
Not if you stay strong.

103
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,964
And if you believe that,
you're dumb.

104
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:44,424
You know, strength has its limits.

105
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:46,426
Everybody eventually caves.

106
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:50,805
If you're looking for a friend,
keep looking, Squabbles.

107
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:54,434
It can't be that hard
finding one in a place like this.

108
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:58,897
Yeah, it is...
and most of them act like you.

109
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:03,902
[indistinct chatter on PA]

110
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:11,994
[Shades]
That the dude you mentioned?

111
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:14,704
[Rackham] Yeah, that's him.

112
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:19,209
They say three things get a cop locked up.

113
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:22,421
Pride, power, or pussy.

114
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:25,090
Yeah, well, I take pride
in my power over pussy,

115
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:26,925
and I ain't never seen a day in lock-up.

116
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:29,844
What's he in here for?

117
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:32,222
[Rackham] I've seen his jacket.

118
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:34,891
With that amount of years
for what they said he did...

119
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:37,644
[chuckling] I'm guessing
he pissed someone off good.

120
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,397
Ah, he was sent here to rot.

121
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,318
Yo, man, time's up.

122
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:51,533
[Comanche] What you wanna do?

123
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:54,786
See if he bends or breaks.

124
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:08,967
[grunting and straining]

125
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:11,095
[Luke grunting]

126
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,598
[all grunting]

127
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,236
[groaning]

128
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:31,198
[alarm blaring]

129
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:33,700
[all grunting]

130
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:38,913
[both coughing]

131
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,378
I'm not just gonna take shit
because you're dishing it out, you hear?

132
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:46,713
[guard] Hands in the air!

133
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:50,008
I'm just trying to survive!

134
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,051
[grunts]

135
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:56,556
Guess I found me a gladiator.

136
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,392
[breathing heavily]

137
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:03,147
[shutter slides open]

138
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:06,400
[Rackham]
Well, you're a hell of a fighter, Lucas.

139
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:08,402
You learn that in the military...

140
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:11,780
or during your police training?

141
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:13,072
Hmm?

142
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:15,950
How'd you like to live like a king...

143
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:18,370
using them fists of yours?

144
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:23,292
We got some bad boys
who's pretty good with their hands.

145
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,336
And they making money in here.
Good-ass money.

146
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:29,047
I want you to get in on this.

147
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:33,218
Believe it or not,
it'll benefit both of us.

148
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:36,513
And I get a little extra coin.
And you... [clicks tongue]

149
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:38,056
if you survive...

150
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:41,393
get to be your own man.

151
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:47,316
Untouched, extra rations,
maybe a conjugal or two, hmm?

152
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:50,277
It's a good offer, convict.

153
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:53,197
Slavery was always a good offer...

154
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:55,990
to a master.

155
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:04,249
[men shouting in distance]

156
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,554
[grunting softly]

157
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:29,858
Connie.

158
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:32,277
-Connie!
-[groans]

159
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:34,821
-[Luke sighs]
-[groaning]

160
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:37,616
Ow. What happened?

161
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,326
The building fell on us.

162
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:41,495
[Connie] How?

163
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:45,915
Something came flying at the building,
and I got you out of the way.

164
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:49,919
[coughing] My... my leg...
is trapped.

165
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:52,422
-[shuddering] I smell--
-[Luke] Gas.

166
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:55,675
We're not going to have a lot of time,
but we have to be careful.

167
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,051
[panting]

168
00:11:57,135 --> 00:12:01,598
If this rubble shifts the wrong way
or if we make the wrong move...

169
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:03,767
it could set off a spark
and this whole place could blow.

170
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,896
Who do you think's gonna move the rubble?
You? Me?

171
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:11,400
You think they can get to us?

172
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,902
If they can't get to us,
we gonna have to get to them.

173
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:15,153
How?

174
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:20,950
Okay, Connie.

175
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:24,288
The best way I can put this is...

176
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:27,999
I'm kind of strong.

177
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:39,010
[whispering] Holy shit!

178
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:48,353
-[grunting]
-[rubble shifting]

179
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:55,902
[groaning]

180
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:04,453
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

181
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:05,954
Hey, you wanna play?

182
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:11,250
Hey, man, I'm talking to you.
Wake up! Hey, wake up!

183
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:20,218
[Squabbles] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

184
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:23,680
You think can't nobody read that look
a thousand miles out?

185
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:28,893
Cop a squat before you do
something stupid like catch a body.

186
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:31,813
You know, the best way
to stay out of the hole

187
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:34,983
is to stay out of your head,
especially when it's full of hate.

188
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:48,372
[grunting]

189
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:51,207
[sighing loudly]

190
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,417
[inhaling deeply]

191
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:55,629
Breathe some of this fresh air,
young blood.

192
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:57,381
Count down your days.

193
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,139
[Squabbles] Man, you outta your mind?
You mean to tell me...

194
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:11,185
[stuttering] this cover
of <i>Rolling Stone</i> with Lisa Bonet, and...

195
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:16,775
the hair, the...
the nakedness, her eyes on me--

196
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:19,736
-On you?
-On me!

197
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:22,656
You mean to tell me this ain't hot?

198
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:26,993
Says it right here, on the cover.
"The Hot Issue."

199
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:31,247
Come out of the time machine, Squabs.
There's a lot of new honeys out there.

200
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,083
You don't know nothing about Beyoncé?

201
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,585
Nicki Minaj?

202
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:38,797
-Lisa Bonet's daughter?
-She got a daughter?

203
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,298
[indistinct chatter over TV]

204
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:42,967
Zoë.

205
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:45,845
Or like I call her, Godfather, Part Two.

206
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:50,559
The sequel better than the original?

207
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:52,060
[Luke] Close.

208
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:55,021
Look, I was defendin' myself
killing that dude.

209
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:57,941
-But you went to his house.
-It was-- Whatcha... whatcha call it?

210
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:01,069
-Preventative.
-Just more excuses.

211
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:03,196
That's all I've heard
for the last 20 minutes.

212
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,824
I mean, do any of you
ever say to yourself,

213
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:08,785
"I... I have to take responsibility
for what I did,

214
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:09,953
the reason I'm here"?

215
00:15:10,036 --> 00:15:11,746
What, you mean,
like, the... the 12 steps?

216
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,749
Yeah, yeah, unless you were set up.

217
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,418
I know I was set up.

218
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:17,877
-[chuckling]
-[inmate] Me, too.

219
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:21,673
-[inmates agreeing indistinctly]
-Even if you were set up...

220
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:25,176
you have to see your involvement
in what went down.

221
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,720
You ever say that to yourself?

222
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:30,640
You ask these men
to come clean with themselves,

223
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:32,559
and they don't know a thing about you.

224
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:37,689
What gives you the right to listen to us,
but not share anything about yourself?

225
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:39,649
That's not my role.

226
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,527
-Trust has to be earned.
-True.

227
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:45,822
Maybe if you tell us
what you're fighting...

228
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:47,991
we'll be a little more open
to do the same.

229
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:53,538
Did you do something wrong
that you need to take responsibility for?

230
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,043
-I did.
-What happened?

231
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:02,255
Was it a brother, sister,
or family member that you

232
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,173
didn't focus on like you should have,

233
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:07,552
while you were growing your life,
earning your degree?

234
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:17,103
Time's up, guys.

235
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,111
Mr. Lucas?

236
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:29,323
Two minutes.

237
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:42,170
Most you've said since you've been here.

238
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:46,090
I might have gone
a few words past necessary.

239
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:52,096
My brother, he died in jail
while I was getting my masters.

240
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:58,102
I knew he needed help, but at the time
I felt I did all I could do, and I have...

241
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:01,773
[inhales] regretted feeling
that way ever since.

242
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:06,570
-Sorry I pressed.
-You did.

243
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:10,406
But don't be sorry.

244
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:13,702
And don't act
like you did it for the guys 'cause...

245
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:15,787
you did it to keep me from pressing you.

246
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:19,791
Guilty.

247
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,836
What did that question spark in you?

248
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:30,134
I know...
what it's like to be on this side.

249
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:34,764
And... from where I'm at...

250
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:38,101
that idea seems like bullshit.

251
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:41,145
[scoffing] You innocent?

252
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,648
Doesn't matter.

253
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,527
[sighs]

254
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:54,075
You are.

255
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:58,580
I'm guilty of a lot of things
that people will never know about.

256
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:03,167
I guess it's karma's way
of reminding me...

257
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:05,629
that she can be a bitch.

258
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:08,172
You should tell the group that.

259
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:11,425
You really do care, don't you?

260
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:14,053
I do.

261
00:18:22,646 --> 00:18:24,188
[guard] Let's go, Carl.

262
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:31,905
It's not often I see a prisoner
leave you speechless.

263
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:33,990
[sighs]

264
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:37,911
He's in prison, but...

265
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:41,164
[inhaling sharply]
he's not a prisoner.

266
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:43,124
Slo-mo, frame by frame.

267
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:47,712
[man] It wasn't a gas leak.

268
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:50,840
That was not a gas leak.

269
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:53,217
Who the hell would use a rocket in Harlem?

270
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:55,053
Who do you think?

271
00:18:57,388 --> 00:19:02,393
So, some of the inmates think people
are being experimented on in Seagate?

272
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,519
Yes.

273
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:06,105
Jimmy Quinto said that, uh,

274
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:10,276
he was gonna get his sentence reduced
if he went through some experiments.

275
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,822
-Now, was he lying?
-[chuckling] Of course he was.

276
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:17,075
He probably did a plea bargain...
[stammers] or testified.

277
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:19,744
Jimmy Quinto?
A snitch?

278
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:22,580
-Nah. No way.
-[inmate] Nah.

279
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:24,248
He ain't here.

280
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:26,710
Ain't nobody heard of him dying, so...

281
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:29,628
[Reva] I know you all think
because Seagate is privately owned,

282
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:33,007
there's some <i>X-Files</i> stuff
permeating the place.

283
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:34,175
There isn't.

284
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:37,511
Just think about all the stories
you've heard about Seagate.

285
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:41,224
The ghost stories,
millionaires hidden in dungeons.

286
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,686
[chuckling]
Tupac still alive on an island.

287
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:46,145
So he just got out?

288
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:48,606
More than likely, Jimmy just got out.

289
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:52,736
Only problem is you work for Seagate.

290
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:56,740
So, if it is true...
why would you admit it?

291
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,908
Good point.

292
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:02,704
I give you my word, Carl.

293
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:06,249
There are no experiments happening here.

294
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:11,337
Damn, long as I've been coming here,

295
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,590
I ain't never heard her give her word,
young blood.

296
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,765
[Reva] You know, I appreciate this,
you staying behind.

297
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:29,355
Took me a while to realize
that I was raised with manners.

298
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,776
Should've done this a long time ago.

299
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:37,781
Stacking chairs is easier than talking.

300
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:41,284
Why can't I get you to talk?

301
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:44,578
Hmm?

302
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:48,666
You're not a murderer.
You're not some serial killer.

303
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,335
You're a man who trusted the wrong people.

304
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:55,464
You made a few stupid mistakes...
caught a bad break.

305
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:57,675
Do you know how I caught that bad break?

306
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:01,304
Talking to people.

307
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:05,016
-Trusting them.
-So why do you come here?

308
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:08,227
Because you provide hope.

309
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:10,354
Thank you.

310
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:13,858
When you're not trying to hit somebody
with that hierarchy of needs shit--

311
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:15,693
Oh, you couldn't just be nice, could you?

312
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:18,196
-I have a reputation to live up to.
-[chuckling]

313
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,031
Back away, Lucas.

314
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,372
I guess I gotta go.

315
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:47,058
[door closes]

316
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:49,978
[Rackham chuckling]

317
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,521
Doc Connors, huh?

318
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:56,609
[chuckling] Getting caught up with her
ain't the smartest thing,

319
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:59,112
but, man, she's gorgeous,
I'll give you that.

320
00:22:00,113 --> 00:22:02,198
-You looking out for me now?
-Why, you want pussy?

321
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,699
I can get you that.

322
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:06,202
You ain't got to wet dream
about Doc Connors.

323
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,454
You want extra shit?
I'll get you that, too.

324
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:11,665
This about me fighting for you?
That's not the lane I want to play in.

325
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:14,335
[chuckling]
You must smell a lot of shit

326
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,504
having your ass
on your shoulders all the time.

327
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:18,589
I make you an easy offer,
throw in some perks,

328
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,091
and you just shrug 'em off.

329
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:23,219
Well, it's lucky I'm a patient man.

330
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:25,304
Smart enough to know you'd say no.

331
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:27,556
Gave me time to build a backup plan.

332
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,190
Squabbles, put down that shiv!

333
00:22:36,274 --> 00:22:37,316
[blowing whistle]

334
00:22:40,987 --> 00:22:42,989
You don't fight,
I tear your little world apart,

335
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:44,615
starting with your homie Squabbles.

336
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:47,451
-[Squabbles grunting]
-[guard] Get down! Get down!

337
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:49,037
Stay seated!
Stay seated!

338
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,664
-[grunting]
-Look at me when I'm talking to you.

339
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,168
Rackham, stop!

340
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:58,796
I don't move quick, your man's gonna get
another 20 years, easy. Or life.

341
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:01,215
You want this stopped,
you tell me what I wanna hear.

342
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:05,261
-[blowing whistle]
-[guard] Stop moving!

343
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:07,388
You son of a bitch.

344
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:10,391
Yeah, that's "smart son of a bitch"
to you.

345
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,811
You want me?

346
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,941
Squabbles has to be by my side
every step of the way.

347
00:23:18,024 --> 00:23:20,234
[breathing heavily]
Only way I fight.

348
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:24,989
Can't believe you fell for
the club in the gut again. [chuckling]

349
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:29,118
[rap music playing]

350
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:32,746
[Squabbles] You know,
strategy's name of the game,

351
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,790
you want to whip some serious ass.

352
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,087
Stay on your center line.

353
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:44,467
Head, chin, chest, stomach,
and if you have to,

354
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,260
get at them nuts.

355
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:48,346
Stay inside your man's shoulders.

356
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,475
You used to box?

357
00:23:53,101 --> 00:23:56,062
I used to live on 42nd Street
back in the day.

358
00:23:56,145 --> 00:24:00,149
[chuckling]
Uh, <i>Five Deadly Venoms,</i>

359
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:01,985
<i>Clan of the White Lotus,</i>

360
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:04,237
<i>Five Fingers of Death.</i>

361
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:07,740
You think you can fight
because you watch kung fu flicks?

362
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:12,495
I know I can fight because
I owned that corner back when I sold dope.

363
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:15,373
And any asshole who tried to take
anything from me

364
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:19,710
learned up close how I became
Golden Glove champ for seven years.

365
00:24:21,004 --> 00:24:24,257
Watched kung fu flicks
when I wasn't on the corner.

366
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,259
What was your favorite movie?

367
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:29,512
Jet Li.

368
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:33,682
Uh, the remake of <i>Chinese Connection,</i>
<i>Fist of Legend.</i>

369
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:35,851
Better than the original.

370
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,687
You'd choose Jet over Bruce?

371
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:43,317
Nah... you can't oversee my training.

372
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:47,321
I can have an opinion.

373
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:51,075
It's like assholes.
Everyone's got one.

374
00:24:58,249 --> 00:24:59,917
[Comanche]
You know how this goes?

375
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:04,213
You win, you get whatever
you want up in this joint.

376
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:07,258
Booze, bitches, extra rations,
shit like that.

377
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,842
I don't want none of that.

378
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,680
What kind of nigga are you?

379
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:15,683
The kind that doesn't like
being called a nigga.

380
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:17,226
[Comanche chuckling]

381
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,648
[blows landing]

382
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:24,983
[inmate] That's it, right there.

383
00:25:25,818 --> 00:25:28,821
-[inmates grunting]
-Yeah, break him up, break him up.

384
00:25:31,282 --> 00:25:32,491
What you got?

385
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:37,121
[grunting]

386
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:38,872
Work it.

387
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:43,294
-You got him now. Lay him up.
-Sending the fights out?

388
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:46,004
-[grunting]
-Yeah!

389
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:47,673
Welcome to the Internet.

390
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:49,133
[inmate] That's how you finish!

391
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,594
Oh, yeah, he ain't gettin' up.

392
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:57,308
Smart move with the hair.
Nothin' to grab.

393
00:25:58,476 --> 00:26:01,104
I'm still mad at you
for picking Jet Li over Bruce Lee.

394
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,565
Well, take it out on these bastards then.

395
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:07,193
[chuckles softly]

396
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:17,370
[grunting]

397
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:22,416
Keep him off of you.
That's it, right there.

398
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,004
Yeah, there you go.

399
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:36,430
[Connie screaming]

400
00:26:41,352 --> 00:26:42,478
How's your leg?

401
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,481
Uh, probably broken.

402
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,067
How are you doing this?

403
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,702
[inaudible]

404
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:04,124
[grunts]

405
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:17,095
[bones cracking]

406
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:21,684
[bone crunching]

407
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:24,728
[yells]

408
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,865
[grunting]

409
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,125
-Get better next time. [chuckles]
-Yeah, yeah.

410
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,464
[Squabbles] See something.
You're changing.

411
00:27:52,715 --> 00:27:55,218
You're not really taking care of yourself.

412
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:58,053
[Luke] Why?

413
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,097
[Squabbles]
When's the last time you showered?

414
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,849
Or cut your hair?

415
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:08,146
Just seems like you're spiraling downward.

416
00:28:08,231 --> 00:28:11,317
What I'm doing
ain't got no questions or answers.

417
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,112
Are you losing your way?

418
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,117
When I figure out a way
to cut all this shit loose

419
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,786
and get us out
from under Rackham, I will.

420
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,037
All right.

421
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:26,582
Widen your stance.

422
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:30,336
And stay on your line like I told you,
and your chin down.

423
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,005
[suspenseful music playing on TV]

424
00:28:51,524 --> 00:28:53,526
God, Carl.
What happened to you?

425
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,199
-Were you attacked?
-I got into a fight or two.

426
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,371
You haven't been to group in months.

427
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,540
Things changed.

428
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:12,085
So you reverted to your non-verbal self.

429
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:17,174
Who's the white dude?

430
00:29:20,428 --> 00:29:22,721
The prison doctor, Dr. Burstein.

431
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:26,392
Do you need to talk to me
about anything?

432
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:29,937
Reva, when it comes to me,
there's nothing to talk about.

433
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,022
-Squabbles--
-Ain't got shit to say about me.

434
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:36,402
No, he hasn't said a word about you
no matter how many times I begged him to.

435
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:40,781
But I could tell by his silence
that you were in a very bad place.

436
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:41,949
Begging?

437
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:44,952
I thought I had broken through, Carl.

438
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:47,288
We had broken through, but you...

439
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:50,333
Now you just seem broken.

440
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,461
It's not what you think.

441
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:58,299
It ain't all about me.

442
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:02,886
Sometimes...

443
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:07,350
survival costs.

444
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:20,529
[Shades speaking indistinctly]

445
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,996
[Rackham] Aw, y'all are breaking my heart.

446
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,457
-Hey, hey, hey!
-It's okay.

447
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,753
Remember, you push,
I push back harder.

448
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,505
Keeps order, Carl.

449
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:41,842
Not smart.

450
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,763
Made me realize
there's two folks in here you care for.

451
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:49,141
[chuckling]

452
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:02,530
[Scarfe] Plates are blurred.
Closer traffic cam got knocked out.

453
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:05,323
Damn SUV passed right under it.

454
00:31:05,408 --> 00:31:07,618
That's not enough to go after Cottonmouth.

455
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:09,662
How about the bomb squad?

456
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:11,914
Get 'em down to Genghis Connie's
after everything's secure?

457
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:13,040
[cell phone ringing]

458
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,250
Detective Knight.

459
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,212
[Scarfe] What?

460
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,924
It's that firefighter.
Something's happening.

461
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,509
Okay, thanks.

462
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:24,927
Go, I got this.

463
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,019
Hey, give me hard copies
of those videos, huh?

464
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:45,280
Yo, Zip. [sighing]
It's me, Detective Scarfe.

465
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,576
I need to talk to Cottonmouth.

466
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,687
I got to ask you a question...
and I need an honest answer.

467
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:21,817
You tied to anybody in here?
In a relationship?

468
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:24,111
Related to anybody?

469
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,988
I work with Dr. Burstein,

470
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:29,282
but that's to do psych-evals
for the patients he works with.

471
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,868
He's not in the infirmary.

472
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:33,704
What does he do other than creep around?

473
00:32:34,747 --> 00:32:36,414
He's a legitimate doctor.

474
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:38,876
Carl, you can trust me.

475
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,377
[breathing heavily]

476
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:44,256
The guards established a fight ring and
the convicts fight until they're broken.

477
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,051
What happens to them after that,
I don't know.

478
00:32:49,512 --> 00:32:52,848
That's why my face
looks the way it does.

479
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:57,269
And I may have dragged you
into this bullshit unintentionally.

480
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:58,937
-Me?
-Yeah.

481
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:00,773
Rackham's a smart dude.

482
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,441
He knows I like coming here.

483
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:06,236
Seeing you.

484
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:09,907
He's going after the people I care about.

485
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:14,703
Which is why
I need you to stop coming here.

486
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:16,705
Leave this place and don't look back.

487
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:20,083
-I'll inform the warden.
-You can't tell anybody shit, Reva.

488
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:23,712
This setup ain't happened
without the warden being in on it.

489
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:25,380
You can't trust anybody.

490
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:28,175
I have worked here for years.
I have to do something.

491
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:30,052
Leave.

492
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:32,179
Before this place turns you to salt.

493
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,024
Contact my lawyer.
Tell him I'm ready to talk.

494
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,943
I'll use him to get me
out of this hellhole,

495
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:48,028
and then I'll take Rackham down myself.

496
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:51,031
-How long have you been fighting?
-Long enough.

497
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:56,244
-You didn't know anything about this?
-God... no!

498
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:03,669
Whenever, wherever...
you find me.

499
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:09,007
Carl.

500
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:13,136
Why did you come tell me this?

501
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:18,100
Because you give me hope.

502
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:27,192
[Squabbles] If you'd have told me sooner,

503
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:29,778
we probably could've done
something about it,

504
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,572
like take out Rackham.

505
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,658
Someone would take his place.

506
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:36,577
The hell you gonna do about it?

507
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:40,914
Stop fighting.

508
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:43,834
He not gonna let you just
walk away from the fight game.

509
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,293
I know.

510
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,838
I got a plan, though.

511
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:51,341
I'm gonna build
evidence against Rackham...

512
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:53,969
then shut his shit down.

513
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:55,303
[Squabbles sighing]

514
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,062
[exhaling sharply]

515
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:14,406
Hey, you look a little shook, Squabbles.

516
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:17,826
What was Lucas talking about?

517
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:25,083
[razor whirring]

518
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:02,663
What's up, Carl Lucas?

519
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:09,670
Yo... you've been owning
those cats in the ring.

520
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:11,797
It's either that or get owned.

521
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:19,096
You know one thing I don't believe in?

522
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,514
Coincidences.

523
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:23,475
What you want?

524
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,228
[Comanche] I hear you tryin'
to get outta the fight game?

525
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:28,188
Who told you that?

526
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:29,564
Your girlfriend.

527
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,110
[Shades]
Squabbles didn't give you up easy.

528
00:36:35,738 --> 00:36:38,490
-He alive?
-Ain't the question.

529
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:40,450
You're right.

530
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:44,204
Remember what happened
the last time I faced off with you two?

531
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:45,914
[Comanche] Last time was a test.

532
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:49,042
Rackham says you don't change your mind...

533
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:51,544
we give you time
in the infirmary to think about it.

534
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,797
[Shades] See, I'm of the mind
that we stomp your ass.

535
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,091
And find a new dude
to fight for Rackham.

536
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:00,888
Especially since you trying to expose
some shit that's going on at Seagate.

537
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:02,597
[chuckling]

538
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,559
[sighing]

539
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:10,647
I guess I can't trust
nobody around here, can I?

540
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:13,525
[grunting]

541
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:51,021
[EKG beeping]

542
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:05,202
[Burstein] He was attacked.

543
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:07,830
He's got internal damage.
He won't survive a transfer.

544
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:10,748
[softly] Oh, Carl.

545
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:13,626
[sighing]

546
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,087
I trusted you.

547
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,090
[stuttering] It wasn't me.
They beat it out of Squabbles.

548
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,967
They killed him.

549
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,094
[breathing heavily]

550
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,472
[shushing]

551
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:27,099
[crying]

552
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,730
You have to try to save him.

553
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:35,565
I've never had a patient
start off in this kind of shape.

554
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,525
-He's damaged goods.
-Do it for me.

555
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,278
-His chances of survival--
-Do it for me.

556
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:42,614
[sighs]

557
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:48,161
Take the ferry home.

558
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:51,664
You don't have to be here for this.

559
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:52,875
Go.

560
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:09,057
Yeah, you're probably gonna die.

561
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:11,894
But you're already dying.

562
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:18,275
What you're about to see is different
from anything you've ever experienced.

563
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:35,583
[machine beeps]

564
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:45,468
[air hissing]

565
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:52,767
[machine whirring]

566
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:13,788
-Where's Lucas?
-Albert, this isn't the time.

567
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,002
Why you trying to save him?

568
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,463
Albert, quit overreacting.

569
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:23,840
He probably won't survive anyway.

570
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:28,303
You son of a bitch!
You think you're gonna rat me out?

571
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:30,347
You're gonna die tonight, Carl.

572
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,307
Albert, please!

573
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:38,230
We had a good system.

574
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:42,859
I made money...
and you got to live.

575
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:47,239
Now I need to watch you burn.

576
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:49,950
-You can't do this.
-Yeah, you gonna stop me?

577
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,826
[machine whirring and hissing]

578
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:54,329
[rapid beeping]

579
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:55,913
[alarm blaring]

580
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:05,632
[screaming]

581
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:13,056
[screaming]

582
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:22,024
-[machine exploding]
-[glass shattering]

583
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:43,503
[Luke grunting and straining]

584
00:41:57,767 --> 00:41:59,811
[breathing deeply]

585
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:14,076
[clattering]

586
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:26,671
We're gonna get out of here.

587
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,673
I'm gonna need you to crawl into there.

588
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,844
When and if we get out of here,

589
00:42:32,927 --> 00:42:35,263
you're going to have to explain
how you got this way.

590
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:37,932
[Connie grunting]

591
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:41,894
[rubble crumbling]

592
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:49,277
[coughing]

593
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:14,636
[alarm blaring]

594
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:17,430
[exhales sharply]

595
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:22,810
[screaming]

596
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:33,446
Sweet Christmas.

597
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:38,701
[screaming]

598
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:43,206
-[Misty] What's going on?
-[thudding]

599
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:48,628
-Back up, newsboy!
-[Misty] Hey, let him through.

600
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:51,088
Shine your light down here.

601
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,301
[thudding continues]

602
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:59,013
Damn sure don't know what that is.

603
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:12,652
-[whistle blowing]
-[yells]

604
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:16,281
What the hell?

605
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:18,158
[whistle blowing]

606
00:44:22,954 --> 00:44:24,414
[Luke grunting]

607
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:30,920
-[firefighter] Can you move?
-I'll be damned.

608
00:44:31,963 --> 00:44:34,799
I can, but I'm gonna need some help.

609
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:36,884
Connie's leg is broken.

610
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:38,845
[Connie] I can't believe you did this.

611
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,015
[whispering] Which is why
I think you should keep

612
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:45,268
what happened down here between us.

613
00:44:57,989 --> 00:44:59,282
[sighing]

614
00:45:10,001 --> 00:45:12,295
You look like a damn fool.

615
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:18,092
[line ringing]

616
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:20,052
[woman] <i>Operator.</i>
<i>How can I direct your call?</i>

617
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:23,014
I'd like to place a collect call
to Dr. Reva Connors.

618
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:10,728
[chuckling]

619
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:43,970
[sighs]

620
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:47,640
I still can't believe
I punched through that wall.

621
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:52,144
No one's survived
Seagate's waters either.

622
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:57,316
Did Burstein know
that I would get these...

623
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,318
These abilities?

624
00:46:59,402 --> 00:47:02,905
The bath was only supposed
to heal you at a faster rate.

625
00:47:08,202 --> 00:47:11,456
I can't do anything
that'll let people know who or what I am.

626
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:16,919
Hell, I don't even know
how I would explain it.

627
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:26,303
Reva.

628
00:47:28,222 --> 00:47:30,558
When we asked you
about the experiments...

629
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:33,603
you said they weren't true.

630
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:37,982
Carl, I...

631
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,193
I promise I'll explain it all.

632
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:44,363
I'll tell you everything.

633
00:47:45,865 --> 00:47:47,700
How'd you get your hands
on all my info?

634
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:49,952
You haven't always been a convict.

635
00:47:50,036 --> 00:47:52,580
I haven't always been a psychologist.

636
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:58,878
[sighs]

637
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:08,763
Thank you for saving my life.

638
00:48:11,057 --> 00:48:12,850
Thank you for changing mine.

639
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:31,494
You're gonna need a new name.

640
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:34,997
Any ideas?

641
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:40,086
[inhaling deeply]
My father's a preacher.

642
00:48:44,215 --> 00:48:46,759
He used to say, one way or the other...

643
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,304
I would regret the life that I led.

644
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:55,101
He used to say...

645
00:48:56,268 --> 00:48:59,564
"The Spirit of the Lord is on me...

646
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:04,777
because I have been anointed
to preach good news to the poor.

647
00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:11,701
He has sent me to proclaim
freedom for the prisoners,

648
00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:14,245
and recovery of sight for the blind...

649
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:17,582
to release the oppressed."

650
00:49:19,876 --> 00:49:21,335
What is that?

651
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,509
Luke 4:18.

652
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:33,765
He used to tell me that...

653
00:49:33,848 --> 00:49:37,143
no one can cage a man
if he truly wants to be free.

654
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:42,064
So Luke... Freeman?

655
00:49:42,148 --> 00:49:43,482
Nah.

656
00:49:44,483 --> 00:49:45,777
That's a bit on the nose.

657
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,236
[both chuckling]

658
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:54,243
[indistinct radio chatter]

659
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:09,551
-How you doing?
-[inhales deeply]

660
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:11,636
I'll survive.

661
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:14,722
[chuckles] That's the understatement
of the year.

662
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,811
Look, we need to, uh,
talk about what happened.

663
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,188
Not now.

664
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,902
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

665
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:31,739
I've been hearing some pretty miraculous
things about you surviving that explosion.

666
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:33,240
You saved the owner's life.

667
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:35,367
Why don't you just tell us your name?

668
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:47,338
My name is Luke Cage.
