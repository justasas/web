<i>The Cage of Love</i>

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,950
<i> Episode 5 </i>

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,880
I want to tell you,

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,300
regardless if whether you are a heiress or a poor man's daughter,

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,850
I will always be with you.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,770
My heart will always be with you.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,980
Thus, I will only leave if you leave. If you stay, I will stay too.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,460
Cai Hong.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,290
Why are you here?

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,890
Why are you two together at night

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,490
meeting in this room together?

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,580
Spread out. Don't be close together.

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,780
Mrs. Wu, I'm sorry. It was thoughtless of me.

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,950
Since it is late, I will leave.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,640
Go. Go. Go.

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,070
Do you feel better?

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,570
Cai Hong, listen to me.

18
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,890
From now on, don't be so close
to Zhou Shao Tian.

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,610
Our family was rich,

20
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,650
your father let him chase you,

21
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,840
that was because he was nice
and could help us.

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,680
He could even be our son-in-law but it's different now.

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,150
Look at him, he doesn't have money or power.

24
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,290
You'd better not get so close to him.

25
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,280
I see people distancing themselves from me.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,900
In the past, there were lots men who wanted to the Wu family's son-in-law.

27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:49,030
But now, only Brother Shao Tian treats me the same as in the past.

28
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:56,940
Aunt. Brother Shao Tian is my most trusted friend.

29
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,740
You are really silly.

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,600
How can a man and a woman

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,560
be friends?

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,470
I don't believe it, he must want something from you.

33
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,800
Would he really treat you so well unconditionally?

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,860
You should marry a rich guy as you
are young and beautiful now.

35
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,600
Your head and face. <i>(are beautiful)</i> Well surprise your aunt

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,880
and make the second half of your life better.

37
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,340
Am I right?

38
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,900
What has it got to do with money? Marriage is for life.

39
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,300
Yup.

40
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,270
What you said is true.

41
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,480
It may not be necessarily good if one is rich

42
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,480
but it's definitely not good to be without any money.

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,400
Do you know? Think about it.

44
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:14,340
What we talked about it to you previously, I wonder what are your views.

45
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,050
I'm very sorry. I'm afraid that I have to reject your kind gesture.

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,230
Are you not happy with my bringing up the topic of revenge for you?

47
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,420
If so, I can...

48
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,670
No, it's not about money.

49
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,080
Maybe Master Zhou is still reluctant to express his feelings towards the person he loves.

50
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,950
If this is the case, I will offer a leeway for you,

51
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,940
otherwise I would feel sorry for you.

52
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,870
But I cannot bear Master Zhou' talents wasted.

53
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,870
What should I do?

54
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,410
Or let's do it in this way.

55
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,810
I will keep the position for you.

56
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,690
You are welcome to join us any time.

57
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,010
Thank you, Miss Lu, for thinking so highly of me.

58
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,220
I would like to invite you for a meal another day.

59
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,020
Please show me face.

60
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,990
Of course.

61
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,960
I even invited the Mayor of Huzhou so he could personally talk to Mrs Jiang.

62
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,390
She still refused.

63
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,140
Brother, what can I do? Two days have passed.

64
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,170
Whether Ling Long can deliver the goods or not, it will depend on Mrs Jiang.

65
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,970
Can I try?

66
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,890
You?

67
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,030
My brother can't even do it,
how can you manage it?

68
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,180
I don't think you forgot that

69
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,940
It was Marshall Zhang who fought for orders.

70
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,030
Okay.

71
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,060
I want to see how you can manage it.

72
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,080
If I can persuade Mrs Jiang,

73
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,340
could you let Uncle Fu stay?

74
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,840
If you can really do it,

75
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,150
I won't ask Uncle Fu to compensate but he will need to leave.

76
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,350
It's because he definitely did something wrong.

77
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,750
If it were you, you also wouldn't

78
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,470
retain someone who betrayed you.

79
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,770
But on the contrary, if you can't do it,

80
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,360
not only will I demand that Uncle Fu compensate,

81
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,980
as for you, you should get lost with him too.

82
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,490
Okay.

83
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:11,090
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

84
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,630
Brother. You are really not going to take me along?

85
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,490
If we want to persuade Mrs Jiang, we may take some time.

86
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,960
If the both of us go,

87
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,060
what if something happens to Mom when she is home and she needs someone to take care of her. What are we going to do?

88
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,690
Okay, come back soon.

89
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,220
I get it, don't worry.

90
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,050
Cai Hong, Cai Hong...

91
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,950
-Shao Tian.
-Are you really going with him?

92
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,430
Yes and don't worry about it.

93
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,990
He did not embarrass you, right?

94
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,990
Of course not.

95
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,710
By the way, Brother Shao Tian,

96
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,580
Mrs Jiang is very protective of her flowers. If we were to pluck them,

97
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,950
she definitely won't be happy. Thus, we need to think of a way

98
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,390
to make her heart feel at ease.

99
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,230
Leave this to me. I will think of a way.

100
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,850
Wu Cai Hong.

101
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,030
It is getting dark and you are still flirting.

102
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,910
I am not flirting!

103
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,990
You will find out later.

104
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,860
Be careful.

105
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,430
Let's go!

106
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,960
Sorry, sorry.

107
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,700
I... I... I... didn't

108
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,950
Boatman, hand me a cloth.

109
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,980
Okay, thank you.

110
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,990
I am sorry.

111
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,590
From now on, sit here

112
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,030
and don't move around.

113
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,660
Is anyone here?

114
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,000
Mrs Jiang.

115
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,690
Hello, Mrs Jiang.

116
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,500
Hello, Mrs Jiang.

117
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,150
I am Wu Cai Hong from Ling Long.

118
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,940
I want to talk about something with you.

119
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,670
Mrs Jiang, wait for me.

120
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,020
Mrs Jiang, Mrs Jiang...

121
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,490
Mrs Jiang,

122
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,800
I will be waiting for you here.

123
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,220
I will wait even though you won't come out.

124
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,890
You came out, Mrs Jiang.

125
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,090
-Mrs Jiang, where are you going ?
-I don't want to talk to you, I am going to the bathroom .

126
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,040
Then... I will come with you.

127
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,500
How can you come with me? It's only for one person.

128
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,060
-You...Get your hands off.
-Can you please talk to me?

129
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,070
Okay, I will.
Get your hands off me!

130
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,710
Why are you laughing?

131
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,560
I hate him by his look. Let him go!

132
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,040
Let him go. Otherwise I won't talk to you.

133
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,240
Mrs Jiang, that person

134
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,380
has left.

135
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,680
Don't be so mad.

136
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,990
Did you think about it?

137
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,650
See, we...

138
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,550
Okay, let's just ignore him.

139
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,820
Let's go, Mrs Jiang.

140
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,800
Why didn't he come back?

141
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,690
Are you done?

142
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,530
Yup.

143
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,690
-What?
She has agreed.

144
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,780
-How?
-Hey! I am telling you that my garden is so huge.

145
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,370
Go to the village and find help to pluck the flowers.

146
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:06,110
If not, you won't be able to pluck the roses before it gets dark.

147
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,040
Okay. I got it.

148
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,320
Thank you so much! Mrs Jiang.

149
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,090
Aren't you going to look for people?

150
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,490
Oh yeah.

151
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,850
How did you convince Mrs Jiang?

152
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,050
Mrs Jiang planted the rose garden

153
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,280
for her daughter who, as you saw, passed away.

154
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,720
I promised her that even though she is a hundred years old, I will still help her to look after the rose garden.

155
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,220
Thus, she let me pluck them.

156
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,370
So, this is her weak point.

157
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,330
I'm different from you. What you were looking for was her weak points.

158
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,690
As for me , what I looked for was her needs.

159
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,490
Treat others well and their heart bends.

160
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,610
Thus, she also uses her sincerity to handle me.

161
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,890
Cai Hong!

162
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,810
Brother Shao Tian, over here.

163
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,790
Why is he here?

164
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,140
To help us.

165
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,570
Brother Shao Tian.

166
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,340
-Brother Shao Tian.
-Yes.

167
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,920
This place is not bad.

168
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,690
I knew that you could do it.

169
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,680
Let me explain things to you.

170
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,480
What is this?

171
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,080
Look.

172
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,630
So how? It looks actually like the real rose, right?

173
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,090
Why are you so smart?

174
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:17,250
But it must have cost a fair bit of money to buy this.

175
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,330
You should be repairing the house.

176
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,870
- Didn't you spend it all?
- What about the money?

177
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,980
I will just put on winter clothes.

178
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,170
This place is so hot and you are still wearing autumn clothes?

179
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,580
Cai Hong. With you by my side, everything is warm.

180
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,890
It's so cold.

181
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,120
Come, let me wipe your perspiration.

182
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,600
Cai Hong.

183
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,900
Mrs Jiang.

184
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:51,100
Cai Hong. The boatman just came to tell me that all the boats have already left.

185
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,280
I think you won't be able to leave today.

186
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,710
We won't be able to leave? What should we do then?

187
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,290
You will have to suffer tonight

188
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,980
and spend the night at my home.

189
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,800
Don't say that we will suffer.

190
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,890
- We are troubling you.
- None at all.

191
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,040
But I only have two rooms.

192
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,840
Let's do it like this. I will give you the room of my daughter, Cai Hong.

193
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,530
You both can stay at the guest room.

194
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,030
So how? Let's go and take a look.

195
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,920
I think

196
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,820
you should sleep on the ground.

197
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,730
Who gives you the right? You are not my boss now.

198
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,610
It's because I snore when I'm asleep.

199
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,900
When I'm asleep, I'm dead to the world.

200
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,110
Don't talk about snoring. I can't even feel the earthquake.

201
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,480
Your thinking is too simple and immature.

202
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,000
When I snore, I'm not like just anyone.

203
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,060
I rank higher than anyone else.

204
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,990
Just don't regret it.

205
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,570
This is really interesting.

206
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,990
Is there any regret medicine in this world?

207

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

208
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,870
Mutant.

209
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,980
It's late. Why aren't you asleep yet?

210
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,890
They say that the stars in the sky

211
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,070
are the eyes of our loved ones.

212
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,600
About my parents,

213
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,080
which pair of eyes are theirs?

214
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,140
Are they watching me?

215
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,480
Regardless of which pair of eyes they are,

216
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,930
you must know that they are looking at you from above

217
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,030
and keeping watch over you.

218
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,020
Cai Hong. You are tired from the long day.

219
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,030
Sleep early.

220
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,150
I still want my parents to watch over me for a while longer.

221
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,070
Okay then.

222
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,750
It is not too late.

223
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,060
I will stay and watch the stars with you.

224
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,870
Hey, Zhou guy.

225
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,510
Why aren't you sleeping?

226
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,460
If you are not going to sleep, I will lock the door.

227
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,350
You have finished talking?

228
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,380
It's good tea.

229
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,120
Take your time drinking it.

230
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,910
Mrs Jiang. Thank you for helping Ling Long.

231
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,910
I'm not helping Ling Long. I'm helping Cai Hong.

232
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,020
Thank you. I will visit you often in the future.

233
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,420
Have a safe journey then.

234
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,430
Bye.

235
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,980
You have so many goods. How are you going to sit?

236
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,240
But we are in a hurry to use the goods.

237
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,900
The boat should be able to take the three of us, right?

238
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,560
Could they bend the rules?

239
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,680
Why is there only one boat?

240
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,920
There is only boat here and that's mine.

241
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,870
Who's getting on board?

242
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,100
We are all getting on board.

243
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,940
This boat can only take two passengers now. You have so much goods.

244
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,100
- I can pay you much. How much do you want?

245
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,720
It's not the problem about money. It's too dangerous.

246
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,950
I think the boss should get on board.

247
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,350
Let's do this instead.

248
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,090
Deliver these goods back for me.

249
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,870
These goods are extremely important to Ling Long.

250
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,450
If Ling Long doesn't have these,

251
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,930
and something happens on the way there,

252
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,620
Cai Hong and I will not take responsibility.

253
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,580
- How will you go back then?
- It's getting late.

254
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,730
Cai Hong and I will wait for the next boat. We may need to stay here for the night.

255
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,890
But we are not in a hurry. Boss, please go first.

256
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,670
I was just short of finding

257
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,870
the whereabouts of the large sums of missing money. Then

258
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,710
I will be able to find evidence of the killer then.

259
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,760
What evidence did you find?

260
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,870
I got this from Jiang Yu.

261
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,990
Mister Zhang placed some orders. He gave good feedback.

262
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,380
He was extremely happy.

263
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,030
He also promised to place future orders and

264
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,530
they will come to us.

265
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:22,300
Of course, we were able to overcome our obstacle this time to complete the order.

266
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,190
- This is because of the hard work by the staff.
- Boss Jiang.

267
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,750
Cold water, warm water and water. Which kind would you like to drink?

268
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,770
Warm.

269
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,450
It's not hot enough.

270
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,470
I have prepared it so the water can be mixed.

271
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,670
If the temperature is not enough, there is still the cold water.

272
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,030
Boss Jiang. I already wrote this document.

273
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,270
If you still need more, there are still two copies in the office.

274
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,490
Looks like I should be well prepared too.

275
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,960
Continue.

276
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,050
Brother.

277
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,990
- Brother.
- What's wrong?

278
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,520
Look at this.

279
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,470
This is missing information. The file contained Ling Long information about the liquidation.

280
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,980
But with our research...

281
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,000
I already knew about this. Don't panic.

282
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,710
This is just a duplicate.

283
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,820
Brother. Wu Cai Hong definitely stole it.

284
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,010
I already said that she's here for an ulterior motive.

285
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:48,050
She's only trying to find evidence concerning me about Wu Hong Da's death.

286
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,700
Fei Fei.

287
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,390
I remember that was a big sum of money missing from the previous Ling Long.

288
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,530
Help me to investigate where that money went to.

289
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,030
What has that old accounts got to with us?

290
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,610
Why should we bother about this?

291
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,130
Just investigate when I tell you to do so.

292
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,540
But Cai Hong stole the documents.

293
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,650
Enough. If she do anything wrong, I will punish her.

294
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,370
Forget about it.

295
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,940
<i>Could it be that there is Brother has something to do with Wu Hong Da?</i>

296
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,780
<i>He won't do something like that.</i>

297
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,600
<i>He won't.</i>

298
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,100
Are you trying to help me carry some of this stuff because I'm struggling with it?

299
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,440
You are really thick skinned.

300

301
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,210
Otherwise you will get into more troubles than you'd be able to handle.

302
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,630
I think the one who is looking for trouble is you instead.

303
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,320
Don't think that by pretending to be pitiful,

304
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,600
others will take pity on you.

305
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,940
Your pretense may trick others but you can't trick me.

306
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,770
You don't need to come with me.

307
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,510
This is the second code of a Secretary.

308
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,150
The secretary must be close by.

309
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,510
I already told you that regardless of whether the boss is right or wrong,

310
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,440
you must do what you are told.

311
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,110

- I even said that

313
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,060

354
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:00,100
but also that you will help me in getting the dyeing factory.

355
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:08,050
I know that you are preoccupied with the issues connected to Ling Long.

356
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:13,420
It may be wishful thinking but I am looking forward to this meal and hopefully you having a change of heart.

357
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,090
Everything is difficult following right after a disaster.

358
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,350
I don't have anyone now and I also don't have many skills.

359
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,270
Even if I don't have someone like you to help me,

360
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:28,040
even a cloud can be a secret ingredient

361
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,790
in the Huzhou weaving and dying business. Even the earth has a seat.
(Things out of our control can play a part.)

362
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:39,130
By the way, I heard that Ling Long has a secret recipe.

363
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:43,020
The recipe was provided for royal use. Even you know it too.

364
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,760
I joined Ling Long when I was nineteen years old. I have been with Ling Long for ten years.

365
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,010
I have never heard of any secret recipe.

366
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,930
It could be that the reporters

367
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,540
have spread ridiculous news.

368
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,120
It's okay. Come.

369
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,500
I raise this cup (toast) to you today.

370
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,290
Being able to dine with Miss Lu

371
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,480
who is a beauty,

372
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,830
not everyone would have this honour.

373
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,550
Talking about beauty,

374
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,580
if one has money, one can get anything.

375
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,610
If Mr Zhou were to prosper,

376
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,030
he may get the beauty that has always gotten away.

377
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,420
There are insects there.

378
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,170
Insects!

379
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,440
There are insects.

380
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,540
Open the door.

381
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,370
Open the door.

382
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,900
Because of a Wu Cai Hong, you are suffering at Ling Long. Is this worth it?

383
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,600
Miss Lu. I think you are mistaken.

384
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,780
I, Zhou Shao Tian, don't need to spend 300won to

385
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,950
to drink a cup with Cai Hong.

386
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,920
But women like men who are strong.

387
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,930
Because a strong man can gives security to a woman.

388
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,460
As you know, Jiang Yu was suppressed.

389
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,920
That is not a good thing.

390
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,090
It's only a matter of time before I leave Ling Long.

391
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,990
It's just not now.

392
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:32,880
Then, let's celebrate your early departure.

393
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,500
Madam.

394
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,320
Is Cai Hong here?

395
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,640
You scared me. Why are you here so late in the evening?

396
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,770
You reek of alcohol.

397
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,320
Cai Hong is not back yet.

398
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,670
Where did she go?

399
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,050
For a young and beautiful woman,

400
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,510
it's common for her to dine and chat with her friends after work.

401
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,170
Furthermore, Cai Hong is now working and experiencing life.

402
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,270
She knows what kind of friends are good for her.

403
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,440
Brother Shao Tian. It's late. Are you here to look for sister?

404
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,310
She is not back yet.

405
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,370
Brother Shao Tian.

406
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,880
Again and again, I keep telling him.

407
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,530
- Mom.
- He scared me just now.

408
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,910
Two little tigers, two little tigers.

409
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:05,020
Ran so fast. Ran so fast.

410
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,670
One doesn't have a mouth,

411
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,610
one doesn't have ears.

412
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,310
It's really strange.

413
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,060
It's really strange.

414
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,100
Two little tigers.
