[music playing]

00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:26,005
[Jidenna rapping]

00:02:13,302 --> 00:02:14,929
[grunts]

00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:57,930
[man grunts]

00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:07,022
[groans]

7
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:09,775
[man groaning] Bitch!

8
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:08,042
This ain't no social.

9
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:14,131
This is what we call
a State of the Union.

10
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:19,344
Darrell, how we doing after Fort Knox?

11
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:24,308
Break it down and let it be broke.

12
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:26,936
[Darrell] Ain't nothing to let be.

13
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,479
You are broke.

14
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:34,068
Let me rephrase.

15
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:36,111
You got your real estate.

16
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:38,197
Mama Mabel left you the club.

17
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,533
You and Mariah share the deed
on her old brownstone.

18
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,869
I know you got some cash, right?

19
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,292
I got at least... 250 laying around.

20
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,503
[Darrell] Well, Fort Knox
is what hurts, baby.

21
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:57,424
You lost seven figures,
seven times over.

22
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:00,594
All of your cash profits from the corners,
stash houses, drops.

23
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:02,721
You still got stocks,
the club profits, but...

24
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:05,640
But what?

25
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:08,060
The streets is talkin'.

26
00:05:08,143 --> 00:05:11,271
And that dude with the hoodie,
if he's still out there...

27
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:13,565
This nigga too scared to say his name.

28
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:18,070
Koko, this ain't PS 154.
You ain't gotta raise your hand, man.

29
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:19,488
[Koko] I been reading this book.

30
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:22,282
[chuckles] Huh. You readin' now?

31
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:24,618
-[laughing]
-Yeah. It's a... it's a book on politics

32
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:28,038
and the social conditions
that created hip-hop.

33
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:30,540
The Dodgers left Brooklyn,

34
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:32,792
Robert Moses created
the Cross Bronx Expressway,

35
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:35,963
and white folks went
running for the suburbs.

36
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:40,175
This cat named Moynihan went and hollered
at Nixon, and told the prez

37
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,889
that maybe the inner city
could benefit from the benign neglect.

38
00:05:44,972 --> 00:05:46,181
Benign what?

39
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:49,601
It's... it's the benign neglect.

40
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,353
What it means is this:

41
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:55,690
Maybe if we just leave
that Luke Cage cat alone,

42
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:59,403
give him his side of the street,
we take ours.

43
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:03,949
[shouting]

44
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:23,135
Benign neglect.

45
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:24,886
[laughing]

46
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,140
Yeah, okay. [chuckling]

47
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,770
The police sitting on my money.

48
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:36,941
So I'm gonna have to turn up my game.

49
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:40,569
Zip... I want you
and the fellas to hit the streets.

50
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:45,032
Hit every business
from 110 to 155th.

51
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:47,451
If they got a dime,
I want at least a nickel.

52
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:50,204
Bring everything back
by the end of the day.

53
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:54,208
You think you're gonna recoup $7 million,
just like that?

54
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,545
I don't even know why you back here.

55
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,591
Look around.

56
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:07,054
You know damn well
why Diamondback sent me.

57
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,099
Fort Knox?

58
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,604
This makes the junkyard rip...

59
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:19,399
look like Amateur Night at the Apollo.

60
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:25,489
This dishwasher...
thinks he can prove Harlem don't need me.

61
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,827
Let's see how bad
he really wants to wear the crown.

62
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,293
You hit the boulevard
and squeeze 'em hard.

63
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:43,882
And when they start crying,
talking about, "Why? Why?"

64
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:49,429
You tell them to go talk
to Luke Cage down at the barber shop.

65
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:52,224
They're paying
a Luke Cage stupidity tax.

66
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:54,476
[breathing heavily]

67
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,395
[shouting] What are you doing?

68
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:58,981
Time is precious!

69
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:00,399
Move!

70
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:02,942
Zip!

71
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,281
Call Mr. Spurlock.

72
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:15,372
Tell him we gonna need his services.

73
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:32,056
-[both grunting]
-Get off!

74
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:34,016
[grunting]

75
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:46,820
-You got problems with the tax?
-Holler at your man Luke Cage...

76
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:48,822
-Holler at Luke Cage...
-[all] At the barber shop.

77
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,497
[Zip] Payday, Aisha.

78
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,291
We ain't got it this month, Zip.

79
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:00,375
[Zip chuckles]

80
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:02,669
Back off.

81
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:05,089
-[scoffs] Give me that.
-[both straining]

82
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,632
-[Aisha screams]
-[laughing]

83
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:09,259
What the hell are you doing, Zip?

84
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:10,635
[Aisha yelling]

85
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:17,142
Ooh.

86
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:20,562
Didn't your old man
come up on the Mets?

87
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:21,771
He got cut.

88
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:23,773
He played for the championship
New York Nines team.

89
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:26,568
That's a Nine's ring?

90
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:27,986
Zip, please.

91
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:30,655
That's my father's!

92
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:34,118
[Zip chuckling]

93
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:36,953
[Zip] Aw! Don't cry.

94
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:38,788
[chuckling] You mad?

95
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:41,250
Holler at Luke Cage.

96
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,460
He'll tell you why we doin' this.

97
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:54,263
-A tailor?
-That ain't no tailor.

98
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:56,806
That's Dapper Dan himself.

99
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,725
Dapper Dan?

100
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,144
[chuckles]

101
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:02,937
Said you needed a suit,
that's why I had you come here.

102
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:05,940
And I figure...

103
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:08,235
Pop would want you to come
to his memorial correct,

104
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:11,488
so I used a little bit of money
to have my man Dap do you right.

105
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:13,865
[chuckling]

106
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,937
[Dapper Dan] Saw you on TV
the other night. Buried alive.

107
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,606
Now that's what I call style.

108
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,152
-[Luke] Lucky.
-You ain't lucky. You blessed.

109
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,826
Hey. What was Mike Tyson like?

110
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:00,454
[Fish chuckling] Oh, I know
you're sick of telling that story.

111
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:02,331
He whooped Mitch Green's behind,
didn't he?

112
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:05,459
[scoffs] Mike Tyson
is a real nice guy, man.

113
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,085
But he hit like a beast.

114
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:09,713
Yeah, well there was beauty in that beast.

115
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:14,259
You can't control what people say.
Just be the best man that you can be.

116
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:17,637
And always make sure
they spell your name right.

117
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:21,766
[Luke] Now, that's a dapper approach, man.

118
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,394
-Thanks, man.
-Appreciate it.

119
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:29,733
Let's see here.

120
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:32,444
[both chuckling]

121
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,279
That ain't no smock.

122
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,492
-You ready for later?
-All good.

123
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:40,994
Messages stacked up at the door.

124
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:44,456
Like everybody in Harlem
looking for you after that building thing.

125
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:47,459
I'm strictly about Pop's memorial today.

126
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:50,003
[sighing]
Seating everyone at this thing

127
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:52,171
is gonna be the toughest move
I've mastered

128
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:54,466
since the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit.

129
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:56,175
[sighing] I mean...

130
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:00,096
I gotta put Estelle up front,
'cause she's been with him the longest,

131
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,516
at least as far as the neighborhood knows.

132
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,145
Keep her far away as hell from Charlene.

133
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:12,442
She's real sly. Moves like a bishop
on the diagonal at all times.

134
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:15,153
Now, they both
have to steer clear of Candy,

135
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,822
who they both think is his cousin.
[chuckles]

136
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:19,574
Candy?

137
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:22,536
She rubs everyone the wrong way but Pop.

138
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:26,456
Who she rubs the right way,
every Tuesday and Thursday at 9:45.

139
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,999
[chuckling]

140
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,670
Looks like Shaft ain't had nothing
on Henry Hunter.

141
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:33,588
-Pop was a mack.
-[scoffing]

142
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:35,799
If that's what you wanna call it.

143
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:41,012
He would want you to have
his apartment upstairs.

144
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:44,308
Uh, especially since your crib blew up.

145
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:55,319
I'll earn my keep somehow.

146
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:57,278
Goddamn right you will.

147
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:01,115
We fix this place up,
the doors gotta reopen.

148
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:05,203
-Talk for another day.
-Cool.

149
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,791
-Luke Cage here yet?
-Whoa, slow down, Aisha.

150
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:11,335
-What's wrong?
-[Luke] I'm Luke.

151
00:13:11,418 --> 00:13:14,629
What you got to do with all this shit
happening up and down Lenox Avenue?

152
00:13:14,713 --> 00:13:16,005
What are you talking about?

153
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:17,841
Zip snatched my daddy's championship ring

154
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:20,552
and hit about 20 other spots
all over uptown.

155
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:22,471
-Why?
-I don't care why.

156
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:24,180
You need to get my daddy's ring back.

157
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,766
You remember what he was like
before he got strung out?

158
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,602
Eddie's a good dude deep down.

159
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:31,980
To me, what's left of him is that ring.

160
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:35,567
The only reason why he didn't pawn it is
because I took it away from him.

161
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,152
Somebody's gotta protect his legacy.

162
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:40,655
-Even if he won't.
-[sighing]

163
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:43,282
Let me get into this.
See what the hell's going on.

164
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:45,994
Get into it?
You need to check these dudes!

165
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:47,954
Everybody heard about
what you did in the projects.

166
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:50,999
Don't be a punk and just stand by.

167
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,386
Different kind of chess gambit.

168
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:07,265
Cottonmouth figures if he can't drop you,
he'll get Harlem to push you out.

169
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:08,850
Where you going?

170
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:11,520
To make sure Cottonmouth
spells my name right.

171
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,691
They smashed all my displays!

172
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:18,693
Yo, they took my Les Paul.
That's my life.

173
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:19,861
Jacked me for my tips!

174
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:22,238
-I'm on it!
-[woman] I work hard for that money.

175
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:23,573
I'm on it!

176
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:33,667
[Soledad] Hey, you're late.

177
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,960
What? I got robbed.

178
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:38,380
Some guy stole my bag.
I had to whoop his ass.

179
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:41,508
What were you thinking?

180
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:43,802
I was thinking that I wanted my bag back.

181
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:45,595
-He could have killed you.
-[tsks]

182
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,681
<i>Mami,</i> please. I grew up here.

183
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:50,892
If you don't fight back,
they make you into a doormat.

184
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:54,396
You know who taught me that? You.

185
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:57,148
Things have changed up here, <i>mija.</i>

186
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,942
Things have changed everywhere.

187
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:01,403
Is...

188
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:03,655
Is why you came back home?

189
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:07,366
I wanted to come back
where things made sense, yeah.

190
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:12,914
What the-- [groans]

191
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,416
[grunts]

192
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:16,543
-Where is he?
-Who?

193
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:18,002
Les Paul.

194
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:32,434
-Those two?
-Yeah.

195
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:35,228
-Let's go talk to them.
-Don't you need a gun?

196
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:36,563
I am the gun.

197
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,774
Yo, Plug One, Plug Two.

198
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:41,568
What is this?
Your boyfriend?

199
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:42,902
You want some of this? [grunting]

200
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,906
[woman scoffs]

201
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:49,951
You know my name?

202
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:51,578
That's Luke Cage, asshole.

203
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:55,081
The next time you say my name...
I'm coming for you.

204
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:57,375
Now, when you wake up,

205
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:59,919
I want you to tell everybody
that you've been screwing with

206
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:03,465
that they got nothing to fear
from Cottonmouth, you understand?

207
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:04,966
Wake up? [grunts]

208
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,192
[man groaning]

209
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:27,739
I can't believe that bitch shot me.

210
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:30,158
Got a name on that "bitch" who shot you?

211
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,537
I ain't say I got shot.

212
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,288
No snitching, huh?

213
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,710
You remember me from Genghis Connie's?

214
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:43,212
Oh, shit.

215
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,090
What happened?
Who shot you?

216
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:48,510
I'm going back to Raleigh.

217
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:50,178
I've had enough of this shit.

218
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:51,555
[groans]

219
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,850
You ain't moving fast enough.

220
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:57,894
Aisha ain't like the others.

221
00:16:57,977 --> 00:17:00,313
She wants that ring back.

222
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:01,856
You gotta understand.

223
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,360
When her father was sick,
she came up in the streets all by herself.

224
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:08,697
She's tougher than she looks.

225
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,073
Aisha shot that dude?

226
00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:14,619
He was with Zip. He laughed at her,
and talked trash about the ring.

227
00:17:14,703 --> 00:17:16,412
Where'd she get the gun?

228
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:19,708
Yo, I plead the eighth.

229
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,710
You mean the fifth.

230
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:24,337
Yeah, that shit.
I plead the fifth.

231
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:28,216
Where is she?

232
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:30,844
Check the shop on St. Nick.

233
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:33,597
If she ain't there,
your guess is as good as mine.

234
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,936
Don't you get tired of hanging out
near crime scenes?

235
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:42,939
Who's this?

236
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:48,194
Is this is what you were
looking for this morning?

237
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,781
Uh-uh. It's evidence.
Part of my investigation.

238
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:53,617
-That's my property.
-Too bad.

239
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,744
Is she the reason rockets
keep getting dropped on your head?

240
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:59,330
A good cop would ask the person
doing the shooting that question.

241
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,415
Oh, yeah, wise guy?
Well, how about this?

242
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:03,376
What's going on
between you and Cottonmouth?

243
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,797
He didn't like the way
I was washing dishes and he fired me.

244
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:10,466
Chaos rolls off you like water off a duck.

245
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:12,385
But it's gotta stop.

246
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:13,887
Innocent people are getting hurt.

247
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,931
Either be a part of the solution
or leave.

248
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:19,433
I will. I'll leave.

249
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:21,435
But first, I gotta do right by Pop.

250
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:26,650
[Misty] Hey!

251
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:30,236
-You going to Pop's memorial?
-Yeah.

252
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,613
Don't.

253
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:42,331
[Shades] You need to let this go.

254
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,626
No.

255
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,295
It makes you look weak.

256
00:18:48,922 --> 00:18:50,632
I can't ignore him.

257
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,052
You can't let this dude drive you stupid.

258
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:58,222
It only helps his name ring out...
like yours used to.

259
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:02,018
[sighing] All right...

260
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:06,314
Mr. Gangster Consultant.

261
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:07,899
Take your shot.

262
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:10,401
-What would you do?
-Sell this club.

263
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:13,529
You can net three mil, easy,
on the real estate alone.

264
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:15,114
Not happening.

265
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:19,243
No one black has ever
done anything like this.

266
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:23,081
Percy Sutton came close,
but that was years ago.

267
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:28,419
Harlem's Paradise is special.

268
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,631
And it's not going nowhere.

269
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,261
If you don't make the right moves now...

270
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,013
you are done.

271
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,187
This place is my reputation.

272
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,109
My blood.

273
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:54,821
My legacy.

274
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:04,873
[scoffs]

275
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,667
He's here.

276
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,688
You guys? Again?

277
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:36,320
[Stokes] There he is.

278
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,366
Dishwasher Lazarus.

279
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:43,036
You want your old job back?

280
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,958
Costs to be a savior.
Ask Jesus.

281
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:52,545
You started all this.
This is me finishing it.

282
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:55,381
You want Harlem?
It's expensive.

283
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:59,761
I don't want Harlem.
I just want you to stop messing with it.

284
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:02,596
This is my home.

285
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,850
You don't know a damn thing about it.

286
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,981

[grunting]

291
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,333
Carl Lucas?

292
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,377
[Stokes] Whoa! Whoa!

293
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:40,343
It's called deductive reasoning.

294
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:45,598
If a rocket launcher couldn't stop me...
what's that little peashooter gonna do?

295
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,517
You wanna go to war?

296
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:51,062
Hmm?

297
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,274
I'll take you to war.

298
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:57,401
You don't have enough people.

299
00:21:58,111 --> 00:21:59,570
This mob's not deep enough.

300
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,240
Ask your man, Shades.

301
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:04,033
You're supposed to be dead.

302
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:06,744
You can't kill me.

303
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:10,498
Keep my name out your mouth.

304
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:15,336
Or what?

305
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,339
[inhales deeply]

306
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:32,228
You know this son of a bitch?

307
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:34,813
It's a long story.

308
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:37,066
I'll make time.

309
00:22:48,286 --> 00:22:49,620
-Don't do that.
-What?

310
00:22:50,413 --> 00:22:51,872
Worried I'm gonna spill it?

311
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:54,875
<i>Mami,</i> you're so superstitious.

312
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:57,253
And you're not?

313
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,759
There's more to this than superstition.

314
00:23:08,431 --> 00:23:10,724
That's a kind of yes/no thing.

315
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:16,105
There's a middle ground.

316
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,400
Unexplainable.

317
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,282
The hospital was attacked by men in masks.

318
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:31,704
And the one I took down had a scar...
like from an autopsy.

319
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:36,167
Like he had died
and come back to life once before.

320
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,212
And his friends
broke in and killed Louisa.

321
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,839
The hospital wants to cover it up.

322
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:45,969
They're saying that
a junkie stabbed Louisa.

323
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,014
I was gonna go to the cops,
so they gave me a choice.

324
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,684
Actually, it wasn't a choice at all.

325
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,355
I'm glad you came home.

326
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,816
I kinda had to.

327
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:04,195
Metro-General pretty much made sure
I can't work anywhere else in New York.

328
00:24:04,988 --> 00:24:06,990
What would make you happy?

329
00:24:09,242 --> 00:24:11,285
I've seen a man...

330
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:13,912
a blind man who can see,

331
00:24:13,997 --> 00:24:16,957
because his other senses
are so amplified.

332
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:22,963
And this other man who survived
a shotgun blast to his head

333
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:26,050
and recovered from a brain hemorrhage
in a few hours.

334
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:28,344
And they both needed my help.

335
00:24:29,345 --> 00:24:31,305
I think that's what I want to do.

336
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:34,975
Is help people...

337
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,811
with abilities.

338
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:46,112
You know what
your <i>abuela</i> said about these things?

339
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:52,076
Well, you know I don't believe
in that Santeria mumbo jumbo.

340
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:57,415
She was a <i>curandera,</i> not a priestess.

341
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:02,628
The world isn't the world anymore, <i>mija.</i>

342
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:07,133
Aliens coming out of the sky.

343
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:10,094
-People with silver hammers.
-[Claire sighs]

344
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:12,388
Green monsters.

345
00:25:14,432 --> 00:25:18,686
All I know is...
everything happens for a reason.

346
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:24,358
And now, somehow...
you're a part of it.

347
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:28,779
What do you call that?

348
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,407
[sighing] The worst luck in the world.

349
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,536
It's called fate.

350
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:43,336
[men grunting and gun firing
on television]

351
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:45,921
That's Carl Lucas.

352
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:50,426
I did time with him at Seagate Prison
when I first got there.

353
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:54,930
Rackham, captain of the guards,
he had us work him over real good.

354
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,516
There's no way
he could've survived in one piece.

355
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:03,106
This nigga's half Houdini, half Ali.

356
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,691
There's a bullet for everyone.

357
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,444
Diamondback taught me that.

358
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:10,988
Say what?

359
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:12,990
I got something to show you.

360
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:18,121
[man speaking Polish]

361
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:21,582
Russian?

362
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:23,334
Ukrainian, I think.

363
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,002
Eastern European connection.

364
00:26:28,631 --> 00:26:30,424
[Stokes] Kevlar?

365
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:32,593
[Shades]
Must have a South American hookup.

366
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:35,012
It's heavy duty.
Military grade.

367
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,182
[speaking Polish]

368
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,023
[gunshot]

369
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,733
[man groaning]

370
00:26:49,152 --> 00:26:50,611
This ain't shit.

371
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:51,862
-Wait for it.
-[whirring]

372
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,864
-Wait for it.
-[muffled explosion]

373
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:59,077
[exclaiming]

374
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:01,539
That is the illest shit
I've ever seen in my life!

375
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,749
Are you serious?

376
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,918
Based on a prototype by Hammer.

377
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:09,338
The rounds are a composite,
invisible to metal detectors.

378
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:12,925
And they incinerate forensic evidence,
so they are untraceable.

379
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,887
What kind of metal does that?

380
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:19,807
Nothing from this Earth.

381
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,936
-The incident?
-That's what I hear.

382
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,146
Yo...

383
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,856
if you wanted to kill Jesus...

384
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:30,859
that's the bullet you'd use.

385
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:33,153
That's why they call it the Judas.

386
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:38,075
Hmm... I can think of a few fools
I'd love to baptize with that joint.

387
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:39,827
[laughing]

388
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,247
How do I get 'em?

389
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,624
One of two ways.

390
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,168
You pay for it.

391
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:52,923
Or you ask Diamondback
to handle Carl Lucas for you.

392
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,220
I don't need Diamondback
to handle my problems.

393
00:27:57,303 --> 00:27:58,929
[inhaling sharply]

394
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,681
How much for the damn thing?

395
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:13,986
-Per bullet?
-Mmm-hmm.

396
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:15,529
For real?

397
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:19,325
God damn it.

398
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:22,870
Diamondback can front me.
I'm good for it.

399
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:25,289
He ain't gonna front you a dime.

400
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:27,375
You made too many mistakes.

401
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:29,960
He told you that?

402
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,588
Does he have to?

403
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:35,966
[chuckling]

404
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,843
I'll call him my damn self.

405
00:28:41,472 --> 00:28:43,307
He ain't the same Diamondback.

406
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:49,104
If he does you this favor...
he's taking Harlem from you.

407
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:53,567
I'm just letting you know.

408
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:13,128
I'll get Domingo his guns,
square everything away...

409
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:16,424
so Diamondback can front me the loan.

410
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:20,469
Then I'll kill Cage
so shit can get back to normal.

411
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:24,181
Let me make a few phone calls.

412
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,351
-My man.
-Hmm.

413
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:39,029
Hey, Captain.

414
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:42,533
We need to talk, seriously.

415
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:45,869
What's the problem?

416
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:47,245
Scarfe.

417
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,081
IAB hasn't officially said anything,

418
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:52,460
but someone I trust is telling me
he's under investigation.

419
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:53,669
What?

420
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:58,090
[scoffs] Look, I've been riding
with Scarfe for years.

421
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:00,008
Is he salty? Yeah.

422
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:01,844
But dirty? Never.

423
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:05,723
We have a lot of eyes on us, Misty.
Can't take any chances.

424
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:07,391
What's this based on?

425
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,978
The night of the restaurant explosion
and Crispus Attucks raid,

426
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:13,939
you and your partner logged into
the crime scene 40 minutes apart.

427
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,316
So?

428
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:17,275
In the time that was unaccounted for,

429
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,653
your only source of information
for the barber shop shooting,

430
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:21,238
Chico Diaz, went missing.

431
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:23,031
He was last seen with Scarfe.

432
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:25,868
That's not true.

433
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:29,287
Scarfe left the precinct to pick up Chico,
but Chico was gone.

434
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:34,084
So, he picks up a witness unsupervised,
which is against protocol,

435
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,669
doesn't even log it in,

436
00:30:35,753 --> 00:30:38,922
and he still has time to get
to Genghis Connie's before anyone else.

437
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,298
What, is he clairvoyant?

438
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:41,967
He's not telling you everything.

439
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:44,928
Look, they are wasting their time on this.

440
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:47,180
[Scarfe] Good news.

441
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:50,017
Gyro guy's back.

442
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,270
Got your nasty, mystery meat for you.

443
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:54,855
Veggie for me.

444
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,818
Captain, LT.
Y'all hitting on my partner again?

445
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:02,237
[Perez scoffs] She's fair game
when you ain't around.

446
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,531
[Scarfe chuckles]

447
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:07,660
Let me know when you have something that,
uh, we might be able to use, Detective.

448
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,582
What was that about?

449
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,710
Luke Cage.

450
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:20,297
They think we're losing sight
of Cottonmouth by focusing on him.

451
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:25,052
That's what happens when you start hawking
raffle tickets in your own precinct.

452
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,762
You forget how to do police work.

453
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:30,766
Hey. When I get back from the memorial,

454
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:34,061
you good with going over all the shit
that's gone down since Crispus Attucks?

455
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,772
Sure.
I'll get started while you're gone.

456
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:38,649
Go say goodbye to your friend.

457
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,450
[phone ringing]

458
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,872
Scarfe.

459
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,544
Yeah, got it. [exhaling sharply]

460
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:00,754
Y'all ready, baby? [chuckles]

461
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:02,840
Let's do it.

462
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:05,468
Whoo! Give it to me, baby. [chuckles]

463
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:07,845
Oh! Thank you.

464
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:10,055
[laughing] Whoo!

465
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:12,390
Whoo!

466
00:32:12,475 --> 00:32:13,892
[Zip] That's it, that's it.
[man] Man, take my money.

467
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:16,437
[Zip] The banker, baby,
that's what they call me.

468
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,271
[man 1] Double or nothing.
[man 2] Bettin' six, bettin' six.

469
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:21,274
[conversation continues indistinctly]

470
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,485
Damn.

471
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:25,863
You guys actually take lunch breaks
like real employees, huh?

472
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,659
Any of you guys at Crispus Attucks
the other night?

473
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:32,703
-Uh... uh-uh.
-Nah, man.

474
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,335
[scoffs] Like I need these bitches.

475
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:42,045
[gun cocking]

476
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,551
[bullet ricocheting]

477
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,982
[choking]

478
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:04,652
Aisha's ring.
You got it?

479
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:07,362
[groaning]

480
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:09,615
Think about where you are.

481
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:13,744
It's hallowed ground... this park.

482
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,329
Named for Jackie Robinson.

483
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,707
[grunting]

484
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:23,295
It's here.
It's all around you...

485
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:25,631
if you respect yourself enough
to take a look.

486
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:27,299
At what?

487
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:29,510
Our legacy.

488
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:30,928
[choking]

489
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:37,225
[Zip grunting]

490
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:52,908
[Perez sighs] I don't know
what the hell you've been doing,

491
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:54,326
but IA's onto you,

492
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,620
and they've given the captain a heads-up.

493
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,455
You're being investigated, Scarfe.

494
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,208
Captain was poking around Misty,
seeing what she knows.

495
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:05,212
But... we've got bigger problems than IA.

496
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:10,551
Cottonmouth needs Domingo's guns
from evidence. Now.

497
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:12,928
Goddamn Cottonmouth.

498
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,181
What do you suggest?

499
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,561
It'd be easier just to kill him.

500
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,731
Not really.

501
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:25,899
We don't know if he's got a backup plan.

502
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:28,276
You better have a backup plan
for getting them guns.

503
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:31,905
[Perez] <i>I got Sergeant MacClean</i>
<i>from property on it.</i>

504
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:34,867
[Scarfe] <i>MacClean?</i>

505
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,870
<i>That fat donut-eating bastard</i>
<i>is gonna get us burnt.</i>

506
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:40,247
[Perez] <i>We'll be fine.</i>
<i>He's on payroll.</i>

507
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,915
<i>If we go down, he goes down.</i>

508
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,464
[exhales]

509
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:07,190
[Luke] Aisha, I got something for you.

510
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,704
You with them stickup boys?

511
00:35:22,665 --> 00:35:24,249
-No.
-Good.

512
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,210
'Cause we ain't got shit left.

513
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:32,507
[Luke] I'm sorry about
what happened to your shop.

514
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:35,468
Back in the days, people had respect.

515
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:38,596
I seen 'em all come and go.

516
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:42,225
Nicky. Fritz. Azie.

517
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,102
It's always been wild.

518
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:48,356
But people
carried groceries for old ladies.

519
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,317
Your name meant something.

520
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:54,571
Maybe that's why they call it
"back in the day."

521
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,283
You're Eddie?

522
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,204
The one and only.

523
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:03,831
I need to find your daughter.

524
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:08,669
She still carrying on about that ring?
It ain't worth shit.

525
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:13,131
Maybe it reminds her of better times...

526
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,593
back in the day.

527
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,020
What about your father?

528
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:29,898
Did he play the game?

529
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:31,441
Of course.

530
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,902
Baseball is a game
passed from father to son.

531
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:37,489
That's why you don't see no niggas
playing the game no more.

532
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:39,199
'Cause all the fathers is gone.

533
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:41,785
[scoffs]

534
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,248
Aisha's the one
had the idea for this damn shop.

535
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,877
Said I could sign some autographs...

536
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:53,005
and keep my hands on something positive.

537
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:57,675
I said,
"Baby, everything I touch turns to shit."

538
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:00,678
She never did listen.

539
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:08,353
Quit letting her down.

540
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:12,858
If she comes back...
tell her Luke Cage came by.

541
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,861
I need to see her.

542
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:20,032
You him, huh?

543
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:23,160
Your name is all over Harlem today.

544
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,788
Not in a good way.

545
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:28,957
I'm about to change that.

546
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,835
You should do the same.

547
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:36,173
[door closes]

548
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:46,683
That's him.

549
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,270
[Soledad] Who?
[Claire] Luke.

550
00:37:50,353 --> 00:37:53,648
Oh, he's trouble.
He reminds me of your father.

551
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:57,735
Yo, that's Luke Cage.

552
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,405
-You know him?
-Yeah. From the barber shop.

553
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:02,240
He's for real.

554
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,024
Shit.

555
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:42,447
Sorry, Pop. You got me.

556
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:12,144
Hi.

557
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:15,647
You know the man?

558
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,438
[cell phone chiming]

559
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,347
I never really knew my father.

560
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:33,808
I always said that...

561
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:35,685
outside of my conception...

562
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:38,813
he was never there for me.

563
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:44,069
It got easier and easier

564
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:46,404
to think of him as dead.

565
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:48,906
And now that he is...

566
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:51,743
I need him.

567
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:53,745
More than ever.

568
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:55,372
[shakily] I was gonna tell him...

569
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:58,250
I've got one on the way.

570
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:00,418
He's a grandfather.

571
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:05,465
I just hope that
by being in my son's life...

572
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:08,426
I'm able to do the things that...

573
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:12,764
seems like Pop did for everybody else.

574
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,152
Aisha.

575
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:27,029
I took care of it.

576
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:30,073
You don't have to do anything else.

577
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:33,701
And take your hand... out of your purse.

578
00:41:43,336 --> 00:41:45,672
Would anyone else like to say anything?

579
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,801
[Stokes] I have a few words.

580
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:01,479
[clearing throat]

581
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:09,071
Henry Hunter was my mentor...

582
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:11,323
[inhales deeply]

583
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,033
and oldest friend.

584
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,036
Taught me streets the hard way.

585
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:18,496
Y'all don't remember
the sound of his fist,

586
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,290
but that's how he got his name.

587
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:21,708
[chuckling] Pop.

588
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:25,753
But he changed.

589
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:28,256
He evolved.

590
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,217
[all agreeing]

591
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,884
You see, Harlem would do that to you.

592
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:36,681
Where some people saw a war zone,
Pop always saw a pasture.

593
00:42:36,764 --> 00:42:42,645
A breeding ground for artistry...
greatness.

594
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,897
[all agreeing]

595
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:46,608
From Billy Strayhorn...

596
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:50,778
Teddy Riley, Big L, A$AP Rocky.

597
00:42:50,862 --> 00:42:52,405
All those brothers...

598
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:56,201
came from right here.

599
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:57,827
[all agreeing]

600
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:03,833
Roses from the concrete,
all 'cause of people like Pop.

601
00:43:05,835 --> 00:43:09,547
Now, I believe that whatever
doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

602
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:11,341
And that's how
we got to look at Pop's death.

603
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:13,218
[all agreeing]

604
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,555
Now, they never caught the shooter.

605
00:43:19,682 --> 00:43:23,395
But I have faith that he is rotting
in the depths of hell.

606
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:25,897
I miss Pop.

607
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:30,485
I promise you with all my might...

608
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:35,448
that even though
we are being attacked from all sides

609
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:37,742
by foreign interlopers...

610
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:40,120
strangers...

611
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:42,497
with arcane abilities...

612
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,081
[all agreeing]

613
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:50,297
...I promise you...

614
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:53,550
I stay true to what we have right here.

615
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:57,637
'Cause that's what Pop woulda wanted.

616
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,264
[all agreeing]

617
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:01,474
[man] Yes, yes, yes. Yes!

618
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:22,036
[screams]

619
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:25,790
[yelling]

620
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:53,901
I asked Pop once...

621
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:59,282
why he didn't want people
to curse in his shop.

622
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:03,578
And why we had
to wear these ugly smocks.

623
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:05,747
-[people chuckling]
-He said...

624
00:45:07,164 --> 00:45:11,669
"These kids
need to see a man go to work...

625
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,842
every day...
and to be in the presence of men...

626
00:45:18,926 --> 00:45:22,138
in uniform putting in work."

627
00:45:22,221 --> 00:45:23,640
[all agreeing]

628
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:27,977
I didn't want to walk in late,

629
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,188
but... I was trying to do
what Pop always did.

630
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:34,734
Help those in need.

631
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:40,239
And protect them from the forces
that would do them harm.

632
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:46,162
[inhaling deeply]
At first, it was selfish...

633
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:49,499
because my name was attached to it.

634
00:45:50,124 --> 00:45:51,793
But then it got bigger.

635
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:58,049
If we try to protect only ourselves...

636
00:45:58,132 --> 00:46:00,927
without looking out
for those people closest to us...

637
00:46:03,137 --> 00:46:04,431
then we lose.

638
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:09,811
Pop never forgot his people.

639
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,606
Where some people saw hard rock kids...

640
00:46:14,899 --> 00:46:17,068
he saw precious jewels.

641
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:22,365
He reminded me that
diamonds are formed by pressure...

642
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:25,327
covered in dirt.

643
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:28,120
But then you polish them...

644
00:46:29,038 --> 00:46:30,206
and they shine.

645
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:32,083
[all agreeing]

646
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:38,423
[all exclaiming]

647
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:43,428
Pop saw the shine in everyone
that walked in his barber shop.

648
00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:46,973
He cut their hair.
He listened to their problems.

649
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,143
And he made them feel better
about the world and themselves.

650
00:46:52,979 --> 00:46:56,566
We have to strive on a daily basis...

651
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:59,110
to do the same for each other.

652
00:47:00,653 --> 00:47:03,656
And sometimes, that's gonna mean
standing up to a bully.

653
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,241
[all agreeing]

654
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:09,245
Especially...
if he calls himself a friend.

655
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:12,457
-[all exclaiming]
-[man] Talk about it.

656
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:17,086
I don't believe in Harlem.

657
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:23,175
I believe in the people
who make Harlem what it is.

658
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:24,844
[cheering and applauding]

659
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:48,117
I believe this...
belongs to you.

660
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:53,247
So, you're one of them, huh?

661
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:56,250
You mean someone who gives a damn?

662
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,585
Yeah.

663
00:47:58,586 --> 00:47:59,921
[chuckling]

664
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:04,341
[indistinct chatter]

665
00:48:17,146 --> 00:48:18,397
I was wrong.

666
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:20,692
I'm glad you came.

667
00:48:20,775 --> 00:48:23,194
Embarrassing you in public
was much better than doing it

668
00:48:23,277 --> 00:48:25,905
behind closed doors
in your cheap-ass club.

669
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,201
Never confuse the battle with the war.

670
00:48:33,788 --> 00:48:35,790
Next suit that gets damaged...

671
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,501
I'm taxing you.

672
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:42,254
[laughing]

673
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:46,175
Yes.

674
00:48:50,472 --> 00:48:53,432
Hell of an impression you made in there.

675
00:48:53,516 --> 00:48:54,684
I'm sorry, did you just
pay me a compliment?

676
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:56,143
No, I didn't.

677
00:48:56,227 --> 00:49:00,439
You need to stop with this pissing contest
before more people get killed.

678
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:02,233
Maybe if y'all stopped him
in the first place,

679
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:03,818
no one would've had to die.

680
00:49:03,901 --> 00:49:06,988
I will get him the right way.

681
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,949
-The system will win.
-Forget the system.

682
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:12,660
Arrests lead to indictments.
And indictments lead to pleas.

683
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:15,037
There's always a bigger fish,
a bigger angle.

684
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:16,455
A slap on the wrist.

685
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:20,001
Boom. Right back in business.
I ain't going for that.

686
00:49:20,084 --> 00:49:22,044
You just started World War III in there.

687
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:26,298
And your ass might be bulletproof,
but Harlem ain't.

688
00:49:26,382 --> 00:49:28,718
Harlem is gonna suffer.

689
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:30,678
So if you aren't gonna help us
take him down,

690
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:32,889
then you need to leave right now, Luke,

691
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:35,182
before you make things worse.

692
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:42,774
I'm sorry things couldn't be
different between us.

693
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:47,111
But I ain't going nowhere.

694
00:49:56,996 --> 00:49:58,080
[door closes]
