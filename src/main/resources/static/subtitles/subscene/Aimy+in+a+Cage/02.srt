The Cage of Love

19
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,110
<i> Episode 2 </i>

20
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,070
Boss. You are looking for me?

21
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,350
Ling Long is in trouble.

22
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,400
There's a dye factory called Yao Sheng, selling their products at a lower price, to drive Ling Long out of business.

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,060
How can this be? <br> Our Ling Long is a well-known brand,

24
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,770
with many customers and quality goods.

25
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,930
Yao Sheng used dyes imported from France.

26
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,170
The textiles they produce are okay, <br> but their price is 10 percent cheaper than ours.

27
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,730
However, the cost of importing dyes is expensive.

28
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,390
How could their textiles be cheaper than ours?

29
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,530
I think that Yao Sheng is disregarding costs,

30
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,180
and doing cut-throat competition.

31
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,200
Have someone look up Yao Sheng's backing. <br> Also, take a look and see how much money we have left in our account.

32
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,920
We must defeat them this time.

33
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,160
Yes.

34
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,900
Shao Tian.

35
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,940
What's wrong? Why do you look hassled?

36
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,610
Shao Tian. Listen to me. I just transferred the money out.

37
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,790
Wu Hong Da suddenly wants to check the balance of the accounts.

38
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,630
He says it's to deal with the cut-throat competition.

39
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,940
Tell me what we should do.

40
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,280
It was such a big sum of money and you dared to steal it. <br>It's causing a stir now.

41
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,960
You're so scared that you're about to piss.

42
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,480
If they investigate the huge sum of money, we will be in trouble.

43
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,690
You don't know Wu Hong Da. He is very cruel.

44
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,190
Of course, I know what kind of person he is.

45
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,610
I schemed about this money for a long time.

46
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,620
Don't worry.

47
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,610
I'm his eyes. You are his hands.

48
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,290
We know very well what actions he will take.

49
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,700
Shao Tian. Didn't you say that we would leave Huzhou once the money was in our hands?

50
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,040
When will we leave?

51
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,000
Very soon.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,040
I have a plan. Don't be impulsive.

53
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,020
Shao Tian. The money will be in our hands soon. <br>Why aren't we leaving?

54
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,900
It can't be that you really like the Miss of the Wu family?

55
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,390
You want to be their son-in-law?

56
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,930
I'm saying, Shao Tian. Stop dreaming.

57
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,770
If Miss knew you are scheming with her father behind her back, <br>she would chew and spit you out in a second.

58
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,260
Don't get involved in my affairs.

59
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,370
I know what to do.

60
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,870
Have you seen this person?

61
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,140
No.

62
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,570
Hello. Have you seen this person?

63
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,420
Okay, you can leave first.

64
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,710
Manager Jiang.

65
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,480
Madam Jiang's illness is not stable. It's worse than before.

66
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,390
And there wasn't any symptoms before her illness started.

67
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,510
We, the medical staff, have been trying our best to help her,

68
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,240
but have had little success.

69
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,870
When she is discharged, you and Miss Fang must work hard to persuade her.

70
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,970
Perhaps, she might accept the advice of her family members.

71
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,990
It has been many years. When my mom thinks of unhappy events,

72
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,560
she becomes like this.

73
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,430
We have tried many methods and consulted many doctors

74
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,270
but there is no progress.

75
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,410
Mom. What are you doing?

76
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,690
Give me the scissors.

77
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,920
Yu Er. I don't want to live anymore.

78
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,170
If I die, you don't have to suffer so much.

79
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,840
Madam Jiang. Let's talk it over. Your son is here.

80
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,240
- Don't do anything foolish.<br>- It's useless.

81
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,060
They forced my husband to die.

82
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,550
They are thinking of forcing me and the Wu family.

83
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,710
- Mom. <br>- Don't move.

84
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,020
Okay, I won't move. Don't do anything either.

85
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,160
Don't move.

86
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,380
You have suffered for the past few years.

87
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,000
I didn't take good care care of you. Instead, you had to take care of me instead.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,360
When I'm dead, you don't have use your savings to treat me.

89
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,730
I really can't drag you down any longer.

90
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,050
Mom, don't say this. You are not dragging me down.

91
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,360
When I die,

92
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,410
I can be free. You can be free too.

93
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,460
Aunt.

94
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,370
Mom.

95
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,960
Doctor, help me to treat her wound.

96
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,580
Aunt. You said that you wanted to be free and didn't want to drag anyone down.

97
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,620
Actually, you are trying to run away and using the pain as your excuse.

98
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,810
Do you think that if you die, they will really be relieved?

99
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,690
You are wrong.

100
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,860
Your death will only bring them more pain.

101
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,200
They will only hate themselves for not being able to protect their own mother.

102
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,600
They will also be in pain as to why you wouldn't shoulder this with them.

103
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,060
You are also leaving all your pain to them.

104
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,970
They will never be able to forgive you and themselves.

105
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,040
Four years ago, my mom and I were in the same situation as you.

106
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,650
To relieve me, she chose to kill herself.

107
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,620
These years, I've been living in a painful abyss.

108
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,630
If you want your son to be like me,

109
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,970
everyday living while blaming oneself, then do it!

110
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,710
Remember, next time find someplace where there'll be no one around.

111
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,500
No one will disturb you again.

112
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,740
Everything should be alright. Take a rest soon.

113
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,520
Nurse. Where is the outpatient clinic?

114
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,150
Over there.

115
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,040
Thanks.

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:01,910
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

117
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,670
Sorry about just now.

118
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,640
Your apology doesn't sound sincere.

119
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,870
I never thought you also had experienced <br>the same hardships I did.

120
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,930
My mom was just like your mom.

121
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,890
For many years, she had to endure the pain caused by her illness.

122
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:38,300
The many years of suffering caused her to turn from gentle to bad-tempered.

123
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,030
Her love for me also

124
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,830
made her decide to free herself for my sake.

125
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,920
When she made her decision, she didn't consider my feelings.

126
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,990
Up until my mom left me,

127
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,650
it was too late to feel regretful.

128
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,610
If before she made this absurd decision,

129
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,900
I could have told her what was in my heart,

130
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,990
she wouldn't have done that.

131
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,940
Twelve years ago, our family suffered a catastrophe.

132
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,960
From then on, my mom developed a mental illness.

133
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,310
For these twelve years, we've always been cautious.

134
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,560
Not knowing which word or which situation would provoke her.

135
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,050
But the more we didn't dare say, <br> the tighter the knot in my mom's heart got.

136
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,560
Her illness became more serious.

137
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,260
I didn't expect that you causing a scene, would instead undo the knot in her heart.

138
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,320
Since I did you such a big favour,

139
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,910
shouldn't you declare something to me?

140
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,690
Declare what?

141
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,920
That fountain pen.

142
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,600
How could be you so stubborn?

143
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,890
Yes, you did help me but you also hurt my mom.

144
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,550
Hence, we are considered even. We don't owe each other anything.

145
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,750
In that situation just now, if I didn't do that, would she have came to her senses?

146
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,310
Rotten Stone Head. I did you such a big favour

147
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,580
and you are still unwilling to let me have the pen?

148
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,000
Aren't you being a little stingy?

149
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,600
If you find out my name, I will then reconsider if I should give it to you.

150
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,670
- Rotten Stone Head. <br>- And also,

151
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,360
don't hassle the doctors and the nurses.

152
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,500
I already told them to protect the information of the patient.

153
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,850
If not, I will sue them.

154
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,750
I don't need to ask them. I already know your rotten name.

155
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,850
It's Rotten Stone Head.

156
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,960
Brother Shao Tian, why are you here?

157
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,670
I went to your house to look for you. They told me that you were at the hospital.

158
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,580
I witnessed your heroic deed in saving someone.

159
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,390
Our little heroine is injured. Let me bandage your wound.

160
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,970
It's already done.

161
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,550
That fast?

162
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,510
-Who was that man? <br>-Are you referring to Rotten Stone Head?

163
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,490
He is the guy who snatched my pen.

164
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,940
Cai Hong, I like you.

165
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,620
I want to take you for my wife.

166
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,930
Cai Hong. You don't need to answer me right now.

167
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,620
You really don't need to.

168
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,620
You just need to know that in this world,

169
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,690
there is always someone waiting for you by your side.

170
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,990
No matter when or where, no matter the circumstances,

171
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,420
I will always be waiting for you.

172
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,020
Brother.

173
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,310
Here's today's newspaper. It has news about Ling Long.

174
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,130
Petty devil. Petty devil.

175
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,330
You're really narrow-minded.

176
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,610
I saved your mom

177
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,760
and you still won't let me have the pen.

178
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,900
I should visit his mom but I hit her yesterday.

179
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,980
Would she remember and hate me?

180
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:17,050
No. In order to give my Dad a surprise, I must find out his name.

181
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,850
Wu Long.

182
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,910
Kitty, I don't have time to play with you today. <br>I have a very important task to do.

183
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,970
See you later. Keep the rabbit company.

184
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Who is it?

185
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,430
Come in.

186
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,010
Aunt.

187
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,490
It's you.

188
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,570
-Don't get up. <br>-Come here.

189
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,700
Lie down. Don't get up.

190
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,090
Come and sit.

191
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,800
Aunt, sorry about yesterday.

192
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,910
I'm here to apologise to you today.

193
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,100
You really don't need to apologise to me.

194
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,110
Yesterday, fortunately, you slapped me and made me come to my senses.

195
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,710
Otherwise I would still be bashing my head against a brick wall.

196
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:26,950
Actually, I have been hurting my family all these years.

197
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,410
Once I'm discharged, I will treat you to a meal.

198
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,750
I don't need the meal but if you really want to thank me,

199
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,970
you can tell me your son's name.

200
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,430
If you have any matters with him, you can wait for him to come later.

201
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,670
Why don't you ask him yourself?

202
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,960
He won't tell me when he sees me.

203
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,330
Why?

204
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,940
It's a long story.

205
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,010
Hello, Mr Jiang.

206
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,710
Mom.

207
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,360
Mom.

208
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,510
You are here.

209
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,790
Mom, what are you doing?

210
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,980
I'm tired of lying down and wanted to move around.

211
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,670
Yu... Jiang Yu.

212
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,580
Is your work done at the factory?

213
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:50,580
Jiang Yu. If you are busy, you don't need to visit me.

214
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,620
I'm fine.

215
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,740
Son, don't worry. I'm really fine.

216
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,040
Mom, are you really okay?

217
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,030
What are you doing?

218
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,500
Mom. What is she doing here?

219
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,850
What are you both doing?

220
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,630
We didn't do anything.

221
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,410
I only promised her that I would call your name.

222
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,970
I already know your name. <br>It's Jiang Yu.

223
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,980
Let's go.

224
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,520
Let's go.

225
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,000
I only just called his name. What's wrong?

226
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,970
Take this.

227
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,640
Where is my fountain pen?

228
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,430
Don't you remember what I said the other time?

229
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,240
I said that once you found out my name, we would discuss this again.

230
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,350
I didn't promise that I would give you the pen immediately.

231
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,900
Rotten Stone Head. A kid knows what a promise is.

232
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,470
You are going to be a scoundrel over a pen?

233
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,170
Even I feel ashamed for you.

234
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,660
Okay. Even if I promised to give you the fountain pen,

235
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,270
it was agreed on that you couldn't spend any money.

236
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,090
You bribed my mom. You broke the pact first.

237
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,630
When did I bribe your mom?

238
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,480
Did you make this appear from thin air?

239
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,290
This is to declare my sincerity. That's why I bought this for her.

240
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,040
I didn't have any intentions to bribe her at all.

241
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,950
In any case, I have only two words. Definitely not.

242
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,520
Then I also have two words. Shame-less.

243
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,730
Okay. Seeing how pitiful and miserable you are,

244
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,390
I will give you another chance. Don't spend a single cent or go through my mom,

245
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,980
just find out my favourite food.

246
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,790
I will consider whether to let you have the pen then.

247
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,520
Jiang Yu. You don't keep your promise.

248
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,970
I don't believe that I can't find the exact same pen.

249
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,220
Miss. There was really only one of that pen. I'm not lying to you.

250
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,510
There is only one in Huzhou. It can't be that there is also only one in this world.

251
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,370
Miss. If you really like that fountain pen,

252
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,550
I can send a telegraph to the overseas manufacturer to order another one,

253
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,600
but it will take a long time. It takes around twenty days.

254
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,950
Twenty days? My father's birthday celebration is in ten days. It will be too late for me.

255
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,270
Why don't you look around my shop for another gift?

256
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,980
I don't want to. I only want that fountain pen.

257
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,380
<i>I will treat you to a meal another day. What do you like to eat?</i>

258
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,500
<i>I can treat you to anything.</i>

259
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,090
Stop the rickshaw.

260
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,350
It's really you.

261
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,180
Come. What are you doing here?

262
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,980
Where is your fierce owner?

263
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,890
Did you leave home? Are you afraid of her too?

264
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:22,980
Why don't we do this? I will take you to visit my home.

265
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,590
Okay, let's go.

266
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,720
Brother. What are you doing?

267
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,280
A cat is here. So cute.

268
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,990
-I picked it up. <br>-You picked it up?

269
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,360
This is not something you would usually do.

270
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,000
- You don't like animals, right? <br>- Who says so?

271
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,030
So cute.

272
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,150
Don't play with her anymore. <br>Go to the kitchen and find her something to eat and drink.

273
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,450
- Okay. <br> - Go now.

274
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,930
Are you hungry?

275
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,040
Meow, it's time to eat.

276
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,990
Wu Long, it's time to eat.

277
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,930
Wu Long?

278
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,980
Transfer the money back.

279
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,380
- What? <br>- Transfer the money back.

280
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,370
You...

281
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,930
Are you saying to transfer the money back to the company?

282
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,430
Yes.

283
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,840
Transfer the money back to Ling Long.

284
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,740
No. Shao Tian, what do you mean?

285
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,970
At first, I didn't want to touch the money but you forced me to do it. <br>You are reversing it now.

286
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,920
You are not playing with Wu Hong Da. You are playing with me.

287
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,200
Just do what I tell you to do.

288
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,820
You don't have the right to discuss terms with me.

289
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't care what methods you use. Transfer the money back discreetly.

290
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,150
Once it's done,

291
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,740
I won't treat you unfairly.

292
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,490
Okay, I will do according to what you say

293
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,330
but Shao Tian, you should know that

294
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,380
for such a huge sum of money, it's not easy to move it.

295
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,400
Now that we are going to transfer it back, it will create problems.

296
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,430
Such a huge amount cannot appear from nowhere. We need to have some kind of contract or something else.

297
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,760
I think we should find a suitable time.

298
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,060
Take action fast

299
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,390
before Wu Hong Da finds out.

300
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,990
I will assist you when necessary.

301
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,360
Brother.

302
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,680
We received news about Ling Long.

303
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,020
They said that the company is in trouble.

304
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,590
They had problems with generating their normal turnover. People are starting to complain.

305
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,400
Relay this instruction down. Starting from now,

306
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,450
we will offer basic unit prices for all small customers

307
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,580
and immediate execution of the given orders.

308
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,950
This will help us to win over Ling Long's small customers

309
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,630
and completely dry off their cash flow.

310
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,550
Wu Hong Da will no longer be considered so almighty.

311
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:58,260
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

312
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,790
Come in.

313
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,910
Boss. This lady said that she's your friend.

314
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,090
Miss Lu Man.

315
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,370
I have not seen the handsome face of Boss Wu for few days now.

316
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:15,670
Miss Lu Man's visit graces our humble home. Is Master Lu in good health?

317
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,700
In very good health. When he knew I was paying you a visit today,

318
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,020
he especially instructed me to send his regards to you.

319
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,980
Shao Tian. Go back to work first.

320
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,070
Okay.

321
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,830
Miss Lu. This way, please.

322
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,550
Please sit.

323
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,730
Miss Lu. Why are you looking for me?

324
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,930
I heard that you ran into a small problem.

325
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,090
Other people are eyeing Ling Long with curiosity.

326
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,610
There is a cashflow problem in your company.

327
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:54,970
Will those problems not turn Ling Long into a chopping board?

328
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:02,040
I might have a perfect solution for your current problems, Boss Wu.

329
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,130
Ling Long definitely has a small problem lately

330
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,540
but it's still better that we solve it ourselves.

331
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,270
Boss Wu, the whole Huzhou city is dominated by Master Lu.

332
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,650
Nothing can escape my eyes.

333
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,950
Miss Lu. Why do you want to help me?

334
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,500
You are a smart man.

335
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,990
I'm here today

336
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:32,490
to use this cheque to buy something.

337
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,020
What do you want to buy?

338
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,000
Ling Long's trade secrets.

339
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:55,660
All of Ling Long's dye recipes are made public.

340
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,350
I don't have any trade secrets.

341
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,290
Boss Wu.

342
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,230
I am getting bored by this childish play.

343
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,360
What I want is not your trade secrets,

344
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,450
but the secrets of the Jiang family.

345
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,990
<i>You are dreaming.</i>

346
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:31,870
Miss Lu Man, I am grateful for your kindness,

347
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,600
but I really don't have any trade secrets.

348
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,990
I have never heard of this.

349
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,270
Maybe Boss Wu is just not willing to part with it yet.

350
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,190
So be it then.

351
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:51,140
I would also frown if you'd give away such precious things so quickly.

352
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,420
This is my phone number.

353
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,350
If you change your mind, please call me.

354
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,970
We can discuss the price.

355
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,990
Brother.

356
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,510
What's wrong?

357
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,820
These acounts are giving me a headache.

358
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,680
There are some which I can't balance. Please help me to take a look.

359
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,330
Where? Let me see.

360
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,490
It's here.

361
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,050
This money is from Henghua Cloth Square, coming through with the start-up funds.

362
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:42,250
We have agreed on two points per annum, giving them 3 years to pay us off.

363
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,050
Then in what tables should I put it?

364
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:50,100
I have taught you this so many times already. They go into the receivable accounts.

365
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,050
Here.

366
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,850
<i>I don't want anything except this.</i>

367
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:31,610
<i>I have never seen such a rude, stingy and mannerless man like you!</i>

368
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:39,450
<i>You see, he has a strikingly handsome face. <br> He has a Grecian nose, strong brows and bright-eyed, with an uncommon demeanor.</i>

369
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,000
<i>No matter how you look at him, upon meeting you'll fall for him, he is definitely a very handsome man.</i>

370
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,200
<i>Brother, I spent my most beautiful days in the shelter provided by the Jiang family.</i>

371
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,980
<i>You didn't abandon me during my most difficult times.</i>

372
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,030
<i>In your eyes, I'm so stupid. I can't even do the accounts.</i>

373
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,600
<i> I will still allow you to teach me.</i>

374
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,040
What's wrong?

375
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,940
Are you blaming me for not taking you to find your owner?

376
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,980
Okay.

377
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,990
I will take you to find her tomorrow. Okay?

378
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,820
It's just a darn fountain pen. What's so great about it?

379
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,210
I will knit this scarf myself.

380
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,580
In my Dad's eyes, it will be priceless.

381
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,680
Miss.

382
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:52,430
I searched everywhere since yesterday and I can't find Wu Long.

383
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,440
Could she really be lost?

384
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,320
- Cai Hong. <br>- Brother Shao Tian.

385
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,300
- Wu Long is missing. I'm going to find her. <br>- I will go with you.

386
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,990
Let's go then.

387
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,830
How are we going to find your owner?

388
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,310
If I can't find her, I will rear you forever. I'm not bad as your owner either.

389
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,980
Okay, I know. Let's just wait a while longer.

390
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,020
Wu Long.

391
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,100
Wu Long.

392
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,410
Wu Long.

393
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,760
Wu Long.

394
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,870
Cai Hong. I already looked over there. I can't find her.

395
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:52,340
Wu Long went out with me. She must be near the hospital.

396
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,070
She can't really be lost.

397
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,940
Look at how anxious you are. Your head is full of sweat.

398
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,670
I will do it myself.

399
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,020
Let's go home.

400
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,020
<i>Jiang Mansion </i>

401
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,620
Stop the rickshaw.

402
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,370
Forget it. No need.

403
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,960
Wait.

404
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,100
Do I know you?

405
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,800
- What's wrong with you? <br>- Nothing.

406
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,010
- Don't you want the pen? <br>- No.

407
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:07,270
- Do you want the cat then&gt; <br>- No!

408
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,050
Are you talking about Wu Long?

409
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,840
This is not a new game of yours, right?

410
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,270
It's up to you whether you believe me or not.

411
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,010
I believe you.

412
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:25,070
If you do this, wouldn't your boyfriend be unhappy if he sees?

413
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,960
First, I don't have a boyfriend.

414
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,100
Secondly, if I had a boyfriend, he would not like you to be so stingy.

415
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,790
The cat is at my home but...

416
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:42,670
Must I find out what's your favourite food or must I find out where you live?

417
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,870
What I wanted to say was...

418
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:48,690
I don't have time today but tomorrow is fine.

419
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:53,670
Okay, state the meeting place and time.

420
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,330
Then tomorrow at 3pm at Chaoyin Bay Bridge.

421
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,060
Okay, it's 3pm then. Don't break the appointment.

422
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,520
If you do, I'm going to throw your cat into the river to feed the fish.

423
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,960
See if you dare!

424
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,660
Let's go.

425
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,290
Why did you call me here?

426
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,670
Shao Tian. There is a big problem.

427
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,370
Wu Hong Da has been conducting investigations for the past few days.

428
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,940
He told everyone to move the ledger books to his office.

429
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,190
Think of a solution.

430
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:33,030
How can I think of a solution?

431
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:36,620
Shao Tian. All the ledger books are locked inside his safe.

432
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,000
He is the only one who knows the combination to the safe.

433
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,320
He already doesn't trust me.

434
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,320
I already feel like he is aware of this matter.

435
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,920
It's all your fault. We would have left with the money.

436
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,360
Who would have thought this would come back to bite us one day.

437
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,910
Don't expect me to fix it. You are the only one who can get those books.

438
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,930
Tomorrow is Wu Hong Da's 40th birthday celebration.

439
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,130
He will definitely have a banquet in his mansion.

440
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:13,050
There will be many people. He definitely keeps the ledger books in the company.

441
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,970
We will take action tomorrow.

442
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,640
Look.

443
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,930
It's really beautiful. Did you draw this?

444
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,940
You really drew this?

445
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,140
Is this me?

446
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,270
- Do I look young? <br>- Younger by five years.

447
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,500
I really look young.

448
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,190
Dad is always a young hero in my eyes.

449
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,620
This is a drawing of the entire Wu family.

450
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,070
If the future, when you go out for business, you can take this along with you.

451
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,750
It will seem like your whole family is with you.

452
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,910
Great.

453
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,590
By the way, where is your sister?

454
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,210
Is she sleeping late again?

455
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,150
This wench.

456
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,700
Who drew this? I already heard.

457
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:11,230
Dad, today's your birthday. I wish you all the best, joy and peace.

458
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,410
Here's your present.

459
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,950
Sister's present is a high end product. My drawing can't be compared it.

460
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,050
That may not be so.

461
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,710
Here.

462
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,880
Dad, take a look.

463
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,230
This is...

464
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,830
I personally made this scarf.

465
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,650
For me?

466
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,990
- I thought it was for Shao Tian. <br>- Yes, me too.

467
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,540
Let me try it. So how?

468
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,490
It's the first time Cai Hong knitted anything. It's really not bad.

469
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,600
Dad. In the future, I will knit a better one for you.

470
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,780
This is already good enough. I like it.

471
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,910
Dad. I can knit a scarf for you now. In the future, I will cook for you.

472
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,000
I will also help you in your business, when you are too old to do it by yourself.

473
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And I will stick to your side through thick and thin.

474
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,530
Anyways, father, please look forward to your daughter taking care of you.

475
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,410
Okay, I will be waiting for it.

476
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,650
Dad, I can do it too. In the future, I will be filial to you too.

477
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,760
Okay, I will be waiting for the both of you.

478
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,220
Look at how filial they both are. The weather's hot. Take it off.

479
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,390
No. Cai Hong gave this to me. I must wear it every day.

480
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,320
I'm going to the factory for a while. There are some matters I need to settle.

481
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,530
Dad. Today is your birthday. Can't you give yourself a day off?

482
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,440
That's right. Even the workers in the factory thought that you were taking a day off for your birthday.

483
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,460
What's so urgent that you have to settle it yourself?

484
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,480
I made an appointment with a very important person.

485
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,140
I will be back for the birthday celebration.

486
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,230
Come home early then.

487
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,970
Dad, take care.

488
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,390
You both, listen to me.

489
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,500
Regarding this banquet...

490
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:10,030
No, move it a bit.

491
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,250
Mom. What's wrong?

492
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,200
I'm anxious. Look, the guests are already here.

493
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,190
Your father is still not back yet.

494
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,290
Dad is too much. Once he's busy with work, he forgets everything.

495
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,810
Why don't we do this? You take care of the guests and I will look for Dad.

496
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,290
Okay, go and be back soon.

497
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,410
Don't worry, Mom.

498
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,080
Be careful.

499
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,910
I'm really so anxious.

500
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:57,990
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to You by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

501
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,280
Who are you?

502
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,500
I am Yao Sheng's boss, Jiang Yu. <br><i>(yao - brilliant, dazzling; sheng - rise; name of the company)</i>

503
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,580
I'm Jian Wen Yuan's son.

504
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,450
<i>Give it to me.</i>

505
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,530
<i>Give it to me.</i>

506
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,710
You said that you are Jiang Wen Yuan's son?

507
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,930
I get it now.

508
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:30,160
No wonder Yao Sheng was pressing us harder and harder to the brink.

509
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,460
So, you are Jiang Wen Yuan's son.

510
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:39,980
It all stems from the wrong deed I have committed.

511
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:49,910
12 years have passed without notice.

512
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,750
I made you wait for a long time.

513
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,480
Those twelve years,

514
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,790
I have been living in guilt and remorse.

515
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,930
Come off it.

516
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,100
When you caused my father to die at that time,

517
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,860
you took away Ling Long together with our family's secret recipe.

518
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:14,280
For the past 12 years you have been stepping on a river of blood and tears shed by my family.

519
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,280
You have been enjoying things originally belonging to our family.

520
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,480
Did you ever think about how we lived for the past twelve years?

521
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,000
You are telling me now that you have a guilty conscious?

522
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,850
You are here to take revenge.

523
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:31,950
This is what you should do.

524
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,910
Because that year,

525
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,510
I committed an unforgivable crime to your Jiang family.

526
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,710
It has been twelve years.

527
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,130
I knew that this day would come sooner or later.

528
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:50,990
I will pay back for everything that I have done.

529
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,990
Now that you are here,

530
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,990
I feel relieved now.

531
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,260
I won't ask to beg for forgiveness.

532
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,130
I'm begging you

533
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,020
to let my family off.

534
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,730
I'm sorry.

535
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,000
Do you think that being sorry

536
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:42,580
can erase 12 years of our pain and suffering?

537
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,410
I'm back this time,

538
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:52,030
not only to take back the company and trade secrets.

539
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:56,980
I'm also going to take back everything which belongs to the Jiang family.

540
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:02,950
I'm also going to double the pain that we have suffered

541
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,970
and return it back to you.
