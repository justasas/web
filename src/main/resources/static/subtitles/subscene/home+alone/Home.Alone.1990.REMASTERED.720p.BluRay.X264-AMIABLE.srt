1
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,592
Where's my suitcase?

2
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,763
Who stole the hair dryer?

3
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,393
Miss. Young lady!

4
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,471
Excuse me. Girls!

5
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,482
Hey, little fella. Hey!

6
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,026
Excuse me, girls. Girls!

7
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:42,853
Hey. big fella!

8
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,239
Help me make the beds
in the living room.

9
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,611
Come on down here!

10
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,780
Hey. son!

11
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:53,038
Big fella.
Hey, little guy! Little guy!

12
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,201
Pete's brother
and his family are here.

13
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,956
<i>Trish is going to Montreal.</i>

14
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,710
Montreal? Oh, her family's there.

15
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,377
- Then we're off.
-When?

16
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,880
- Tomorrow.
-You're not ready, are you?

17
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,004
Uncle Frank won't let me
watch the movie...

18
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,555
...but the big kids can.

19
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,049
Why can't I?

20
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,429
I'm on the phone.

21
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,512
When do you come back?
Not till then?

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,564
It's not even rated R.
He's just being a jerk.

23
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,276
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no...

24
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,104
...then it must be really bad.

25
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,490
No, we put the dog in the kennel--
Hey, get off!

26
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,907
Kevin, out of the room.

27
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,411
Hang up the phone and make me,
why don't you?

28
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,616
This kid.

29
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,328
Did you pick up
a voltage adapter thing?

30
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,078
No, I didn't have time.

31
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,036
- Then how do I shave in France?
-Grow a goatee.

32
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,417
Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

33
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,926
I've got something, pick up those
Micro Machines that are all over.

34
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,087
Aunt Leslie almost broke her neck.

35
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,639
He was playing
with the glue gun again.

36
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,140
We talked about that.

37
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,432
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.

38
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,471
I made ornaments out of fish hooks.

39
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,647
- My new fish hooks?
-I can't make them out of old ones...

40
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,232
...with dry worm guts stuck on them.

41
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,199
- Peter.
-Come on, Kevin. Out.

42
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,659
Do you guys have a voltage adapter?

43
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,327
Here's a voltage adapter!

44
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,158
God, you're getting heavy!
Go pack your suitcase.

45
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,457
Pack my suitcase?

46
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,081
- Where's the shampoo?
-I don't live here.

47
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,461
This many people here
and no shampoo.

48
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,797
- Are your folks home?
-They don't live here.

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,634
- Tracy, did you order the pizza?
-Buzz did.

50
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,840
Excuse me. Are your parents here?

51
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,558
My parents live in Paris.

52
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,809
15::

53
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,345
- Are your parents home?
-Yeah.

54
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,434
- Do they live here?
-No.

55
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:45,317
No. Why should they?
All kids, no parents.

56
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,902
Probably a fancy orphanage.

57
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,073
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.
I've never done it once.

58
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,401
- Tough.
-That's what Megan said.

59
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,111
- What did I say?
-You told him, "Tough."

60
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,664
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What was I supposed to say?

61
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,541
"Congratulations, you're an idiot"?

62
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,289
- I'm not an idiot!
-Really?

63
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,588
You're helpless! We have to do
everything for you.

64
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,008
- She's right, Kev.
-Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm small.

65
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,835
I don't know how to pack.

66
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,388
- I hope you didn't just pack crap.
-Shut up, Linnie.

67
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,551
- Do you know what I should pack?
-Buzz told you, cheek-face.

68
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,515
Toilet paper and water.

69
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,639
What are you so worried about?

70
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,441
You know Mom's gonna
pack your stuff, anyway.

71
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,778
You're <i>what the</i> French call
<i>les incompetents.</i>

72
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,021
What?

73
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,865
Bombs away!

74
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,832
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.

75
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,161
If he has something to drink,
he'll wet the bed.

76
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,705
This house is so full of people
it makes me sick!

77
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,667
When I grow up and get married,
I'm living alone!

78
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,674
Did you hear me?
I'm living alone!

79
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,548
I'm living alone!

80
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,302
Who's gonna feed your spider?

81
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,808
He just ate a load of mice guts.
He'll be good for a couple weeks.

82
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,437
Is it true French babes
don't shave their pits?

83
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,150
Some don't.

84
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,191
But they got nude beaches.

85
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,616
Not in the winter.

86
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,496
Buzz?

87
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,787
Don't you know how to knock,
phlegm-wad?

88
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,423
Can I sleep here?
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.

89
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,466
If he drinks, he'll wet the bed.

90
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:38,260
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room
if you were growing on my <i>ass.</i>

91
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,685
Check it out. Old man Marley.

92
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,728
Who's he?

93
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,986
You ever heard of
the South Bend Shovel Slayer?

94
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,021
- No.
-That's him.

95
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,111
In '58 he murdered his whole family
and half the people on his block...

96
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,238
...with a snow shovel.

97
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,742
Been hiding out
in this neighborhood ever since.

98
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,500
If he's the shovel slayer,
how come the cops don't arrest him?

99
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,456
Not enough evidence to convict.

100
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,212
They never found the bodies.

101
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,506
Everyone around here knows he did it.

102
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,971
It'll just be a matter of time...

103
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,219
...before he does it again.

104
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,097
What's he doing now?

105
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,229
He walks up and down
the streets every night...

106
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,727
...salting the sidewalks.

107
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,899
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

108
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,316
No way.

109
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,406
See that garbage can full of salt?

110
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,868
That's where he keeps his victims.

111
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,867
The salt turns the bodies...

112
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,907
...into mummies.

113
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,914
Mummies!

114
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,709
Look out!

115
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,997
How you kids doing? Good?

116
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,792
Lot of action around here today, huh?

117
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,589
Going on vacation?

118
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,341
Where you going?

119
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,011
You hear me, or what?
Going on a trip?

120
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,222
Where you going, kid?

121
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,480
Okay, that's $122.50.

122
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,987
Not from me, kid. I don't live here.

123
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,231
You just around for the holidays?

124
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,741
You could say that.

125
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,492
- Pizza's here!
-There you go.

126
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,657
That's $122.50.

127
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,905
It's my brother's house. He'll get it.

128
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,250
Hey, listen...

129
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,043
- Hi.
-Hi.

130
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,454
- Are you Mr. McCallister?
-Yeah.

131
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,506
The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

132
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,171
Good, because somebody
owes me $122.50.

133
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,929
- I'd like a word with you, sir.
-Am I under arrest or something?

134
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:29,013
No, no, no. There's always
a lot of burglaries around the holidays.

135
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,309
We're checking the neighborhood to see
if the proper precautions are taken.

136
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,560
We have automatic timers
for our lights, locks for our doors.

137
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,769
That's about <i>as</i> well
as anybody can do.

138
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,026
- Did you get some eggnog?
-Come on.

139
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,649
- Let's eat.
-Come on.

140
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,862
- Eggnog?
-Pizza!

141
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,411
- Are you gonna be leaving--?
-Pizza!

142
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,369
Grab a napkin
and pour your own drinks.

143
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:56,295
- Does Santa go through customs?
-What time do we have to go to bed?

144
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,332
Early. We're leaving at 8 a.m.
on the button.

145
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,294
I hope you're all drinking milk.
I want to get rid of it.

146
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:08,098
- Pizza boy needs $122.50, plus tip.
-For pizza?

147
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,050
Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.

148
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,678
- You've got money.
-Traveler's checks.

149
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,980
Forget it, Frank. We have cash.

150
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,354
You probably got the checks
that don't work in France.

151
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,482
Did anyone order me a plain cheese?

152
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,813
Yeah. But if you want any...

153
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,318
...somebody's gonna have to barf it up
because it's gone.

154
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,409
Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi.

155
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,209
Kev! Kev, get a plate.

156
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,017
- Passports!
-Watch it!

157
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,936
No, no. Get these passports
out of here.

158
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,364
Are you okay, honey? Come here.
Are you all right?

159
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,282
What is the matter?

160
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,236
He started it!
He ate my pizza on purpose.

161
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,492
He knows I hate sausage and olives--

162
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,165
Look what you did, you little jerk!

163
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,096
Get upstairs now.

164
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,303
Why?

165
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,180
You're such a disease.

166
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,769
- Shut up!
-Kevin, upstairs!

167
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,143
- Say good night, Kevin.
-"Good night, Kevin."

168
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,977
Why do I get treated like scum?

169
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,779
I'm sorry. This house is just crazy.

170
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,240
We've got all these extra kids
running around.

171
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,489
My brother's in from Ohio.
It's nuts.

172
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,238
How come you didn't bring
more cheese pizzas?

173
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,495
- Nice tip. Thanks.
-Thanks.

174
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,910
Having a reunion?

175
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:04,422
My husband's brother transferred
to Paris. His kids are still here.

176
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,292
He missed the family,
so he invited us to Paris...

177
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,672
...so we'll be together.

178
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,468
- You're taking a trip to Paris?
-Yes, we leave tomorrow morning.

179
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,849
Excellent. Excellent.

180
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,098
If you'll excuse me,
this one's a little out of sorts.

181
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,022
Don't worry about me.
I spoke to your husband.

182
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:26,062
And don't worry about your home.
It's in good hands.

183
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:32,117
Fifteen people in this house,
and only you have to make trouble.

184
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,694
I'm getting dumped on.

185
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,696
You're the only one acting up.
Now get upstairs.

186
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,244
I am upstairs, dummy!

187
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,622
The third floor?

188
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,999
- Go.
-it's scary up there.

189
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,081
Fuller'll be up in a while.

190
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,338
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.
He wets the bed.

191
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,761
He'll pee all over me. I know it.

192
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,755
We'll put him somewhere else.

193
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,391
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,014
It's too late. Get upstairs.

195
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,103
Everyone in this family hates me!

196
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,480
Then ask Santa for a new family.

197
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,154
I don't want a new family.
I don't want any family. Families suck!

198
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,484
Stay up there. I don't want
to see you again tonight.

199
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,194
I don't want to see you
for the rest of my life.

200
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,871
I don't want to see
anybody else either.

201
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,081
I hope you don't mean that.

202
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:25,170
You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up
and didn't have a family.

203
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,380
No, I wouldn't.

204
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,174
Then say it again. Maybe it'll happen.

205
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,595
I hope I never see
any of you jerks again!

206
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,444
<i>I wish they would all just disappear.</i>

207
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,679
- Where are they?
-I don't know. She said 8 sharp.

208
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,605
Peter!

209
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,480
- We slept in!
-We slept in!

210
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,205
Hi, I'm Mitch Murphy.
I live across the street.

211
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,210
You guys going out of town?

212
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,799
We're going to Florida.

213
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,629
Well, first we're going to Missouri
to pick up my grandma.

214
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,339
You know the McCallisters
are going to France?

215
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,924
Do you know if it's cold?

216
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,729
- Do these vans get good mileage?
-Kid, I don't know. Hit the road!

217
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,644
Do a head count.
Get everyone in the vans.

218
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,068
Where are the passports?

219
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,188
I put them in the microwave to dry.

220
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:01,193
How fast does this go?
Does it have automatic transmission?

221
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,199
Does it have 4-wheel drive?

222
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,283
Look, I told you before, kid.
Don't bother me. Now, beat it!

223
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,966
Line up in front of the van.

224
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,891
Line up and shut up!

225
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,810
Shut up! I gotta take a head count.

226
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,391
One, two, three--

227
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,973
Eleven, 92, 12...

228
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,559
Buzz, don't be a moron.

229
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,688
Six, seven, eight...

230
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,489
...nine,10,11.

231
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,528
Okay, half in this van,
half in this one. Let's go.

232
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,494
Have a good trip.
Bring me back something French.

233
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:55,042
There's no way we'll make this plane.
it leaves in 45 minutes.

234
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,498
Think positive!

235
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,629
You be positive. I'll be realistic.

236
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,386
Ma'am. Ma'am.
Excuse me, your power is fixed...

237
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:06,217
...but the phones are a mess.
It'll take a couple of days to fix.

238
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,805
- Especially around the holidays.
-Thanks.

239
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,353
Did you count heads?

240
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,354
Eleven, including me.

241
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:17,152
Five boys, six girls, four parents, two
drivers, and a partridge in a pear tree.

242
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,313
Hold the plane!

243
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,437
- Did we miss it?
-You just made it.

244
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,313
Single seats only in coach.
Take whatever's free.

245
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,278
I get a window seat!

246
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,906
- Kids are in coach, we're first class.
-Seats Four A and B.

247
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,582
Four A and B. I'll take your coats.

248
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,211
- Fasten your seat belts.
-Champagne, please.

249
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,539
- It's free, isn't it?
-Oh, yes.

250
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,582
We made it.

251
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,546
Do you believe it?
Hope we didn't forget anything.

252
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,551
Mom?

253
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,888
Thank you.

254
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,437
- That's real. That's real crystal.
-Yeah, so?

255
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,562
- Put them in your purse.
-Frank, I can't do that.

256
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,519
Just-- Put them in your purse!

257
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,397
Yeah. Fill <i>n</i> up. Fill it up.

258
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:08,948
Fill it up, please.

259
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:10,900
Thank you.

260
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,662
Don't you feel like a heel,
flying first <i>class</i> with the kids in coach?

261
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,247
No. The kids are fine.

262
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:20,748
The only time I ever flew as a kid was
in the station wagon, not to France.

263
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,914
We had to go to Aunt Laura
and Uncle Arthur's.

264
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,292
Kids are okay. They're having
the time of their lives.

265
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,010
Hello?

266
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,930
Mom?

267
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,767
Dad?

268
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,600
Mom? Dad?

269
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,524
Where are you guys?

270
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,814
Buzz?

271
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,238
Buzz?

272
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,615
Buzz?

273
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,245
Megan?

274
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,122
Hello?

275
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,833
Hello?

276
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,296
Rod?

277
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,969
Uncle Frank?

278
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,847
Uncle Frank, is this a joke?

279
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,560
Megan? Linnie?

280
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,894
Is this a joke?

281
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,290
It's only my imagination.

282
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,500
Only my imagination.

283
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,063
The cars are still here.
They didn't go to the airport!

284
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,584
I made my family disappear.

285
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,800
<i>You're completely helpless.</i>

286
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:41,847
<i>You know, Kevin, you're what
the French call les incompetents.</i>

287
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,062
<i>Kevin, I'm going to feed you
to my tarantula.</i>

288
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,065
<i>Kevin, you are such a disease.</i>

289
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:53,237
<i>There are 15 people, and you're
the only one who has to make trouble.</i>

290
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:57,066
<i>Look what you did, you little jerk!</i>

291
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:04,206
I made my family disappear.

292
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,097
I'm free!

293
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,412
No clothes on anybody. Sickening!

294
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,950
Cool! Firecrackers!
I'll save these for later.

295
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,128
Buzz, I'm going through
all your private stuff.

296
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,919
You better come out and pound me!

297
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,967
Buzz, your girlfriend! Woof!

298
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,347
<i>Who is it?</i>

299
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,896
<i>It's me, Snakes. I got the stuff.</i>

300
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,940
<i>Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell out.</i>

301
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,285
<i>All right, Johnny,
but what about my money?</i>

302
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:05,532
<i>What money?</i>

303
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,989
<i>A.C. said you had some dough for me.</i>

304
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:11,121
<i>Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?</i>

305
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,248
<i>A.C. said 10 percent.</i>

306
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,880
<i>Too bad A.C. ain't in charge no more.</i>

307
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:20,046
Guys, I'm eating junk
and watching rubbish!

308
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,799
You better come out and stop me!

309
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,131
<i>He'll call you when he gets out.</i>

310
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,051
<i>HEY-</i>

311
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,302
<i>I'll tell you what I'll give you.</i>

312
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,227
<i>I'm gonna give you
to the count of 10...</i>

313
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,230
<i>...to get your ugly, yellgwm</i>

314
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,607
<i>...no-good keister off my property...</i>

315
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,814
<i>...before I pump your guts
full of lead.</i>

316
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,650
<i>All right, I'm sorry. I'm going.</i>

317
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,119
<i>One, two...10.</i>

318
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,762
<i>Keep the change, you filthy animal.</i>

319
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,015
Mom!

320
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,652
What's the matter?

321
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,276
Honey?

322
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:28,073
- I have a terrible feeling.
-About what?

323
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,288
That we didn't do something.

324
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,784
You feel that way
because we left in a hurry.

325
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,204
- We took care of everything.
-Did I turn off the coffee?

326
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:39,796
No.

327
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,081
I did.

328
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,712
Did you lock up?

329
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,301
Yeah.

330
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,005
Did you close the garage?

331
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,099
That's it.

332
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,723
I forgot to close the garage. That's it.

333
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,352
No, that's not it.

334
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,113
What else could we be forgetting?

335
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,073
Kevin!

336
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,953
The captain's doing all he can.
Your phones are out of order.

337
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,626
We'll call when we land.
I'm sure it's okay.

338
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,580
Horrible. Horrible.

339
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,211
Just horrible.

340
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,173
How could we do this? We forgot him.

341
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,675
We didn't forget him,
we just miscounted.

342
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,224
What kind of mother am I?

343
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,894
If it makes you feel any better,
I forgot my reading glasses.

344
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,478
Five families gone
on one block alone.

345
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,656
They all told me
from their own mouths.

346
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,399
It's almost too easy.

347
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:31,988
Check it out:

348
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,240
All the houses with nobody home...

349
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,288
...have automatic timers
on their lights.

350
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,956
But I got it all figured out.
Watch this.

351
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:47,129
Number 664 will be going on
right about...

352
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,710
<i>...n0w.</i>

353
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,679
Wait, wait, wait.

354
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,554
Number 672...

355
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,100
...right now.

356
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,523
Wait a minute.

357
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,686
671...

358
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:07,944
<i>...n0w.</i>

359
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,943
And that's the one, Marvin.
That's the silver tuna.

360
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,660
It's very G.

361
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,743
Very G, huh? It's loaded.

362
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,200
It's got lots of top-flight goods.

363
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,750
- Stereos, VCRs--
-Toys?

364
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,547
Probably looking at
some very fine jewelry.

365
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,333
Possible cash horde.

366
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,586
Odd marketable securities.

367
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,551
Who knows? It's a gem.

368
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,308
Grab your crowbar.

369
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,974
Crowbars up.

370
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,700
Which way?

371
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,207
We'll go around back,
down the basement.

372
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,852
- You said they were gone.
-They were gonna leave today.

373
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,683
Let's get out of here.

374
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,480
We have to use the phone, please.

375
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,025
It's an emergency.
We really have to make a call.

376
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,728
Please! Our brother's home alone.

377
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,235
Give us the phone!

378
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,739
I'm sorry. Thank you.

379
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,659
I'm calling the police.
Book us a flight home.

380
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,739
Get change out of here.
Call everybody you know.

381
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:09,122
Here's my address book. You and Frank
call everyone on our street.

382
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,124
Maybe somebody can help us.

383
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:14,707
Hello? Hello?
Oh, she'll have to call you back.

384
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,975
This is ridiculous. Only a wimp
would be hiding under a bed.

385
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:29,180
And I can't be a wimp.
I'm the man of the house.

386
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,823
Hey, I'm not afraid anymore!

387
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,452
I said, I'm not afraid anymore!

388
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,786
Do you hear me?
I'm not afraid anymore.

389
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,693
Village police department.

390
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:24,281
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

391
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:29,581
<i>I'd like somebody to go there. Tell him
that we're coming home to get him.</i>

392
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,871
Okay, let me connect you
with Family Crisis Intervention.

393
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,376
<i>No, it's not a family crisis.</i>

394
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,912
Hold on.

395
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,209
Larry, can you pick up?
There's some hyper lady on hold.

396
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,803
- What line, Rose?
-Two.

397
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,840
Family Crisis Intervention,
Sergeant Balzak.

398
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,933
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

399
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:53,810
Has the child been involved in
violence with a drunk family member?

400
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,061
No!

401
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,851
Has he been involved
in a household accident?

402
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,232
I don't know. I hope not.

403
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:05,610
Has the child ingested any poison
or is an object lodged in his throat?

404
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,329
No, he's home alone! I'd like
somebody to go over to the house...

405
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,327
...and see if he's all right.

406
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:16,044
You want us to go to your house,
just to check on him.

407
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,336
Yes!

408
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,589
Let me connect you to the police.

409
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,257
They just transferred me.

410
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,589
- Rose! Hyper on 2.
-Hang on.

411
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,423
- Hold on, please.
-No, please don't hang up. Please!

412
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,508
Any luck?

413
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,096
No.

414
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,933
- I couldn't get anybody.
-Leslie?

415
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,435
Nothing but a bunch
of answering machines.

416
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,570
Somebody pick up. Pick up!

417
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,772
Oh, hi, ma'am. It's you again.

418
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:47,910
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone, and I--

419
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,909
We'll send a policeman over
to your house to check on your son.

420
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,859
There's no one home.
The house looks secure.

421
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,157
Tell them to count their kids again.

422
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,656
You can't bump somebody or ask or--?

423
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,703
There's no way I can do that.

424
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,998
Isn't there a way
if you ask somebody?

425
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,700
If you said it's an emergency--

426
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,160
I cannot ask them.

427
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,704
A policeman's going
over to the house.

428
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,836
Well, that's a relief.
Everything here is booked.

429
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,091
Nothing to Chicago?

430
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,507
There's nothing to Chicago,
New York, Nashville.

431
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,008
- What about a private plane?
-Sorry. We don't do that.

432
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:56,137
The only thing is a booking
for us on Friday morning.

433
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,847
Friday morn-- That's two days away.

434
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,776
The kids are exhausted and so are you.
There's nothing we can do.

435
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:07,982
I say we go over to Rob's, and
that way we can call the police again.

436
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:11,493
I'm not leaving here
unless it's on an airplane.

437
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,787
Madame, we are doing
everything we can.

438
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:18,000
If you want to stay at the airport,
maybe we can get you on standby.

439
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,120
It is a possibility
that a seat will open up.

440
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,669
- Is that okay?
-Yes. I'll wait.

441
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,639
- Bye. I'll miss you, honey.
-Bye.

442
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,387
Don't you get lost.

443
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,143
Goodbye.

444
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,000
I took a shower, washing every
body part with actual soap.

445
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,126
Including all my major crevices...

446
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,750
...between my toes
and in my belly button...

447
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,419
...which I never did before
but enjoyed.

448
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:13,013
I washed my hair with adult formula
shampoo and used cream rinse.

449
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,259
I can't find my toothbrush,
so I'll pick one up today.

450
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,603
Other than that, I'm in good shape.

451
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,482
All right! Buzz's life savings.

452
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,928
I thought the Murphys went to Florida.

453
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,243
You're one of the great
cat burglars of the world.

454
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,121
You think you can keep it
down a little in there?

455
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:09,539
<i>You've reached the Murphys.
Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

456
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:14,293
<i>This is Peter McCallister again.
We're in Paris at my brother's.</i>

457
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,967
<i>Let me give you the number here.
The country code is 33.</i>

458
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:23,143
<i>The area code is 14
and the number is 694-876--</i>

459
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,349
- Hey, Harry.
-Yeah?

460
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,439
That house we ran last night,
was that the McCallister's?

461
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,100
Yeah.

462
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,778
- Call <i>me</i> in Paris.
- You're right. They're gone.

463
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,740
- I knew they were.
-Silver tuna tonight.

464
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,212
How may I help you?

465
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:55,171
Is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

466
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,506
Well, I don't know.

467
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:02,011
- It doesn't say, hon.
-Can you please find out?

468
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,894
- Herb.
-Yeah?

469
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,349
I got a question here
about a toothbrush.

470
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:21,444
Do you know, is this brush approved
by the American Dental Association?

471
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,781
I don't know.

472
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,681
Oh, hon, you pay for that here.

473
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,639
Wait, you have to pay for that.

474
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,485
Son! Son! Hey!

475
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,404
Jimmy, stop that boy!

476
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:03,989
Hey!

477
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,070
Hey!

478
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,825
Shoplifter!

479
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,878
Hey! Hey, kid!

480
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,255
Come back here!

481
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,429
Stop it, will you?

482
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,092
Come here.

483
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,132
I'm a criminal.

484
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,169
What's so funny?

485
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,251
What's so funny?

486
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,873
Why are you laughing?

487
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,385
You did it again.

488
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,264
You left the water running.

489
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,596
Why do you do that?
I told you not to do it.

490
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,179
- It's our calling card.
-Calling card.

491
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,515
All the great ones leave their mark.

492
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,357
We're the Wet Bandits.

493
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,315
You're sick, you know?
You're really sick.

494
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,984
- I'm not sick.
-Yes, you are.

495
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,405
It's a sick thing to do.

496
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,039
- We don't need that.
-Don't tell me--

497
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,125
I can do it if I want to.

498
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,505
It's not sick. Hey, watch out!

499
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,139
Hey! Hey!

500
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,307
You gotta watch out for traffic.

501
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,598
- Sorry.
-Damn.

502
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,180
Santy don't visit
the funeral homes, buddy.

503
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,439
Okay. 0K3)'-

504
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,402
Merry Christmas.

505
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,913
What's the matter?

506
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,450
I don't like the way
that kid looked at me.

507
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,252
- Ever seen him before?
-I saw a hundred kids this week.

508
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,127
Let's see what house he goes into.

509
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,039
Why's he going faster?

510
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,375
I told you something's wrong.

511
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,577
He looked at me weird.
Why would he run?

512
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,490
Maybe he went in the church.

513
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,501
- I'm not going in there.
-Me neither.

514
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,628
Let's get out of here.

515
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:46,143
When those guys come back,
I'll be ready.

516
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,210
Did they come back?

517
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,511
From Paris?

518
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,500
We'll come back tomorrow.
Maybe they'll be gone.

519
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,004
We better go before
somebody sees us.

520
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,378
Look what I found in the kitchen.

521
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,748
Frank, those are for later.

522
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,967
Do you want a little shrimp, huh?

523
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,807
Do you speak English?

524
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,687
Well, is there--?

525
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,696
- Did you get anybody?
-I am looking for my son!

526
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,614
No, I can't find anybody.

527
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,910
They're all shopping.
Nobody's home for the holidays.

528
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,825
Never mind, forget it.

529
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:06,415
- This is so pointless.
-What?

530
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,876
We're here rotting in this apartment.

531
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,295
Kevin's at home.
Mom's at the airport.

532
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,256
- So?
-You're not worried about Kevin?

533
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:19,338
Why should I be? He acted like a jerk,
and now he caught it in the butt.

534
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:23,967
He's so little and helpless.
Don't you think he's flipped out?

535
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:27,270
The trout can use a couple of days
in the real world.

536
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,689
You're not worried
something might happen?

537
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:32,475
No. For three reasons:

538
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:37,359
A, I'm not that lucky.
Two, we have smoke detectors...

539
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:41,451
...and D, we live in the most boring
street in the United States...

540
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:46,030
...where nothing even remotely
dangerous will ever happen. Period.

541
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,187
<i>Who is it?</i>

542
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,569
It's Little Nero's. I have your pizza.

543
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,860
<i>Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell out.</i>

544
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,237
Okay.

545
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,028
What about the money?

546
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,906
<i>What money?</i>

547
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,371
Well, you have to pay
for your pizza, sir.

548
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,705
<i>Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?</i>

549
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,049
That'll be $11.80, sir.

550
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,101
<i>Keep the change, you filthy animal.</i>

551
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,763
- Cheapskate.
-Hey.

552
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,270
<i>I'm gonna give you
to the count of 10...</i>

553
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,852
<i>...to get your ugly, yellgwm</i>

554
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,196
<i>...no-good keister off my property...</i>

555
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,524
<i>...before I pump your guts full of lead.</i>

556
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,484
<i>One, two...10.</i>

557
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:36,816
A lovely cheese pizza, just for me.

558
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,612
<i>--To Dallas/Fort Worth.</i>

559
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,652
<i>American Airlines...</i>

560
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,948
So we have the $500,
the pocket translator...

561
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:50,496
...the two first-class seats,
that's an upgrade--

562
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:51,864
Is that a real Rolex?

563
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,914
- Do you think it is?
-No.

564
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:59,338
But who can tell? I also have a ring.

565
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,423
That is beautiful!

566
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:02,967
They're boarding.

567
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:06,804
She's offered us two first-class
tickets if we go Friday.

568
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:11,259
Plus a ring, a watch,
a pocket translator, $500 and--

569
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:12,764
The earrings.

570
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:16,807
She's got her own earrings.
A whole shoebox full of them.

571
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,607
- Come on, come on.
-No, but--

572
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,064
I'm desperate.

573
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:25,941
I'm begging you.
From a mother to a mother. Please!

574
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,786
- Oh, Ed.
-Please!

575
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,452
Oh, all right.

576
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,297
<i>"Dear Santa, I got a sister last year.</i>

577
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,423
<i>This year I'd rather have Clay-Doh."</i>

578
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,436
I didn't mean it.

579
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,814
If you come back, I'll never
be a pain in the butt again.

580
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,317
I promise. Good night.

581
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,421
Are those microwave dinners good?

582
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,795
- I don't know.
-I'll give them a whirl.

583
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,847
For the kids.

584
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,349
Hold on, I got a coupon for that.

585
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,560
It was in the paper this morning.

586
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,235
$19.83.

587
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,108
Okay.

588
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,617
Are you here by yourself?

589
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,704
Ma'am, I'm 8 years old.

590
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:27,171
You think I'd be here alone?
I don't think so.

591
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,963
Where's your mom?

592
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,757
- In the car.
-Where's your dad?

593
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,882
- He's at work.
-What about brothers and sisters?

594
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,463
I'm an only child.

595
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,057
- Where do you live?
-I can't tell you.

596
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:41,136
- Why not?
-Because you're a stranger.

597
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:23,052
<i>Hello, Kevin!</i>

598
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,765
Shut up!

599
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,572
I don't get it.

600
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,370
It looks like there's nobody's home.

601
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,585
Last night the place is jumping.

602
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,080
Something ain't right.

603
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,877
Go check it out.

604
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,054
NOW?

605
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:06,937
No, tomorrow, egghead!
Now! Go ahead.

606
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,436
U Now?"

607
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:28,909
Shit!

608
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,797
<i>Get the heH out of here.</i>

609
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:37,092
<i>All right, Johnny.
But what about my money?</i>

610
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,377
<i>What money?</i>

611
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,804
<i>A.C. said you had
some dough for me.</i>

612
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,883
<i>Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?</i>

613
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,889
<i>A.C. said 10 percent.</i>

614
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,638
<i>Too bad A.C. ain't in charge no more.</i>

615
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,019
<i>What do you mean?</i>

616
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,726
<i>He's upstairs, taking a bath.</i>

617
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,816
<i>He'll call you when he gets out.</i>

618
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:02,368
<i>Hey, I tell you what
I'm gonna give you, Snakes.</i>

619
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:06,288
<i>Snakes'?
-I'll give you to the count of 10...</i>

620
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,707
...to <i>get your ugly,
yellow, no-good...</i>

621
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,875
<i>mkeister off my property...</i>

622
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,120
<i>...before I pump your guts full of lead.</i>

623
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,998
<i>Al! right, Johnny. I'm sorry. I'm going.</i>

624
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,130
<i>One, two...10.</i>

625
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,323
<i>Keep the change, you filthy animal.</i>

626
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,200
What happened?

627
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,911
I don't know who,
but somebody got blown away.

628
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,410
Somebody beat us, they're in there.

629
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,751
Two of them.

630
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,588
There was arguing.
One blew the other one away.

631
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,381
- Who?
-I don't know.

632
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:04,304
I recognized one of their voices.
I heard that name "Snakes" before.

633
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:08,221
Snakes? Snakes. Snakes.
I don't know no Snakes.

634
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,679
Snakes. Let's get out of here.

635
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:15,308
Hold it. Hold it.

636
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,860
Let's wait and see who it is.
We work this neighborhood too.

637
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,693
Suppose the cops finger us for a job...

638
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:24,867
...and they ask us
about a murder in the area.

639
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:28,037
Won't it be nice to have
a face to go with it?

640
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:31,865
That's a good idea.

641
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,456
Of course it's a good idea. Snakes?

642
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,875
He sounded like a snake.

643
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,633
Everything's full.

644
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,339
Everything's full?

645
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,391
I'm very sorry,
but it is Christmas Eve.

646
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,932
What about another airline?

647
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,398
Nothing available.
May I help you get a hotel room?

648
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:04,152
- Tomorrow we can get you a flight.
-I can't wait that long.

649
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:08,653
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we're doing
absolutely everything we can.

650
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,876
I'm in your way. I'm sorry.
You've places to go.

651
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,454
Got a ticket there, good. Excuse me.

652
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:23,501
Look, I have been awake for almost
60 hours. I'm tired and I'm dirty.

653
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:28,051
I have been from Chicago to Paris,
to Dallas to-- Where am I?

654
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,094
Scranton.

655
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,931
I'm trying to get home
to my 8-year-old son.

656
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,263
Now you're telling me it's hopeless?

657
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,933
- I'm sorry.
-No. No way.

658
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,186
This is Christmas!
The season of perpetual hope.

659
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,023
If I have to get on
your runway and hitchhike...

660
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,275
...if it costs me everything I own...

661
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:51,327
...if I have to sell my soul
to the devil himself...

662
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,327
...I am going to get home to my son.

663
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,663
Ma'am, if there was anything--

664
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,461
Do it. Do anything.

665
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,584
- I can get you a hotel room.
-What?

666
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:05,877
Can you excuse us for a sec?
Can I see you for a second, please?

667
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,961
Excuse us.

668
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,470
You got a little bit of a dilemma.

669
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:15,097
We got a crisis ourselves.

670
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,930
Allow me to introduce myself.
Gus Polinski.

671
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,567
Polka King of the Midwest?

672
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,314
The Kenosha Kickers?

673
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:29,950
- Hi there.
-Hi.

674
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:34,196
That's okay. I thought
you might have recognized--

675
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:37,916
I had a few hits a few years ago.
That's why I just--

676
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,327
"Polka, Polka, Polka"?

677
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,123
No? "Twin Lakes Polka"?

678
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:49,178
"Yamahoozie Polka," a.k.a.
"Kiss Me Polka"? "Polka Twist"?

679
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,845
These are songs?

680
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,925
Yeah. Yeah, we--
Some fairly big hits for us.

681
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,972
You know, in the early '70s.

682
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,975
Yeah, we sold about
623 copies of that.

683
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:00,772
- In Chicago?
-No, Sheboygan.

684
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,645
Very big in Sheboygan.

685
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,351
Did you say you could help?

686
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:08,273
Anyway, I'm rambling on here.
Our flight was canceled...

687
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,860
...so we gotta drive. See the guy
in the yellow jacket over there?

688
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:16,493
He's gonna rent us a nice big van
to drive to Milwaukee.

689
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:20,041
Now, I heard you had some problems
getting to Chicago?

690
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,660
To see your kid?

691
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:25,881
My son. He--
We left, and he's there.

692
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,669
If you have to get to Chicago,
we'll gladly drive you.

693
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,970
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

694
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,885
- You'd give me a ride?
-Sure, why not?

695
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,592
You gotta get home.

696
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,804
- A ride to Chicago?
-Sure, it's Christmastime.

697
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,021
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

698
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:44,392
You don't mind
going with polka burns?

699
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,397
No, I'd love to.

700
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,418
Hey, Marv. Marv, Marv!

701
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,469
Look at this.

702
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:23,021
I think we're getting scammed
by a kindergartner.

703
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,629
Dad, can you come here
and help me?

704
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,761
Remember that kid
we saw the other day?

705
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,222
He lives here.

706
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,024
If the kid's here,
the parents got to be.

707
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,019
He's home alone.

708
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,404
What? You want to
come back tonight?

709
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:21,989
Even with the kid here?

710
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,367
I don't think that's a good idea.

711
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,293
That house is the reason
we worked this block.

712
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,788
Ever since I saw that house,
I wanted it.

713
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:32,173
Let's take it one step at a time.

714
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:36,925
We'll unload the van, get a bite
to eat, we'll come back about 9:00.

715
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:38,429
Nine o'clock.

716
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,927
This way it's dark.

717
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:43,226
Yeah, kids are scared of the dark.

718
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,100
You're afraid of the dark too.
You know you are.

719
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,940
No, I'm not.

720
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,017
- Yes, you are.
-Not, not, not.

721
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:52,398
You are so.

722
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,604
Mom, where are you?

723
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,579
Do you play?

724
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:14,591
Do you want to try?
Go ahead, try it. Try it!

725
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,413
- Excuse me.
-Yeah?

726
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,665
Hey, nice shoes.

727
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,618
Oh, thanks.

728
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,296
Is he still here?
It's really important that I see him.

729
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,459
He's getting in his car.
If you hurry, you can catch him.

730
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:03,181
How low! Giving Kriss Kringle
a parking ticket on Christmas Eve!

731
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,975
What's next, rabies shots
for the Easter Bunny?

732
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,678
Santa, hold on.

733
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,813
- Can I talk to you?
-Make it quick. Santa's running late.

734
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,444
I know you're not
the real Santa Claus.

735
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:20,406
What makes you say that?
Just out of curiosity.

736
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:24,111
- I'm old enough to know how it works.
-All right.

737
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,325
But I also know you work for him.

738
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:29,498
- I'd like you to give him a message.
-Shoot.

739
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:34,705
Kevin McCallister, 671 Lincoln Blvd.
Do you need the phone number?

740
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,290
No, that's all right.

741
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,416
This is extremely important.

742
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:43,672
Please tell him instead of presents,
I just want my family back.

743
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:48,640
No toys. Nothing but Peter, Kate,
Buzz, Megan, Linnie and Jeff.

744
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,891
And my aunt and my cousins.

745
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:54,232
And if he has time,
my Uncle Frank. Okay?

746
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,151
Okay.

747
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,317
- I'll see what I can do.
-Thanks.

748
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:05,073
Wait. My elf took the last of the
candy canes home to her boyfriend.

749
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,158
- That's okay.
-No, don't be silly.

750
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:10,241
Everybody who sees Santa
has gotta get something.

751
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:14,578
Here, hold out your little paw there.
There you go.

752
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:17,422
- Don't spoil your dinner.
-I won't.

753
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,253
Thanks.

754
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,061
Son of a--!

755
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,782
Merry Christmas.

756
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,576
May I sit down?

757
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,298
That's my granddaughter.

758
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,880
The little red-haired girl.

759
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:54,631
She's about your age. You know her?

760
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:55,923
No.

761
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,181
- You live next to me, don't you?
-Yeah.

762
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,935
You can say hello when you see me.
You don't have to be afraid.

763
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:08,903
There's a lot of things going around
about me, but none of it's true. Okay?

764
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:11,731
- You've been good this year?
-I think so.

765
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,741
You swear to it?

766
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:15,155
No.

767
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:19,998
Yeah. Well, this is the place to be
if you're feeling bad about yourself.

768
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:23,034
- It is?
-I think so.

769
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,836
- Are you feeling bad about yourself?
-No.

770
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:34,797
I've been kind of a pain lately.
I said some things I shouldn't have.

771
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:38,220
I really haven't been
too good this year.

772
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:39,888
Yeah.

773
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:43,305
I'm kind of upset
because I really like my family.

774
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:48,440
Even though sometimes I say I don't.
Sometimes I even think I don't.

775
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:51,479
- Do you get that?
-I think so.

776
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:54,782
How you feel about your family
is a complicated thing.

777
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,447
Especially with an older brother.

778
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,538
Deep down, you'll always love them.

779
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:05,039
But you can forget that you love them.
You can hurt them, they can hurt you.

780
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:07,666
And that's not just
because you're young.

781
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:12,091
You want to know the real
reason why I'm here?

782
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,543
Sure.

783
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:17,801
I came to hear my granddaughter sing.
I can't come hear her tonight.

784
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,473
You have plans?

785
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,725
No.

786
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,227
I'm not welcome.

787
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,228
At church?

788
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,565
You're always welcome at church.

789
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,859
I'm not welcome with my son.

790
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:35,065
Years back, before you and your family
moved on the block...

791
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,488
...I had an argument with my son.

792
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,323
How old is he?

793
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,199
He's grown up.

794
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:47,248
We lost our tempers, and I said
I didn't care to see him anymore.

795
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:52,090
He said the same, and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

796
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,502
If you miss him,
why don't you call him?

797
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:58,255
I'm afraid if I call,
he won't talk to me.

798
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,006
How do you know?

799
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:03,681
I don't know.
I'm just afraid he won't.

800
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,514
No offense, but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?

801
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,063
You can be old for a lot of things.

802
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:14,066
- You're never too old to be afraid.
-That's true.

803
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,193
I was afraid of our basement.

804
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:19,697
It's dark. There's weird stuff
down there, and it smells funny.

805
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:23,371
That sort of thing.
It's bothered me for years.

806
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:24,910
Basements are like that.

807
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,618
I made myself go down
to do some laundry...

808
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,954
...and I found out it's not so bad.

809
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:35,801
I worried about it, but if you
turn on the lights, it's no big deal.

810
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,130
What's your point?

811
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:40,338
My point is,
you should call your son.

812
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,050
- What if he won't talk to me?
-At least you'll know.

813
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:48,638
Then you could stop worrying about it.
You won't have to be afraid anymore.

814
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:54,357
No matter how mad I was, I'd talk to
my dad. Especially around the holidays.

815
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:57,696
I don't know.

816
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,821
Just give it a shot.
For your granddaughter anyway.

817
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:04,241
<i>I'm sure she misses you.</i>
And <i>the presents.</i>

818
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:06,289
I send her a check.

819
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,584
I wish my grandparents did that.
They always send me clothes.

820
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:13,629
Last year I got a sweater
with a bird knitted on it.

821
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:14,918
Oh, that's nice.

822
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,250
Not for a guy in the second grade.

823
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:20,086
You can get beat up
for wearing something like that.

824
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,510
I have a friend who got nailed...

825
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:26,593
...because there was a rumor
he wore dinosaur pajamas.

826
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:31,973
You better run home where you belong.
Think about what I said.

827
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,767
- All right?
-Okay.

828
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,731
It's nice talking to you.

829
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,646
Nice talking to you.

830
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:46,996
- What about you?
-Me?

831
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,157
Yeah. You and your son.

832
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:52,994
We'll see what happens.

833
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:55,539
Merry Christmas.

834
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:58,670
Merry Christmas.

835
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:54,181
This is my house. I have to defend it.

836
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:25,272
We'll check it out.
We can come back for the truck.

837
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,655
How do we go in?

838
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:38,205
We'll go to the back door.
Maybe he'll let us in.

839
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:41,788
Yeah, he's a kid. Kids are stupid.

840
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:47,802
Bless this nutritious, microwaveable
macaroni and cheese dinner...

841
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:50,801
...and the people
who sold it on sale. Amen.

842
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:18,537
This is it. Don't get scared now.

843
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:34,428
Merry Christmas, little fella.

844
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:40,017
We know that you're in there
and that you're all alone.

845
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,852
Yeah, come on, kid. Open up.

846
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,394
It's Santy Claus and his elf.

847
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,071
We won't hurt you.

848
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:54,156
No, no. Got some nice
presents for you.

849
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:58,160
Be a good little fella now
and open the door.

850
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,119
What?

851
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,957
What? What?

852
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:09,713
What?

853
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,378
- What happened?
-Get that little--

854
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,311
Hello.

855
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,399
Yes! Yes!

856
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:35,109
The little jerk is armed!

857
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:39,538
That's it! I'm going in the front.
You go down the basement!

858
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:44,103
That smart aleck!

859
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:16,900
Oh, boy. That's it, you little--
You little--

860
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:20,074
No, not this time, you little brat.

861
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:26,281
You little creep, where are you?

862
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,642
Yes!

863
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,179
--Rip his head off--!

864
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:38,481
You're dead, kid.

865
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:28,702
Where are you, you little creep?

866
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:47,637
Harry, I'm coming in!

867
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,349
Oh, no! I'm really scared.

868
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:58,395
It's too late for you, kid, we're
in the house. We're gonna get you.

869
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,734
Okay, come and get me!

870
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,227
Why, you--!

871
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:10,027
Now you're dead!

872
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:38,305
I'm gonna kill that kid!

873
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,493
- Marv.
-Harry?

874
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:57,574
Why'd you take your shoes off?

875
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,834
Why are you dressed like a chicken?

876
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:05,207
I'm up here, you morons.
Come and get me.

877
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:11,881
You guys give up,
or are you thirsty for more?

878
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,100
Heads up!

879
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:28,655
Don't worry, Marv.
I'll get him for you.

880
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,491
Yes!

881
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:41,330
He's only a kid, Harry.
We can take him.

882
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:44,588
Shut up, will you? What is it?

883
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,958
You're missing some teeth.

884
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:49,338
Where? It's my gold tooth.

885
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:52,513
My gold tooth. I'll kill him. I'll kill him!

886
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,059
You bomb me with
one more can, kid...

887
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:01,518
...and I'll snap off your cojones
and boil them in motor oil!

888
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,059
<i>911 emergency.</i>

889
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:08,111
Hello, my house is being robbed.

890
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:13,029
My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard.
My name is Murphy.

891
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:17,950
You never know what's there.

892
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,699
There he is!

893
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,294
I got you! I got him, Harry.

894
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:30,379
I got him.

895
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:32,798
Harry, give me a hand!

896
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,096
I got him!

897
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:39,601
Harry. help me. Get up!

898
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:42,436
I got him.

899
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:23,432
What are you doing?

900
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:26,856
Harry, don't move.

901
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:28,191
Marv?

902
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,777
Don't move.

903
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:32,816
What are you doing?

904
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:39,240
Did I get him?

905
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,072
Did I get him?

906
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:43,540
Where is it? Where is it?

907
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:47,370
Never mind that. Here!
How do you like it, huh? You jerk!

908
01:26:47,577 --> 01:26:50,456
Get that kid, before I--
Get that kid!

909
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:18,404
Where'd he go?

910
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,161
Maybe he committed suicide.

911
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:26,287
Down here, you big horse's ass!
Come get me before I call the police.

912
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,493
- Let's get him!
-Wait, wait.

913
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:30,579
It's just what he wants us to do:

914
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:33,882
Go back through his fun house
so we get all tore up.

915
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,629
He's gonna call the cops!

916
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:37,507
From a tree house?

917
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:38,879
Come on.

918
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:41,723
- Out the window?
-Yeah.

919
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:43,304
I'm not going out the window.

920
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:47,513
Why, you scared? Are you afraid?
Come on, get out here.

921
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:53,693
Come on.

922
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:01,193
Come on!

923
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:10,077
- Come on. Keep going.
-Let's go back, Harry.

924
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:16,799
Shut it, Marv.

925
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:21,300
Hey, guys!

926
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,177
Check this out.

927
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:25,975
Go back. Go back.

928
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:15,851
There he is!

929
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:18,111
Hey, I'm calling the cops!

930
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,857
Wait, wait!
He wants us to follow him.

931
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:24,030
I got a better idea. Come on.

932
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,260
Hi, pal.

933
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:46,924
We outsmarted you this time.
Get over here!

934
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:54,310
What are you gonna do?

935
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,771
I'll do exactly what he did to us.

936
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:58,818
Burn his head with a blowtorch.

937
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:01,021
I'll smash his face with an iron.

938
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:04,073
I'd like to slap him
in the face with a paint can!

939
01:30:04,274 --> 01:30:05,901
Shove a nail through his foot!

940
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:11,032
I'm gonna bite off every one of
these little fingers, one at a time.

941
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:22,710
Come on. Let's get you home.

942
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,409
Wow, this is great.

943
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:54,036
Nice move, leaving the water running.

944
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:58,086
Now we know each and every house
that you've hit.

945
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:04,213
We've been looking for you guys
for a long time.

946
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:07,338
Yeah. Well, remember,
we're the Wet Bandits.

947
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:11,717
- Wet Bandits, that's W-E-T--
-Shut up! Get in the car!

948
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:13,510
Hey, come on. Come on.

949
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,805
- Hands off the head, pal!
-Come on.

950
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:14,325
I'm a bad parent. I'm a bad parent.

951
01:32:14,571 --> 01:32:15,788
No, you're not.

952
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:18,450
You're beating yourself up there.
This happens.

953
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:20,376
These things happen.

954
01:32:20,577 --> 01:32:24,457
You want to talk about bad parents?
Look at us.

955
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:29,420
We're on the road 48, 49 weeks a year.
We hardly see our families.

956
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:32,381
Joe, over there. Gosh, you know...

957
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:35,433
...he forgets his kids' names
half the time.

958
01:32:35,633 --> 01:32:38,933
Ziggy over there,
he's never even met his kid.

959
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:42,934
Eddy... Let's just hope
none of them write a book about him.

960
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:47,563
Tell me, have you gone on vacation
and left your child home?

961
01:32:50,982 --> 01:32:52,359
No.

962
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:56,030
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.

963
01:32:56,863 --> 01:33:00,117
Yeah, it was terrible too.
I was all distraught and everything.

964
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:04,580
The wife and I, we left the little
tyke there in the funeral parlor.

965
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:08,504
All day. You know, we went
back at night, when we...

966
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:10,961
...came to our senses, there he was.

967
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:14,340
Apparently, he was there
all day with a corpse.

968
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:18,681
He was okay.
You know, after six, seven weeks.

969
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:21,354
He came around
and started talking again.

970
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:25,726
They get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.

971
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:27,652
We shouldn't talk about this.

972
01:33:27,894 --> 01:33:32,024
- I was just trying to cheer you up.
-I'm sorry I did.

973
01:33:58,299 --> 01:33:59,425
Mom?

974
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:05,894
Mom?

975
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:11,984
Mom?

976
01:34:58,318 --> 01:34:59,661
Kevin!

977
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:02,322
Kevin!

978
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:35,563
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

979
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:47,492
Oh, Kevin, I'm so sorry.

980
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:09,226
Where's everybody else?

981
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:11,933
Oh, baby, they couldn't come.

982
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:13,393
They wanted to so much--

983
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:18,072
I didn't fall asleep in the back
and drool all over you, did I?

984
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:20,617
- You do drool!
-Shut up!

985
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:27,074
Kevin, my boy. How are you?
It's good to see you.

986
01:36:27,282 --> 01:36:29,034
You're all right.

987
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:30,751
I love you. You okay?

988
01:36:32,412 --> 01:36:33,538
Hey, Kev.

989
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:38,547
It's cool that you didn't
burn the place down.

990
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:42,346
Thanks, Buzz.

991
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:46,050
Wait a minute.
How'd you guys get home?

992
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:48,762
On the morning flight
you didn't want to wait for.

993
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:52,224
- Oh, no. Thank you.
-Merry Christmas.

994
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:53,854
Merry Christmas.

995
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:56,569
Someone has to find an open store.

996
01:36:56,769 --> 01:36:58,396
I went shopping yesterday.

997
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:02,612
You, shopping?

998
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,619
I got some milk, eggs
and fabric softener.

999
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,449
- What?
-No kidding?

1000
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:11,375
What a funny guy.

1001
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:13,704
What else did you do
while we were away?

1002
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:17,124
Just hung around.

1003
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:20,676
Bring your stuff upstairs.

1004
01:37:20,877 --> 01:37:25,428
Shopping? He doesn't know how
to tie his shoe. He's going shopping?

1005
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:28,639
This is not the Kevin I knew.

1006
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:53,788
Honey, what's this?

1007
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:55,685
Kevin! What did you do to my room?

1008
01:42:34,857 --> 01:42:36,859
