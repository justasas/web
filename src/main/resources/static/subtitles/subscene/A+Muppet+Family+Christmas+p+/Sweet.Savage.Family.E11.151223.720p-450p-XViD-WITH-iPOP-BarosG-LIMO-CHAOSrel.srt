<i>[Episode 11]</i>
Tae Soo, are you okay?

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,170
- We're over here!
- Save us, Officer Seo!

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,440
Over here!

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,230
- Officer Seo!
- Over here! Over here!

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,770
Don't move.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,690
There are real bullets in my gun.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,270
Thank you so much for coming, Bro!

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,350
I texted him earlier.
I told him to track us down with the GPS.

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,880
Good job! You did a good job, Tae Soo!

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,180
Are you okay?

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,330
Yes, Bro!

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,600
How about you, Director Baek?

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,790
I'm fine, I'm fine!

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,120
What were you even doing?

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,880
They're still saying that they're fine.

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,410
Bro!

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,990
What the heck are you doing?
You're a police officer!

18
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,070
I told you yesterday,
when I bought you farewell drinks.

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,270
Life is about making it,
or not making it.

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,260
If you're unlucky, things get
taken away from you.

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,690
Bro!

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,600
Oh my, oh my!

23
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,330
I forgot to introduce him.

24
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,290
My savior, Officer Seo Chul Joong!

25
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,970
I did what I had to do.

26
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,320
As a policeman,
I had to save a dying man.

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,700
What does that mean?

28
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,610
You killed me.

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,550
You buried me.

30
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,960
When I woke up,
I couldn't move my body.

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,710
I thought to myself,
"I'm going to die here."

32
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,460
But then, Officer Seo appeared!
And he saved me!

33
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,900
I went to the mountains.
I saw something moving in the ground.

34
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,440
So I started to dig into the ground.

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,790
The shaman from Miari was right.

36
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,270
If she hadn't told me that
I should dig with my front paws

37
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,090
I wouldn't have done that.

38
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,310
I love you, Mother.

39
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,950
What is it that you want?

40
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,310
You're asking that again?
How many times have I told you?

41
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,350
I want to take your life!

42
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,510
If they get annoying, just use this.

43
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,560
What?

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,940
It's quick and easy.

46
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,110
Which one should I shoot first? Huh?

47
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,460
You?

48
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,130
You?

49
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,110
Now, on to the final round.

50
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,890
This time, we'll do freestyle acting.

51
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,190
Wait.

52
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,160
Since it's the final,
let's make it a bit more difficult.

53
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,620
A comet is on its way to Earth.

54
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,280
It will collide with the Earth
in five minutes.

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,070
Everyone is about to die.

56
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,030
Now, you're going to say
your farewell before you die.

57
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,080
What will you say,
and to whom will you say it?

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,310
Let's start with Lee Do Kyung.

59
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,810
You don't have much time.

60
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,420
The comet will hit Earth in five minutes.
Now, cue!

61
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,670
My dear daughter, Hyun Jee.

62
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,930
Thank you so much for being my daughter.

63
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,910
I...

64
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,360
I will only cherish good memories of you.

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,580
<i>I will protect you from Heaven...</i>

66
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,920
<i>so that you won't have to cry again.</i>

67
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,140
<i>You wanted a happy family so badly.</i>

68
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,820
And I really wanted
to make that happen for you.

69
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,750
I am so sorry for not
being able to do that for you.

70
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,500
Hyun Jee!

71
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,650
I am so sorry.

72
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,730
Mommy...

73
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,180
Mommy...

74
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,840
Mommy loves you so much.

75
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,430
Honey.

76
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,210
Sung Min's dad...

77
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,150
They say I'll die in five minutes.

78
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,820
Well... I'm glad.

79
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,770
Finally, I don't have to be
a gangster's wife anymore.

80
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,090
<i>I'll make this short,
since there isn't much time.</i>

81
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,990
Sung Min and Soo Min...

82
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,900
If you raise them as if
they didn't have a mom

83
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,410
you know what I'll do to you, right?

84
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,460
Let your mother be sometimes, too.

85
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,730
About you and me...

86
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,420
I do not want to meet you
in our next lives.

87
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,350
"Let's have a happier life
in our next lives."

88
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,870
That's something only those who
didn't try hard enough would say.

89
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,450
But we did our best.

90
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,620
You and I did.

91
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,670
Yoon Tae Soo...

92
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,210
You are the best.

93
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,180
<i>You are the best husband.
You are the best father.</i>

94
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,120
If I could wish for only one thing...

95
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,470
I would wish that in our next lives

96
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,830
we would be born with
golden spoons in our mouths.

97
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,090
I mean it.

98
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,710
Okay. Now...

99
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,630
I will announce the winner.

100
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,620
The winner is...

101
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,890
<i>Dad, save me...</i>

102
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,200
Oh, hello, Mr. Chairman!

103
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,630
This is Son Se Woon.

104
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,790
Who?

105
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,390
It's Son Se Woon,
the CEO of the movie production company.

106
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,260
You invested
three billion won into my movie.

107
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,440
What? How did you...

108
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,730
Oh...

109
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,060
You must be surprised that I'm alive.

110
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,140
Everyone is surprised.

111
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,140
I can give you more details later.

112
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,220
You saw the photos I sent you, right?

113
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,240
Don't you think

114
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,400
those photos are worth as much
as you invested in the movie?

115
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,190
Are you threatening me
with my son's life?

116
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,680
How did you figure that out?
You're a quick one.

117
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,320
I think I deserve the right to do this,
since I almost died.

118
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,150
Your son...

119
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,400
He's still too young to accompany
me into the Underworld.

120
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,810
You can keep him!

121
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,880
Hello?

122
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,560
What did he say?

123
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,270
Ha!

124
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,990
Suddenly...

125
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,660
I'm thirsty!

126
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,200
Well...

127
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,710
Let me have a sip.

128
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,790
Let me have a sip too.

129
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,220
Oh, okay.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,360
Wait.

131
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,130
It's not fun if you just give it to them.

132
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,870
Give me that.

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,520
Which one should I give water to first?

134
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,680
How about here?

135
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,460
Here? Here?

136
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,630
Here?
How about the middle?

137
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,500
Oh, you got it.

138
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,880
You guys are so inconsiderate.

139
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,430
That's why you're both losers, gosh.

140
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,280
That was all we had.

141
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,340
Keep eating, please.

142
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,960
You're sure that I won the role?

143
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,990
It's not a mistake, right?

144
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,790
I can't believe this is really happening.

145
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,750
I know how you feel.
Congratulations.

146
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,220
Thank you so much!
Thank you. Thank you!

147
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,850
You don't need to thank me.

148
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,200
Everyone was horrible.
So I picked the least horrible one.

149
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,250
From now on,
you need to do a good job.

150
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,900
I see.

151
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,120
I have a question.

152
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,560
- I forgot.
- You know.

153
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,570
Oh, in the emotional scene...

154
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,550
Everyone tried very hard to shed tears.

155
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,650
But you didn't shed a tear.
Are you a bit dry?

156
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,130
I guess I am.

157
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,180
I'd prefer to laugh until I die.

158
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,720
Because I have already shed
too many tears in my lifetime.

159
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,610
Yes, I picked the right one!

160
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,370
She's definitely an unfortunate woman.

161
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,080
What? An unfortunate woman?

162
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,520
Yes, an unfortunate woman.

163
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,310
The best actors are those who have
had many hardships in their lives.

164
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,060
It's like... through hardships,
they head for the stars!

165
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,080
For the stars.

166
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,930
Huh? Stars?

167
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,120
Anyway, I'm proud of myself
for finding a treasure!

168
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,230
I'll give you a big hug.

169
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,010
No, thanks.

170
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,640
You will regret...

171
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,490
- I'll just regret it then.
- She's stubborn! I love that!

172
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,740
Anyway, can you invest in my movie?

173
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,210
I'm William.

174
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,000
William. William.
William, William... okay?

175
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,200
I need to go to a sauna.
I need to sober up.

176
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,290
Then let's drink at the sauna.

177
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,420
Okay.

178
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,010
Mr. Chairman.

179
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,330
I'll just go to the police
station with your son.

180
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,580
Well...

181
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,040
If you sin, you should
receive punishment, right?

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,390
You can see your son's face
when it's all over the newspapers.

183
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,190
I kind of think you'll just
give me a lot of money.

184
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,220
Oh, I almost forgot. Mr. Chairman!

185
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:26,380
Eat good food and live a long life, okay?

186
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,820
Live long enough to see
your son coming out of prison.

187
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,150
I'm busy, so I'm going to hang up...

188
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,510
Pardon me?

189
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,130
Excuse me...

190
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,290
Do you have more to say?

191
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,870
Then do that.

192
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,940
He has a burner phone,
so it's hard to track him down.

193
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,190
What should we do?

194
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,710
Send the money.

195
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,720
Wow, the chairman is a big man!

196
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,710
He sent the money right away.

197
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,920
Really?
Then is it over now?

198
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Yes, Officer Seo.
You worked hard.

199
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,920
Wow, did you save the country
in your previous life?

200
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,600
You're so lucky that
you have a rich father.

201
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,630
You! You think I'll just let you be?

202
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,420
If you want to.

203
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,420
Don't do that, don't do that.
Don't do that!

204
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,670
It hurts, right?

205
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,890
I said stop!

206
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,040
Do you want to try?
It's kind of fun.

207
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,790
Tae Soo.

208
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,780
Bro, why are you doing something
that you're going to regret later?

209
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,610
I think I'll regret it if I don't.

210
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,920
It hurts. Stop.

211
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,330
I know what we're doing is bad.

212
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,880
But Chairman Baek isn't someone
that you want to hang out with!

213
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,710
I'll send my last gift to you.
So think it through.

214
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,520
Let's go.

215
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,450
There's a good soup spot nearby.
Should we go?

216
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,250
Of course!

217
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,410
<i>I should go back!</i>

218
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:52,780
<i>This place isn't good for me!</i>

219
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,030
<i>In the lavish temptations.</i>

220
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,780
<i>I stand, smiling.</i>

221
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,880
<i>But everything feels unfamiliar.</i>

222
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,510
<i>You always choose</i>

223
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,130
<i>between the two.</i>

224
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,270
<i>You will lose everything here.</i>

225
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,710
Geez.

226
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,490
Now you're acting as an idiotic duo?

227
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,660
Say something with that mouth of yours!

228
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,280
Why didn't you just let me die?

229
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,320
What?

230
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Gi Bum!

231
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,500
You were going to spend the money anyway.
Why did you take so long?

232
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,580
You have no idea what he did to me.

233
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,630
That bastard!

234
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,510
I'll kill him when I catch him.

235
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,250
Wait and see.

236
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,100
Look at him!

237
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,640
The arrogance...

238
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,980
I... I am very sorry.

239
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,350
It all happened so quickly.

240
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,880
Do you think that
you and Gi Bum are equals?

241
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,130
Pardon me?

242
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,770
Do you think that you're actually my son?

243
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,570
Well... Mr. Chairman.

244
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,720
Why do you think I had you stay close
to Gi Bum all of these years?

245
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,290
So you could be a duo
and have fun together?

246
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,570
I did that so you could calm
him when he lost control.

247
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,420
Save him when he's drowning.

248
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,690
And take beatings for him.

249
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,860
That's why I took care of you
and supported you.

250
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,730
Tae Soo.

251
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,620
You are the one who introduced Son to me.

252
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,530
And you are the one who maintained
a close relationship with Officer Seo.

253
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,970
Don't you think this is a bit strange?

254
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,500
Mr. Chairman.

255
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,420
Geez.

256
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,860
<i>Do you think that
you and Gi Bum are equals?</i>

257
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,630
<i>I had you stay close to Gi Bum.</i>

258
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,600
<i>I did that so you could calm
him when he lost control.</i>

259
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,230
<i>Save him if he's drowning.
And take beatings for him.</i>

260
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,750
<i>That's why I took care of you.</i>

261
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,520
But Chairman Baek isn't someone
that you want to hang out with!

262
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,350
I will send my last gift to you.
So think it through.

263
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,370
<i>[OFFICER SEO]</i>

264
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,920
<i>Let's talk.</i>

265
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,160
Do you have more to say?

266
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,360
I only have half the money.
So save just one of them.

267
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,890
You'd like to only save your son?

268
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,270
Then what about Yoon Tae Soo?

269
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,280
He's the one who buried you.

270
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,710
Regardless, no one
would say anything.

271
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,450
You said you had all the evidence.

272
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,700
If you take care of everything
regarding my son with the police

273
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,130
I'll send you more money.

274
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,810
Oh...

275
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,070
I thought he was your adopted son.

276
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,280
What adopted son?

277
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,750
It would be better if he didn't exist.

278
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,410
I'm cleaning all kinds of messes for him,
but he doesn't even thank me.

279
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,550
<i>His wife is even a bigger joke.</i>

280
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,640
Mom, can't you just be the protagonist?

281
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,920
You only won a supporting role.

282
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,750
Not anyone can be a protagonist.

283
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,420
You mom did very well for a rookie!

284
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,570
Congratulations, Mom!

285
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,640
Thanks.

286
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,000
Wow, I never knew that
my daughter-in-law was so talented!

287
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,150
I'll buy you a nice outfit.
Just wait and see.

288
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,810
You have no money.

289
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,830
I have money. I have a lot.

290
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,130
Then buy me one! I would love that.

291
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,830
It's really great that
I've become an actress!

292
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,260
I get nice gifts from my mother-in-law.

293
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,080
Geez!

294
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,160
Dad!

295
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,710
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

296
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,500
Mom won a role. She'll be in the movie!

297
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,680
What?

298
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,910
Mom, I'm a bit tired.
I'm going to go rest.

299
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,970
Why is he acting like that
when his wife just did so well?

300
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,860
Please eat some cake.
I'll go check on him.

301
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,320
Go ahead.

302
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,490
Honey.

303
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,400
Aren't you going to congratulate me
on winning the role?

304
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,580
Aren't you curious what role I got?

305
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,370
There was an amazing twist at the end.

306
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,340
You're being pathetic.
How much longer will you be like this?

307
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,650
I got it. Please stop.

308
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,250
It's not because of you.

309
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,970
Then what's wrong?

310
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,880
Your phone was turned off all day.

311
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,030
I'm really tired.

312
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,440
Let's talk later.

313
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,060
Honey.

314
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,140
I want you to know one thing.

315
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,780
I'm not doing this because I wanted
to be an actress or be in this movie.

316
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,560
I don't know how much help
I can actually give you.

317
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:04,050
But I'm proud of myself because I feel
like I can relieve your burden a bit.

318
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,390
I'll get your bath ready.
Soak yourself in hot water before bed.

319
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,610
You smell sweaty.

320
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,570
William? Whoever that is...

321
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,250
Because of that strange man,
everything is ruined.

322
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,280
Even our sweet director
was swayed by him.

323
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,100
It's my fault.

324
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,230
You did your best to support me.

325
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,020
But my acting wasn't good enough.

326
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,630
I thought that I did my best.

327
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,790
Oh...

328
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,870
There's no point in saying that now.

329
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,050
I never thought I would
need to use this card.

330
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,020
But I think it's time
to implement Plan B.

331
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,860
Plan B?

332
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,230
How are you?

333
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,360
Director Bong, did you
really write this script?

334
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,410
What happened to the story?

335
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,850
Well, that's... because of Writer Oh...

336
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,060
Are you blaming your writer now?

337
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,750
Aren't you the director here?

338
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,490
I know. I'm really confused these days.

339
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,070
You either fix the script,
or find a different actress.

340
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,390
I can't let my wife act out
this kind of crazy character.

341
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,420
And not because she's my wife.

342
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,710
No one should act out this
kind of wretched character.

343
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,290
Don't you want to make a movie?

344
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,080
Tae Soo, you can't do that.

345
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,780
What do you mean?

346
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,780
Eun Ok has to be in the movie.

347
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,650
Eun Sil, do you really want your
sister to do this kind of stuff?

348
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,470
Of course I don't like it!

349
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,040
But...

350
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,610
She has a reason.

351
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,360
What reason?

352
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,100
Please don't ask me that.

353
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,300
Please!

354
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,690
She'll kill me if I tell you this.

355
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,630
I won the role, just like you asked me.

356
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,930
Good job, good job!

357
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,130
I knew you would be amazing!

358
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,550
I told you.

359
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,350
You would be better than
someone who has acted before.

360
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,810
You're being kind.

361
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,130
Since you got the role,
you should perform well.

362
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,500
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

363
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,710
And... about what you promised last time.

364
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,880
I hope you'll keep your promise.

365
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,020
Huh?

366
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,130
I mean the title to the house.

367
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,530
Oh, that!

368
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,880
Of course I should keep my promise.

369
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
After the movie is finished

370
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,300
I'll give that to you.

371
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,340
After it's finished?

372
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,390
Well, do you win a marathon medal
when you start running a race?

373
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,210
Mr. Chairman...

374
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,430
Eun Ok.

375
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,230
In reality, I should have
sent you an invoice.

376
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,730
Tae Soo got kidnapped by
Mr. Son, like an idiot.

377
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,240
I paid a ransom and saved him.

378
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,020
What? Mr. Son did?

379
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,260
He's the worst kind of swindler!

380
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,010
This time, I'll let it go for you.

381
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,560
Don't worry. Just do what I say.

382
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,800
Then you will get what you want.

383
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,510
Get up.

384
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,300
- I said get up!
- Honey!

385
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,940
What the heck are you doing?

386
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,770
Mr. Chairman.

387
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,180
Is it true that you had her audition,
using the title to the house as bait?

388
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,940
Is it true that you pushed her,
so you could ruin Lee Do Kyung's life?

389
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,760
- Tae Soo!
- I...

390
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,780
It's true, I'm your dog.

391
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,050
I bark, I bite, as you say.

392
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,180
I don't know when I'll be killed,
but I always wag my tail.

393
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,160
I became your dog...

394
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,960
So that my family could
live like human beings.

395
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,080
Mr. Chairman,
you can keep me as your dog.

396
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,150
But leave my wife alone!

397
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,300
Let's go.

398
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,560
Let go of my hand! It hurts!

399
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,810
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

400
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:24,860
Are you insane?

401
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,360
I was insane, and now I'm back to normal.

402
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,180
- Huh?
- Finally!

403
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,100
I see yellow as yellow and red as red!

404
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,310
I got it. But what happened with Mr. Son?

405
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,350
I thought everything was
taken care of that night.

406
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,100
You should have told me what happened!

407
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,290
What about you? You went along
with that old man's scheme?

408
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,780
Did you really have to crush your friend?

409
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,340
What about me?

410
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,970
Don't say it like that!

411
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,750
Would I do that, just because I hate her?

412
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,060
I was just that desperate.

413
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,290
Yes, I got greedy.

414
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,490
If I was capable of being a mean person,
just this once

415
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,530
he would give me a house that I could
never dream of buying on my own.

416
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,630
Eun Ok!

417
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,050
You said you didn't want
to live like a dog.

418
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:17,180
But if you are a dog...

419
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,920
Then I am a dog too.

420
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,440
Where's the owner?

421
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,210
Did he go out to play?

422
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,930
Please let me pass you.

423
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,570
Hey, Number One!

424
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,760
- Oh, Bro!
- Yeah.

425
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,280
Wait. Let me get the burner first.

426
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,540
Okay, go ahead.

427
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,030
- Have you been well?
- Yes, how are you?

428
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,390
It's always the same for me.

429
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,730
Excuse me. Two orders of pork, please.

430
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,060
Two orders? Coming right up!

431
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,890
Bro, did you come alone?

432
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,810
I didn't come to eat.

433
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,950
I was passing by, so I came to say hello.

434
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,240
I see.

435
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,190
Can we have the check, please?

436
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,530
Okay!

437
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,740
I'm sorry, but can you set
that table over there?

438
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,700
Huh? Okay.

439
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,380
- Bye!
- Thank you!

440
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,640
Where are your servers?
Why are you working alone?

441
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,990
This time of day, I work alone.
I have part-timers for when it gets busy.

442
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,670
You have no workers?

443
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,280
I have no money.
It costs a lot to hire help.

444
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,930
By the way... how much does it cost
to start a restaurant like this?

445
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,380
Why? Are you interested?

446
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,870
Oh... I was just curious.

447
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,130
About 300 million won,
after the rent deposit.

448
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,300
300 million won?

449
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,160
Hey, Number Two!

450
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,480
Huh? Brother Tae Soo!

451
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,870
Wait one second.

452
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,400
What happened to your foot?
Are you hurt?

453
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,920
I tripped yesterday while
I was out on a delivery.

454
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,390
Did you go see a doctor?

455
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:16,340
Making a living is hard enough.
How could I afford that?

456
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,180
I have to save up
so I can pay the rent, at least.

457
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,060
Stay right here.
I'll be right back.

458
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,860
Oh... okay, okay.

459
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,980
I want some pastries.

460
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,220
Sure!

461
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,330
Huh?

462
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,630
Hey!

463
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,890
You're Number Three!

464
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,760
Right! Tae Soo!

465
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,820
You used to live next door!

466
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,480
That's right!

467
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,820
What are you doing here?

468
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,770
You used to work at a bank in Seoul.
Why are you doing this?

469
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,780
I retired a long time ago.

470
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,170
I lost all my stocks. So here I am.

471
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,470
I see.

472
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,490
Do Number One and Number Two
know you came back?

473
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,330
Don't tell them!

474
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,360
I'm sure they're having a hard time too.

475
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,990
I see.

476
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,220
Oh, well, how's business?

477
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,540
Well, fish-shaped pastries
are supposed to be the easiest.

478
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,380
When people lose a job, the first thing
they try is selling fish-shaped pastries!

479
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,670
That's why I started doing this too.

480
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,610
Well... making a living is so hard.

481
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,810
Yeah...

482
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,610
Geez! It's the police!

483
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,900
Help me push the cart! Hurry!

484
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,330
It's the police! Hurry!
Or they'll take it away!

485
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,600
Hurry up!

486
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,410
Geez, faster!

487
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,880
Oh, Do Kyung.

488
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,330
Are you just getting home now?

489
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,400
What brought you here?

490
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,010
Well, I wanted to see if you were okay.

491
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,110
What do you mean?

492
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,030
Your audition.

493
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,820
I heard a strange
guest judge ruined it all.

494
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,230
Geez, I should have been there.

495
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,330
I'm sure that I didn't get it simply
because I wasn't good enough.

496
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,180
Did you just come to ask about that?

497
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,360
Well...

498
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,240
It's Christmas soon.
How about taking a family trip?

499
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Just to freshen things up.

500
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:38,330
Your cards are closed and your car
has been taken away. But a family trip?

501
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,340
Just go home and sleep.

502
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,730
You better watch where you're going.

503
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,130
I'm sorry.

504
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,920
Look at his hair...

505
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,320
Let me see.

506
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,400
Geez.

507
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,080
You, and I, are destined for each other.

508
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,590
Destined for each other!

509
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,220
It's done!

510
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,800
I want to brag to Yoon Sung Min!

511
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,620
<i>Finally it's complete!</i>

512
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,300
<i>Memorize it so you don't make
any mistakes at the concert.</i>

513
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,410
<i>Are you working on my Christmas gift?</i>

514
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,220
Geez, did he forget?

515
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,500
<i>Did you forget?</i>

516
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,870
<i>Of course not.</i>

517
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,700
I'm so tired from all of this work!
I'm going to sleep!

518
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,840
Picking a gift for a girl
is harder than math!

519
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,250
It's strange.
He even became stylish.

520
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,680
Are you picking a gift
for your girlfriend, instead of studying?

521
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,720
Let me give you a tip.

522
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,070
Girls like expensive gifts,
but they love romantic boys!

523
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,370
Romantic!

524
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,130
Kiss? Something like that?

525
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,060
What are you talking about?

526
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,740
It's not like that. Just get out.

527
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,630
It's not?

528
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:05,320
Your notebook is completely covered with
Hyun Jee's name! Hyun Jee! Hyun Jee!

529
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,330
When did you take that?
Do you want to die?

530
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,950
You should be more careful to
keep that relationship secret.

531
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,380
If Mom finds out, he'll be dead.

532
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,210
I can look the other way,
depending on what you do for me.

533
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,970
What do you want?

534
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,980
Say it!

535
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,340
That one.

536
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,870
Take it.

537
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,260
We're good now, right? Don't tell Mom.

538
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,820
The two of you, please leave my room.

539
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,960
Please get out.

540
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,370
Ah.

541
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,120
<i>Do you know what
the next step in dating is?</i>

542
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,790
I look forward to my Christmas gift.

543
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,980
What am I thinking?

544
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,400
Geez.

545
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:34,420
Wake up. What are you thinking?

546
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,570
Oh.

547
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,530
Wow.

548
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,700
Wow, cool!

549
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,350
Wow, this is so cool!

550
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:51,980
- Let me try too.
- No way, it's mine.

551
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,000
You're stingy...

552
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,160
Why are you drinking alone?

553
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,630
- Oh, Sung Goo.
- Yeah.

554
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,470
You look handsome today!

555
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,690
You're a handsome guy!

556
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,890
Boss, what's the matter?

557
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,750
Sung Goo.

558
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,440
What do you think...

559
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,880
we could do...

560
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,750
if we weren't gangsters?

561
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,430
Say what?

562
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,010
As for me...

563
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,260
I don't have 300 million won.
I don't know how to make a fire.

564
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,930
I don't know how to ride a motorcycle.

565
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,880
If your leg gets hurt,
you should go see a doctor.

566
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,710
I can't live my life afraid to get
caught by the police forever.

567
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,320
Say it so I can understand
what you want to say.

568
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,580
Huh?

569
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,990
Yeah...

570
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,720
I'm just babbling.

571
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,970
Hey.

572
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,770
Ask them how much I owe.

573
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,950
Ask them how much I should pay.

574
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,960
And ask them how much this bar costs.

575
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,360
Why should I ask that?

576
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,690
You know what?

577
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:25,540
I'm more jealous of the owner of this bar
than of anyone else in the world.

578
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,690
- Sung Goo.
- Yeah?

579
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,550
Let's go sing.

580
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,690
Geez! Boss!

581
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,760
You're really drunk. Sit down. Geez!

582
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,550
Geez.

583
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,610
Hey, call a driver.

584
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,970
You didn't bring your car.
Why do you need a driver?

585
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,130
Hey, if I said do it, just do it.

586
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,410
Call them.

587
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,130
And find out how much a driver makes.

588
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,430
Tell them I'll work hard.

589
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,740
You know what?

590
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,870
I can only drive an automatic.
I can't drive a manual.

591
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,260
I have a regular,
Type 2 driver's license.

592
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,690
You...

593
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,850
You know I have no sense of direction.

594
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,040
I can't go anywhere without a GPS.

595
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,820
I can't.

596
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,790
I have no idea where I'm going.

597
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,350
Geez... Boss.

598
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,880
Sung Goo.

599
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,710
Is the world so harsh?

600
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,240
Or am I that stupid?

601
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,990
I thought...

602
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:48,130
I thought I had the hardest life.

603
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,630
But if you look around,
so many people are suffering.

604
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,660
I never felt this way before.

605
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,390
But I'm frightened.

606
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,100
I don't know what kind of life
I've been living so far.

607
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,860
I...

608
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,860
This is the kind of life I've lived.

609
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,910
<i>This is the kind of life I've lived.</i>

610
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,960
Honey! Honey!

611
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,210
Honey!

612
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,600
Honey! Honey!

613
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,810
I don't have 300 million won.

614
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,160
I don't know how to ride a motorcycle.

615
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,970
Just run away. Run away.

616
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,110
Go.

617
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,330
Geez...

618
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,780
You're here!

619
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,110
Why did the string break?

620
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,990
I don't know. When I saw it
this morning, it was cut.

621
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,370
Let's go in.

622
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,950
We checked the guitar and the amplifier.

623
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,010
The composition is finished too.
We're ready to go, aren't we?

624
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,900
I'm a bit nervous.

625
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,610
You're nervous?
You've been performing in the streets!

626
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,920
We'll be fantastic!

627
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,650
Go!

628
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,910
Go!

629
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,430
Come to the cafe to rehearse.
I'll get it ready.

630
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,070
Okay. See you then.

631
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,530
Do you live around here?

632
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,440
Excuse me?

633
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,090
What's your relationship with that girl?

634
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,910
You're just a friend, right?
Not her boyfriend.

635
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:56,090
Why do you ask?

636
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,580
Oh...

637
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,540
I thought I should.

638
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,270
Never mind.

639
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,470
Office job...

640
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,760
Two million won.

641
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,070
Storage...

642
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,200
Age limit...

643
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,080
Oh.

644
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:38,420
Boss, I need to know.

645
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,430
Know what?

646
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:44,100
Why are you dragging this on so long?

647
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,230
I need to know.

648
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,530
It's nothing.

649
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,020
Oh, man. I am really disappointed.

650
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:03,730
Wow, Yoon Tae Soo.
You lead a good life.

651
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,620
What are you talking about?

652
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,360
Those two guys must be sitting
the way you are, in first class seats.

653
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,180
Flying over the clouds.

654
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,280
Huh?

655
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,060
Mr. Son and Officer Seo...
They left the country.

656
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,380
Is that true?

657
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,580
Geez, I'm about to explode!

658
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,930
I wasn't going to let them live.
But they had a plan, and they ran away.

659
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,280
Did you really not know that
Officer Seo was working with him?

660
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,890
The two of you call each other brothers.

661
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,210
What is it exactly, that you want to say?

662
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:43,090
If I had known, would I have been
stabbed in the back like that?

663
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,180
I'm about to explode too!

664
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,060
Do you know how much
money my dad blew?

665
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:53,340
He was all about you,
and then ended up losing money.

666
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,300
At least I'm his own blood.

667
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:01,270
But you, you're a money drainer.

668
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,780
A money drainer.

669
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,950
Yoon Tae Soo is looking for a job.

670
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:14,260
Man, after the huge mess
that he's made...

671
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,530
He's going to leave me?

672
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,500
That seems to be the case.

673
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,370
Bring me all of the books
for the bars that he manages.

674
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:25,180
Pardon me? You mean, all of the bars?

675
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,810
When my dog betrays me

676
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,980
I have to tighten his leash.

677
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,650
Oh, no, don't do that, dear actress!

678
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,950
- Are you crazy?
- I'll do it.

679
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,400
You are an actress. Please!

680
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,240
You didn't have to do this yourself!

681
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,060
Please just give us your orders.
We, your servants, will do everything.

682
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,920
Geez, you guys are overreacting.

683
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,140
Can you please recommend
Kyung Mee for a small role?

684
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:59,720
Otherwise, she'll keep
bothering you like this.

685
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,610
I have no power over that.

686
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,920
Don't say that.

687
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,740
You won your role because
Director William loved you.

688
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,240
And Director Bong drools all over him.

689
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,730
Why do you say that you have no power?
You're big stuff now!

690
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:14,560
Geez, have you changed already,
just because you're doing well?

691
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,860
How could our friendship change?

692
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,310
Sister! This is bad! This is bad!
Look at this.

693
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,780
What?

694
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,630
What is it?

695
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,530
Madam Oh!

696
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,860
Madam Oh!

697
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,200
Why did you suddenly change the script?

698
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,960
What are you talking about?

699
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,500
There's a bed scene
that was not there before.

700
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,540
And Mee Mee turned into a pervert?

701
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,550
Geez.

702
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:56,500
Mee Mee is dealing with extreme
loneliness and pain right now.

703
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,380
She was a gang leader's woman.

704
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,370
But she lost that title because
of Sunny's appearance.

705
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,510
I wrote it that way, to show
Mee Mee's desperation and humiliation.

706
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,120
She is feeling some complicated emotions.

707
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,950
I guess you don't
understand that, do you?

708
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,960
It's not that.

709
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:19,250
But then who is Sunny?
That character came out of nowhere.

710
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,830
That's me.

711
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,820
You are that Sunny who
is innocent and fragile?

712
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:31,050
Yes. Madam Oh thought I was perfect
for that role, so offered it to me.

713
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,900
I can't make the story
any sadder than this.

714
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,190
I told you, Ma'am.

715
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,870
Eun Ok is so prideful that
she likely won't take this with grace.

716
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,020
What? What's wrong?

717
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,950
Are my edits to the script too intense?

718
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:01,100
Geez! What were you thinking, Ma'am?

719
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,190
Director Bong!

720
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,890
Mee Mee turned into a pervert,
due to her stress?

721
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:07,780
Now she's disguised as a man?

722
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:11,340
Why didn't you just say she
was the boss' daughter?

723
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,360
Oh! That's a great twist!

724
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,400
Madam, please!

725
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,620
I can't let you ruin the script anymore.

726
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:24,000
Your job is done.
I'll take care of the rest.

727
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,960
Are you telling me that I'm fired?

728
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,700
It's not that. I'm saying you
should come to your senses!

729
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,670
Okay, I got it. Please calm down.

730
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:36,380
Let's drink this, okay?

731
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,410
Geez!

732
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,690
Okay.

733
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,020
Uh?

734
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,870
Why did you do that?

735
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,980
Over there...

736
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:09,230
There's a CCTV on the ceiling.

737
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,190
Where?

738
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,630
No! Don't look.

739
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:21,510
Then... are you saying...

740
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:24,460
Our previous times in this room
were all recorded?

741
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,820
Okay! Great!

742
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,010
So there's an unused company car?

743
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,070
- Yes.
- What kind of car?

744
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:37,880
It's a one-ton truck.
We just need to unload the cement.

745
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,040
Should I get it ready now?

746
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,480
Are you saying... I should take
my wife and Hyun Jee in that truck?

747
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,210
Yes, it seats three people.
All of you can ride in it comfortably.

748
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,770
Get out! Get out!

749
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,630
And how about using
the production company's credit card?

750
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,060
Are you trying to make me
look like a fool? Get out!

751
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,910
This is hard!

752
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,490
Geez! What should we do now?

753
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,160
The chairman must be spying on us!
We're dead!

754
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,190
Please, please, calm down.

755
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:25,190
We need to think calmly.

756
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,120
Why did this happen to us?

757
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,020
How can I think calmly now?

758
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,650
I'll get killed before
I can even make my movie!

759
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,400
You told me to be rational.
And now you're going to act like this?

760
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,900
I'm finished!

761
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,350
Please, stop!

762
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,570
- Huh?
- Stop.

763
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,240
Stop? Okay, I got it! I got it!

764
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,420
In my opinion...

765
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:54,750
It was most likely installed
for home security, not to spy on us.

766
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,070
Home security?

767
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:00,490
Remember the old butler...
the one who ran away?

768
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,260
He stole all of my money and jewelry.

769
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:08,840
The chairman ordered them
to reinforce home security.

770
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,630
So it must have been
installed pretty recently.

771
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:17,620
And I'm still alive, which means
the chairman hasn't seen it yet.

772
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,230
Let's go back.

773
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,960
What? Why... why go back?

774
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,840
We need to take care of that
footage before he sees it!

775
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,970
That's right. That's right,
that's right. Let's go!

776
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,340
- Is this the right place?
- Yes.

777
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,240
This is the only part of the house
that I have never seen before.

778
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:47,040
This is not the time to be doing that.

779
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,420
Okay.

780
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,640
Geez.

781
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:53,460
By the way, what are we looking for?

782
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,130
The computer that is connected
to all of the security cameras.

783
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,420
It must be here.

784
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,300
So then we just find it
and crush it, right?

785
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,810
You don't need to crush it.
We'll just delete it.

786
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,220
- Please...
- Save me!

787
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,440
I told you! This is not the time!

788
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,210
Okay.

789
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,360
Oh! Over there!

790
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,610
Over there! Isn't that it?

791
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,670
Oh! Okay!

792
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:36,020
What? Why isn't it turning on?

793
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,310
Is it broken? Huh?

794
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:42,090
Please! Please! Geez.

795
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:44,650
Hide! Hide!

796
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,430
Would I die if you
canceled all of my cards?

797
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,510
How have you been?

798
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,600
What?

799
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,040
Gold.

800
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:35,270
Dad, you cut off my money line.

801
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:37,470
I had to do this.

802
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:41,470
Do Kyung and Hyun Jee, just wait.

803
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:50,060
I checked all of the books that
Secretary Ma brought from the bars.

804
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,110
I found something strange
at Tae Soo's bars.

805
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,070
That's why I had you come.

806
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,370
What's strange, Sir?

807
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,310
Since the beginning of the year

808
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:04,070
the numbers haven't matched at all.

809
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,670
What's happening here?

810
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:08,750
Did Tae Soo steal the money?

811
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:11,410
No, definitely not.
He would never do that.

812
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:13,880
Then what's wrong with the numbers?

813
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,540
Who did this?

814
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:20,040
Actually what happened was...
Director Baek...

815
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:24,520
Tae Soo tried to stop him, but
Director Baek said he'd tell you later.

816
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,040
Be quiet!

817
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,020
You're not a smart guy.

818
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:36,630
In times like these, what you
need is politics, not honesty.

819
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,230
Pardon me?

820
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,020
I heard that you're
becoming a father soon.

821
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:44,210
How will you take care of your
family if you lose your job?

822
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,200
What? Eun Ok auditioned
to save her house?

823
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,630
The chairman said she could stay
in the house if she won Mee Mee's role.

824
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,820
That's why she worked so hard.

825
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,520
I feel bad for my sister.

826
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,290
Why does the chairman
hate Do Kyung so much?

827
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,320
That's a mystery.

828
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,010
If Director Baek finds out,
he'll be furious.

829
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,440
Keep it a secret from Do Kyung.

830
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,800
What is it that you need to say,
that you need to say it in private?

831
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,550
Is it true, about Do Kyung?

832
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:19,650
What?

833
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,410
About your house.

834
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,080
Geez, that was too much.
You guys are still friends.

835
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,250
Kyung Mee, can you leave us alone?

836
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,570
Okay, I should get out.

837
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,400
Speak calmly.

838
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:54,510
Did you want to kick me out
like that too?

839
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:56,920
Do Kyung...

840
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,050
Were you trying to make me leave
just like the chairman wanted?

841
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,240
I know you think it's just an excuse.

842
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,720
But I did that because I was afraid
to get kicked out of my house.

843
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,880
If you were in my shoes...

844
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,520
I don't care. I don't even want to know.

845
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,120
Aren't you the same, anyway?

846
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:19,280
You sided with Madam Oh
and tried to kick me out.

847
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,510
You...

848
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:23,870
You don't know why I came
back to Daejeon, do you?

849
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,110
It's obvious.

850
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:29,050
You wanted to get back
together with Gi Bum.

851
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:31,210
No, it was because of Hyun Jee.

852
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:38,250
Eun Ok.

853
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,250
Is it true?

854
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:45,800
If you are here about your father,
don't say anything. I already did.

855
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,240
Is that all?

856
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:50,430
I'm really disappointed.

857
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,330
How could you do that to a friend?

858
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,230
I said to not say anything!

859
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,460
I can't hold my anger back!

860
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,710
I see that you were desperate about
your house. But to do this to a friend!

861
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,610
- Gi Bum.
- Yes.

862
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,970
It was all my fault.

863
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:09,590
I regret that I accepted the chairman's
offer without thinking about it.

864
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:17,560
What? Is that an apology?

865
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,220
Was she always so blunt?

866
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,370
Don't be harsh on her.

867
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:23,520
The real problem is your father.

868
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:29,030
I knew you were making real efforts.

869
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:31,580
So I thought about getting
back together with you.

870
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,590
But I can not and do not want
to stand your father anymore.

871
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,270
Just let me go.

872
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:44,050
Don't say that. We should
focus at a time like this.

873
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,270
Don't you have self-pride?

874
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,680
Self-pride?

875
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,130
I lost that ten years ago.

876
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:53,500
And I endured that loss
with my competitive spirit.

877
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,350
But I'm not sure
I have that anymore either.

878
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,630
Just give up.

879
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,770
Do Kyung. Do Kyung! Do Kyung!

880
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,140
That old fart!

881
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,400
Boss!

882
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,330
What are you here, Young Il?

883
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,520
Geez, you smell like alcohol!

884
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,240
I only had one pint.

885
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,570
But suddenly, I missed you,
so I came.

886
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:28,770
Huh?

887
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,890
Did something happen?

888
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,250
Boss.

889
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:36,760
Sun Young is pregnant.

890
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,440
Really?

891
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,110
Congratulations!

892
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:43,340
You're going to be a father soon?

893
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,340
But I'm confused.

894
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:51,000
When I think about being
a father, I feel scared.

895
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,050
And I'm not sure how
I can be a good father.

896
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,440
I see.

897
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:59,900
From now on, you should only
think about your family.

898
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,210
That's all you need to do.
Oh, my. Congratulations!

899
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,230
What? Is something wrong?

900
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:12,250
Boss.

901
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,210
Go ahead. Tell me.

902
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,430
I am sorry.

903
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,880
I am really sorry.

904
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:01,360
Are you a human?

905
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,750
How can you call yourself
a human after doing that?

906
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,610
You destroyed any and all evidence
that exposed Gi Bum misusing the money.

907
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:11,410
Don't you know that Boss
has to take the heat now?

908
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:12,500
Yes!

909
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:14,460
I know what I did was wrong.

910
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:17,560
I know I shouldn't have
done that to Tae Soo.

911
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,050
But I had no choice,
when I thought about my family.

912
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:23,670
How can you say that?

913
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,030
You...

914
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,650
Do you know how hard it's been on Boss?

915
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,640
Who helped you get this far?

916
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,750
You got married thanks to Eun Ok!

917
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,910
How could you stab Boss in the back?

918
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:39,510
I will be a father soon.

919
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:42,080
But I have no savings.

920
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,110
I couldn't see my future.

921
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:50,210
It's okay. These things happen.

922
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:53,820
I told you. All you need to
think about is your family.

923
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,330
Boss!

924
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,560
And...

925
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,580
This isn't much.

926
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,650
But you should buy a cake
and some flowers for your wife.

927
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,960
Boss.

928
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,180
Here.

929
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,920
I have some business to attend to.

930
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,100
Finish up here and go home.

931
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,910
Mr. Chairman, I'm here.

932
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,430
Oh.

933
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,340
Finally, we seem to be in sync.

934
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:52,390
I was going to tell you to come.
But you came all on your own!

935
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,430
Sit down.

936
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,690
What are you working on so hard?

937
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,430
Well...

938
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:04,980
One of my dogs is acting out.

939
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:08,550
So I'm getting ready to beat him up,
to teach him a lesson.

940
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,820
Is it that the dog is smart,
or that the owner is stupid?

941
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:19,320
Just to get the dog,
you use his wife and his underlings.

942
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,900
How dare you?

943
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,560
There are dogs that
are better than humans.

944
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:25,800
Also, there are humans
that are worse than dogs.

945
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,270
- What?
- Watch your mouth.

946
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,640
You be quiet!

947
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:32,290
This isn't the time
for a little mouse to barge in.

948
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,220
Stay out.

949
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,040
Mr. Chairman...

950
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:46,580
Are you trying to tie me up
and choke me to death, with that?

951
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:50,380
You won't be able to do it this time.

952
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,240
You always said, it's about the people.

953
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,880
It's the people who do the work.

954
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:03,100
You said, make good connections.
You said, find flaws in them.

955
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,790
How dare you act so rudely like this?

956
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,220
I had met many people
following you around

957
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,670
while carrying bagfuls of money
earned from all those clubs.

958
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:31,130
National assembly members,
civil servants, prosecutors and police!

959
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:37,130
When those bastards were
greeting us with smiles...

960
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:39,370
You told me this.

961
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:42,880
"They've fallen into our traps."

962
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,360
But...

963
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,830
I thought about it the other way.

964
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:56,690
And the person in the worst position
is you, Chairman.

965
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,230
Tae Soo, you punk!

966
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:01,780
Compare that to the original
that you have.

967
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:07,020
As for the German tape recorder
you put in my pocket!

968
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:10,810
I'll be taking good care of it.
Don't you worry.

969
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,410
Why you...

970
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,520
Just like I learned from you...

971
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,190
I'm trying to survive from you!

972
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:22,430
Now, let's cut our ties completely.

973
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:26,990
I am leaving you, Mr. Chairman.

974
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:33,510
As of today, it seems
that I am no longer your dog.

975
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:42,380
Still, we share a long history together.

976
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:47,190
You don't want this to get dirty, do you?

977
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,610
There's nothing I want from you either.

978
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,260
I do have one shield
to protect my family.

979
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:56,250
And that's what I came to show you today.

980
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,710
Mr. Chairman.

981
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:06,110
I wish you... a long, healthy life.

982
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:33,610
