00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,210
Where's Gwangbak?

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,540
We went out early to do research.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,340
She's not going to debut as a writer this year.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,640
She's all bluff, like someone I know.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,440
Just say she's like me.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,240
Don't beat around the bush.

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,950
But you still understood.

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,440
Mom, the soy bean stew is extra delicious.

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,420
I didn't know it was this good.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,320
That means you're old.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,990
How could you say that?

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,340
Do I look old?

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,250
Everyone thinks I look younger than I am.

15
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,150
No way.

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,580
You're all bluff, too!

17
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,080
I'm not!

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,610
You bluffed about finding a woman for him!

19
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,880
I've been asking around, so hold on.

20
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,390
Just forget it!

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,720
I'll die before that happens.

22
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,620
You have to be careful setting people up.

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,680
It's not like he has anything to offer.

24
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,340
Yes, he does!

25
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,910
You're embarrassing me, mom.

26
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,820
He works part time and makes money,

27
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,280
and he's learning how to make pizza

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,810
so he can open a pizza shop.

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,580
I'm not expecting much for a daughter in law.

30
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,840
I just want someone who won't cut me off

31
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,910
and drive me crazy whenever I talk.

32
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,590
Don't beat around the bush.

33
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,140
You want someone who's not like me.

34
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,280
You understood, so I'm good.

35
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,840
Grandmother, you're just as bad.

36
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,640
You say whatever you want to say.

37
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,780
I'm a descendant of the six martyrs.

38
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,890
I say what needs to be said, no matter what.

39
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,190
I know.

40
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,190
You must work at a nice place.

41
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,990
You can come and go as you wish.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,740
Of course.

43
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,180
What my mom just said...

44
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,810
I know. I'll find someone.

45
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,420
I don't care about anything else.

46
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,450
I know, money.

47
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,950
I'm not totally crazy about money,

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,390
but because of where I am right now,

49
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,920
it would be nicer if she had some money.

50
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,550
I don't care about the looks. You know?

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,050
I said I got it!

52
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,290
If she's rich, she could be an old hag.

53
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm not that desperate.

54
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,950
Oh, my!

55
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,750
Hello.

56
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,380
Excuse me?

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,790
You must be doing really well.

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,790
You look better than when you lived at my house.

59
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,110
Who...

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,310
You don't remember?
I was your landlady.

61
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,690
Oh...

62
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,740
You don't fight with your husband anymore?

63
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,110
You used to fight with him and cry.

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,390
I don't cry anymore.

65
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,640
Bye.

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,020
Hey, Mrs. Landlady!

67
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,340
I'm not married!

68
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,520
Don't call me "Mrs."
How annoying.

69
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,890
You said you're single, right?

70
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,490
I am, so?

71
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,020
Goodbye.

72
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,790
Friend!

73
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,140
What brings you here?

74
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,890
I came to see you.

75
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,850
Wow, you must be making lots of money.

76
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,750
Where's Yeongdal?

77
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,280
She went out to meet up with a friend.

78
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,150
You don't want Yeongdal to get married?

79
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,810
I do.

80
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,190
It's difficult to choose from all those men.

81
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,880
What kind of son in law do you want?

82
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,320
Someone rich and handsome with a good job.

83
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,990
And he must be good to me.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,420
My Don is handsome, yes.

85
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,920
But he has no money.

86
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,550
He has no future and he has a part time job.

87
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,610
What kind of daughter in law do you want?

88
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,010
I don't want much.

89
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,080
If Yeongdal says yes, I'll consider her.

90
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,020
What?

91
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,640
You'll consider her?

92
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,220
I don't believe this.

93
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,850
Don't say that!
Loser has nothing to offer!

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,820
Goof off's nothing special, but he got Hobak.

95
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,880
If Don marries Yeongdal, we'd be even.

96
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,880
How dare you!

97
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,280
Don't even think about that.

98
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,090
I want you to leave!

99
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,890
And I don't want to be friends with you!

100
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,990
Don't push me.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,450
If you act like that, your daughter's going to get old and die alone!

102
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,310
What? Leave!

103
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,710
Hey!

104
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,280
And don't come back!

105
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,420
The Korean War was nothing compared to this!

106
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,310
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

107
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,720
Oh my!

108
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,420
You're full of energy, aren't you?

109
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,390
We're lucky that gate isn't broken.

110
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,240
This is all your fault.

111
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,350
What is?

112
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,790
You treat Don like dirt, so everyone else does!

113
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,810
Anggeum, I fixed the stroller.

114
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,140
Hey, don't say hi to the beauty salon woman.

115
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,850
Don't even talk to her when you see her.

116
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,590
Tell her to keep her stupid daughter!

117
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,050
I should just die!
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo!

118
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,240
She must have asked her for her daughter.

119
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,790
Don, don't even think about it.

120
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,850
I don't want her.

121
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,720
I couldn't, if I wanted.

122
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,050
What?

123
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,590
Nothing. I fixed the stroller.

124
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,850
Hey.

125
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,550
Uncle, are you free tonight?

126
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,550
Really?

127
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,720
Who is it?

128
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,420
Is she pretty?

129
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,720
I thought you didn't care.

130
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,320
Just meet her.

131
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,490
She's a semi real estate tycoon.

132
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,840
Semi real estate tycoon?

133
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,150
Why would she want me?

134
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,140
This isn't working.

135
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,610
This is nutty, nutty, nuts.

136
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,240
Dad!

137
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,880
Boys!

138
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,740
- It's dad!
- Dad! Dad!

139
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,440
What's wrong with you guys?

140
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,740
It's been so long, they're happy to see you.

141
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,850
What are you doing home?

142
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,290
Mom, why are you home?

143
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,150
I had to close the shop for your kids.

144
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,550
Hobak asked me to take care of them.

145
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,940
I'm making spicy rice cakes.

146
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,880
I don't want that!
I want dad's pizza.

147
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,280
Pizza! Pizza!

148
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,880
Dad, have some!

149
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,810
I don't like this kind of food.

150
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,380
I'm more of a rice and kimchi kind of man.

151
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,110
Sintong, Bangtong.

152
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,590
This is just a "what if."

153
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,020
If we were to live without mom...

154
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,720
I can't even talk to you!

155
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,450
I'm not even finished yet!

156
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,610
I miss mom so much!

157
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,640
Why would you say that?

158
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,110
I said "if."

159
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,640
If mom doesn't come back from her trip...

160
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,320
- Mom!
- Mom!

161
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,210
How can you cry at the word "mom"?

162
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,020
Man!

163
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,280
Why are you crying?

164
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,650
Why did you make them cry?

165
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,610
They started crying when I said the word "mom."

166
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,010
It's like they're orphans or something.

167
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,990
At their age, they need their mom.

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,510
They don't even want to eat right now.

169
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,990
Who goes on a business trip just like that?

170
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,650
Mom.

171
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,280
Do you have any money?

172
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,280
Money? How much?

173
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,140
$100,000?

174
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,180
What?

175
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,850
I wish I did!

176
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,420
How can I have $100,000?

177
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,180
You can't borrow it?

178
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,950
I don't know anyone who's that rich!

179
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,950
Why? Why do you need it?

180
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,440
I need it for something.

181
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,420
What about your rich director?

182
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,940
Why don't you ask her?

183
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,290
Man!

184
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,320
This isn't working.

185
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,610

You can't.
That's what my father wants.

Next test is cooking. What do I do?

551
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,240
Everyone will be bad at it.

552
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,690
You should try your best.

553
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,780
Make it as delicious as you can.

554
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,380
I should've learned to cook.

555
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,850
What are you making?

556
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,010
It's top secret. I'm so nervous.

557
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,880
Look, Mr. Park,

558
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,690
you said you'd take care of it!

559
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,240
I must have some inheritance.

560
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,610
I want it now and you can't do it?

561
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,920
I'm not going to the board meeting.

562
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,950
If you keep this up, I'm taking legal measures.

563
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,080
I drew you a bath.

564
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,180
Dad,

565
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,410
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

566
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,640
I'll go through the lawyer.

567
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,580
Just do what my lawyer, Mr. Park tells you to do.

568
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,620
Your bath..

569
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,040
I don't want anything else.

570
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,140
I just want what's rightfully mine right now.

571
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,540
But that's not yours!

572
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:12,810
Grandfather left it to me!

573
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,910
I'm not going back to the States.

574
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,490
I said no!

575
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,250
Your bath...

576
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,720
What's wrong with you?

577
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,390
Dad, talk to my lawyer.

578
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,240
Can't you see I'm busy?

579
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,250
Why are you talking about the stupid bath?

580
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,720
How can you hold down a job, being so dense?

581
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:36,080
Can't you see I'm talking to my dad?

582
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,810
I can't see anything right now...

583
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,720
I'm going out.

584
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,380
Hey, hey...

585
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,890
This is nuts.

586
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,540
- Hey, Sedal!
- Oh, hey.

587
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,620
It's been a while.

588
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,810
What's up?
I heard you were busy.

589
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,620
Let's play some golf, okay?

590
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,450
Let's go next week.

591
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,950
Do you have some time?

592
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,620
Yes. You want coffee?

593
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,220
Or let's get dinner a little later.

594
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,250
I don't have time for that.

595
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,650
I'm in a hurry.
Can you lend me money?

596
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,340
Money?

597
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,120
Yes, can you lend me $100,000?

598
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,580
Oh, I have to finish writing a report.

599
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,410
Hey, Goof off, call me later, okay?

600
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,510
Hey...

601
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,040
Hey, Goof off.

602
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,410
Hi.

603
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,380
Are you busy?
Can we get coffee?

604
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,490
I know why you're here.

605
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,250
What?

606
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,220
These days,

607
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,680
it only takes a minute for word to spread.

608
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,240
It's an amazing world.

609
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,050
Everyone's talking about you needing money.

610
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,750
I was going to ignore you,

611
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,190
but I thought I should give you some advice.

612
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,640
I heard you hooked up with a rich woman.

613
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:03,410
You abandoned your wife and kids?

614
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,340
We don't think you're worth our time.

615
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,420
For money?
What you did is unspeakable.

616
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,490
Why do you need to borrow money?

617
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,350
She ran out of money?

618
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,990
Why don't you sell that watch?

619
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,340
Wake up!

620
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,520
[Pawn Shop]

621
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,720
How much can you give me?

622
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,390
how much do you want?

623
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,350
I'd like $50,000,

624
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,080
but I'll take whatever you can give me.

625
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,720
It's not an average watch,

626
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,620
so don't put it with other watches.

627
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,080
And don't show it to anyone.

628
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,080
I'll come back for it in a week.

629
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,280
Did you buy this?

630
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,520
I didn't really buy it.

631
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,850
It was a gift?

632
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,250
Yes.

633
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,020
From a woman?

634
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,250
Of course.

635
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,240
Why?

636
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,040
You should keep this instead of selling it.

637
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,020
What?

638
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,820
I can't cook.

639
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,310
Me neither.

640
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,240
No one here can cook well.

641
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,190
Everyone's the same.

642
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,850
I wish the contest was to eat this radish.

643
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,220
Let's start by eating the radish.

644
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,750
Really?

645
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,020
Number 4 won 1st place!

646
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,680
That was warm up.

647
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,310
- Darn it!
- Okay.

648
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,140
This is the fourth test.

649
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,990
The cooking test you've been waiting for!

650
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,290
Your parents in law came to your house,

651
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,650
and you must whip something up in a hurry.

652
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:33,740
We have some common ingredients up here.

653
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,190
You can take anything you want.

654
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:42,910
Mr. Choi Daese who's holding this audition will be the judge of this test.

655
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,040
You have 30 minutes.

656
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,890
Things are not going well.

657
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,750
She only did well on the first test.

658
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,390
Other girls are pretty good at cooking, 

659
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,790
but Number 4 is not so good.

660
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,020
Can I ask you to do something for me?

661
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,720
I have some.

662
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,850
We brought some for ourselves.

663
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,080
Okay.

664
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,990
Oh, stir fried fish cake.

665
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,390
That looks really good.

666
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,680
Are you sure that's edible?

667
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,490
Oh!

668
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,990
What's this?

669
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,350
Soft tofu stew.

670
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,040
Oh, this smells good.

671
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,350
This looks very edible to me.

672
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,810
Can I have some water?

673
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,010
Of course.

674
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,250
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

675
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,880
Please stand in front of your dish.

676
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,620
Check your rankings.

677
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,540
1st place!

678
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,880
1st place! 1st place! 1st place!

679
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,680
Seven people remain.

680
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,950
Only the final test remains.

681
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,390
But the points given are the highest,

682
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,910
so we don't know who will win.

683
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,320
Oh...

684
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,450
Man...

685
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,540
Since everyone looks finished,

686
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:11,280
I think we should have a family meeting.

687
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,490
Family meeting?

688
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,390
Why not? Let's do it.

689
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,720
But what would you have to say here?

690
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,310
Why not? He's family.

691
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,620
Actually,

692
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:24,450
I want everyone to help with the chores.

693
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,620
Oh...

694
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,450
This is a big family,

695
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,720
but we all depend on mother alone.

696
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,490
She does everything for us.

697
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,720
From things like cooking, laundry, cleaning

698
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,450
to taking care of Aeji and Jungji.

699
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,410
I know it's my fault,

700
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,740
but I'm afraid mother will get sick.

701
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,520
People in the past did more!

702
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,220
Grandmother, stop saying that.

703
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,250
You always talk about the past.

704
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,520
Minjung is right.

705
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,390
We should've done this a long time ago.

706
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,990
Mother, she's no spring chicken.

707
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,450
She's old, she's over 60 years old.

708
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,540
Being over 60 years old isn't old!

709
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,510
She's in her prime!

710
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,290
You were born healthy,

711
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,520
so you're healthier than I am right now,

712
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:21,450
but I'm not like you.

713
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,350
I'm scared of everything I have to do.

714
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,220
Then we should decide what to do.

715
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,390
Mother, what do you think?

716
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,850
What should we do?

717
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,620
Can I tell you what I thought of?

718
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,040
Sure, go ahead.

719
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,580
Mother can continue to cook.

720
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:41,620
She is the best cook here.

721
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:45,290
And I think we should divide up the rest.

722
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:51,090
We can take turns doing the dishes and doing the laundry.

723
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:54,280
Uncle can clean downstairs,

724
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,520
and I can clean upstairs.

725
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,990
The front yard,

726
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,250
I think the men can clean it on Sundays.

727
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:08,120
Oh, that would be amazing help for me.

728
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,290
Then make a schedule and post it up there.

729
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,990
Haebak, you do it.

730
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,950
Okay.

731
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,490
The breakfast dishes can be done by

732
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,950
grandmother, uncle and Subak.

733
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,250
Me too?

734
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,120
Of course. You're very healthy.

735
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,750
Father, Daebak and I'll do the dinner dishes.

736
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,550
And Minjung can do them on Sundays, since you get off late.

737
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,450
Father, when should we start?

738
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,750
We should start this evening.

739
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,790
That means you have to go first.

740
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,320
Okay.

741
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,990
I'll start it off.

742
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,520
I don't believe this!

743
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,450
I have to watch him do the dishes now?

744
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,120
You're having a hard time because of your kids!

745
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,950
When my father gets discharged,

746
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,620
I'll come home early and look after Jungji.

747
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,310
You pick the time, too.

748
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,080
She's not doing it for free. I pay her.

749
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,040
It's not about the money.

750
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:06,280
We should talk about this.

751
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,750
You keep saying you pay me, but how much

752
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,390
have you paid me? $100 twice, $200 once.

753
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,250
I only got $400 from you. $400.

754
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,820
You've been raising your grandkids for money?

755
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,620
If I had to pay more, I'd get a professional.

756
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,450
Why would I have you take care of them?

757
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,390
And you won't stop nagging,

758
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,310
making them sick and hurt.

759
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,080
I can't help it if they get sick!

760
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:34,280
It's because you don't pay attention!

761
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,250
Come with me.

762
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,150
- Man!
- I don't pay attention?

763
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,610
I'm raising your kids for you and you say that?

764
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:40,580
I can't believe this!

765
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,180
You're worse than a mother in law!

766
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,840
I worked my butt off raising her kids!

767
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,950
And that's the thanks I get?

768
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,640
Then take your kids and move out!

769
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,110
Don't do that to your mother.

770
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:59,080
You heard what she said.

771
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,010
Having to live here is miserable enough,

772
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:04,550
but she tells me to take my kids and move out.

773
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,140
I thought you were upset, too.

774
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,240
Just let it go. You told me that.

775
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,320
Imagine how hard it must be for her.

776
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,640
When the kids get hurt, don't blame mother.

777
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,180
She was so worried that she cried.

778
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:20,040
Even though they're my kids,

779
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,410
it's hard to take care of them.

780
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,540
You shouldn't just leave them to her.

781
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,680
It's not like I'm doing nothing!

782
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,540
I have a job!

783
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,120
Mom said she'll take care of Jungji,

784
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,310
so I can go out and make money.

785
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,240
So why is she acting like this now?

786
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,550
You should fix your work hours.

787
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:39,080
You can't keep going to work in the evenings

788
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,040
to come home late or early in the mornings.

789
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,540
You have too many work dinners.

790
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,910
You drink every night.

791
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,720
You're a housewife.

792
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,990
Why does that matter when I have a job?

793
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,620
You work too, so how could you say that?

794
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,390
When I go to work, I'm not a housewife.

795
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,310
Do you hear her?

796
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,620
I could just slap her on the mouth.

797
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,190
Why didn't you follow them upstairs?

798
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,640
I'm not crazy!

799
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,240
She needs that.

800
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,150
Oh, I wish Minjung were our son.

801
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,880
A son like him would be so reliable.

802
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,290
Why are you smiling like that?

803
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,490
No reason.

804
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,220
Wash them clean.
 Don't forget the corners.

805
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:29,640
I don't want to have to do them again.

806
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,810
Don't worry.
 I'm meticulous.

807
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,620
Nice going.

808
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,550
Mother, this is actually fun.

809
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,580
I need to do this to be appreciated.

810
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:44,850
What if your father saw you doing this?

811
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,350
He'd say, "Good job! Good for you."

812
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,690
This isn't right!
 Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

813
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:59,750
Father.

814
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,950
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.

815
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,080
No, don't say that.

816
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:09,150
We're actually pretty pleased.

817
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,580
Couples need to fight sometimes, too.

818
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,180
- Minjung.
 - Yes, father?

819
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:20,080
It feels like you're really family now.

820
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:23,810
My wife is so happy with you.

821
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,580
You have to get married.

822
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:36,810
I want to move out of this house with you.

823
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,740
But nobody wants to marry me.

824
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,750
Who is she?

825
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,850
Semi real estate tycoon.

826
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:49,020
It means she has lots of land or buildings.

827
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,420
Is that true?

828
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,610
You're in luck, then.

829
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:57,520
I'll have to meet her to see if I am.

830
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,910
Go inside. It's cold.

831
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,340
You're meeting a woman.
I want to see you off.

832
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,120
Good luck. 
I had a really great dream.

833
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:12,640
Divorce is in my future,
so  I should at least get married.

834
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,990
Of course.

835
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,350
Find someone different from Anggeum.

836
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,350
- Okay?
- Not okay.

837
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,420
Why you little!

838
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,250
Hello, I'm Wang Don.

839
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:46,240
I'm Ji Hwaja.

840
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,620
Hi.

841
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:52,450
I think I know why we're still single.

842
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,080
Excuse me?

843
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:58,180
It's so we can meet.

844
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,410
Have you been on many blind dates?

845
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,020
Just once,

846
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:08,050
but she asked

847
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,990
about my salary, house, and car,

848
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,350
but I'm unemployed.

849
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,620
So I kept my mouth shut,

850
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,450
and she just left.

851
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,520
I haven't been on any since then.

852
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,050
My god! How crazy!

853
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,350
You shouldn't meet women like that.

854
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:30,690
I'm forty and you're thirty five, right?

855
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:34,490
I'm older, right?

856
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,290
Yes.

857
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:39,620
I heard you were never married.

858
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:43,650
Every man I've ever met came after my money.

859
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:48,450
So I got really scared.

860
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:53,140
Use this.

861
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,040
This is your lucky day.

862
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:00,120
Excuse me?

863
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,250
I don't care if you have money or not.

864
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,950
I don't care what car you drive.

865
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,040
Why? Because I can buy you one.

866
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,150
All I need is a man with

867
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:20,490
a sound mind and a sound body.

868
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,910
And someone younger.

869
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,110
Rich women meet younger men, don't they?

870
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,810
Let's go out for dinner.

871
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,450
I'm not hungry.

872
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,310
My treat. Don't worry.

873
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,310
Here.

874
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,810
It's for coffee.

875
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,020
With me, you don't have to worry about money.

876
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,290
I have plenty of money.

877
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,720
Korean food? Chinese? Japanese?

878
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,580
How about Japanese?

879
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,420
Let's go get some Japanese food.

880
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:04,720
I come here often.

881
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,720
You don't eat food like this often, do you?

882
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:10,810
Order whatever you want.
My treat.

883
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,310
Okay.

884
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,740
When I get stressed out,

885
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,190
I come here and order whatever I want.

886
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,620
Say ah!

887
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,950
I can eat it myself.

888
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,640
Don't say no.

889
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,610
Ah!

890
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,910
How cute!

891
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,610
I don't think you'd stab a woman in her back.

892
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:55,140
I like you.

893
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:56,540
Do you like me?

894
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,080
Well...

895
00:52:58,090 --> 00:52:59,810
I can't tell after just one date.

896
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,310
I agree.

897
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,510
So let's meet every day from now on.

898
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,040
Oh, my!

899
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:12,220
Stop this!

900
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,410
Man!

901
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,120
Miran!

902
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,250
Eun Miran!

903
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,640
She hasn't come home yet.

904
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,410
This is nuts.

905
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:47,140
He's at the summer house right now.

906
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:49,410
His phone is still off.

907
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:52,010
From what the maids are doing,

908
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:53,820
it looks like there will be a party.

909
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,290
I think this is enough.

910
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:07,990
Why don't we give it another day?

911
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,990
No.

912
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,950
What are you going to do?

913
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,410
Should I go get him?

914
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,610
So you can beat him up?

915
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,840
There's no need for that.

916
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:43,310
I was being stupid.

917
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,220
Now I know for sure,

918
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:49,350
so I'm over him.

919
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,520
I have no regrets.

920
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:13,850
Ms. Eun.

921
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:30,280
What are you doing?

922
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,450
Get out of my house!

923
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,620
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

924
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:48,190
I'm really sorry.

925
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:50,410
You weren't home and I was in a hurry.

926
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:54,490
I have no time to explain anything.

927
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,890
Don't ask me any questions.

928
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,390
Just lend me $50,000.

929
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:04,120
I know I shouldn't ask for money before we're married,

930
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,750
but please help me out.

931
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,990
Before we're married?

932
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,490
Married?

933
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,890
When did I say I'd marry you?

934
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,450
Wake up.
 Are you delusional?

935
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,310
Then, were you toying with me?

936
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,180
We had fun together.

937
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,910
I can't believe you'd steal from me.

938
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,610
You're pathetic, just like others.

939
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:36,750
You are just like all the others.

940
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,920
You'd do anything for money.

941
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:48,020
You can call me names and treat me like dirt.

942
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:51,720
But you're the only rich person I know.

943
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:53,620
And I wanted that more than anything.

944
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,350
But please.

945
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,620
Someone's life depends on this.

946
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,450
I'm not buying this charade.

947
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,680
Get him out of here!

948
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:15,720
Hold, hold on!

949
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:21,410
Please help me out.

950
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:25,510
My wife is going to die.

951
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:30,220
What will my sons do if she does?

952
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:34,390
They cry when I merely mention the word "mom"

953
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,850
How can I let anything happen to them?

954
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:41,250
Miran, I mean, director!

955
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,790
Please!

956
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,750
A person's life is on the line.

957
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,120
She might die,

958
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:51,810
no, she might already be dead.

959
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,990
I'll do anything you want.

960
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,250
Please,

961
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,450
please help me.

962
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,120
I'm not asking for it.
 Let me borrow it.

963
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:11,220
I'll give you the deeds to my apartment.

964
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,220
My wife is...

965
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:14,640
Stop.

966
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,090
You're so boring.

967
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,090
I thought you were different.

968
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:23,540
But you fell for it pretty easily.

969
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:26,410
Over a measly $100,000 credit card.

970
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:29,310
You're pathetic.

971
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,910
You sold your soul for money.

972
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,520
Get him out of here!

973
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,620
Agh!

974
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:29,010
I had fun.

975
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:34,540
Thank you for such a valuable lesson.

976
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:42,150
I wore these here, so I'm keeping them on.

977
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:45,810
If I hadn't worn these here,

978
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,890
it would've been pretty funny.

979
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,250
I'm leaving.

980
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:54,740
Oh!

981
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,040
The watch.

982
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,350
leave it there.

983
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,810
What are you doing?

984
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,580
Does that upset you?

985
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:21,290
We're even.

986
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:25,590
You destroyed my life just like that.

987
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,580
Like this fake watch.

988
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,620
Wait!

989
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,180
Put this on.

990
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,680
Man.

991
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,220
I knew you'd get kicked out.

992
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:07,640
There were many men before you.

993
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:11,010
But you lasted longer than anyone else.

994
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:12,790
And here.

995
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,790
This was delivered just now.

996
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,120
Goodbye.

997
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,490
It's freezing!

998
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,490
Why is it snowing all of a sudden?

999
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,620
[Divorce agreement]

1000
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,510
Remember what I said?

1001
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,890
You have no right to say you want a divorce.

1002
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,150
And that I would bring it up.

1003
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:42,040
I think it's time.

1004
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:43,220
I'll see you at the court house.

1005

Subtitles by KBS World

1006
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:32,220
You're really going to make Sangnam marry the winner?

1007
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:35,850
If I can break that rude girl, it's worth it.

1008
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,290
I have something to tell you.

1009
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,350
Congratulate me. I'm getting a divorce.

1010
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,020
You must have been in a lot of pain.

1011
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,520
What's wrong with you?

1012
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:45,590
I think we're destined to be together.

1013
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:47,620
You were with that woman you met?

1014
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,390
We should plan the wedding!

1015
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,140
If it weren't for her,

1016
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:52,410
this wouldn't have happened!

1017
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,680
Maybe I should just hire someone!

1018
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:56,240
What did you just say?

1019
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,150
I told you not to let strangers in!

1020
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,140
- Take them out of here?
- What?

1021
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,990
This is uncomfortable for both of us!
