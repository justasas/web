2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,480
Sunjeong! Sunjeong!  Sangnam!

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,310
What are you going to do about this?

4
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,750
This is all your fault.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,810
You shouldn't have left the house empty!

6
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,590
What happened?

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,820
Your father's golden key got stolen.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,640
What?

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,780
And the tie pin and cuff links are gone.

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,480
I told you not to leave the house empty!

11
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,510
That wasn't just any key!

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,280
Let's call the police, father.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,580
Right, call them now.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,850
Daese, I don't think we should.

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,440
Why not?

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,040
It might create more problems.

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,540
They'll ask us to come and go, drop by here,

18
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,610
and you'd have to go there, too.

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,420
This happened because of you!

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,010
Was my sister here?

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,190
Yes.

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,510
And she went into Daese's room?

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,690
Yes.

24
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,620
No way. She couldn't have.

25
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,490
I'm sure of it.

26
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,780
It felt weird, so I said no to the police.

27
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,640
What if they find out it was Sangnam's mom?

28
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,140
How embarrassing would that be?

29
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,640
And how would Sangnam feel?

30
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,090
I really hate her. I should...

31
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,620
Aunt, hold on.

32
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,450
I'll take care of this.

33
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,190
Please leave this to me.

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,620
I know what to do.

35
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,840
Minjung, I waited for you.

36
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,190
I hope everything is okay with you.

37
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,410
The court sent you documents.

38
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,280
Reheat and stew and have dinner.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,390
[Divorce by Consent Application]
Submit this to finalize the divorce.

40
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,140
Submit this to finalize the divorce.

41
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,990
If you don't, it will be null and void.

42
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,750
Why aren't you asleep?

43
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,490
Why did you come out?

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,590
To go to the bathroom.

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,920
Happy birthday, honey.

46
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,750
I don't know where one of my children is.

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,380
So how can I celebrate my birthday?

48
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,020
Don't worry. She won't die.

49
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,250
She sent $50.

50
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,050
If I didn't have Haebak and Daebak,

51
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,150
I'd want to give up everything.

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,840
Don't say that. There's mother.

53
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,750
Don's married so he can take care of her.

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,250
Yeah, right.

55
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,410
You'd never be able to let your mother go.

56
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,190
And mother will give up without you.

57
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,340
How about you?

58
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,510
What do you think?

59
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,590
You'll go on fine without me.

60
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,090
Of course.

61
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,310
If you don't want me to, don't give up.

62
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,150
Don't go, Bong. I'm scared.

63
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,440
What did you just say?

64
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,940
Don keeps Yeongdal company.

65
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,010
Why don't you do it?

66
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,010
I'd rather die.

67
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,710
I'd rather run away from home.

68
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,310
So not romantic.

69
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,010
Daebak, Daebak.

70
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,750
You asked me to wake you up.

71
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,710
What is it?

72
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,040
It's nothing. Go back to sleep.

73
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,740
But the living room's too cold.

74
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,920
The water's frozen.

75
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,390
You should sleep in the room.

76
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,380
I'm sorry. I should be sleeping here.

77
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,310
Mrs. Park almost killed me for that.

78
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,540
Bong, it's not there.

79
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,190
Oh, boy.

80
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,220
Mother, it's me.

81
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,640
Get in here.

82
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,480
Oh, your body is ice cold.

83
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,580
Oh, cold. Ugh...

84
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,690
There's hot water in the kitchen.

85
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,810
Huh? There wasn't any.

86
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,080
No?

87
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,550
Did you use all the hot water?

88
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,440
Yes, I washed my hair.

89
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,280
How could you use it all up?

90
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,950
That was for those going to work.

91
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,440
But I thought I had priority.

92
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,140
Don't yell at her.
She's our treasure.

93
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,910
I can't believe my ears.

94
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,790
She's more like a headache.

95
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,490
What are you then?

96
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,620
Oh! Stomachache, right?

97
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,420
Right, stomachache.

98
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,940
Hah...

99
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,640
My stomach is growing.

100
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,940
It's too early to grow.

101
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,920
I've been taking pictures and it is.

102
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,440
Look.

103
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,920
No need. What you're saying is nonsense.

104
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,890
You have to be at least 5 months.

105
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,190
Let me see.

106
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,040
It is!

107
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,750
Right? It's bigger than yesterday.

108
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,790
Bong, look at my stomach.

109
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,010
Uh, I...

110
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,340
That's nothing to brag about.

111
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,450
Grow up. You can't show that to him.

112
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,280
Bong, why aren't you eating heartily?

113
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,190
I'm not very hungry.

114
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640
Of course he can't eat.

115
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,780
He sleeps on the freezing floor,

116
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,650
he can't use the bathroom in the morning,

117
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,750
and he had to use cold water to wash up.

118
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,290
His old body can't take it.

119
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,350
So how can he eat?
He has no strength.

120
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,420
He's full. If he's hungry, he'd devour...

121
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,150
Right, Yeongdal.

122
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,590
It's because I'm full.

123
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,940
If I were hungry, I'd devour everything.

124
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,920
Everything here tastes so good.

125
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,020
Eating with everyone makes me so anxious

126
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,250
about others eating all the good side dishes.

127
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,110
Eat up. Don't be timid.

128
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,410
I won't let you go hungry.

129
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,810
Then pitch in.

130
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,480
You eat too much.

131
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,440
At that rate, your baby will be too big.

132
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,520
But aren't you glad she's eating so well,

133
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,620
even with just kimchi on the table?

134
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,210
Hey, something seems to be missing.

135
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,550
It's Daebak.

136
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,810
Daebak ran away from home?

137
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,550
He went to study.

138
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,640
He did?

139
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,580
Hurry up. The lunch crowd will be here.

140
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,340
Making money isn't easy.

141
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,690
Others could do that in 30 minutes.

142
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,690
But you take over an hour.

143
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,210
No other restaurants would hire you.

144
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,420
You'll get fired, just like that.

145
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,050
I actually did.

146
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,580
Thank you.

147
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,140
God will bless you.

148
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,550
So what happened to you?

149
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,940
Things happened.

150
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,790
Life is a mysterious thing.

151
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,490
It looks like you have stories to tell.

152
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,240
I have tons of stories to tell.

153
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,580
It's me, mother.

154
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,440
I'd like to see you.

155
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,420
I have some things to say to you.

156
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,890
Glad you called. 
I wanted to see you, too.

157
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,290
When can you come?

158
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,810
Right now.

159
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,940
Right now?

160
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,240
Turn around.

161
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,140
Why do you look so surprised?

162
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,290
You all get surprised to see me.

163
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,120
Perfect timing, right?

164
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,510
I locked the door. How did you get in?

165
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,520
With this. I can open anything with this.

166
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,750
I could sleep because you didn't apologize properly.

167
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,410
Have a seat. I'll get you some tea.

168
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,580
Mother.

169
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,810
Mother.

170
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,550
What did you say?

171
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,940
Give me back the golden key.

172
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,810
And the tie pin and the cuff links.

173
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,290
have you gone mad?

174
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,210
I know you took them.

175
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,580
Oh, my!

176
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,510
How dare you accuse me of such a thing?

177
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,220
What did I take?

178
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,510
You're turning me into a thief?

179
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,220
I better call Sangnam.

180
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,740
Go ahead.

181
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,610
What?

182
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,880
Sangnam can take you to the police.

183
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,940
How dare you...

184
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,520
You!

185
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,090
Don't yell.

186
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,610
I won't back down until you give them back.

187
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,940
That wasn't just any key.

188
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,340
Father's employees gave it to him to

189
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,080
commemorate the years of hard work.

190
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,210
So how could you steal that?

191
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,940
That wasn't just gold.

192
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,140
So give it back,

193
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,310
if you don't wan me to call the police.

194
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,710
How dare you!
Did you see me take it?

195
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,640
You went into that room that day.

196
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,020
And that makes me a thief?

197
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,750
You're impossible!

198
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,110
How dare you accuse me of stealing?

199
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,740
Fine! Let's go to the police. Let's go!

200
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,790
Do you mean it?

201
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,690
Yes. Let's go.

202
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,440
I'm not scared.

203
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,310
Fine.

204
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,420
You're not giving me any choice.

205
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,420
I'll buy that from you.

206
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,990
What?

207
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,910
You won't get much if you sell it.

208
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,340
I'll pay you double of what it's worth.

209
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,290
Double?

210
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,340
Yes.

211
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,290
I'll tell everyone I found them,

212
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,810
so sell them to me.

213
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,790
You have nothing to lose.

214
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,110
I always keep my promises.

215
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,910
I'll keep this a secret from father and Sangnam.

216
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,840
Uh, you promise?

217
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,140
Of course. Going to the police is a bother.

218
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,850
Then pay me three times.

219
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,440
That's too much. Three times

220
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,920
I'll throw in the tie pin and cuff... Whatever.

221
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,550
They weren't worth much anyway.

222
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,790
Fine.

223
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,940
I still have some money to give you,

224
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,020
so I'll pay three times its worth.

225
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,690
Give them to me.

226
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,190
I don't have them now. They're at home.

227
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,310
Bring them tomorrow when nobody's home.

228
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,210
You can't change your mind.

229
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,740
Don't worry.

230
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,310
Oh, this is...

231
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,240
- What are you doing? 
- Huh?

232
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,340
They look perfectly fine.

233
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,010
- Can I take them?
- You can't.

234
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,340
But I'll let you, just this time.

235
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,080
You can take anything you want.

236
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,010
We're having coffee, so join us.

237
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,020
There are lots of pretty women.

238
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,720
But they're all married!

239
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
Come with me.

240
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,740
Huh? Don't...
This is nuts.

241
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,890
Hey, hey, hey!

242
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,490
Here's a new member.
Number 505.

243
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,110
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

244
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,780
Hello. I'm Heo Sedal.

245
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,990
We use apartment numbers here.

246
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,040
Okay. I'm Number 505.

247
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,550
Have a seat.

248
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,840
Don't stand there looking so awkward.

249
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,480
We're all in the same boat.

250
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,110
Come and sit down.

251
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,280
Okay.

252
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,110
So, what happened?

253
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,580
What do you think?

254
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:17,790
She went through the mobile phone, found her and slapped her.

255
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,240
Oh, it was invigorating.

256
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,940
Mobile phones tell you if anyone's cheating.

257
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,980
Right.

258
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,010
You can never trust men.

259
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,940
They all have a wandering eye.

260
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,050
Number 505, you try it.

261
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,390
Your eyes are big, so they're be perfect.

262
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,420
- Right. right.
- They're perfect.

263
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,920
Like this?

264
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,990
Wandering, wandering, wandering.

265
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,110
Oh, perfect! You passed!

266
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,080
Who were you talking about just now?

267
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,210
We were talking about a TV drama.

268
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,840
Uh, okay.

269
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,440
I thought it was someone you knew.

270
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,810
Women are just as bad, I heard.

271
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,940
Number 103 is having an affair.

272
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:10,550
The guard found out first from the way she dressed.

273
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,080
Office wife and office husband are popular.

274
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,790
What's that?

275
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,710
Acting like a couple at work.

276
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,050
It's a glorified term for cheating.

277
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,620
Oh...

278
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,690
It's me. Are you coming home late?

279
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,320
I'm going out with co-workers.

280
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,520
What time will you finish?

281
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,840
I don't know.

282
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,710
Will you be drinking?

283
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,420
We will, I'm sure.

284
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,050
Who will be there?

285
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,990
Why do you ask?

286
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,940
And why do you care about drinking?

287
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,740
Don't ask stupid questions like that.

288
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,420
Uh, Hobak!

289
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,350
Oh, man...

290
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,390
There's a perfect article for you.

291
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,690
Newlywed journal.
What do you think?

292
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,620
Newlywed journal?

293
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,440
You can write about others or yourself.

294
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,440
The title will be "The Truth About Marriage."

295
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,980
The raw truth about married life.

296
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,210
Make the single women feel better.

297
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,980
Is it too much for you?

298
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,540
No, I think I'll have a lot to say.

299
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,310
I'm giving this to you out of sympathy.

300
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,250
Thank you, editor.

301
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,410
Where's the cake?

302
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,190
I ate it.

303
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,120
I'll get you another one when I get paid.

304
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,690
Mom!

305
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,120
Miho.

306
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,240
Oh, did you enjoy it?

307
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,150
Yes.

308
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,010
Was it fun? You didn't get sick?

309
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,650
I'm going to see Daebak.

310
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,810
Man...

311
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,750
I can't believe her.

312
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,020
Daebak, what happened?

313
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,210
You never answered my calls.

314
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,310
Are you cheating on me?

315
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,920
I don't have time to cheat on you.

316
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,390
What are you doing at the library?

317
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,320
Is there a girl?
If I catch you, I'll kick your butt.

318
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,850
I have no time for that.

319
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,250
We moved.

320
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,740
Moved? When?

321
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,390
I can't go into detail.

322
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,980
I have to go back in and study.

323
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,650
My only hope is to study.

324
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,390
Are you okay?
Have you gone made?

325
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,790
I'm perfectly fine.

326
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,810
My family went bankrupt.

327
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,050
What?

328
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,590
Mom! Mom!

329
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,390
- Is that true?
- Yes.

330
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,820
Daebak's family moved to a tiny house.

331
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,240
[Marriage is...]

332
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,590
Is it going well?

333
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,620
No.

334
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,550
Have some of this.

335
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,310
Thank you, aunt.

336
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,690
What are you writing about?

337
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,980
It's nothing.

338
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,480
It's a project I got.

339
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,390
Why didn't you tell me?

340
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,350
I heard from Miho just now.

341
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,790
Your family's going through tough times?

342
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,810
Oh...

343
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,950
You heard?

344
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,740
It must be hard.

345
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,420
And you just got married.

346
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,740
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,720
I know how difficult it must be for you

348
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,810
when something like that happens.

349
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,240
I've been there, too.

350
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,150
Yesterday was my father's birthday.

351
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,710
But I couldn't even tell Sangnam because he'd want to go visit them.

352
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,190
You should've told me, at least.

353
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,540
Please don't tell Sangnam.

354
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,910
Or father.

355
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,690
I don't want them to find out.

356
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,190
I know.

357
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,740
It's embarrassing and discouraging.

358
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,240
I've experienced that because of my sister.

359
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,340
You didn't look so happy,

360
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,420
and I thought it was because of Daese.

361
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,940
I had no idea this had happened.

362
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,150
Please don't tell Sangnam.

363
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,940
I'll tell him in my own time.

364
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,450
May I have 2 sweet buns, please?

365
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,120
My pretty princess.

366
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,390
Is it good?

367
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,710
Yes, it is.

368
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,320
He's such a cheapskate.

369
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,920
He only bought two?

370
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,650
He's so inconsiderate.

371
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,810
It's not me who's eating this.

372
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,150
Wangdal's eating it.

373
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,690
Who's Wangdal?

374
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,850
We're calling the fetus Wangdal.

375
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,690
They give names to their fetuses now.

376
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,710
Is there honey in there?

377
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,920
I don't know. I think it's sugar.

378
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,710
It's sugar.

379
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,210
Is there pine nuts, too?

380
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,740
I think so.

381
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,740
I'm sorry I can't offer you any.

382
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,920
That looks good.

383
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,280
I shouldn't star at people eating.

384
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,840
Then don't stare.

385
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,990
I'm trying not to, but I can't help it.

386
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,040
Today's fortune is bad.
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

387
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,380
I'd like to share,

388
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,440
but I just can't do it.

389
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,810
I wasn't like this, but since I got pregnant, I became a total glutton.

390
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,050
I'll take this into my room.

391
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,210
Look, mother.

392
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,080
You cherished Don, but look where it got you.

393
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,020
Why didn't he buy a few more for you?

394
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,420
I'm not saying this because I want one.

395
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,850
You told me not to spoil my kids?

396
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,790
But you're living proof of its repercussions.

397
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,510
And it's going to get worse.

398
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,010
Why that little...
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo...

399
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,620
Give me that baby.
I'll take care of him.

400
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,050
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

401
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,510
Just 10 minutes.
I need 10 minutes.

402
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,240
Oh, little boy.

403
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,190
Can you take care of him?

404
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,420
Okay.

405
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,940
Don't you miss your kids?

406
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,890
You should take care of them.

407
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,150
They like my mom better than me.

408
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,240
I can't go to Aeji's talent show.

409
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,040
I regret marrying you,

410
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,440
and I regret having those kids! Satisfied?

411
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,480
The rose of Sharon has bloomed.

412
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,010
The rose of Sharon has bloomed.

413
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:09,190
The rose of Sharon has bloomed.

414
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,190
Where were you?

415
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,650
I don't believe this.

416
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,820
Don't I pay you on time?

417
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,650
You didn't prepare any of the vegetables.

418
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,150
And you didn't do the dishes.

419
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,210
You said it'd take an hour. What time is it?

420
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,620
I'm sorry.

421
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,890
I'll do it now.

422
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,710
Making money isn't easy, you know?

423
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,010
I know. I know so well.

424
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,440
Go to sleep, Jungji.

425
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:07,350
Good boy, Jungji.

426
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,690
Oh, where is your mom?

427
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,150
Is she eating well?

428
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,550
Is she sleeping well?

429
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:23,310
Jungji, tell your mom to come home.

430
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,990
Say "Mom. come home."

431
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,920
Mom, come home.

432
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,620
Mom, come home.

433
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,520
Subak!

434
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,810
Subak! Subak!

435
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,190
Subak!

436
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,650
Subak! Subak!

437
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,420
Subak! Subak!

438
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,550
Subak!

439
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,390
She must be miserable.

440
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,150
Imagine how she must have felt, 

441
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,740
leaving baby formula at the door.

442
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:36,790
She must be having a hard time herself yet...

443
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,190
It's not like she knows how to do anything.

444
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,980
She never even did her own laundry.

445
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:49,310
Where did she find the money to buy this?

446
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,510
Why that little...

447
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,840
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo...

448
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,390
I feel sorry for Subak,

449
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,390
even though I used to hate her.

450
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,320
Why didn't you follow her?

451
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,550
I called her and ran after her,

452
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,080
but it was too dark.

453
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:14,290
Honey, let's go find Subak.

454
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:18,240
Let's call the police or something.

455
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,150
Leave her be. She'll come back.

456
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,290
We know she's alive so don't worry.

457
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,980
Okay, let's go to bed.

458
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,790
Go to sleep.

459
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,040
Why isn't mom home?

460
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,640
She'll come home soon.

461
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,010
Dad, watch out.

462
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,740
Mom's pretty, so what if other men like her?

463
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,920
Your mom's not pretty!

464
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,740
She is. Other men all look at her.

465
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,420
What if someone steals her from you?

466
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:06,190
Everyone raise your glasses.

467
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,740
For great success!

468
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,740
For our success!

469
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,750
Manager.

470
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,820
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

471
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,710
The person you have called is unavailable...

472
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,440
Oh, man.

473
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,280
[Missed calls, Home (12)]

474
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,710
Why won't you pick up the phone? Huh?

475
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,190
Where are you? Who are you with?

476
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,510
How much did you drink?

477
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,190
Are you with men?

478
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,280
Hah!

479
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,990
Hey! Hey! Wang Hobak!

480
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,080
Oh, this is nuts!

481
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,540
Man!

482
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,650
Why isn't she coming home?

483
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,890
Oh, it's so cold.

484
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,780
Oh, boy.

485
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,690
Oh, no.

486
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,740
Why did you drink so much?

487
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,610
- I was so happy.
- Oh, man!

488
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,280
- I drank too much.
- What's going on here?

489
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,320
Huh? Why are you out here?

490
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,250
Say hi. This is my husband.

491
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,890
Hello.

492
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,210
I guess I'll have to give her to you.

493
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,240
Oh, be careful.

494
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,150
Please take good care of my manager.

495
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,290
Goodbye.

496
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,140
I'll see you tomorrow.

497
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,740
It's been a great night!

498
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,150
- Sweet dreams.
- Goodnight!

499
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,440
What the...

500
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,120
Hobak. Hey...

501
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,350
Oh, this is too much. Ugh.

502
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,820
What's that?

503
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,690
Did you get in safely?

504
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,350
You were amazing tonight!

505
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,390
You are so great.

506
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,320
So sexy.

507
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,890
Did you get home okay?

508
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,420
I love you. Let's go!

509
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,050
Oh, man.

510
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,010
Ugh... Man...

511
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,920
_ Are you crazy?
- Oh, ouch!

512
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,150
That hurt!

513
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,320
My chin!

514
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:48,020
Oh, man...

515
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,480
Open the door!

516
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,720
Hey! Open the door! Hey!

517
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,920
Why isn't this open!

518
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,210
Open the door!

519
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,780
Why won't you open the door?

520
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,350
Don, are you sleeping?

521
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,050
Yes.

522
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,510
Wangdal wants noodles.

523
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,150
Tell him to sleep.

524
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,480
Doesn't he ever sleep?

525
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,650
How can you say that?

526
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,850
It's Wangdal who wants it.

527
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,590
Okay.

528
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,150
Yeongdal!

529
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,890
Eat.

530
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,780
Ouch, hot! Hot!

531
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,610
Slow down. Eat it with rice.

532
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,620
Nice going.

533
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,850
The wife goes out and gets drunk,

534
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,350
and the husband makes soup for her.

535
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,940
This family's doing swell.

536
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,640
Oh, that hit the spot.

537
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,240
Oh, I feel alive again.

538
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,740
Who was that man who brought you home?

539
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,510
Someone brought me home?

540
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,780
You don't remember?

541
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,610
I don't.

542
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,040
I don't believe this!

543
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,050
You really don't remember?

544
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,320
What if someone kidnaps you?

545
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,820
Who'd kidnap me?

546
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,950
Some young bastard brought you home.

547
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,890
Who could it be?

548
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,150
Oh, right. He's just an employee.

549
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,010
Don't call him a bastard. That's rude.

550
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,090
He kept calling you "my manager."

551
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,780
I hated it.

552
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,190
Why does the word "my" piss me off so much?

553
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,450
I hated "my" Minjung, too.

00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,590
You never failed your family.

739
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,740
You made me cry but that's who you are.

740
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,820
When we dated, the whole 7 years,

741
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,120
you never looked at another woman.

742
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,940
You always remained faithful.

743
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,450
And I really loved you for that.

744
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,050
For being so consistent.

745
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,520
Congratulations, anyway.

746
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,240
Thanks.

Be honest with me.

You were waiting for this to happen, right?

753
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,510
How can you say that?

754
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,690
How did you know?

755
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,720
I held my breath until my neck turned stiff.

You did. I'll be right back.

Minjung, what are you doing?

00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,780
I had plans, so I'm out.

Did you have dinner?

00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,150
Yes.

Don't you feel bad for your kids?

I call him because of the kids.

Don't use the kids as an excuse.

He hasn't come so I just got curious.

782

He's all alone so I'm worried.

783
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,210
He can take care of himself.

Gwangbak told me to keep it a secret,

836
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,150
but I can't do it.

00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,690
How could that happen?

Yes.

They moved to a tiny two room house.

00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,880
How could she not tell me?

842
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:31,510
Aunt, a married couple can't be like this.

843
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,380
But you both have your pride.

844
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:35,740
She just married you,

845
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,650
so to tell you her family went bankrupt,

846
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,190
it would've been embarrassing.

847
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,610
People might think she's bad luck.

848
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,150
But that's nonsense!

849
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,320
We're married.

850
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:51,220
She must be miserable.

851
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,090
Don't tell your father,

852
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,350

861
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,920
Of course.

862
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,010

I have the envelope here.

865
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:35,510
So you should take them out.

866
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,990
Open them.

867
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,350
Why?

868
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:49,880
Please open them. I must check.

869
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,780
Then show me the envelope.

870
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,420
You can't do this!

871
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,520
You're pretty smart.

872
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,790
I went to college. I can't give you this.

873
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:18,440
You are just like me.

874
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:22,890
If we open a tea room, it'd be a success.

875
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,010

876
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,010

You're pretty tough.

881
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,420
How did you know I'd grab at two?

882
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:59,990
I went to college, and I was a teacher.

883
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,420

884

How could you do this?

885
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:11,240
You tricked me?

886
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:14,090
I only got back what you stole.

887
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,050
I have no reason to give you money.

888
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,920

890
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,490
What about what you did to me?

891
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,120
I did everything I could for you.

892
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,840
I gave you $10,000 behind Sangnam's back.

893
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:36,580
You hurt him when he was little,

894
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,850
but I was happy about you and him.

895
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:43,480
I didn't care if he got mad at me.

896
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,490
But you stole father's key

897
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,850
and turned Sangnam against me.

898
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,880
I won't let this go on.

899
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,050
You won't? How dare you?

900
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,320
I won't just sit here and...

901
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,540
Sangnam. Sangnam.

902
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,890
Sangnam, listen to me.

903
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,280
She's framing me!

904
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:05,010
Sangnam, listen to me!

905
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,620
- Sangnam. 
- Get out right now!

906
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,040
- Sangnam.
- I said get out!

907
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,280
I'm embarrassed of thinking of you as my mom.

908
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:17,650
And I regret meeting you again.

909
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:21,220
I'm devastated you're my birth mother,

910
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:24,820
and I wish I could drain all of my blood.

911
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,490
I can't believe I thought of you as my mom.

912
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,920
You don't deserve the title.

913
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,090
Sangnam.

914
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,740
Please leave.

915
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,740
Don't say anything.

916
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,590
Leave.

917
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,490
Sangnam! Sangnam!

918
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,520
Sangnam! Sangnam! Oh, Sangnam...

919
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,510
Sangnam.

920
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,320
I'm sorry things turned out this way.

921
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:07,950
I didn't want anyone else to find out.

922
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,890
After some time passes and

923

Sangnam can  take you back again,

Goodbye.

926
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,020
Why did you come?

927
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:55,880
I could've taken care of it.

928
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,320
I'm sorry.

929
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,050
I'm really sorry.

930
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,150
I don't even know where to begin.

931
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,380
Sangnam, I know you're hurting.

932
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,920
I wish you didn't know.

933
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,740
It's okay.

934
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,490
I should know this.

935
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,790
Why didn't you tell me about your parents?

936
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,190
Why didn't you tell me?

937
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,990
We're married.

938
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:40,450
Did aunt tell you?

939
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,820
Yes.

940
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,490
How could you keep that a secret?

941
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,030
Why did you suffer alone? You fool.

942
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,690
When will I grow up?

943
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,380
I'm such a bad husband.

How can I ask him to come back?

Get a hold of yourself, or you'll lose him.
