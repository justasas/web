00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,860
What is it?

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,960
Let's eat first.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,580
What would you like?

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,200
Pick whatever you want.
It's my treat.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,490
Do you want some meat?

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,910
It's lunch. I want something simple.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,490
I'll get bibimbap.

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,870
Get meat. My treat.

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,850
You're always working too hard.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,230
Excuse me?
What do you have for meat dishes?

12
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,980
It's okay, mom.

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,620
Meat's for dinner with alcohol.

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,110
I have to go back to work soon.

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,770
I'll just get bibimbap.

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,160
My daughter can't enjoy her lunch because of that darn job.

17
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,010
Hello? We'd like two stone pot bibimbap.

18
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,790
Make it extra delicious!
It's for my daughter!

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,990
Depression must be going around these days.

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,760
Depression?

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,260
Lots of people die from it.

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm afraid to watch the news these days.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,230
It's filled with stories about people who kill themselves of depression.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,510
But that could happen to us.

25
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,630
But why kill yourself?

26
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,770
You should go on living, no matter what.

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,290
It must be unbearable for them.

28
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,280
Your sister might make the news, too.

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,550
Let's help her out just this once.

30
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,200
She wants to die.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,200
It doesn't take much for someone to go mad.

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,020
She was sobbing, saying she just wants to die.

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,750
I never ever seen her look that lost.

34
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,220
What if she does something stupid?

35
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,620
Minjung wants her to go live with his dad,

36
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,440
but I can't send her when she's depressed.

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,960
We should help her find a place in Seoul.

38
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,900
You have money, don't you?

39
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,120
What money?

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,010
What do you mean, what money?

41
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,800
You've been saving up, I know.

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,710
Let's lend Subak that money.

43
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,670
I don't have money. I don't.

44
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,110
But you've been working for years!

45
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,300
I'm not asking it for free.

46
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,880
And it's not for a stranger.

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,100
Let's help your sister out.

48
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,980
I'll pay you good interest.

49
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,260
You can make money and do good.

50
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,140
Your father can't sleep these days.

51
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,570
Subak must move out by the end of this week,

52
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,150
so bring the money tomorrow.

53
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,930
I wonder if we can find a place quickly.

54
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,430
Got it? Let's go.
You're finished, right?

55
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,720
Mom!

56
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,180
I don't have that kind of money.

57
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,820
What did you do with the money you made?

58
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,650
I don't make enough money to save.

59
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,510
Sedal doesn't have a job, so...

60
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,140
I'll pay you back!

61
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,730
You think I won't pay you back?

62
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,870
It's not that.

63
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,910
The fortune teller said that your sister is destined to be rich.

64
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,680
I'll tell her to pay you back.

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,970
So lend her the money, just this once.

66
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,300
What's my bill?

67
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,380
Hello.

68
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,630
- Can't catch me!
- Stop right there!

69
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,270
It must be hard for you.

70
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,420
It must be since it's your first time.

71
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,670
Parcel service business is hard.

72
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,430
I don't mind it but I'm worried about Subak.

73
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,970
I'd like for her to remain in Seoul,
but I can't afford it...

74
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,700
Since we must take care of my father,

75
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,300
I'd like her to move in with him...

76
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,770
I know I have no right to say this now,

77
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:26,720
but I'm worried about him living alone.

78
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,830
I'm sure you are.

79
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,360
Your parents were a loving couple,

80
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
but now your father's all alone.

81
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,190
And you're the eldest son.

82
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,990
I'm living with my mother,

83
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,040
so I know exactly how you feel.

84
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,600
I'd put it off, so I could take care of him when things were better...

85
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,470
But with everything happening,

86
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,280
I really get why they say you should be good to your parents when you can.

87
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,660
My father's different from other men.

88
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,540
My mother was sick for a long time,

89
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,390
so he can take care of the household.

90
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,260
And he's worked hard all his life and being a farmer,

91
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,260
he won't make Subak work hard.

92
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,560
He'll take care of the girls,

93
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,630
and there's a room at the orchard,

94
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,180
so he can stay there.

95
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,590
What about you?

96
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,380
I can stay at the office.

97
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,900
Father, can you talk to Subak?

98
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,220
She won't even give me the chance to talk.

99
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,340
Look, isn't this really cute?

100
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,910
This is for you, Sintong.

101
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,940
And this is for you, Bangtong.

102
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,790
Mom, when are we getting new clothes?

103
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,870
We always get stuff people throw out.

104
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,600
We're not special at all.

105
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,060
Oh, yes you are special.

106
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,380
Just wait.

107
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,670
I'm going to get you your own rooms.

108
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,970
- Really?
- Really?

109
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,220
Of course.

110
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,560
We're going to move to an apartment,

111
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,600
and I'll buy you beds and desks.

112
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,900
God, please let us buy our own apartment.

113
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,910
Yes, please!

114
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,260
What's all that?

115
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,300
Mom found these at the donation box.

116
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
Why do you keep doing that?

117
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,460
You want your boys to wear trash?

118
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,550
If we wash them,
they'll be as good as new.

119
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,190
And they're brand name clothes, too.

120
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,550
The boys don't mind.

121
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,580
Mom's going to buy an apartment.

122
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,950
You're wearing one too.

123
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,250
This is from the donation box?

124
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,350
- You didn't know?
- Man!

125
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,900
Ugh!

126
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,900
You liked it because it's brand name.

127
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,060
Put that back on!

128
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,750
What if the owner of this shirt sees me wearing this and goes,

129
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,930
"Oh, look at him wearing the shirt I threw out."

130
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,700
Would that make you happy?

131
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,820
You don't respect your husband at all!

132
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,900
I'm going nuts.

133
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,210
Your sons are more mature than you.

134
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,600
Ouch! That hurt!

135
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,740
I don't care about buying an apartment.

136
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,970
I just want good food, nice clothes and lots of time to play video games.

137
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,760
Me too, me too.

138
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,740
You two get out!

139
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,740
Mom, don't mind them.

140
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,600
They're just immature.

141
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,450
Oh, Sintong, you're the best.

142
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,090
Nice going.
Your own son says you're immature.

143
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,210
Put your shirt back on.

144
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,000
There's nothing to see.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,980
Nothing?
There's plenty to see.

146
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,540
If you turn around

147
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,120
Would we be able to look into the other's eyes?

148
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,550
Bounce...

149
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,430
Mother.

150
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,530
I'm home.

151
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,520
Hi.

152
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,270
Did you have dinner?

153
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,720
I don't have an appetite.
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

154
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,750
She made herself bibimbap in this bowl and ate it all.

155
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,750
You still fall for that after 40 years?

156
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,820
She's yelling at me all day,
but acts all weak when she sees you.

157
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,740
I wonder what kind of illness that is.

158
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,490
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

159
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,850
You have to move out this week?

160
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,990
Yes.

161
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,260
Where will you go?

162
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,370
What do you mean by that?

163
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,520
She'll stay in Seoul.

164
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,540
But she can't afford to do that.

165
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,230
I know you're upset.

166
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,340
But Minjung's the one who's most upset.

167
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,940
But Minjung did this to himself.

168
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,700
She's done nothing to deserve this,
so she's the one who's most upset!

169
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,780
Is this a competition?

170
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,010
Get Minjung and find out who's more upset.

171
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,010
A married couple must work together,

172
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,060
especially when things become tough.

173
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,390
You had a good life until now, thanks to Minjung, so you should bear this with him.

174
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,770
What? Why should she have to bear this?

175
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,520
She must.

176
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,770
Your mom and I survived hardships together,

177
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,210
And look, she's the boss of me now.

178
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,700
That's how things go.

179
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,430
Your mom had a very hard life.

180
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,280
At least you know!

181
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,650
She did have a hard life.

182
00:10:53,650 --> 00:11:01,560
She used to live with gold nuggets lying around,
using money as toilet paper,

183
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,790
but her life after marrying you was hard.

184
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,260
It wasn't as hard as yours who got arthritis from playing jacks with gold nuggets.

185
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,230
To be honest, what hardships did you suffer?

186
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,850
Did you have to make money?

187
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,830
Or was I a tough mother in law?

188
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,830
You had a good life.

189
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,730
I made money by raising kids and living with a tight budget.

190
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,670
And as for you, everyone already knows how you treat me.

191
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,960
They know you've been mean to me!

192
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
- Mom!
- Why? Am I wrong?

193
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,660
I never heard such a thing before.

194
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,130
We always veer off the subject.

195
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,450
I know.

196
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,840
Take the girls to your father in law's.

197
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,180
I don't want to.

198
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,710
I'm going to stay in Seoul.

199
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,960
Do as I say.

200
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,730
Why are you trying to force her to go?

201
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,570
What if something happens?

202
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,230
She's suffering from depression!

203
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,460
And how can she take care of an old man?

204
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,790
There's a room at the orchard,

205
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,000
and he can take care of himself.

206
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,770
Subak will have it easy.

207
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,770
It won't be.

208
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,020
Just hold on.

209
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,850
Hold on?
Is there another solution?

210
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,100
Are you getting money from somewhere?

211
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,600
- Size 90, 10.
- 90, 10.

212
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,760
- Size 95, 11.
- 95, 11.

213
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,700
- Size 100, 11.
- 100, 11.

214
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,000
Just a sec.

215
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,980
Mom, what is it?

216
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,580
My daughter, where are you?

217
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,820
Why are you working so hard?

218
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,370
Nobody will thank you for that, will they?

219
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,650
Hobak, did you think about it?

220
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,550
Mom, let's talk later.
I'm busy right now.

221
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,020
Okay, okay.

222
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,410
There isn't must time... Bye.

223
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,280
Who are you?

224
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,890
This must be the wrong place.

225
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,240
I'm looking for Sintong and Bangtong...

226
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,250
Oh, it's the apartment across the street.

227
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,380
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

228
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,830
Sintong, Bangtong.

229
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,670
Oh? Hello.

230
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,490
Oh, incredible.

231
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,760
This is the first time she's come to visit us!

232
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,910
Don't be rude. Please come in.

233
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,490
Your mom's not home yet, is she?

234
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,670
Grandmother brought you snacks.

235
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,140
This is so awkward.

236
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,950
Just let it go.

237
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,360
- Hello.
- You're home?

238
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,990
I'm always in the same place...

239
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,390
How did you find us?

240
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,800
You don't know where we live.

241
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,070
I do! I came to Bangtong's 1st birthday party.

242
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,000
Have fun.

243
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,800
Have fun with whom?

244
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,550
Come sit down.
I need to talk to you.

245
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,500
Well, I hear someone calling me.

246
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,200
I won't yell at you.

247
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,910
So come and sit down.

248
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,160
It's not that.
Someone's calling me.

249
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,950
See? Did you hear that?
I'm coming!

250
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,440
Okay!

251
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,640
Mom, mom, mom.

252
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,220
- What is it?
- Go over to my place.

253
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,080
Is it a roach again?

254
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,480
It's worse than a roach.

255
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,390
Hurry up!

256
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,410
Should we get our grandmother?

257
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,850
She'll be over pretty soon.

258
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,580
Sintong, Bangtong!

259
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,180
See?

260
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,570
What brings you here?

261
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,810
To see my grandchildren, of course.

262
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,980
Hello.

263
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,640
I wouldn't recognize you if I ran into you.

264
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,580
Your face changes every day.

265
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,370
Subak's the same.
It changes every 3 months.

266
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,830
Compared to Subak, I'm nothing.

267
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,310
Grandmother, can we take these to our room?

268
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,030
Sure, sure.
Take them to your room.

269
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,250
Did you recognize your grandchildren?

270
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,710
You couldn't recognize them if you ran into them on the street.

271
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,180
Of course I'd recognize my grandchildren.

272
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,960
They grow up so fast,
and you only see them once or twice a year.

273
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,920
Oh, you saw them on your birthday.

274
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,770
I'm amazed you found this place.

275
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,980
You never visit.

276
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,510
I found it find.
I don't forget if I see it once.

277
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,770
Since we're on the subject of seeing,

278
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,940
I feel bad for your eyes.

279
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:12,230
They must be shocked to see such a dreadful place after seeing Subak's grand mansion.

280
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,080
I heard she's in big trouble.

281
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,370
How sad. You can't rely on your son in law.

282
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,960
My heart's breaking for you.

283
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,730
If it is, tell your son to get a job.

284
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,760
I'd like to rely on my second son in law.

285
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,240
You always say I mistreat Sedal,
but am I doing that for no reason?

286
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,440
He should earn my affection.

287
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,980
He's making my daughter's life hard,
so how could I be nice to him?

288
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,020
I can't believe you're saying that here.

289
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,950
This is my son's place.

290
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,720
Your sons place my butt.

291
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,880
This is my daughter's place!

292
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,690
I'm sure she's paying for it!

293
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,000
What are you doing out here?

294
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,940
Don's sister in law is here.

295
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,260
I'm going nuts.

296
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,030
Stop that.
Your neck will break.

297
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,440
Don't worry.
I have a license in this.

298
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,530
I'm going nuts.

299
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,720
See? It's automatic.

300
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,930
Oh, boy.

301
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,520
What's my mom doing here?

302
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,240
Who knows? I sure don't.

303
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,340
She even brought the boys snacks.

304
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,270
I wonder what's gotten into her.

305
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,000
Call me when she's gone.

306
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,060
Don't go play video games!
I'll kill you!

307
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,710
I don't have money to go even if I wanted to.

308
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,430
Oh, you're home!

309
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,160
Oh, my poor daughter.

310
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,520
It must be so hard for you to support your husband, too.

311
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,560
I don't believe this.

312
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,810
You taught her to treat her husband badly just because she makes money.

313
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,810
She's doing that for a reason.

314
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,160
Oh, stop it, please.

315
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,650
You're home.

316
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,050
I put the boys to bed.

317
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,040
Oh, thanks, Yeongdal.

318
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,580
It's late.
Why don't you go home?

319
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,380
Your husband must be waiting,
so you should go.

320
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,270
I don't have a mother in law or a husband waiting for me at home.

321
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,590
So I don't have to go unless I want to.

322
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,700
I could even spend the night here.

323
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,870
Right, Yeongdal?

324
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,230
Right.

325
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:44,490
Like you know, I'm living with my in laws,
so I'm always busy.

326
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,140
But I do care about you guys.

327
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,650
I can't even buy my grandkids clothes.

328
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,720
Why? They have lots of clothes.

329
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,120
Well, actually, they're not really your grandchildren.

330
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,180
Their last name is Heo.

331
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,310
You were mean to her whens he got pregnant,
so why are you pointing that out now?

332
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,100
I had my reasons.

333
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,570
You sent her without a cent when you married her off.

334
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,200
Please, that's water under the bridge now.

335
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,930
Mom, go home.
I'll stop by tomorrow.

336
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,420
Okay then.

337
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,500
Let's talk tomorrow.

338
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,020
What about?

339
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,710
Talk about what tomorrow?

340
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,310
Mind your own business.

341
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,730
A mother and daughter have plenty to talk about.

342
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,320
You're always together like twins,
so how will you ever marry her off?

343
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,290
You and Subak were twins too, but you let her get married,

344
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,650
to a man who went bankrupt.

345
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,260
You don't have to see me out.

346
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,600
Just to the corner.

347
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,910
I live across the street, so don't.

348
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,450
Go inside and rest.

349
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,000
Bye, mom.

350
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,220
I'll see you tomorrow.

351
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,290
- Goodbye, Ms. Park.
- Goodbye.

352
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,300
Goodbye.

353
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,700
It's so dark!
They don't even turn the lights on.

354
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,770
It's an old apartment,
so there's no light.

355
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,680
Be careful. Don't fall down.

356
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,770
Ugh! Ouch, ouch...

357
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,880
Why can't she zip it?

358
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,290
She gets on my nerves.
Ouch it hurts.

359
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,140
Why did she come all the way here?

360
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,710
Who knows?

361
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,050
It's obvious.

362
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,370
She kept saying,
"my daughter, my daughter."

363
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,290
It's the first time you heard that, too, right?

364
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,630
She was probably unhappy to see your place.

365
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,640
She never talks about you with our friends.

366
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,150
She always talks about Minjung and Subak,

367
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,150
about what they bought her.

368
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,430
With good reasons.

369
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,190
People think you must be adopted!

370
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,530
And the grandkids, too.

371
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,680
She only loves Subak's girls,
complimenting their looks.

372
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,530
Sintong and Bangtong must've felt so awkward!

373
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,770
Did she come to ask for money?

374
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,340
Even if she calls you "my daughter,"

375
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,000
don't lend her any money.

376
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,350
I have no money to lend.

377
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,880
Nobody believes that.

378
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,940
Oh, I heard there are moms with several kids

379
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,870
who would take something away from one kid and give it to another.

380
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:46,060
Everyone in this neighborhood knows how your mom treasured only Subak.

381
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,300
You're too nice.
I wouldn't stand for it.

382
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,250
You're so mean to me, so why do you let your mom bully you like that?

383
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,340
If you're half as nice to me as you are to your mom,

384
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,220
I'd carry you around my back.

385
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,730
I'm too heavy for you to carry on your back.

386
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,230
People are so sharp when it comes to money.

387
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,960
It's like they can sniff it out.

388
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,890
Can I keep that money for you?

389
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,970
Excuse me?

390
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,320
Oh, man.

391
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,920
Wow, I'm really excited.

I may be one but I'm very mature.

400

I don't like women who are too full of energy.

Is that a new dress?

Daebak seems bored of me, so I got dressed up.

Yes, my friends ask me for advice.

They do?

and some feelings were developing.

They weren't dating yet, but...

What should she do then?

473

It's simple. With men like that, you must make them fall for you and dump them.

00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,850
Yes, mom. What is it?

536
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,600
I was wondering about what I asked you.

537
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,260
I'll stop by on my way home.

538
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,260
You will?

539
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,840
Oh, is there anything you want to eat?

540
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,140
I'll cook it for you.

541
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,140
Okay.

542
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,580
[Ms. Wang Hobak]

543
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,370
Your father can't sleep these days.

544
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,120
Help your sister out.

545
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,760
Welcome.

546
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,580
Please close out all my savings accounts.

547
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,580
All of them?

548
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,110
You only have a few months left.

549
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,460
You'll lose a bit of interest.
Is it okay?

550
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,460
That's too bad.

551
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,130
I need the money.

552
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,360
Okay.

553
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,740
Oh, Ms. Lee.
Hello.

554
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,560
What?

555
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,230
Bangtong did what?

556
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,530
Oh, no!

557
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,650
I'm so sorry, Ms. Lee.

558
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,030
I'll talk to him and teach him a lesson.

559
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,670
Why? Why did you hit your friend?

560
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,300
He was acting up!

561
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,880
That's not an excuse!

562
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,740
Didn't I tell you to be nice to your friends?

563
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,940
A mean boy like him deserves it.

564
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,280
How dare you!

565
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,530
Roll up your pants!

566
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,780
Hit me! Go ahead!

567
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,680
I still won't regret what I did!

568
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,520
What?

569
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,140
How dare you talk to me like that?

570
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,890
I hate you, mom!
You're mean!

571
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,220
Mom, don't hit Bangtong.

572
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,670
He deserves it!

573
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,850
You! You come here!

574
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,240
He had a good reason.

575
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,170
That boy called him a beggar,
saying he was wearing his old clothes.

576
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,480
What?

577
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,790
When he said we were moving to an apartment,
he called him a liar.

578
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,650
Saying a beggar couldn't move to a new place.

579
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,960
I was going to beat him up tomorrow.

580
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,990
So don't hit Bangtong, mom.

581
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,860
Bangtong, come here.

582
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,930
Mommy!

583
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,840
I'm sorry.

584
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,200
I won't hit you.

585
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,020
It's all my fault.

586
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,800
Why don't you quit your job?

587
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,130
Don't ask me to raise your kids!

588
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,580
Why should I?

589
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,650
When your mother in law won't?

590
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,960
I had to raise all of you and raise your uncle.

591
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,210
So how can you ask me to raise your kids?

592
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,980
It's like asking a man to enlist for military service twice!

593
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,300
Don't you agree?

594
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,110
It'd be a different story if you paid me.

595
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,620
But you won't so I can't do it.

596
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,750
How pretty!

597
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,930
She looks just like you.

598
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,240
Because I love you so much,

599
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,020
I love your baby, too.

600
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,630
Oh, precious thing.

601
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,730
Mom, you'll raise her, won't you?

602
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,080
Of course, I will.

603
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,750
You're just a girl, so you couldn't.

604
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,210
Mom, you're the best.

605
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,580
But don't forget to pay me for that.

606
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,920
Your husband makes a lot of money.

607
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,020
I didn't feel this with my own children,

608
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,250
but she's just precious!

609
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,920
I think it's because she looks like you.

610
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,060
- Grandmother, it's me.
- Hello.

611
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,270
You're here often.

612
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,590
You didn't bring anything again?

613
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,550
I'm sorry, grandmother.

614
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,390
I won't come empty handed again.

615
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,540
I don't believe you.

616
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,480
It'd be too later after I die.

617
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,530
Do it while I'm still breathing.

618
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,460
She has no money!

619
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,920
She makes must enough to feed her kids!

620
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,800
Oh, my daughter, you must be tired.

621
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,210
You could've come tomorrow.

622
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,700
What's gotten into her?
Huh?

623
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,980
Is she on drugs?

624
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,230
I haven't seen her take anything.

625
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,630
Did you eat?

626
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,550
I made some miso soup. Want some?

627
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,580
No, I've already eaten.

628
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,520
Mom.

629
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,220
Yes?

630
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,690
I gave a lot of thought to what you said.

631
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,760
Yes?

632
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,280
But I'm sorry, mom.

633
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,670
I don't think I can.

634
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,070
You can't?

635
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,710
No.

636
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,870
Mom, I'm sorry.

637
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,830
Are you afraid I won't pay you back?

638
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,600
It's not that.

639
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,850
You shouldn't be like this.

640
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,360
Your sister's dying!

641
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,500
How can you be so heartless?

642
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,960
If you can't trust me, sign her apartment contract in your name.

643
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,270
Listen to me.

644
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,410
There's no need.
You said no.

645
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,280
Have I ever asked you for help?

646
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,140
It's only a loan.
I'm not asking you to just give it.

647
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,660
And to be frank, you shouldn't be that way.

648
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,360
Subak's been so kind to you!

649
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:24,140
She pretended to give you work so she could pay you and gave you bags and clothes.

650
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,580
How can you be so ungrateful?

651
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,760
Even strangers would want to pay her back.

652
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,400
You're so greedy and selfish.

653
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,610
Go home.

654
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,110
- Mom.
- I said go home.

655
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,320
You've been to my place.

656
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,980
That's how I live.

657
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,820
I live in a shabby place,
trying to save every penny.

658
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,060
I didn't tell you to live that way!

659
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,010
You can't blame anyone for that!

660
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,290
You don't spend the money you make.

661
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,740
You're right.

662
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,780
I haven't been spending the money I made,

663
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,000
so I can provide a better life for my kids.

664
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,660
So their friends won't call them beggars.

665
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,110
What are you talking about?

666
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,400
Subak's had a good life until now.

667
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,880
I want to live in my own place where my kids have their own rooms.

668
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,240
I deserve that.

669
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,980
I've worked really hard for 15 years.

670
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,140
rain or snow, even if I was sick,

671
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,860
even if my kids were burning up,

672
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,590
I never missed a day of work.

673
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,860
I cried every morning when I went to work,

674
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,470
leaving my little kids behind with someone else.

675
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,970
It's not like you worked to make me money!

676
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,390
I got married with no money.

677
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:06,390
I saved every penny I could and I made them wear clothes people throw out.

678
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,650
And frankly,

679
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:15,210
I saved up, getting yelled at for not buying you any gifts and working at Subak's house.

680
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,550
I can't use this money on anyone else.

681
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,520
I'm going to use it on my kids.

682
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,380
Go ahead! Who's holding you back?

683
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:29,070
People would think I'm trying to steal it.

684
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,660
If I asked to borrow it for myself,
you'd have gone mad.

685
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,760
So mom, don't hate me.

686
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,310
And don't be disappointed, either.

687
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,180
I'm your daughter, too.

688
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,050
My daughter my butt.

689
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,650
How can you do this to your own mom?

690
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,650
I can't stand you, so leave!

691
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,520
I'm sorry, mom.

692
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,520
Father.

693
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,420
What's going on?

694
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,090
I said what's going on?

695
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,310
It's none of your business.

696
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,510
Did you ask Hobak for money?

697
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,560
You said you found a way,
and that was robbing her savings?

698
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,610
You heard her.

699
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:25,220
She won't be robbed.

700
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,320
What's wrong with helping her sister out?

701
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,820
I can't believe how heartless she is.

702
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,360
You're the one who's heartless.

703
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,240
Do you even know Hobak?

704
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,330
I'm asking if you know your own daughter.

705
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,330
Oh, man!

706
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,600
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

707
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,510
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

708
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,690
You favored Subak since they were young.

709
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,850
Who favored whom?

710
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,780
You did.

711
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,390
That's because Subak was good to me.

712
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,480
She helped us out whenever she could,

713
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,350
she gives us allowance,

714
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,270
and look.

715
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,870
Subak bought us this fridge.

716
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:06,870
She bought us the TV and the washing machine.

717
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,870
What did Hobak do for us?

718
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,520
She's never even bought us underwear!

719
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,660
Where are you going?
I'm still angry!

720
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,480
I'm going to buy some underwear!

721
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,600
I'm sick and tired of you and the underwear.

722
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,980
What? You don't have any underwear?

723
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,530
I'll buy you a box full of them.

724
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,850
You can put on two or three pairs at once!

725
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,890
I only say that because I'm upset.

726
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,350
People are all the same.

727
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,490
It's natural for you to love the child who treats you better.

728
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:42,760
Other moms told me that not all children are the same.

729
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,040
What kind of parents are they?

730
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,320
You should learn to control your emotions.

731
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,920
How can you favor one child over another?

732
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,480
Don't you know that it will all come back to bite you later?

733
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,600
No, I don't.

734
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,390
Well, now you know.

735
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,950
Why do you think I put that up there?

736
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:04,040
Look. Put yourself in other's shoes.

737
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,510
If you do that, you'll find the answer,
but you never do that!

738
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,650
Look at it whenever you pass by it.

739
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,550
I will, I promise so...

740
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,780
Let's tell Subak to move in with us.

741
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,460
What?

742
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,650
We already have a kangaroo,
and now you want a salmon?

743
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:26,440
She's physically able and capable!

744
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,040
No way!

745
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,420
We have a kangaroo?
He says we do.

746
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,680
Me.

747
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,270
Why are you a kangaroo?
You're human.

748
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,420
I know.

749
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,880
Mom came to see me at work.

750
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,710
Asking me to lend Subak money.

751
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,430
She's never been there, but she found it.

752
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,190
She even came over to my place with snacks for the boys.

753
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,240
Her smile was so warm.

754
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,160
I don't think I have seen that before.

755
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,540
She held my hand asking,

756
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,380
"Did you eat?"

757
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,650
"Are you hungry?"

758
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,790
"Would you like some meat?"

759
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,840
"My treat."

760
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,080
"My daughter's working so hard."

761
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:42,010
It's the first time she's ever said such things to me.

762
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:51,620
She called me "my daughter" for the first time when she asked me for money for Subak.

763
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,900
She's acting like it's her money,

764
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,160
and I thought how could she do this to me?

765
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:10,770
When I told her I couldn't because I want to let my boys have their own rooms,

766
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,160
her expression changed...

767
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,550
Hobak...

768
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,950
Mom doesn't love me.

769
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:25,120
I don't know why I feel this way.

770
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,840
I'm married and have two kids of my own,

771
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,260
but I still want mom's love.

772
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,280
I must be immature.

773
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:43,590
Wanting your parents love is natural.

774
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,490
You're quite amazing.

775
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,170
Why?

776
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,500
If I were you,
I wouldn't even have gone over.

777
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,620
And I'd be jealous of Subak.

778
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,240
Don't you hate mom?

779
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,690
I do.

780
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:06,120
I don't know why she had me.

781
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,560
You're going to heaven.

782
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,030
I must smell like money.

783
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,820
Everyone's asking me to lend them money.

784
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,680
Who else asked you?

785
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,650
My mother in law.

786
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:25,040
She treated me to pork belly and asked.

787
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,430
I'm scared of people who want to take me out.

788
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,430
There are some at work, too.

789
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,840
How can they ask me for a loan so easily?

790
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,840
It becomes a habit.
It gets easier, I guess.

791
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,690
You do look kind of loaded.

792
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:47,160
When you get dressed up, you look like a former announcer with a rich husband.

793
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,640
Announcer? No way.

794
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,020
Your dream was to become an announcer.

795
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,310
It was.

796
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,050
I was going to apply after graduating.

797
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,920
But you had to drop out of college because of Subak.

798
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,910
Still, you're amazing.

799
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,350
You're a manager.

800
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,920
Right.

801
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,040
Men aren't attracted to women who look loaded.

802
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,040
You have to look cheap to attract men.

803
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,370
Hobak.

804
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,170
Hmm?

805
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,900
Would you like me to buy you some meat?

806
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,650
Hey!

807
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,880
Oh, man!

808
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,400
What is it?

809
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,210
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Why?

810
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,220
You're home late.

811
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,450
Studying must be hard.

812
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,400
Studying isn't hard.

813
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,700
You can't be one of us.

814
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,730
Hello?

815
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:28,960
Am I calling too late?

816
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,380
It is late.

817
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,550
I'm sorry. Were you in bed?

818
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,710
No, I was working out.

819
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,070
In the middle of the night?

820
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:38,190
You're amazing.

821
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,390
You must have been busy these days.

822
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:43,980
Well, the magazine...

823
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,070
The magazine?

824
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,070
You told me to forget it. Is it out?

825
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:51,250
No, no. It's not out yet.

826
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,150
I'll bring you a copy when it comes out.

827
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,510
There's no need.

828
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,260
I'll buy one when it comes out. Bye.

829
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,540
Hello?

830
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:02,280
If you run wild, you lose.

831
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,900
Don't call him.

832
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,380
I lost.

833
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,800
Gwangbak's so funny.

834
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,290
She said it was about her friend.

835
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,820
She's just embarrassed.

836
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,570
Miho, you've been very busy.

837
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:24,850
You have to check on Daebak's studies and give advice to your sister in law.

838
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,950
I need to earn points.

839
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,110
Miho!

840
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,100
It's uncle. Uncle!

841
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,570
Aunt.

842
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,970
You must be tired.

843
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:36,510
Would you like some juice?

844
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:37,570
I'll drink water.

845
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,900
Did she call?

846
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,970
I think she knows I'm looking for her.

847
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:49,000
If she has a conscience, she couldn't face you.

848
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,860
She wouldn't dare.

849
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,810
I wonder if she's okay.

850
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:56,090
Are you worried about her?

851
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:58,900
Don't you hate her for what she did to you?

852
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,400
Of course I do.

853
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,490
But compared to you, it's nothing.

854
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:03,920
She's your mother.

855
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,710
What's going on here?

856
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,180
What do you mean?

857
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,300
You're whispering to each other.

858
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,710
Are you conspiring to sell me off?

859
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:18,750
We were going to,
but nobody wants to buy such an antique!

860
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,310
You! You little!

861
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,590
Oh, I don't believe him.

862
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,680
How am I an "antique"?

863
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,590
Don't you agree?

864
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:27,060
Don't expect me to answer that.

865
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,440
It's too difficult.

866
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,960
Oh, father!

867
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,230
Father!

868
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,300
You're pushing yourself too hard.

869
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,460
I have to be healthy.

870
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,880
I have three unwed children and a brother.

871
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,130
Stand aside.

872
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,980
One, two,

873
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,940
three, four,

874
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,380
five.

875
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,610
Make me some vegetable juice.

876
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,320
I'm doing to drink it every morning.

877
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:48,460
What's wrong?
He never drank that before.

878
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,330
Make him some.

879
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,360
Mom, where are the vegetables?

880
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,680
Are you having an affair?

881
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,380
Why are you checking out your bald head?

882
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,940
Choose your words carefully.

883
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:13,250
I'm not bald.
My hair is thinning.

884
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,230
What are all the doctors doing?

885
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,910
If someone invents something that makes your hair grow, he'll become rich.

886
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,920
Who cares if you can go to Mars or the moon?

887
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,140
They can't make hair grow back.

888
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,650
Did someone complain about your bald head?

889
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:31,240
I was going to have Subak take care of Daebak, but now I can't.

890
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,880
So I'll have to live longer.

891
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,170
I wonder if she's eating okay.

892
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,810
I'm sure she is.

893
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:43,230
Right, mom.
Don't worry about Subak.

894
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:47,130
Daebak, you know how things are here, right?

895
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:48,290
What do you mean by that?

896
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,020
Don't get into any trouble.

897
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,650
My bat's been begging to be used again.

898
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,190
Lots of people deserve the bat now.

899
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,180
Just say it's me.

900
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,960
Why? Did you do something wrong?

901
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,230
Mother.

902
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,040
You got your report card?

903
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:08,140
Oh, good job.

904
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,440
If you keep this up, you'll be set.

905
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,070
We need a judge or a prosecutor.

906
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:16,230
There isn't much time left, so work hard.

907
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:17,740
You're the only one I can depend on.

908
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,490
I know how it feels to be praised.

909
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:23,040
Like hell you do!

910
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,750
You quit your teaching job and became a kangaroo.

911
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,530
It's because I'm having a bad year.

912
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:30,480
I can't believe my eyes.

913
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,780
She's number 1 in the entire school!

914
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,110
My relatives are all smart.

915
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,120
Don't even try!

916
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,690
Haebak takes after Bong, and Daebak...

917
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,520
Daebak's stupid because he takes after me?

918
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,430
Yes. That's it.

919
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,000
Incredible.

920
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,000
Where's your report card?

921
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,240
It's not out yet.

922
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,890
Not yet?

923
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:53,440
How did you do?

924
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,480
I did as I normally would.

925
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,300
I did pretty well, so don't worry.

926
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:01,850
You did well?

927
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,370
How did you do?

928
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,510
I don't want to get into...

929
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,300
Tell me Korean, English and math scores.

930
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,800
30 on Korean.

931
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,150
30? Out of 100?

932
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:13,740
There's one who did worse than me.

933
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,820
I did much better on the others.

934
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,140
What did you get?

935
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,370
I'm good in English, so I got 40.

936
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:21,010
As for math...

937
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:24,000
Can I get a new math teacher?
He's too hard.

938
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,810
Don't try to avoid it.

939
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:27,460
25.

940
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,260
Ugh!

941
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,290
You said you did well!

942
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,730
I'm sure my ranking went up.

943
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,980
They all said they did worse than me.

944
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,420
It's because you asked the idiots!

945
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,890
How many scored below you?

946
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:42,550
One in my class, and ten in the whole school.

947
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,650
Don't make father worry!

948
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,170
Leave him alone.

949
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:51,090
I'm proud of him for not dropping out.

950
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,730
You shouldn't be proud.

951
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,280
What did you do?
Why didn't you tutor him?

952
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,840
I don't want to hear that he takes after me!

953
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,220
I'm not a child!
Don't baby me.

954
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,040
I can take care of myself.

955
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,240
I'm going to school.

956
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,260
Okay.

957
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,980
I'm going to school and coming home late.

958
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,500
Why?

959
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,690
I'm going to the karaoke place.

960
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:15,110
A bad student like you shouldn't go singing!

961
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,110
Come home early and study.

962
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:19,630
I have to.
Remember my friend Yongpal?

963
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,330
Yongpal?

964
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,390
How can you hang out with such...

965
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:25,880
Don't make fun of his name.

966
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,070
He's number 1 in school.

967
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:29,060
You're friends with the number 1 kid?

968
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,040
They're best friends.

969
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,170
He was crying his eyes out because he got 2 questions wrong, so I have to console him.

970
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:38,870
The worst student in school is going to console the best student in school?

971
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:40,110
Because we're friends.

972
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,870
You didn't learn anything from seeing him cry?

973
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:43,820
I did.

974
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,510
You did? What did you learn?

975
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:47,970
He's so funny.

976
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,710
Why would he cry over that?

977
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,800
How can he survive in the harsh world?

978
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,190
That's what I learned.

979
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,630
I'll see you later.

980
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,650
Let's not talk about grades when we're eating.

981
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,870
How about sex, then?

982
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,760
I was just making a joke. Let's eat.

983
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:16,670
Really?

984
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,890
Thank you executive manager.

985
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:21,600
I don't know how to thank you.

986
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,430
I'll tell him to take you out when he gets his first paycheck.

987
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:27,740
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

988
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:34,960
Hello? We're Angels. Please stop by.

989
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,620
- Hello?
- Hello?

990
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,730
Hello? We're Angels. Please stop by.

991
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,190
- We're Angels. Hello.
- It's great.

992
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,690
Hello, we're Angels.

993
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:50,900
Yes, thank you.

994
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:03,760
I'm going nuts.

995
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,330
Loser,

996
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:11,270
I heard something important yesterday.

997
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:14,010
When a man's rich, he's unhappy.

998
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,330
That can't be.

999
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,120
Right?

1000
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,710
I wish I were rich, even if I'm unhappy.

1001
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,740
I know.

1002
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,550
I'm MUWG and you're MUSG.

1003
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,020
Is that for food?
It sounds delicious.

1004
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:33,580
I'm Mr. Unemployed whose Wife Gave up on.

1005
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:37,620
You're Mr. Unemployed whose Sister in law Gave up on.

1006
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:41,060
Loser, when can we become employed?

1007
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,960
What kind of work do you want to do?

1008
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,010
That's simple.

1009
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:47,980
Free work hours,

1010
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,500
easy work and a big salary.

1011
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,630
Me too.

1012
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,410
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

1013
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:05,020
Goof-off, how are we going to finish handing these out?

1014
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,480
Goof-off? Don't call me that.

1015
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,970
Why do you call me Loser, then?

1016
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:10,790
Because you're a loser.

1017
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,220
Follow me.

1018
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,970
Okay, okay. Get in line.

1019
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:22,100
Me! Me!

1020
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,180
Quiet down!

1021
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,230
Get in line.
If you're nice, I'll give you two.

1022
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,600
- Here.
- Here.

1023
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,740
- Yes, here.
- Thank you.

1024
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,360
Give it to your dad.
Not your mom.

1025
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,150
That's right!

1026
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:39,240
Come, come.

1027
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:43,550
- Get in line.
- Here.

1028
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:46,380
And two for you. Yes.

1029
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,220
Give it to your dad.

1030
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,010
Don't give it to your mom. You can't.

1031
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,050
Hey! Stop right there! Stop!

1032
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:58,700
Stop right there! You!

1033
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,760
Walk faster!

1034
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,250
Oh, I don't want to.

1035
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,230
You don't want to? Why not?

1036
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,420
Handing out fliers doesn't pay!

1037
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,320
I hate that manager.

1038
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,770
But that job's perfect for you.

1039
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:31,120
You just need to stand there in a suit.

1040
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,350
There's even a pool at that hotel.

1041
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:36,740
You can watch women in bikinis all day.

1042
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,080
Follow me!

1043
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,000
Heo Goof-off!

1044
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,680
I'm coming!

1045
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,170
I'm going nuts.

1046
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:52,550
- Come.
- Okay, okay.

1047
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,480
Walk faster.

1048
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,470
I don't want to.

1049
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:00,650
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

1050
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,080
Oh, man!

1051
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,920
- Go, go, go! Hurry up!
- Oh, man!

1052
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:09,690
Go for it! Good luck.

1053
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:13,450
Oh, man!

1054
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:17,470
How amazing!

1055
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,050
Oh, nice!

1056
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,420
Oh, no!

1057
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:33,020
I'm just so happy to see you.

1058
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,970
You must be well connected to have come back.

1059
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:42,730
I didn't want to because of you.

1060
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:45,930
I happen to be your boss.

1061
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:48,010
So please show some respect.

1062
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:50,770
I hope we can work well together.

1063
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:54,720
Oh, that little... That little...

1064
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:07,580
I'm having lunch with some clients.

1065
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,700
Okay, father.

1066
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,700
Then I'll eat with the others.

1067
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,700
We'll go out for some pork ribs.

1068
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,650
Okay.

1069
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:18,600
Huh? Oh, oh!

1070
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,890
I spotted the rude girl! Bye!

1071
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,810
Hey!

1072
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:26,650
Hey! You!

1073
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,570
Hey, hey!

1074
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,230
Oh, that rude little...

1075
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,110
I'll meet you there.

1076
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,610
- Okay. Hurry up.
- I will.

1077
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:54,560
Let's go.

1078
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,050
What's up?

1079
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:05,110
I have to have lunch.
I'm a worker, so...

1080
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:05,960
I know.

1081
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,130
You must eat on schedule.

1082
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:12,050
Were you playing with me?

1083
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:12,760
Excuse me?

1084
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,200
Why wouldn't you reply to my text messages?

1085
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,480
You left me hanging.

1086
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,560
You ignored my text message about Daebak.

1087
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,640
We weren't seeing each other,
but Daebak introduced us,

1088
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,580
well, I guess he didn't introduce us.

1089
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,360
Anyway.

1090
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,630
Why are you acting this way?

1091
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,610
You made me very upset.

1092
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:34,970
Is this how you handle people?

1093
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:38,040
You're a total player!

1094
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:40,810
Don't you have anything to say?

1095
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,940
Say something!
Give me an excuse, at least.

1096
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,530
I guess I misunderstood.

1097
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,410
And there I was trying to do something nice.

1098
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:55,880
But it wasn't because I was interested in you!

1099
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:59,690
I thought you shouldn't act like this,

1100
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:03,300
so I came here to impart wisdom about life.

1101
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,420
But it seems like there was no need.

1102
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,800
Goodbye.

1103
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,060
You're the total player!

1104
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:15,100
I was honest with you and you made a fool of me!

1105
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:19,270
What do you mean?

1106
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:23,410
Made a fool of you? How?

1107
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,830
The magazine.

1108
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,490
The magazine?

1109
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,840
- You read it?
- Yes.

1110
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,120
I read how you turned me into a total bastard,

1111
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:39,440
ruined me, and tore me to pieces!

1112
01:02:42,310 --> 01:03:00,400
Subtitles by KBS World

1113
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,500
I trusted you, but you fooled me twice.

1114
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,530
Go to hell.

1115
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,590
I'm going to hell.

1116
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:09,370
You go to heaven and I'll go to hell.

1117
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:10,460
Did you buy a house?

1118
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,320
You're buying a house?

1119
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,500
No, not yet.

1120
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,730
How am I?
How am I as a woman?

1121
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:17,640
I think you're not so bad.

1122
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,580
Do you have a girlfriend?

1123
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:21,310
My wife's so scary that I wouldn't dream of it.

1124
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:24,380
I can't handle being ruined like this.

1125
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:28,400
What do you want me to do?

1126
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,850
Let's stay in Seoul.
