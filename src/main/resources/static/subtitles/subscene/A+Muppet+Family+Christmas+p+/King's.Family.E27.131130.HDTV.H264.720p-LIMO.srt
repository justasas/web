00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,160
Where's your aunt?

3
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,160
I don't know.
She won't answer her phone.

4
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,990
Where did she go?

5
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,400
You raised your daughter really well.

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,360
We all welcome her into our family.

7
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,390
I liked her the moment I saw her.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,100
This must be meant to be.

9
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,690
It was the same for us, too.

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,760
Sangnam is not like other young men.

11
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,000
I love how honest and hard working he is.

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,960
And he's so handsome, he could be an actor.

13
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,270
We want the wedding to be as soon as possible.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,830
What do you think?

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,660
Since they like each other,

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,460
let's do it before the year is over.

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,470
Okay. Shall we order some food?

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,500
Okay.

19
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,190
Aunt.

20
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,240
Where were you?

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,570
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,190
Daese, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,740
Sangnam, can you come out?

24
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,240
She passed out?

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,260
Yes.

26
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,390
She didn't just pass out. It's serious.

27
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,970
I called 911,

28
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,840
and I took her to the emergency room.

29
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,900
My heart is still pounding.

30
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,940
I was so scared.

31
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,890
Are you sure you can go through with this?

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,990
Sangnam.

33
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,840
Let's go in, aunt.

34
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,740
She won't die.

35
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,260
What's going on?

36
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,390
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,540
Something urgent came up.

38
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,470
Okay. Sit down.

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,660
She's my sister in law.

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,440
Hello.

41
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,290
Think of her like Sangnam's mom.

42
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,130
We need to run more tests,

43
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,390
but it looks like anemia and malnutrition.

44
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,770
Malnutrition?

45
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,160
Yes.

46
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,940
She hasn't eaten or slept, father.

47
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,130
What if she dies?

48
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,440
It's because of him.

49
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,870
I know.

50
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,640
She worked at a cafe, trying to forget him.

51
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,470
She worked at a cafe?

52
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,940
Yes.

53
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,630
She hurt her arm and couldn't eat.

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,100
And she was working on top of that!

55
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,000
What did the doctor say?

56
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,240
They need to run more tests,

57
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,690
but it's malnutrition.

58
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,190
Malnutrition?

59
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,540
She hasn't eaten or slept.

60
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,600
How dare she!

61
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,230
Why didn't she tell us?

62
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,430
Oh!

63
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,060
The second floor is spacious,

64
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,060
but if you want, we can renovate it,

65
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,630
so Jihwa can feel comfortable.

66
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,800
I'm never going upstairs,

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,130
and I'm never going to bother her.

68
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,240
Sunjeong, you know how I am, right?

69
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,600
I would never bother Jihwa, right?

70
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,770
You wouldn't.

71
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,730
So when should the wedding be?

72
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,490
Let's set the date right here.

73
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,830
Okay.

74
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,730
How about on Christmas?

75
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,600
On Christmas?

76
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,400
That would be meaningful.

77
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,230
Sangnam, what do you think?

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,730
How about on Christmas? Good?

79
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,860
Aunt.

80
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,430
Yes?

81
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,660
Where is it?

82
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,160
Daehan Hospital.

83
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,360
Aunt,

84
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,860
please take care of this for me.

85
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,560
Father, I'm sorry.

86
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,230
I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

87
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,970
Sangnam!

88
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,540
Where were you?
Gwangbak is dying.

89
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,360
Thank you.

90
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,970
Thank you for coming.

91
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,970
You came!

92
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,760
How could you be so heartless?

93
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,900
She's dying!
What took you so long?

94
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,640
She's dying here.

95
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,300
What if she really dies?

96
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,270
She was thin to being with,

97
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,070
and look at her now.

98
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,090
She's skin and bones.

99
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,070
It's malnutrition. She hasn't eaten!

100
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,290
Who gets malnutrition these days?

101
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,790
Imagine how heartbroken she has been.

102
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,040
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,790
Gwangbak.

104
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,040
Oh, Gwangbak, it's mom!
Wake up. It's mom.

105
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,600
Oh, I know you're tired.

106
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,600
Can you see me?

107
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,660
I thought you were going to die.

108
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,440
I can't believe my eyes.

109
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,960
Mom.

110
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,100
Yes, mom is here.

111
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,340
There's someone she wants to see here.

112
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,790
Okay. I'll see you later.

113
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,330
Don't get up.

114
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,060
How did you know?

115
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,870
Why didn't you tell me, you fool.

116
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,290
Nothing's more important than your life.

117
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,140
Why would you stop eating?

118
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,900
Love isn't worth it.

119
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,560
It's for the birds.

120
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,900
I couldn't find any birds...

121
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,960
Aren't you meeting her parents?

122
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,200
I told them to wait.

123
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,860
You're awake, so I should get back.

124
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,500
I ran here because I didn't want to be blamed for your death.

125
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,370
Should I go back?

126
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,660
You're mean.

127
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,730
You're my sucker.

128
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,230
My precious sucker.

129
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,390
What is this?

130
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,160
You're too thin for me to hold you.

131
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,270
I'm afraid you'll break.

132
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,560
Why didn't you do as I say?

133
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,640
You're a bad girl.

134
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,070
I told you to eat well, but look at you.

135
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,700
How should I punish you?

136
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,160
Even if your family doesn't accept me,

137
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,540
I won't let you go.

138
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,730
If they beat me up, I'll take it.

139
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,870
If they yell at me, I'll listen.

140
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,490
I'm not letting you go.

141
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,660
That's why I came.

142
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,000
Don't let me go.

143
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,560
We're done here.

144
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,900
Is the barbecue ready?

145
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,970
I want to eat the moment they get here.

146
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,930
Mom!

147
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,390
Sedal! My Sedal!

148
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,100
Mom, where's the kimchi?

149
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,230
You like kimchi more than your mom?

150
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,000
I brought it.

151
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,970
Mom, don't you see me?

152
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,060
No.

153
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,430
I just need mom and kimchi.

154
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,190
Why did you come?

155
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,660
I can't believe you said that.

156
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,290
Mom, make me some kimchi stew.

157
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,240
I've been dying for your kimchi stew.

158
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,790
Oh, you live here?

159
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,790
Mom, look. This is amazing.

160
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,290
Oh, my...

161
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,740
This is incredible.

162
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,640
Mmm...

163
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,830
Yummy.

164
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,160
This is nuts.

165
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,640
Make me everything you can with kimchi.

166
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,900
Make stew, stir fry, steamed, what else?

167
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,690
Kimchi fried rice.
I'm making them all.

168
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,730
I missed kimchi so much.

169
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,270
Wow, how can you live without kimchi?

170
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,190
I never knew kimchi was so good.

171
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,160
But you didn't like it before.

172
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,870
Be honest with me.

173
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,770
Are you having an affair with the director?

174
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,040
An affair?

175
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,040
That's degrading.

176
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,140
You can't put a name on this.

177
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,840
It's a peculiar relationship.

178
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,890
Maybe soul mates?

179
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,370
What are you talking about?

180
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,160
Do, re, mi...

181
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,590
This is nutty, nutty, nuts!

182
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm so happy.

183
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,660
Mom, cheers!

184
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,360
Cheers!

185
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,660
I can't believe my luck!

186
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,330
Look where I am, thanks to my son.

187
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,160
My life is pretty great.

188
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,930
I know.

189
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,460
Servants!

190
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,730
I'm having friends over...

191
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,870
I mean, I'm having a party, so get ready.

192
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,790
Make barbecue, some noodles and pancakes.

193
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,960
And get some sirloin.

194
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,260
Get the best kind.

195
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,660
The kind with something plus...

196
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,930
Get them.

197
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,660
Today's menu has been decided, madam.

198
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,330
For entrée, caviar and foie gras,

199
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:47,000
the main dishes are sautéed lamb and bass meunière.

200
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,970
For dessert, we have crème brûlée and macarons.

201
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,230
Oh, okay. That sounds fine.

202
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,660
Did you make my beauty salon appointment?

203
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,540
At the Park Salla Beauty Salon.

204
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,770
I made an appointment at the beauty salon

205
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,540
for the stars in Cheongdamdong, madam.

206
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,790
Oh, you did?

207
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,690
Right. I should go there.

208
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,960
And I don't like you calling me madam.

209
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,130
I never owned a bar.

210
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,790
These aren't new bags!

211
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,330
I'm sick and tired of them.

212
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,790
I never carry the same bag twice!

213
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,930
Call Paris.

214
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,090
Have them air deliver their newest bags.

215
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,900
Now!

216
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,270
They are on the plane over right now.

217
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,270
Oh, how amazing!

218
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,600
Just thinking about it is nutty nutty nuts!

219
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,730
You too?

220
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,870
Oh, man.

221
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,370
Huh? What's going on?

222
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,790
Why is she back so early?

223
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,070
Who are they?

224
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,960
Huh? Oh.

225
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,540
Say hello. My mom and my sister.

226
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,870
I don't want to meet anyone.

227
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,400
What's that smell?

228
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,100
Did someone bring kimchi?

229
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,560
Oh, how annoying!

230
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,270
Uh, hey...

231
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,100
What? She doesn't want to meet anyone?

232
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,290
We should be meeting her!

233
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,460
How can she be so rude?

234
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,230
Mom, destroy her when she marries Sedal.

235
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,790
Mom, you should go.

236
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,460
People who lived in America for a long time

237
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,690
hate it when people show up uninvited.

238
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,830
I'll invite you formally next time.

239
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,600
Baby.

240
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,290
What's wrong with you?

241
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,900
How could you tell outside people to come here without my permission?

242
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,640
This place is here for my privacy.

243
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,040
You need my permission to invite people.

244
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,270
She's not outside people.
She's my mom.

245
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,790
She's your mom, not mine.

246
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,790
Why did you call them over?

247
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,470
I haven't seen her in a while,

248
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,770
and I missed kimchi.

249
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,540
This won't ever happen again.

250
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,670
Forget it. I want to be alone.

251
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,400
The person you have called is unavailable...

252
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,990
How dare he...

253
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,740
How can he do this to me?

254
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,470
Sunjeong! Ice water!

255
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,270
I got it.

256
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,540
Here, Daese.

257
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,160
How could you do this to me? Huh?

258
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,300
What did you two do?

259
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,590
You made me look like a fool!

260
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,900
Because of me,

261
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,260
you must have been hurt.

262
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,430
When I think about it,

263
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,790
I'm not a good enough person.

264
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,640
I'm a teacher,

265
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,990
but I'm so narrow minded.

266
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,830
But because it was my daughter,

267
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,290
my view of things became very narrow.

268
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,190
I used to tell other teachers and students

269
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,640
that education level wasn't important,

270
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,690
but I'm very embarrassed to say that

271
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,860
I had a prejudice against you.

272
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,740
I understand.

273
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,500
Any parent would've reacted the same way.

274
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,590
I don't believe a degree is just a piece of

275
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,690
paper or that it's not worth anything.

276
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,060
It shows a side of one's character.

277
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,090
It shows how the person lived,

278
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,500
and if he went to a good college,

279
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,590
it means he was smart

280
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,270
and that he was a good student.

281
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,430
I have an accountant and a lawyer

282
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,040
who work for my company,

283
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,270
and it takes a lot of work to become that.

284
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,330
hey worked really hard to get there.

285
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,290
So I think education is important.

286
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:45,330
Are you saying you understand where I was coming from?

287
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:53,000
My daughter's far from perfect.

288
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,860
I think you're a better person than her.

289
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,540
You have

290
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,040
my blessings.

291
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,290
Father.

292
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,070
Thank you.

293
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,740
Thank you so much!

294
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,360
Why don't we

295
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,800
just make it happen as soon as possible?

296
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,860
Okay, father!

297
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,790
I won't ever hurt  Gwangbak again.

298
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,060
Thank you.

299
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,000
Daese!

300
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,200
Sangnam, are you hurt?
Let me see.

301
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,970
Get out!

302
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,130
Look at the blood!

303
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,790
You're not my son!

304
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,790
How dare you leave in the middle of dinner?

305
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,770
Did that rude girl call you?

306
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,740
Father, I'm sorry.

307
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,170
You're sorry?

308
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,940
You're sorry now?

309
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,140
You know how you humiliated me?

310
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,390
I've never been so humiliated in my life!

311
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,360
And I'm going to lose my business!

312
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,090
It was credibility that brought me here.

313
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,090
Because of you, I'll lose it all!

314
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,790
Get out!

315
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,270
Father, I'm sorry.

316
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,630
But...

317
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,830
I can't get married like this.

318
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,890
I want to marry someone I really love.

319
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,190
What?

320
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,470
Have you lost your mind?
I ought to...

321
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,740
Daese, don't do this.

322
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,640
Sunjeong, step aside.

323
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,040
Sangnam, run!

324
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,240
I said step aside!

325
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,440
Aunt, are you okay?

326
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm okay.

327
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,240
Please don't do this, father.

328
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,270
This won't change my mind.

329
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,040
You're not my son!

330
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,700
Get out!

331
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,200
I will!

332
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,090
What?

333
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,240
If you want me gone, I will leave.

334
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,940
I'm not changing my mind.

335
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,360
Sangnam!

336
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,440
Sangnam!

337
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,390
This is wrong.

338
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,930
How can you leave like this?

339
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,140
Aunt,

340
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,360
I'm pushed against the wall.

341
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,540
If I don't do this, I can't win.

342
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,000
Aunt, they gave me their blessings.

343
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,430
- They did?
- Yes.

344
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,470
So I need him to accept Gwangbak,

345
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,600
but it won't happen like this.

346
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,630
I'm leaving.

347
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,230
Where are you going?

348
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,860
Divorce!

349
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,730
Meet me at the courthouse tomorrow at noon,

350
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,400
before I go nuts.

351
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,460
How could you do that?

352
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,600
You said you'd work with us, but

353
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,130
not you're working with Daejin?

354
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,560
What happened to our agreement?

355
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,270
Hello? Hello...

356
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,740
I don't believe this!

357
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,400
Nothing's getting done.

358
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,590
Mr. Kim and Mr. Park didn't come to work!

359
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,890
What?

360
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,890
They stayed with us because of Sangnam,

361
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,790
and without them, it's a mess out there.

362
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,590
And Sangnam won't answer my calls.

363
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,270
Man.

364
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,100
You can't beat your son.

365
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,160
You're too weak for that.

366
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,170
Call Sangnam in.

367
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,200
What about the dinner the other night?

368
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,170
You should go and apologize to them.

369
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,470
People get divorced all the time,

370
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,400
and some people break up at the wedding.

371
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,890
It's not like they were engaged.

372
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,890
You're lucky it ended there.

373
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,190
I never lived like that, so I can't!

374
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,270
That dinner was a form of promise.

375
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,740
How can I break it so easily?

376
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,040
Look,

377
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,470
I never paid my employees late,

378
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,000
and I never fell behind on payments.

379
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,790
Even if it means financial damage for me,

380
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,970
I've always kept the promises I made.

381
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,400
But this is different from that.

382
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,060
That's your life and your business,

383
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,360
but this is your son's marriage.

384
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:39,360
How can he marry someone he doesn't love to keep your promise?

385
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,960
Let Sangnam marry whoever he wants.

386
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,270
She's going to be his wife, not yours!

387
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,540
I want you to stay out of this!

388
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,590
Sangnam, your father's furious.

389
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,930
Please hold on for a few more days.

390
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,100
I took care of Daejin.

391
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,190
And I'm working on Mr. Kim and Mr. Park.

392
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,440
Sunjeong,

393
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,060
where's Sangnam? I know you know.

394
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,660
I don't know.

395
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,840
You don't know?

396
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,090
No.

397
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,330
If something happens to my company,

398
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm kicking you out.

399
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,240
Sangnam, your father's furious.

400
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,970
I'm not afraid of getting kicked out,

401
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,060
but what if you can never make up?

402
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,700
Why is getting married so hard for you?

403
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,370
Aunt, I'm sorry.

404
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,130
Just tell him you don't know anything.

405
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,590
And don't worry about me.

406
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,270
I'm eating well and sleeping well.

407
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,740
Just hold on for a few more days, aunt.

408
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,400
Gwangbak, mom wants you downstairs.

409
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,000
What's all this, mom?

410
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,700
It's for you.
Sit down and eat.

411
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,600
Why did you make so much food?

412
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,040
Oh, how can you have malnutrition?

413
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,740
In the old days many people got malnutrition,

414
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,290
but who gets that these days?

415
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,130
If you couldn't handle it anymore,

416
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,560
you should've talked to me about it.

417
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,430
Mom, thanks.

418
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,270
Take your time.

419
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,170
Your life is more important than love.

420
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,060
It's good, mom.

421
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,290
Eat all day, if you want.

422
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,270
Oh, you're skin and bones. Here.

423
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,960
My, sucker, I have homework for you.

424
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,000
Eat a lot and get chubby.

425
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:09,670
I don't want my bride to be boney. Kisses.

426
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,290
What smells so good?

427
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,270
Grandmother,

428
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,670
I'm eating pork belly, so I can get fat.

429
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,170
Girl, don't make your father all worried.

430
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,270
When you end up in the hospital,

431
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,900
it breaks your parents hearts.

432
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,360
The Korean War was nothing compared to it.

433
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,500
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

434
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,060
I won't, grandmother. Have some.

435
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,060
I can't chew very well.

436
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:43,060
You're feasting now, aren't you?

437
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,170
I'm sorry for making father worry, grandma!

438
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,090
What's wrong?

439
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,000
It's my stomach.

440
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,040
It's because you haven't eaten for so long.

441
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,000
Chew thoroughly.

442
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,630
Who is it?

443
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,860
I don't know this number.

444
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,190
- Who is it?
- Maybe it's the magazine.

445
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,700
- Hel...
- I'm Sangnam's father.

446
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,160
- Fath...
- I'm Sangnam's father.

447
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,870
How are you, father?

448
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,470
You know I'm not doing well.

449
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,600
I need to see you.

450
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,190
Okay, father. I'll see you there.

451
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,860
That was his father?

452
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,390
Yes, he wants to see me.

453
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,960
Your father in law to be called you?

454
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,290
When you haven't even met him?

455
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,560
I know.

456
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,270
Maybe he heard I was sick.

457
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,860
You should've said no.
You're not well.

458
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,500
How can I? He's Sangnam's father.

459
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,540
They are lucky.

460
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,500
I said yes because I thought you would die.

461
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,860
Just think about it.
You're so much better.

462
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,860
But you should wear something nice.

463
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,290
Oh, no!

464
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,900
Man.

465
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,790
Man...

466
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,560
I'm sorry I'm late.

467
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,740
Don't you have a watch?

468
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,240
How can you be 30 minutes late?

469
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,540
I'm sorry.

470
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,830
I left early,

471
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,500
but I got splashed by a car,

472
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,790
so I had to go home and change...

473
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,000
Stop. Sit down.

474
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,290
Okay.

475
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,140
You know why I asked to see you?

476
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,940
I'm so sorry.

477
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,170
I know I behaved really badly...

478
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,100
I don't want to hear you calling me father.

479
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,500
So don't.

480
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,360
Then I'll call you sir.

481
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,660
I don't like that either.

482
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,270
Then what should I...

483
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,160
Call me president.

484
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,170
I will.

485
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,370
President, I know things have been really

486
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,830
bad between us, and I want to erase it out.

487
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,790
I wish I could go back and cut it all out.

488
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,970
I'm so sorry.

489
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,540
I know I was really rude.

490
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,790
You know?

491
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,970
Yes.

492
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:02,470
But you were so weird to me back then...

493
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,140
And you asked for money, so I thought...

494
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,790
I'm so sorry, president.

495
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,660
You're apologizing because of Sangnam.

496
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,670
Otherwise, you wouldn't!

497
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,570
No!

498
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:22,890
Looking back, I was really ill mannered and really rude.

499
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,190
But I was like that only when I met you.

500
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,670
I think it's because we were supposed to meet.

501
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,900
I'm serious. Please believe me.

502
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,100
I'm sorry.

503
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,240
I really am not that girl.

504
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,670
Things between us went so awry,

505
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,940
and I don't know how to handle it.

506
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,100
That's why we weren't supposed to meet.

507
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,330
Things are complex because of that.

508
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,790
Why are you forcing yourself on my son?

509
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,200
Stop chasing after my son.

510
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,500
I didn't.

511
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,540
Stop talking back.

512
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,440
Okay.

513
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,640
You made him run out on us at dinner!

514
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,730
That alone shows me how rude you are!

515
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,670
How could you call him at a time like that?

516
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,330
Where is Sangnam?

517
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,590
Excuse me?

518
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,360
You must know where Sangnam is.

519
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,330
I don't understand...

520
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,330
You don't know?

521
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,470
He left the house after a fight.

522
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,000
He did?

523
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:30,860
Yes,

524
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,060
I think he was calling her.

525
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,790
Okay, aunt.

526
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,470
Sangnam has never gone against my wishes.

527
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,970
He never talked back to me.

528
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,060
But he changed after meeting you.

529
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,430
I know what's going to happen to you.

530
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,790
So I'm begging you.

531
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:59,360
He broke up with you and met another woman, so you should let him go.

532
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,960
Why would you hold on to him?

533
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,040
I'm sorry.

534
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,290
Think of this as a way of paying your dues

535
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:11,290
for acting so rude to me all this time and set Sangnam free.

536
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,360
Sangnam only knows how to more forward.

537
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,830
And he'll never get married without my

538
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,970
blessings, so don't get your hopes up.

539
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,600
He would've, if he really wanted to.

540
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,560
You're still young,

541
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,090
so you should make a U-turn.

542
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,770
You don't understand what I mean, don't you?

543
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,040
Why wouldn't you pick up the phone?

544
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,130
Sangnam.

545
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,540
I was worried to death.

546
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,800
You should at least answer your phone.

547
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:56,630
I was meeting someone. I put it on mute.

548
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,670
I heard you met my father.

549
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,300
How did you know?

550
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,240
You left your house?
Why would you do that?

551
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,500
That's not important.

552
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,360
What did he say?

553
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,860
You don't have to tell me.

554
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,240
Whatever he said, don't worry about it.

555
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,890
You only need to listen to me.

556
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,700
But...

557
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,860
He's not going to be your husband.

558
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,940
Never listen to anyone else.

559
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,590
Just listen to me.

560
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,090
And keep your eyes on me.

561
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:40,070
Do that, for the rest of your life.

562
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,860
But you shouldn't have left the house.

563
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,170
Why did you do that?

564
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,970
You've made him so mad.

565
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,860
This is the only way to solve this.

566
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,830
Where are you staying?
Are you eating okay?

567
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,500
Don't worry about it.

568
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,460
You know me.

569
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,790
I always eat on schedule.

570
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,270
Are you doing your homework?

571
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,670
Yes.

572
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,590
Let me see.

573
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,170
You haven't been doing it!

574
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,540
I should spank you!

575
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,860
This won't do.
Let's go and gain weight.

576
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,740
Why did you order so much?

577
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,830
Eat up.

578
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,800
I told you.
I don't want a boney bride.

579
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,070
What would you like to eat?

580
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,170
This? This?

581
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,090
I'll just put everything together.

582
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,860
I'm never going to let you go.

583
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,540
No matter how hard your father is on me,

584
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,460
I'll stick with you to the end.

585
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,290
I can take any heartache or difficulties.

586
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:59,240
I won't let another woman have such a good man.

587
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,070
You shouldn't reveal all of your feelings like that.

588
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,270
It's like going to war without any weapons.

589
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,900
A woman should know how to hide things.

590
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,170
Don't show so much love.

591
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,630
You don't like it?

592
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,440
I love it.

593
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,500
Can I ask you something?

594
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:30,040
Were you really going to marry that woman?

595
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,170
I thought

596
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,400
I could handle being married to her.

597
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:41,540
I was going to keep you in my heart

598
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,670
and go live with someone else.

599
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,090
But I don't like that.

600
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,440
Missing someone for the rest of your life.

601
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,800
If you're in love, you should be with him,

602
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,540
sleep in the same bed and have children.

603
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,630
Let's eat. 
We need to have children.

604
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,630
Ah!

605
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,130
Ah.

606
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,590
Come right now.

607
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,690
I'm shivering in front of the court house.

608
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,070
Ugh!

609
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,470
Don't you know what time it is?

610
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,360
You think avoiding me will make this go away?

611
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,900
You're actually pushing me away.

612
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,470
I can be stubborn, too.

613
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,730
You'll have to sign the form!

614
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,130
I'm not changing my mind.

615
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,500
I'll be back.

616
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,690
See you later, manager.

617
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,090
Attacking?

618
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,170
Yes.

619
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,070
Let's say I ran into a mugger.

620
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,800
Teach me how to attack and subdue him.

621
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,040
Okay.

622
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,890
You have to attack first and catch him off guard.

623
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,200
And then...

624
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,460
And then, get on top of him,

625
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,000
oh, you should sit on him.

626
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,570
So he can't move.

627
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,700
And then, do this.

628
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,500
Oh, my...

629
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,360
And you attack like this.

630
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,730
Uh, let me...

631
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,190
Let's see, let's see.

632
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,590
Oh, no!

633
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,800
Hold on.

634
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:06,000
Oh, this won't do. Come here.

635
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,170
We'll leave everything up to you, then.

636
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,970
Of course.
Don't worry about a thing.

637
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:19,090
If things go well, I'll treat you to a drink somewhere really nice.

638
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,790
Of course. I'm looking forward to it.

639
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,830
Goodbye.

640
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,000
Goodbye.

641
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,000
Oh, I'm exhausted.

642
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,860
I'm tired of making money.

643
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,790
But I love it.

644
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,000
Have your parents found out anything?

645
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,090
No.

646
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,290
I must return it before my father finds out.

647
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,840
Or he'll kill me.

648
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,170
Don't worry.
It'll only take a month.

649
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,590
It really is going to be doubled?

650
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,200
You're the best.

651
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,190
Subak,

652
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,390
you're lucky you found me again.

653
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,940
I know.

654
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,000
Who is it?

655
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,300
Hold on.

656
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:12,390
Yes, yes.

657
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,570
Tonight?

658
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,160
Okay. Wait for me there.

659
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,000
A present?

660
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,670
What would you like?

661
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,270
Okay. I'll stop by the department store.

662
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,840
I'll see you later.

663
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,830
Your ex-wife?

664
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,560
No.

665
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,690
You should break up with her.

666
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,360
It bothers me.

667
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,440
We're not in a relationship here.

668
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,540
You have a husband. 
Don't be jealous.

669
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,430
That's funny.

670
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,230
- I'm home.
- Oh, hi.

671
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,960
You should try bringing some snacks home.

672
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,730
I feel like snacking.

673
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,460
Aeji, stop watching TV.

674
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,890
No! I want to watch more!

675
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,670
Grandmother, stop watching so much TV.

676
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,000
You're making Aeji watch TV.

677
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,630
What else can I do for fun but watch TV?

678
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,300
Stop bugging me about things like this.

679
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,740
Even your father doesn't say anything.

680
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,830
Whatever!

681
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,040
Mom, how can you let her watch TV all day?

682
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,860
I bought her books!

683
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,590
She can't even read yet.

684
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,900
That's why you need to read to her!

685
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,500
Why don't you just kill me right here?

686
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,170
I'm already exhausted because of Jungji.

687
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,540
How can I find time to read to her?

688
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,170
I don't even have time for a break.

689
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,400
But you can't let her watch TV all day!

690
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:49,070
What if she becomes stupid?

691
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,570
You're completely out of your mind.

692
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,870
She'll take after her parents.

693
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:57,170
If they're stupid, she'll be stupid.

694
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,130
Aeji's stupid because she takes after me?

695
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,000
Who else can she take after?

696
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,670
You thought you'd have a genius child?

697
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,590
Mom!

698
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,940
Don't start!

699
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,640
I had a crazy day, running over to the doctor's and the pharmacy.

700
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:13,440
Why? Is Jungji sick again?

701
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,360
He had a fever, so I got him some medicine, 

702
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,500
but it wouldn't go down,

703
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,840
so I had to take him to the doctor's.

704
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,900
Why are you making him sick all the time?

705
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,300
I just can't believe my ears.

706
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,070
I'm making him sick?

707
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,070
Children get sick all the time.

708
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,140
Did I pray for him to get sick?

709
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,060
He's sick because he's a baby.

710
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,540
Anggeum, I heard something like that before.

711
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,460
You're hurting because you're young.

712
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,270
You're hurling because your young?

713
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,770
What's that?

714
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,500
What is that, uncle?

715
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,240
Pay better attention with Jungji!

716
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,360
Why is he getting hurt and sick so often?

717
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,670
That never happened before!

718
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,800
What's wrong with them?

719
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,470
Are they on something?

720
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,460
Who knows? Maybe they are.

721
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,660
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

722
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,200
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

723
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,130
They used to get along great,

724
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,270
but now they're at each other's throats.

725
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,860
When your children get married,

726
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,630
you should see them only once an while.

727
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,400
What about me?

728
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:18,130
Not you.
I'm going to live with you.

729
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,130
I'm home.

730
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,690
Hello.

731
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,660
How's your father doing?

732
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,690
He's gotten much better.

733
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,160
What's wrong with you?

734
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,070
You're driving me crazy!

735
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,400
I'm relying on you to take care of my kids,

736
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,570
but if you're like this, how can I work?

737
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,570
Am I harming your kids?

738
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,240
You should just leave it to me!

739
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,590
But instead, you complain about everything I do, nagging about them.

740
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,460
I didn't feel this way raising my kids,

741
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,500
but I'm going crazy raising yours!

742
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,630
Why don't you raise them, then!

743
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,060
That's not what I'm saying!

744
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,040
Mother, I'm sorry.
Please calm down.

745
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,570
You go upstairs.

746
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,140
This is all your fault!

747
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,190
If you didn't wreck your business,

748
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,690
this wouldn't have happened

749
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,540
What are you up to these days?

750
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,360
If you hired a caregiver,

751
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:10,000
you should be taking care of your kids.

752
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:10,940
I'm sorry.

753
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,740
You're apologizing again.

754
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,890
We're always fighting because of you.

755
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:19,130
Don't you feel anything when you see us?

756
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:25,170
Why did I tell you to move in here?

757
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,630
If anyone wants to raise their grandkids,

758
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,670
I'd tell them not to even think about it.

759
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,070
Nobody should ever do this.

760
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,540
Stop this nonsense or move out!

761
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,400
I don't believe this.

762
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:45,860
I'm already furious,

763
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,230
but I get more annoyed when I come home.

764
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,930
What's wrong?
You're always mad.

765
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,270
Stop fighting with your mother.

766
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,730
She lashes out on me when you do.

767
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,630
She keeps telling us to move out.

768
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,730
It's really stressful for me.

769
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,560
Then why did you go bankrupt?

770
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,970
Just make more money.

771
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,560
I want to move out as soon as possible.

772
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,100
Don't start.

773
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,790
Your mother's already driving me crazy.

774
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,800
Don't pay attention to what my mom says.

775
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,400
Don't act like a girl.

776
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,360
- Like a girl?
- Yes.

777
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:17,560
I'll make money, so you raise the kids.

778
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,960
You're going out again?

779
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,160
I'm going to the gym.

780
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,360
Why are you exercising so hard?

781
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,790
Are you trying to beat someone up?

782
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,200
You've been acting suspicious.

783
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,230
What do you mean?

784
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,960
You're not doing anything fishy, are you?

785
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,240
Mother, I'm a human being.

786
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,460
And I behave like a human being.

787
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:55,360
What are you trying to say?

788
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,670
Who's not behaving like a human being?

789
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,090
Oh, she didn't even bother to answer.

790
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,190
I better destroy her.

791
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,240
Ice cream.

792
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,560
This late? It's cold.

793
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,770
You're supposed to eat it when it's cold.

794
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,540
There's none in the freezer.

795
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,590
Get me some.

796
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,860
Okay.

797
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,960
Who are you?

798
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:34,790
Wait, wait!

799
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,370
Please don't kill me.

800
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:37,960
I didn't do anything!

801
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,090
Please don't kill me.

802
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,790
I have a wife and children.

803
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:51,740
Ouch! Blood! Blood! I'm bleeding!

804
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,870
Help...

805
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,290
You!

806
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:30,340
The house feels empty.

807
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:32,900
It's not. We're all here.

808
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:35,900
It feels like ten people are gone.

809
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,500
Doesn't it?

810
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,400
I feel really sad lately.

811
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,800
The house feels empty and so big.

812
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,240
Without Sangnam,

813
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,860
I don't want to come home anymore.

814
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,500
What's wrong with you?

815
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,300
Why don't you want to come home?

816
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,800
Miho, why are you talking like that?

817
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:57,300
What she said was right.

818
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,940
I think you have to let him win.

819
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,070
Why do you think Sangnam left?

820
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,100
He's rude, that's why.

821
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,090
They're both rude.
A match made in heaven!

822
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,540
You're going to lose your son.

823
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:12,130
If he was like other kids,

824
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:15,670
he'd already be married with kids.

825
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,000
I wouldn't let that happen!

826
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,630
You wouldn't?

827
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,500
I thought you wanted grandchildren.

828
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,340
Don't regret it later and let him do it.

829
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,740
That's what you should do.

830
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,390
They don't need your permission to marry.

831
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,040
You stay out of this.

832
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:33,070
Daese.

833
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,470
You stay out, too.

834
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,830
You're so mean.

835
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:37,570
Miho, you stay out!

836
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,600
Sunjeong,

837
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,040
call Sangnam and have him come home tonight.

838
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:03,440
Tell him I have something to say.

839
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:04,800
Okay.

840
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,300
I got you!

841
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,270
What are you doing?
Let me go! Let me go!

842
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,630
[Divorce Agreement]

843
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:29,000
What are you waiting for? 

844
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,160
Look. Doctor's report.

845
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,900
I got 2 weeks.

846
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:40,570
Do you know what you did?

847
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,900
You didn't know this means divorce?

848
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:48,040
If you don't sign it, I'm going to sue.

849
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,840
Sue, okay?

850
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:53,800
I will.

851
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,130
You should've done it a long time ago.

852
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,270
Don't waste anymore time.

853
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,130
Stop leaking on it!

854
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:24,860
It should be clean.

855
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:28,670
If the judge saw that, he wouldn't like it!

856
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,670
I didn't know you were so strong.

857
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,670
Where did you learn to fight?

858
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,000
I can't believe this.

859
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:37,570
You're just unbelievable.

860
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:41,000
What little love I had left is now gone.

861
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,840
It was attempted murder, don't you know?

862
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,940
Oh, it hurts.

863
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:06,500
See you at noon tomorrow in front of the courthouse.

864
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,900
Hold on.

865
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:15,570
I'm sorry, Sedal.

866
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,540
I went too far, didn't I?

867
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:21,500
I'm really sorry.

868
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:25,440
And I want to thank you.

869
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,670
In the past 36 years,

870
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,860
the only good memories

871
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:36,190
are the ones with you in them.

872
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:41,730
You're the only good memory I have.

873
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:47,360
You made me smile and you made me happy.

874
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,470
It's the truth.

875
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:56,340
You gave me two sons whom I treasure.

876
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:02,670
To me you're essential.

877
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,300
If you're that grateful,

878
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:07,740
give me a present by divorcing me.

879
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,190
I'll see you tomorrow at the courthouse.

880
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,960
Is this what you really want?

881
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,500
I don't joke around.

882
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:18,170
Please reconsider this.

883
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,070
I'm done considering.

884
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,070
I'm only thirty five.

885
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,970
When will I get another chance like this?

886
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,560
I'll wait for you,

887
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,570
if you promise to come back to me.

888
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,240
Don't.

889
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,960
Why would you?

890
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,460
Let's end this.

891
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,190
Sedal,

892
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,170
we're not important here.

893
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:44,590
You should think about our sons.

894
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,330
They need their dad.

895
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:52,740
Sintong and Bangtong miss their dad.

896
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,330
This is what Bangtong said.

897
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:59,670
He said dad, mom, Sintong and him,

898
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,000
the four make up his family.

899
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:04,500
They'll understand when they're older.

900
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,500
We're over, so what good can they do?

901
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:11,630
Don't dwell on me and start a new life.

902
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,270
Being divorced isn't a problem now.

903
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,960
Lots of people get divorced and do well.

904
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:24,960
I don't think this is going to work.

905
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:26,730
Come with me.

906
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:29,540
To where?

907
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:32,440
Let's get a room near the court

908
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:35,360
and submit this first thing in the morning.

909
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:40,270
I'll be there.

910
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,900
I already signed it.

911
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,840
You better come.

912
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,970
Or I'm going to the police.

913
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,230
I'll see you tomorrow.

914
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,900
At the cafe before,

915
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,440
what did you tell the girl who works there?

916
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,670
She seemed pretty scared.

917
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,500
I gave her a piece of my mind.

918
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:13,090
She was mean to me when I worked there.

919
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:19,330
You should help the people you work with instead of trying to be their boss!

920
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:23,400
That's the ugliest thing in the world! Ugly!

921
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,270
What do you think?

922
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:29,930
It must have been hard for you.

923
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,170
It was,

924
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,200
but breaking up with you was harder.

925
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,730
But we never broke up.

926
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,570
You know exactly what to say.

927
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:44,540
You're right.
We never broke up.

928
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:51,170
Standing in front of your house reminds me of something.

929
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:55,360
Oh, no.

930
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,540
What?

931
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,860
I meant us talking on the phone all night.

932
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:01,790
How could you always think about that?

933
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:05,570
I don't know!

934
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,060
Good job.
You did really well.

935
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,700
She did well?

936
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,690
Yes. Law school won't be a problem.

937
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,130
She'll need a bit of luck, of course.

938
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,230
- Incredible.
- I know.

939
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,730
I haven't been this happy in a while.

940
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,270
Jayeong is taking the test again next year.

941
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,900
Her mom was crying so hard.

942
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,940
I bought everyone lunch, but I felt bad.

943
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,970
You bought them lunch already?

944
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:34,560
They called me a judge's mom, so I had to.

945
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,870
I bought them pizza.

946
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,140
Goof off went to law school, too.

947
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,060
How can you say that?

948
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,170
How dare you compare Haebak to Goof off?

949
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,630
You say the most inappropriate things.

950
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,790
Are you still going to the gym?

951
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,340
Yes.

952
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:57,360
You should travel with your friends before you start college.

953
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,500
- We're here.
- Hello.

954
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,400
- Hi!
- Hello.

955
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,540
- Welcome, welcome.
- Come in.

956
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:04,190
You look even more handsome.

957
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,960
Did you get a facial or something?

958
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,230
Thank you.

959
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,040
When will we meet your father?

960
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,730
Soon. Please pick a date.

961
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,230
When do you want the wedding to be?

962
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,430
After the winter. Like next spring.

963
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:24,900
I want to have it this year.

964
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:27,000
We have less than a month.

965
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,400
I'm not sure if that's possible.

966
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:32,040
Mom, we want a simple wedding.

967
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:37,470
Oh, look at her!
 She's just dying to get married.

968
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:38,630
Grandmother!

969
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,170
You know me so well.

970
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,060
Oh, boy.

971
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,500
I want a simple but meaningful wedding.

972
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,940
Then talk to your father and pick a date.

973
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:53,440
I will.

974
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,400
What do we do about your father?

975
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,360
I'll take care of it.

976
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:05,590
Don't say anything to your parents.

977
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,000
I won't.

978
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,300
It's one obstacle after another.

979
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,700
Why is getting married so hard?

980
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,360
If it's easy, it won't be fun.

981
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:39,230
Father, I'm here.

982
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,960
I'm going to be stubborn, too.

983
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:46,830
I can't accept her as my daughter in law.

984
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,200
Instead,

985
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,500
let's have a daughter in law audition.

986
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,070
Excuse me?

987
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:00,700
A daughter in law audition?

988
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,830
They have lots of audition shows on TV.

989
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,370
If she passes the audition,

990
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:09,500
I'll accept her.

991
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:57,860
Can I ask you something?

992
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,290
Okay.

993
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:01,800
Is there a dry cleaner's near here?

994
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:04,070
A dry cleaner's?

995
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,900
Oh,

996
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,700
when you go out that way

997
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,190
and turn right...

998
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:13,300
What are you doing?

999
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:29,860
Where am I? Who are you?

1000
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:32,790
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?

1001
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:34,240
Let me go!

1002
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,730
Why are you doing this to me? Hey!

1003
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,500
Hey!

1004
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:40,170
Let me go!

1005
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,360
Why are you doing this to me?

1006
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:46,690
Hey! Hey! Let me go! Let me go!

1007
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:59,960
Uh... Hello?

1008
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:03,070
Is anyone there?

1009
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,540
Hey!

1010
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:09,170
Is anyone there?

1011
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,790
Is anyone there!

1012
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:31,180
Subtitles by KBS World

1013
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,340
Is something up?

1014
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,970
Gwangbak! I've been kid...

1015
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:38,790
How can a mom come home in the morning?

1016
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:41,340
Are you sick or something?

1017
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:42,170
Excuse me?

1018
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,360
You should see a doctor.

1019
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,560
What do you want?

1020
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:46,000
Get me $100,000 by the end of today.

1021
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:48,360
Where can I get that amount of money?

1022
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:49,730
You better not call the police.

1023
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,460
You cut your finger doing that? Man...

1024
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,800
Hey! Time is crucial for a burn wound!

1025
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:59,140
What if something goes wrong to my mother?

1026
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:01,590
Forget about the mean mother in law.

1027
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,860
Pretend you got a new mother.

1028
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,090
I'll be good to you.
