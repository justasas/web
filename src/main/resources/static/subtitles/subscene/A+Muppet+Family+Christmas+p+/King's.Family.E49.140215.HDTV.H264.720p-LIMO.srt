2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,060
Mr. Ko was at Aeji's kindergarten.

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,040
One, two, three!

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,000
Warm water. It'll warm you up.

5
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,270
I don't know why I feel this way.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,590
I keep having second thoughts.

7
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,960
It's so hard.

8
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,840
You don't look very well.

9
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,770
Why did you go to the river in this cold?

10
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:58,290
I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing.

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,790
I wanted to be a good mom for Miho,

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,590
but I don't feel he's come to me all the way.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,590
Tell him about Miho.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,890
He'll change if he knows Miho is his.

15
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,640
No, I don't want to do that.

16
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,930
He's hesitating and I refuse to tell him about Miho to get him to come to me.

17
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,840
It makes me feel too desperate.

18
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,400
I can't use Miho like that.

19
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,540
What's wrong with doing that?

20
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,070
He has to know she's his child.

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,170
I don't want to push his child on him,

22
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,730
as if that's going to divide him in half.

23
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,700
I'm not doing that.

24
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,490
When everything is over, I'll tell him.

25
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,140
Sunjeong, give him some time.

26
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,470
Men can tell good men apart.

27
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,300
I think he's a serious and sincere man.

28
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,140
I know that.

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,000
I do,

30
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,200
but I don't know what to do with how I feel.

31
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:13,040
Trying to be nice is driving me crazy.

32
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,260
Whenever his ex-wife's family bothers me,

33
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,730
I want to pay them back,

34
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,790
but I've been holding it in.

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,030
I'm afraid that would make him leave me.

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,460
I don't want to lose him again.

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,670
Then don't.

38
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,170
If you do, you're a fool.

39
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,200
Your friends are so funny.

40
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,470
Mom!

41
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,970
Where were you?

42
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,340
The market.

43
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,760
Mr. Ko cooked noodles.

44
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,990
He's really great at it.

45
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,100
He is?

46
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,000
You're not busy?

47
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,270
I pulled an all nighter, so I came to take a nap

48
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,040
and Miho was here so we ate some noodles.

49
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,870
Miho has a cold.

50
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,260
It's too cold here.

51
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,260
We should move to the apartment quickly.

52
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,700
It's okay. I'm better now.

53
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,000
Mom, Mr. Ko, I'm going to the academy.

54
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,240
Are you sure you're okay?

55
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,600
Yes. I don't have a fever now.

56
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,890
Be safe.

57
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,590
Miho, see you later.

58
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,090
I disappointed you, didn't I?

59
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,030
I'm sorry I made you feel that way.

60
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,360
I should've dropped by last night,

61
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,740
but I was just too busy.

62
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,500
I thought this last night.

63
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,970
Miho was sick and I was conflicted.

64
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,030
Why am I here going through this?

65
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,360
I kept thinking, what am I doing here?

66
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,830
Sunjeong, just hold on a little more.

67
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,460
Just a little more.

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,740
I'm going to your father.

69
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,500
Can you go alone?

70
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,670
I'll walk slowly. I can use the workout.

71
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,140
How can you leave your post again?

72
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,590
I went to throw the trash out.

73
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,890
You keep wandering around.

74
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,530
This is too much.

75
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,830
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,730
It won't happen again.

77
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,470
I'm sick of hearing that.

78
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,790
What were you thinking?

79
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,840
If you don't want to work, quit.

80
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,640
You got fired, remember?

81
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,890
You're not a vice principal anymore.

82
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,370
You have to do a better job.

83
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,890
You think making money is easy?

84
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,500
Go clean the bathroom.

85
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,100
What are you doing?

86
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,060
When did you come?

87
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,500
You old hags!

88
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,170
What did you say?
Shut your traps!

89
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,640
Say it again.

90
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,460
Stop it.

91
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,990
Are you all out of you minds?

92
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,240
You think you can mistreat him?

93
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,300
Is owning this building that special?

94
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,500
My parents had a bathroom bigger than this!

95
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,370
It's so dark it looks haunted.

96
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,240
How dare you mistreat my husband!

97
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,830
And what are you?

98
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,000
Aren't you renting here?

99
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,500
Got fired and no longer a vice principal and what?

100
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,100
He is a very well-respected man.

101
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,290
How dare you talk to him like that?

102
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,670
Who knows where you'll be when you get old?

103
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,260
What do you think you're doing?

104
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,030
I'm doing the right thing!

105
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,760
He's quitting so find someone else!

106
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,870
Let's go.

107
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,970
Don't do this.

108
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,140
Let's go. You don't need this job.

109
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,700
I'll get a job. I will!

110
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,800
Don't forget to wire his paycheck.

111
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,040
What the...

112
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,390
Come!

113
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,490
Ouch. My back.

114
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,470
Screaming hurt my bones.

115
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,200
Why did you come?

116
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm glad I did.

117
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,390
Those darn women.

118
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,730
I would've beat them up if it weren't for my back.

119
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,140
You've done enough.

120
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,960
What kind of job are you going to get?

121
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,290
- Huh?
- You said you'll get a job.

122
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,040
So I can stay home and do nothing?

123
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,140
Hold on.

124
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,160
When I'm better, I'll look for a job.

125
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,960
I hope people don't say I'm too old.

126
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,070
You worked to provide for me for 40 years

127
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,540
so I should do the same for you to call it even.

128
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,560
I think I married incredibly well.

129
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,460
You were amazing.

130
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,290
You were like Joan of Arc.

131
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,960
I didn't get much education,

132
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,290
but having a teacher as a husband made me proud.

133
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,040
I'm not well educated,

134
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,830
but people respected me because of you.

135
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,940
So I can't see you suffering like that.

136
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,390
You do what you want to do from now on.

137
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,930
You don't have to make money.

138
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,830
You've already done enough of that.

139
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,200
Thanks.

140
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,160
Honey,

141
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,030
let's not be greedy.

142
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,030
I thought about it while lying on my back,

143
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,760
and life isn't all that special.

144
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,860
When you die, it's over,

145
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,030
so there's no need to expose yourself to that kind of abuse.

146
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,760
But we need a house.

147
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,100
Who cares if we don't have one?

148
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,890
It's okay to rent,

149
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,160
as long as we have a roof over our head.

150
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,660
What's the use of buying a house now?

151
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,140
I was once a homeowner.

152
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,790
The experience was enough for me.

153
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,890
Are you sure?

154
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,060
Nothing really bothers me anymore.

155
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,090
Crying about money won't change anything.

156
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,170
What about the doorplate?

157
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,000
I wanted to hang that up again.

158
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,600
Then hang it up on your chest.

159
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,240
That'll do.

160
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,240
Son?

161
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,160
What's that?

162
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,530
Seaweed soup.

163
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,840
But it's not anyone's birthday.

164
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,170
It doesn't have to be someone's birthday.

165
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,940
Sweetheart, can we talk...

166
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,930
I don't want to talk about that.

167
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,370
She wants you to bring her food?

168
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,840
No.

169
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,300
I'm going to teach her a lesson.

170
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,370
Why does she have to treat my precious son like a servant?

171
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,160
Let her come out and eat.

172
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,430
You don't know what you're talking about.

173
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,730
Get up and eat.

174
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,330
Mother's angry, isn't she?

175
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,740
I don't care what she says.

176
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,640
Not when my wife is dying here.

177
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,790
Eat up.

178
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,240
Is it good?

179
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,260
You're better than me.

180
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,730
It's delicious.

181
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,600
Eat up. Eat some rice, too.

182
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,100
Sedal.

183
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,290
About the baby...

184
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,370
Let's have another one.

185
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,830
But I'm not getting drunk this time.

186
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,970
Let's do it right. Plan it.

187
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,800
Father, you're being mean about my family.

188
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,060
I'm very disappointed.

189
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,870
Father,

190
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,500
please stop hating me.

191
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:21,340
Can you please be more understanding...

192
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,140
I have to take the trash to my...

193
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,070
What are you doing?

194
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,330
Nothing.

195
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,040
Thinking about ways to torture Gwangbak?

196
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,260
Please don't say things like that.

197
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,370
She's the one who's torturing me.

198
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,890
Father, how was your day?

199
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,370
It was good.

200
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,200
Father, I'm really sorry.

201
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,490
I don't know what came over me.

202
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,700
I swear it will never ever happen again.

203
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,660
Please forgive me.

204
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,430
Whatever. Follow me.

205
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,640
Have a seat.

206
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,860
Sit down.

207
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,940
You must sit down first.

208
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,160
I said sit down!

209
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,740
I'll do it.

210
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,600
Just sit there.

211
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,940
Okay.

212
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,140
- Your seat is...
- It's okay.

213
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,640
I have to sit here to drink with you.

214
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,660
Excuse me?

215
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,960
I must get drunk to make us even.

216
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,140
You like being even.

217
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,290
I'm sorry, father.

218
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,870
I was so mad I couldn't sleep.

219
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,970
Father, let's say I lost.

220
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,200
Let's say?

221
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,090
You're letting me win?

222
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,340
No, it's not that.

223
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,600
Let's compete fair and square.

224
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,870
How's that?

225
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,870
Why? You're afraid?

226
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,070
No.

227
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:38,160
Let's put a wager on this, then.

228
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,960
The winner gets a wish.

229
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,370
What?

230
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,260
Nothing, father. I'm sorry.

231
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,790
Okay.

232
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,530
That's actually a good idea.

233
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,090
You won't regret it later?

234
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,970
I won't. How about you?

235
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,300
Of course not, since I'm going to win.

236
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,000
We don't know that.

237
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,890
You think you can beat me?

238
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,470
I've been drinking with construction workers.

239
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,640
Okay.

240
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,030
Fine. Let's do this.

241
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,160
Okay. Go!

242
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,140
Go!

243
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,930
Okay!

244
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,860
Go!

245
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,760
Here.

246
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,290
Bottoms up!

247
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,790
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up.

248
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,830
Bottoms up.

249
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,700
Gwangbak,

250
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,390
love shot.

251
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,190
Okay, father!

252
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,260
You know?

253
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,790
You shouldn't be that way...

254
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,000
Uh, father!

255
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,470
Father!

256
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,290
Yes! Yes!

257
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,640
I won.

258
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,200
I wo...

259
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,790
Are you asleep?

260
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,190
No.

261
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,230
What are you doing?

262
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,830
It's not working.

263
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,300
What made you get a job as a security guard?

264
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,470
You've always been a teacher.

265
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,660
You've never done any hard labor at all.

266
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,430
After quitting my job,

267
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,190
I felt really lost.

268
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,370
I thought, "Why didn't I prepare for this?"

269
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,140
I felt really empty inside.

270
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,960
People nowadays live to be 100,

271
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,460
but I've done nothing to prepare for that.

272
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,530
I knew it in my head,

273
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,640
but I was hit really hard

274
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,300
because I thought things would work out.

275
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,140
Take a break.

276
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,100
We can live off of your retirement fund.

277
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:24,690
I should work while I can.

278
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,990
I can't handle staying home.

279
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,730
If I did, I would have to take care of you.

280
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,330
I'd rather work.

281
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,640
I want you to take care of me.

282
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,840
Bathroom.

283
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,640
Huh? Can you make it?

284
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,840
Yes.

285
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,100
Okay, okay.

286
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,470
- Should I come in?
- Don't be silly!

287
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,070
Bong, stay there, okay?

288
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,460
Are you jealous of Yeongdal?

289
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,030
Of course.

290
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,770
I'll be just like her in my next life.

291
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,100
Start being like her now.

292
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,190
Why would you wait until your next life?

293
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,990
Bong, is your bottom freezing?

294
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,570
Oh, laughing makes my bones ache.

295
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,930
Water.

296
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,070
Father.

297
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,300
What's that?
It smells good.

298
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,770
Oh, I made hangover soup.

299
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,670
Father, I won.

300
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,030
What do you mean?

301
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,700
The drinking competition.

302
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,190
What drinking competition?

303
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,560
Don't you remember?

304
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,970
A drinking competition with you?

305
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,260
I can't believe my ears.

306
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,000
I stole your mother's line.

307
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,640
Father, you said the winner gets a wish.

308
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,600
I never said that.

309
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,430
Father, just a minute.

310
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,440
What is it?

311
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,890
If that's true,

312
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,300
why do I have a picture like this?

313
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,300
He looks just like you, right?

314
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,600
You!

315
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,390
Go wash up, father.

316
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,460
I'll set the table.

317
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,730
I tried to make it like Aunt Sunjeong.

318
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,960
I hope it's good.

319
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,060
How is it, father?

320
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,890
It's not bad.

321
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,370
Where did you learn to drink like that?

322
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,500
My father taught me.

323
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,640
You can hold your liquor.

324
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,840
I was told never to get drunk before the elderly.

325
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,430
Father, can I tell you my wish?

326
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,600
No thanks.

327
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,540
How can you and I have a drinking competition to begin with?

328
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,540
Don't ever mention it again.

329
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,930
Take a look inside.

330
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,530
It's a contract for cafe.

331
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,300
Why are you giving this...

332
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,200
I want you to manage it.

333
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,960
Excuse me?

334
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,690
You want to be a writer?

335
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,060
Who was that?

336
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,930
The Harry Potter writer wrote at a cafe?

337
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,730
Don't dawdle at home.

338
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,530
Go write at the cafe.

339
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,930
Father!

340
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,960
You can spend the profit any way you want.

341
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,890
Excuse me?

342
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,800
You can spend it or give it to your parents.

343
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,540
Don't take trash to your parents.

344
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,740
Father!

345
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,700
Hey!

346
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,530
Watch out for the soup.

347
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,930
Father, thank you!

348
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,990
Thank you so much.

349
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,160
And delete that photo.

350
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,490
I will.

351
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,030
Salla.

352
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,730
Please go.

353
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,990
You saw how my son reacted.

354
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,990
But we haven't met formally.

355
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,590
Let me meet him.

356
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,600
It's okay.

357
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,570
I don't want to break his heart.

358
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,740
Why is our dating breaking his heart?

359
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,030
I'll talk to him.

360
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,840
My son is very stubborn.

361
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,070
Please leave.

362
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,570
What we had is over.

363
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,370
It's not over.

364
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,270
Please leave.

365
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,040
Hurry.

366
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,160
Mom.

367
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,660
Mom, what is it?
What's wrong.

368
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,370
It's nothing.

369
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,890
You can tell me.

370
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,070
Ouch! That stung. Ouch...

371
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,240
Oh, this is nuts.

372
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,970
Who is it?

373
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,960
Sedal, it's me.

374
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,690
Didn't you go to work?

375
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,390
What's wrong with you?
You're so selfish.

376
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,640
Why?

377
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,540
Let mom get married.

378
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,260
Did she tell you to say that?

379
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,270
You're married and have 2 kids,

380
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,140
so why won't you let mom get married?

381
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,730
Mom was crying.

382
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,430
She broke up with him because of you.

383
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,300
Good for her.

384
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,390
You are so selfish.

385
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,600
Mom should live her life.

386
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,390
She had a tough life raising us.

387
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,300
I realized something after I got married.

388
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,240
How amazing it is to have a husband.

389
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,660
She's finally found someone nice.

390
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,030
You only care about your own happiness?

391
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,940
Thinking about mom chokes me up.

392
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,430
Imagine how lonely she must have been.

393
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,160
We should be helping her get married.

394
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,600
Say something.

395
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,270
I have nothing to say.

396
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,640
Sedal!

397
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,270
You stay out of this!

398
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,900
Why should I?

399
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,190
I don't want to talk about mom.

400
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,930
Don't you feel sorry for her?

401
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,640
I do!

402
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,540
That's why I'm saying no.

403
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,970
You don't know anything.

404
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,370
You think you're the only one who loves mom?

405
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,040
I love mom, too.

406
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,540
But she doesn't need to get married.

407
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,040
She can live happily ever after with me.

408
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:23,940
Mom wants to live happily ever after with him, not you!

409
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,290
You stay out.
I'll take care of it.

410
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,870
You...

411
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,430
I'm the eldest son.

412
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,460
I'll take care of mom,

413
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,730
so you stay out.

414
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,560
Look what you made me do!

415
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,890
It's all sewn up!

416
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,600
Then rip it back up.

417
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,600
Watch me!
I'm getting her married!

418
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,930
You better not!

419
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,460
Go home.
I can't stand the sight of you!

420
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,640
I gave it a lot of thought,

421
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,570
and I build up the courage to come see you.

422
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,970
I'm not even sure if this is right.

423
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,890
It must have been very hard for you.

424
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,300
I'm sorry for what my family's done to you.

425
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,930
Minjung

426
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,760
is like a son to me.

427
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,440
He was my daughter's husband,

428
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,840
but I relied on him.

429
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,690
It's very hard for me, so I could only

430
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,530
imagine how my wife or Subak feels.

431
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,960
Please take good care of Minjung.

432
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:25,640
I know you'll be kind to Aeji and Jungji, too.

433
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,870
Mr. Wang.

434
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,500
I think this is the answer.

435
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,690
Dragging on won't help anyone.

436
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:44,830
I'll talk to my family,

437
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,300
so don't pay attention to them.

438
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:53,000
Even if anything happens again,

439
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,090
just ignore it.

440
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,690
Thank you. Thank you.

441
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:08,140
What could I possibly tell you here?

442
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:14,340
I'm so sorry about everything.

443
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:21,030
I'll take good care of the kids and pray for their mom's happiness.

444
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,430
Thank you so much.

445
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,140
He said that?

446
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,000
It broke my heart.

447
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,260
It couldn't have been an easy decision.

448
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,740
It was very gracious of him.

449
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,690
Let's make it work.

450
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,600
If we're happy, everything will work out.

451
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,370
Okay.

452
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,500
What did you say?

453
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,690
Don't go to Minjung from now on.

454
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,260
He's not family anymore.

455
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,570
And give him the kids.

456
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,970
Honey.

457
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,330
This is the right thing to do.

458
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,690
Don't hold on to him anymore.

459
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,430
He won't come back, even if you do.

460
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,530
Send the kids to Minjung, just as you agreed.

461
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,600
I can't.

462
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,430
I'm going to raise them.

463
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,790
Subak...

464
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,970
Then what about Subak?

465
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,030
What about our poor Subak?

466
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,340
She can't drag him back to her life.

467
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,070
Admit it. It's over.

468
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,970
Some things can't be forced.

469
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,030
Setting Minjung free is the right thing.

470
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,970
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

471
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,340
First, second, third, fourth. That one.

472
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,070
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

473
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,840
Is it done?
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

474
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,300
It's okay.
We didn't have much stuff.

475
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,040
Thank you.
I'll come straight home after work.

476
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,340
Let's have a party.

477
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,970
Okay, Minjung.

478
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,890
Mom, I'm so happy.

479
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,140
This is my first room.

480
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,490
Miho, let's have a party.
Wear a dress.

481
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,990
Are you going somewhere?

482
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,530
No, but we're celebrating you.

483
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,040
Me? Why is that?

484
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,170
Because you deserve it.

485
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,030
Oh, no...

486
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,000
What is it?

487
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,330
Look.

488
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,640
What do we do?

489
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,140
It's over 39°C.

490
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,570
Take him to the hospital.

491
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,770
Call Minjung.
Tell him to bring his car.

492
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,670
But Bong told us not to!

493
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,890
But he needs to know his son is sick!

494
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,070
Mother, help her.

495
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,040
Okay.

496
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,990
Ouch, my back.

497
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,140
It's okay, it's okay.

498
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,740
Ship these out by the end of the day.

499
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,560
These new products will go out tomorrow.

500
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,870
- Okay.
- Good.

501
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,440
The person you called is unavailable...

502
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,500
Hello?

503
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,690
It's me. Where is he?
Put him on the phone.

504
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,490
He's at work.
What's going on?

505
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,530
Jungji's burning up!
We're at the hospital!

506
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,500
Hospital?

507
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,390
Okay. Hold on.
I'll try calling him.

508
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,730
Minjung!

509
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,560
What's wrong?

510
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,600
Why won't you answer your phone?

511
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,890
I left it at my office.
What's wrong?

512
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,230
Jungji is sick. 
He's at the hospital.

513
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,590
You should go.

514
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,340
Why won't you answer your phone?

515
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,770
What did the doctor say?

516
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,090
It's enteritis.

517
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,800
Are they admitting him?

518
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,340
What do I do...

519
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,540
Stay here.
I'll go see his doctor.

520
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,640
I got dressed up for nothing.

521
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,690
You can wear it again next time.

522
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,290
Mr. Ko isn't coming home?
Where did he go?

523
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,340
Jungji's at the hospital, so he went there.

524
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:47,240
You used to look happy with him before,

525
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,030
but these days, you don't.

526
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,500
Minjung, Minjung.

527
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,690
What is it?

528
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,160
The doctor said he's okay now.

529
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,000
He can go home.

530
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,800
Good. Thank you.

531
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,390
Jungji,

532
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,600
thank you for pulling through.

533
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,500
My baby...

534
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,100
Don't ever get sick again.

535
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,760
Take Jungji.

536
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,840
Oh...

537
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,230
Take him with you.

538
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,690
You'll take good care of him, won't you?

539
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,900
You won't mistreat him.

540
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,800
You'll be good to him, right?

541
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,190
Subak.

542
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,540
I thought long and hard about it.

543
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:43,300
My father's right.
This is how it should be.

544
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,890
I'm grateful for her sending you right away.

545
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:52,070
And I'm grateful you stayed by Jungji's side.

546
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,690
You didn't even send each other a text.

547
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,460
You really impressed me.

548
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,900
I'll send Aeji and the kids stuff later.

549
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:19,670
Jungji, I'm sorry. Mom's sorry.

550
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,400
Be good. Don't get sick.

551
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,790
Be well and healthy.

552
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,930
Oh, my boy...

553
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,960
Goodbye.

554
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:17,190
Why are you here alone?
Where's Jungji?

555
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,830
He's gone.

556
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,930
And I'm sending Aeji, too.

557
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,000
Subak!

558
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,170
Mom.

559
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,840
I'm going to be successful.

560
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,370
I may not be much now,

561
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:05,100
but I'll be successful

562
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:08,290
and bring my kids back.

563
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,190
Aeji, mom's going to make lots of money.

564
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,660
Stay with dad until then.

565
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,870
No, no!

566
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,370
I want to live with you and grandma!

567
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:38,600
Just wait until I make money.

568
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,370
No!

569
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,270
Take her.

570
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,870
Okay.

571
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,940
Let's go.

572
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,160
Mom!

573
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,700
- Aeji!
- Subak.

574
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,770
Don't look.

575
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,300
Mom...

576
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,870
- Aeji.
- Subak!

577
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,640
Subak!

578
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,060
Subak! Subak!

579
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,660
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

580
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,900
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

581
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,470
I know.

582
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,730
I'm never going to part with my baby.

583
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,230
Here.

584
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,370
Aeji, you can use this room with Miho.

585
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,340
This is mine.

586
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,230
Okay. You take the bed.

587
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,040
Mom, I can sleep on the floor. It's okay.

588
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,230
Okay.

589
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,390
I'll buy you a nicer one when we move.

590
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,770
No, no, no.

591
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,230
No! You'll die!
 You'll die if you do that.

592
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,000
Hey, hey.

593
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,570
You died.

594
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,030
Oh, boy.

595
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:29,070
No, no! You'll die. You'll die. No.

596
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,640
Oh, boy.

597
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,540
Should we stop?

598
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,340
No, no.

599
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,330
Dad, I want to play more.

600
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,390
Just once, then.

601
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,140
Dad, you're the best.

602
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,040
Okay.

603
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:53,370
Mom, can I call Mr. Ko dad?

604
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,740
- Do you want to?
- Yes.

605
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,100
Then go ahead.

606
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,690
Say, "Dad, let's eat."

607
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:04,640
Dad, let's eat.

608
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,640
Huh?

609
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,140
No! He's not your dad!

610
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:14,000
He's my dad!

611
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:21,040
He's my dad. No, no!

612
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,870
Okay, okay. I'm your dad. I'm your dad.

613
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,560
I'm not her dad. I'm your dad.

614
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,790
Have you ever done this kind of work before?

615
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,600
No, I've never done this before.

616
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:41,400
You have a friendly face, so you'll be good.

617
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,840
There is a two week training period.

618
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,600
Do I have to do that?

619
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,000
Yes.

620
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:54,600
You must learn about our bags and about haw to deal with customers.

621
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,830
Can you do it?

622
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,830
Yes, I can.

623
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,260
The best shop and the best manager,

624
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,140
Wang Hobak!

625
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,670
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

626
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,800
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

627
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,470
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

628
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,640
Dad!

629
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,500
Yay!

630
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,940
Mom!

631
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,500
What? Is that true?

632
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,540
Yes. I won 1st place.

633
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:32,960
You won 1st place?
I can't believe my ears!

634
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,790
My company had a contest,

635
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,890
and the 1st place winner gets a shop.

636
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,570
Good.

637
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:44,260
Honey, Don's luck is finally changing.

638
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,460
I owe it all to you, mom.

639
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,890
I made a healthy pizza thinking of you.

640
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,400
What did you make?

641
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,270
- You like pumpkin, right?
- Yes.

642
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,690
I used chicken breast and pumpkin.

643
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,790
Oh, that sounds yummy.

644
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,760
I'm getting a shop next week.

645
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,100
Bong, please come.
Anggeum, you too.

646
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,500
You're the best, the best.

647
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:10,140
Oh, hey, you...
Not here...

648
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,340
I'm so happy.

649
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,460
It's okay. You can fall over.

650
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,800
Let's go to sleep.

651
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:32,030
How's Aeji? Is she okay?

652
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,840
She just feel asleep.

653
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,990
Being away from her mom must be hard.

654
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,230
She's sleeping in our room?

655
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,690
Miho's not sleeping in the bed because of her.

656
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,690
I'll sleep with her for a while.

657
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,100
Did you tell Miho to do it?

658
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,290
To call me dad?

659
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,560
No, Miho wanted to.

660
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,660
I'm grateful,

661
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,400
but I don't think she should for now.

662
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,000
Aeji keeps crying.

663
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,400
But Miho is...

664
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,190
It's nothing.

665
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,540
Mom.

666
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,770
You weren't sleeping?

667
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,770
I won't call Mr. Ko dad.

668
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,160
Mom, I'm sorry.

669
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,000
It's okay.

670
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,460
You shouldn't be sorry.

671
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:08,540
So don't say you're sorry.

672
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,600
You're not sleeping?

673
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:27,190
I have to study.
You're not sleepy?

674
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,270
You aunt wants water.

675
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,370
What a nice husband.

676
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,370
I've never seen you study before.

677
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,960
You hated studying when you were a student.

678
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:40,330
But I have to, if I want to make money.

679
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,100
Don't you feel sorry for her?

680
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,790
She broke up with him.

681
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,640
Mom was crying.

682
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,300
Mom.

683
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,930
Mom, are you asleep?

684
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,240
If you're not, can we talk?

685
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,160
Mom.

686
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,730
Mom.

687
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,840
Mom...

688
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,870
This is nutty, nutty, nuts.

689
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,370
Daese.

690
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,970
Salla.

691
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:44,290
I missed you so much.

692
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,640
But this is the last time.

693
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,260
Why is that?

694
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,900
Don't ask too many questions.

695
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:58,170
I came to tell you this is the last time.

696
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,190
You made me happy.

697
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,500
Thank you for making my heart flutter.

698
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,230
You made me feel like a woman again.

699
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,560
I will never forget that.

700
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:21,060
I hope you meet someone nice.

701
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,430
Salla!

702
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,500
Salla!

703
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,300
Salla!

704
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,900
Thank you for coming to meet me.

705
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,290
I wanted to see you, so I'm glad you called.

706
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,640
Let's cut to the chase.

707
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,230
What do you do?

708
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:08,490
How come so many are into heavy equipment?

709
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:10,500
I don't trust business cards.

710
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,730
You can get them made anywhere.

711
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,800
But it's real...

712
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,140
I came to ask you for a favor.

713
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,670
Stop calling my mom out.

714
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,500
Please leave her alone.

715
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:28,000
I can make Salla happy.

716
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,300
May I ask why you're against me?

717
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,490
If I need to change...

718
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,800
Just break up with her.

719
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,600
If you call my mom again,

720
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,560
I won't let you get away with that.

721
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,600
I feel like I've seen him somewhere.

722
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,740
Where have I seen him?

723
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,270
Be my pony.

724
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,140
Sure.

725
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:13,940
Get on.

726
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,460
Giddy up, giddy up!

727
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,140
Trot, trot.

728
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,370
Giddy up, giddy up.

729
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,170
Why don't you play with your doll?

730
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,800
Aeji, let's play with your dolls.

731
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,030
No, no!

732
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,800
I want a pony ride.

733
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:35,430
Giddy up, giddy up. Trot, trot.

734
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,240
I'm done.

735
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:43,370
Oh, no! Are you hurt?

736
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,230
Why did you make her cry?

737
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,830
Miho, why didn't you take better care of her?

738
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,390
Aeji tripped getting off from Miho's back.

739
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:55,500
Aeji doesn't like stuff like that.

740
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,900
Aeji, don't cry.

741
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,770
Welcome.

742
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:09,840
We'll learn about service manners.

743
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,990
Anyone can have a good first impression.

744
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:16,440
When a customer comes in, smile brightly,

745
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,700
tuck your stomach in and say "Hello, welcome."

746
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,960
Hello, welcome.

747
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,640
Thank you, come again.

748
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,330
Thank you, come again.

749
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,940
Healthy.

750
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,340
Next patient.

751
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,530
- Minjung, dinner's ready.
- Okay.

752
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,230
Dad, I want barbecue.

753
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,560
Barbecue?
Aeji, you want barbecue?

754
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,800
Should we go out and eat?

755
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,790
But dinner's ready.

756
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,190
Okay, sure.

757
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,440
Minjung, there's too much smoke here.

758
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,140
Okay. I'll eat first.

759
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:00,100
Okay.

760
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:01,540
Let's go.

761
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:07,100
Your eyes stung, didn't they?

762
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,200
Oh, my!

763
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,370
Is it a girl?

764
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,170
No, he's a boy.

765
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,370
He looks just like his mom!

766
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,440
He does?

767
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,470
People say he looks like his dad.

768
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,370
Bye.

769
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,790
- Bye.
- Bye.

770
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,460
Oh, good girl.

771
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,990
Dad, I want that!

772
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,440
Can I have it?
Please!

773
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:03,240
Let me have it, please.

774
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,040
Sure. Pick one.

775
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:08,800
Miho, you pick one, too.

776
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,990
Thank you, Mr. Ko.

777
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:18,870
No! It's mine.

778
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,670
No, no! I want to play with that.

779
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,400
But that one's yours.

780
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,570
This is mine.

781
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:28,830
Mr. Ko bought it for me.

782
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,060
No!

783
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,440
Aeji, what's wrong?

784
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:35,940
Let me see you.

785
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,500
Are you hurt?

786
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:40,800
Where?

787
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,230
Are you okay?

788
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,100
It's fine. You're fine.

789
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:54,930
What is it?

790
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,500
Minjung,

791
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:00,040
can't you just leave Miho and Aeji alone?

792
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,000
Kids fight all the time growing up.

793
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:04,340
Your involvement isn't helping.

794
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:06,000
I know that.

795
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:08,870
But she's having a hard time.

796
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,690
She's stressed out about losing her mom,

797
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,870
so why can't you let her be?

798
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,640
She can learn later.

799
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:17,500
Didn't I tell you?

800
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,640
They must be our kids, or it won't work.

801
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,060
I want you to stay out.

802
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:27,430
Miho and I need to become friends with Aeji.

803
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:30,670
But you stepping in isn't giving us a chance.

804
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,100
Just trust Miho.

805
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:35,140
She's a good girl.
She knows what to do.

806
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,440
Miho is a kid, too, you know?

807
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:40,840
Miho's grown up, but Aeji's still a baby.

808
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,600
Don't you feel sorry for Aeji?

809
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,170
You only feel sorry for Aeji?

810
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,370
Aeji keeps acting out,

811
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,600
and you won't pay attention to Miho.

812
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:48,870
Look.

813
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,170
You said they would be our kids,

814
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,800
but you're siding with Miho.

815
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,430
I'm not siding with Miho.

816
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:55,570
I just feel bad for her.

817
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,290
Why should you feel that?

818
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,990
I've never mistreated Miho.

819
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,170
Minjung, I want this to work.

820
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,900
But it feels like you're not really here.

821
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:06,770
Your heart is somewhere else.

822
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,190
Like where?

823
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,870
Where could my heart go?

824
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,500
Don't over analyze things.

825
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:13,400
Let Aeji sleep with Miho.

826
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:15,640
They'll become friends faster.

827
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,400
Let's take things slowly.

828
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:20,140
- I'll sleep with her...
- For how long?

829
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:23,690
Sunjeong, why are you acting this way?

830
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,870
We're talking
Can you answer it later...

831
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,000
Uncle.

832
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:30,270
Yes.

833
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,770
I'm good.

834
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,230
Aeji and Jungji are good, too.

835
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,330
Grand opening?

836
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,540
Congratulations. That's great news.

837
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,800
I'll be there.

838
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,290
Aeji, eat lunch.

839
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,140
I need to take Jungji to see a doctor.

840
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,940
Mom.

841
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:43,790
Mom.

842
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,230
Oh!

843
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:47,840
Sangnam.

844
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:50,730
Go home.

845
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:03,460
Huh? Man...

846
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,140
Hello.

847
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,430
Follow that cab. Don't lose him.

848
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:14,070
- Okay. 
- I'll pay you well.

849
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:14,930
Okay.

850
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:17,000
Sedal, I found him!

851
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,030
Really?

852
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,690
Okay. I'll be right there.

853
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,230
He's headed for Yeongnam intersection.

854
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,140
Okay. I'm driving, so hold on.

855
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:34,170
Yes, yes.

856
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,840
Okay. I got it. Don't lose him.

857
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,960
Aeji!

858
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,270
Aeji, where are you?

859
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,540
Aeji! Aeji!

860
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:07,540
Where? The beltway?

861
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,370
Why didn't you tell me that before?

862
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,230
Minjung, the Naebu Beltway.

863
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,100
Aeji!

864
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:32,600
Mom!

865
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,140
Oh, my...

866
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,100
What happened to your face?

867
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,190
What happened to your hand?

868
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,260
Oh, no...

869
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,300
Man...

870
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,300
What did she do to her?

871
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,330
Didn't you hear what Aeji said?

872
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,100
She abused her.

873
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,560
Raise her as her own child?

874
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:56,460
Yeah, right.

875
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:59,330
She said that to seduce Minjung.

876
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,730
I can't take this.
I should just...

877
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,040
Mom, you stay home.

878
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:21,660
My heart was bleeding when I sent my kids.

879
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,040
You promised to take good care of them.

880
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:28,040
Where's Aeji?

881
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,730
Aeji's hurt.

882
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:34,500
She fell down coming to me and got hurt.

883
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,900
I'm sorry. Is it serious?

884
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:39,300
She's my child, so stay out.

885
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,290
How dare you act like you care?

886
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,660
You are the worst person in the world.

887
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,370
You used my kids to seduce a man?

888
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:53,000
You made him bring them and abused them?

889
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:56,290
I heard you treated her differently than your own.

890
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,460
Why did you abuse them?

891
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,540
What did they ever to do you?

892
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:08,540
How could you kick my daughter out when she was having a hard time?

893
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:16,440
You have a very nice place.

894
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:19,140
You thought you two could be happy?

895
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:21,640
When you broke my heart like this?

896
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:25,170
What do you have here?

897
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,440
What are these?

898
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,640
Stop it!

899
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:40,540
Don't do that to my mom.

900
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:46,100
I'm stopping because of your kid.

901
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:50,170
Don't embarrass yourself in front of her.

902
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:03,040
Mom, why were you just standing there?

903
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:08,660
Why didn't you fight back? Why?

904
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,940
You should fight back.

905
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:32,700
Who are you?

906
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,790
Hey? Do you recognize me?

907
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:52,560
Yes.

908
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,870
This is nuts, you know?

909
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,440
Give my in-law's house back!

910
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:58,970
I'll kill you if you don't!

911
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,100
Minjung, phone.

912
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,100
- Stay down!
- What is it?

913
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,500
Who do you think you are!

914
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,870
If you're going to abuse them,

915
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,690
why did you take the kids?

916
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,460
I brought Aeji and Jungji home with me!

917
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:32,800
Minjung, don't look for me.

918
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,730
It was already over between us,

919
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,060
but we forced ourselves to reconnect.

920
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,160
I was happy while it lasted.

921
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:44,140
Thanks, Minjung.

922
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:45,560
Goodbye.

923
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:58,500
The person you're trying to reach...

924
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,440
She left?
What do you mean?

925
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:05,040
She won't answer her phone.

926
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,960
Why did you let that happen? Why?

927
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:10,000
Why couldn't you make it work?

928
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:14,170
Don't you feel sorry for Miho?

929
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:18,700
You couldn't be there for her all these years.

930
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:24,540
She went through so much raising her alone.

931
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:28,100
You should've understood why she did that.

932
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,460
What do you mean...

933
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,160
How can you be so dense?

934
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:37,000
You didn't know Miho was your daughter?

935
01:02:49,580 --> 01:03:09,530
