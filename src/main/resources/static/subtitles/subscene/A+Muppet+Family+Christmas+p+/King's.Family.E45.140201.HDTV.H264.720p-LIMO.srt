2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,710
You know why I asked you here, don't you?

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,640
I'll keep it simple.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,580
Keep your hands off my kids' dad.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,680
Was that too hard to understand?

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,290
Keep your hands off.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,410
I know why you called,

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,140
but seeing you is making me nervous.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,610
That's because you did something wrong.

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,520
I never did anything wrong.

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,490
Really?

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,750
After wrecking my family?

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,650
I never wrecked your family.

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,840
How dare you?

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,510
You pretended to be a caregiver and took care of my father in law.

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,190
You're despicable.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,990
I knew something was off when I saw you two.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,840
Did you enjoy making me look like a fool?

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,610
I'm sure you did.

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,880
It wasn't like that.

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,090
Whether or not it was,

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,680
stop seeing him from now on.

23
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,890
I know you have no right to say that.

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,590
No right?

25
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,590
I'm the mother of his kids and his wife.

26
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,040
You used to be.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,990
Talking to you nicely isn't working.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,420
You seduced my husband and wrecked my family,

29
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,320
so how could you be so brazen?

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,690
You made us get a divorce!

31
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,020
I had nothing to do with that.

32
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,420
How much schooling did you get?

33
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,920
What? You don't understand Korean?

34
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,920
We broke up because of you.

35
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,350
I don't want to sit here with you anymore.

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,990
So end it.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,890
I won't do that.

38
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,690
What?

39
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,080
Your divorce had nothing to do with me.

40
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,610
You even looked after my father in law!

41
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:52,950
Who wouldn't fall for his old girlfriend when she does something like that?

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,490
You're very tricky.

43
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,990
You hide behind that demure looking face.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,080
Women like you give me the chills.

45
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,420
Miho's your daughter, right?

46
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,390
Does she know, too?

47
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,720
That her mom is doing this?

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,490
I guess you're finished.
I'm leaving.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,790
But poor you.

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,850
He's not going to marry you.

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,050
We're getting back together.

52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,210
Don't you know him?

53
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,680
He will never abandon his children.

54
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,410
He never will abandon his children,

55
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,950
but can you really get back together?

56
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,520
We'll see about that.

57
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,550
You!

58
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,020
You want me to slap you?

59
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,790
Go ahead.

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,790
But I won't just stand here and take it.

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,790
What?

62
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,550
Don't waste your energy.

63
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,240
You're wasting your time here.

64
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,240
I've never gotten involved in your marital affairs and I don't plan to.

65
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,490
You two should take care of it.

66
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,490
I'm only going to talk to him.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,020
And don't use the children as ammunition.

68
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,320
I hope we never see each other again.

69
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,880
What did she say?

70
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,310
She's very tough.

71
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,550
My heart is still pounding.

72
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,850
Why should it?
You should be firm.

73
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,650
She looks shy, but she's really tough.

74
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,420
I thought she'd cry and beg for forgiveness,

75
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,390
but she never backed down the whole time.

76
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,080
Why didn't you beat her up, then?

77
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,950
She would've beaten me up if I tried.

78
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,610
She said she's not backing down.

79
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,490
What do I do, mom?

80
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,990
You have to appeal to Minjung.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,920
You have to change his mind.

82
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,920
Go and beg, if you have to.

83
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,790
How can I...

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,890
I'm scared to see him.

85
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,410
Why should you be?
You have the kids.

86
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,910
Daebak, what are you talking about?

87
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,590
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,290
We can't see each other again.

89
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,590
Why is that?

90
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,890
I deserve an explanation.

91
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,990
All I can say is our families are enemies.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,810
I am Romeo and you are Juliet.

93
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,010
I don't want to be Juliet.

94
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,780
I want to live. Dying is sad!

95
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,490
Miho, goodbye.

96
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,290
No! Tell me the reason.

97
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,290
You should ask your mom.

98
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,850
Daebak! Daebak! Daebak!

99
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,810
Miho, why are you crying?

100
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,050
What's wrong?

101
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,350
Mom, did you do something bad?

102
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,650
Did someone say something to you?

103
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,350
Daebak broke up with me,

104
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,290
saying our families are enemies.

105
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,610
No.

106
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,050
I didn't do anything wrong.

107
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,440
I never did.

108
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,410
It came from the board of directors.

109
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,920
You have to resign before the new semester.

110
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,990
You have a month to sort things out.

111
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,090
[Letter of Resignation]

112
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,210
Good job.

113
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,690
Keep it up.

114
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,940
When are you going to China?

115
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,710
Soon, I think.

116
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,150
Don't send him.
You should go, old man.

117
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,790
I think you love picking on me.

118
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,850
I'm not an old man.

119
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,490
But you couldn't.
You can't speak Chinese.

120
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,310
Whatever.

121
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,880
You don't have any plans for dinner, do you?

122
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,580
I'm meeting Mr. Park, so come with me.

123
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,590
But I do have plans.

124
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,990
Can you move it?
Mr. Park wants to see you.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,650
It's important.
I'm sorry, father.

126
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,010
Hello?

127
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,440
Father, are you at school?

128
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,240
Yes.

129
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,910
What time can you come?

130
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,490
Sangnam already made reservations.

131
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,450
Okay. I'll be right over.

132
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,010
It's Sangnam's treat, so please enjoy.

133
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,780
Applause!

134
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,290
Eat up!

135
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,680
She couldn't even visit us over the holidays.

136
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,390
I'm trying hard not to get upset.

137
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,780
I didn't raise Gwangbak to be a cook.

138
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,080
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,090
When's the housewarming party?

140
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,920
When I learn to cook.

141
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,140
We can order food.

142
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,610
Who cooks at home these days?

143
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,410
Don't you agree, Anggeum?

144
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,410
That's the first correct thing you said.

145
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,090
Bong, is something wrong?

146
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,880
Mother's talking to you.

147
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,220
Huh?

148
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,090
Why aren't you eating?

149
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,490
I'm fine, mother.

150
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,220
I had lunch late.

151
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,610
Do eat, mother.

152
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,090
The meat's burning. Eat up.

153
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,220
Oh, okay.

154
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,740
Eat before they burn.

155
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,090
Thank you, honey.

156
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,350
I never even thought of it.

157
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,740
They hadn't eaten out since what happened.

158
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,990
I think I married well.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,380
Of course, you did.

160
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,740
I'm glad you're happy.

161
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,150
Oh, it's so nice to be out.

162
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,610
I feel like I've been liberated.

163
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,450
Like I escaped from prison.

164
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,150
Prison is a little too harsh.

165
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,240
Being married is harder than I expected.

166
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,320
I agree.

167
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,390
Why is that?

168
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,740
I'm the one who has to adapt,

169
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,690
so why is it hard for you?

170
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,450
Maybe because we hadn't dated for long,

171
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,240
but I feel like I don't know you all that well.

172
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,010
You don't?
You don't know me?

173
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,720
Sometimes I feel that way.

174
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,290
So you regret marrying me?

175
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,880
- Not really.
- Be honest with me.

176
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,990
You're getting ahead of yourself again.

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,820
That's why you have to be clear about it.

178
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,720
It sounds like you regret marrying me.

179
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,450
- It's not that.
- Then what is it?

180
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,890
You don't regret marrying me,

181
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,990
but you're disappointed in me?

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,380
Not disappointed... But...

183
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,010
It sort of feels like it.

184
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,490
Wait, this isn't it.

185
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,220
Why is this conversation going like...

186
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,350
- Forget it.
- What?

187
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,640
I can't tell you anything.

188
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,110
You're disappointed in me.
End of discussion.

189
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,590
You told me to be honest.

190
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,450
Fine. Be as honest as you want to be.

191
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,350
You think I don't want to be honest here?

192
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,610
Then tell me what you want to say.

193
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,450
That way, I can change.

194
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,790
I want us to be honest with each other,

195
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,710
and help each other fix mistakes we make.

196
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,510
I don't like getting emotional like this

197
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,220
and fight over the expressions we use.

198
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,990
Keep the promise we made on our first night.

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,590
Not using harsh words when we fight.

200
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,220
What harsh words did I use?

201
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,850
You did.

202
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,850
Even your tone was rude.

203
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,780
I can't communicate with you.
How frustrating.

204
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,510
What do you mean by that?

205
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,490
I'm frustrated because we can't communicate.

206
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,940
Why are you looking at me like that?

207
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,780
Don't over analyze it.

208
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,240
I'm not talking about schooling.

209
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,040
I'm not educated, so that's expected.

210
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,040
I'm just a high school drop out.

211
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,540
Stop it! I said I didn't mean it like that.

212
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,880
I'm leaving. I don't want to fight.

213
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,190
Don't come here when you two fight.

214
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,010
I don't understand women.

215
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,180
It's like they are from another country.

216
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,450
Aren't we speaking the same language?

217
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,790
Women and men must be different species.

218
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,640
You thought we were the same species?

219
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,380
Have you heard of "Men are from Mars,

220
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,380
Women are from Venus"?

221
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,180
Sangnam,

222
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,790
women take everything emotionally.

223
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,490
Depending on how they feel.

224
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,110
That's so unfair.

225
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,590
You need to know just one thing.

226
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,850
When talking to a women, just listen to her.

227
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,740
And take her side.

228
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,640
If you tell her how you feel after that,

229
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,240
she will be ready to listen to you.

230
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,350
But aunt, I didn't even say much tonight.

231
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,190
I just said I was having a hard time, too,

232
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,880
she got mad, and the rest is pretty foggy.

233
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,990
That was where your mistakes began.

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,510
If Gwangbak said it was hard for her,

235
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,680
you should've said she made you happy.

236
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,720
How can you say something that stupid?

237
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,690
You're impossible.

238
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,350
I don't think I was ready to get married.

239
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,240
Don't say that to anyone else but me.

240
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,880
It sounds like you regret getting married.

241
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,940
Aunt, this is difficult.

242
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,740
Of course it is.
You're two now, not one.

243
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,240
Did she go to her parents house?

244
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,740
Bring her home before your father finds out.

245
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,590
He's taking a shower right now.

246
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,850
Leave her alone. She'll come home.

247
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,180
You still don't get it.

248
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,350
Do everything you can and bring her home.

249
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,090
Oh, man.

250
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,290
Whose side are you on?

251
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,510
Mine.

252
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,240
Where are you?

253
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,540
My parents place.

254
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,880
You didn't tell them we fought, did you?

255
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,140
Actually, you attacked me for no reason.

256
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,490
Of course I did. I told them everything.

257
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,610
My father said he'll get you for this.

258
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,510
You...

259
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,880
I have a father, too, you know?

260
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,090
Come home before I count to three.

261
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,720
Forget it.

262
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,010
- One.
- Hah!

263
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,490
Two!

264
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,720
- Two and a half!
- Bah!

265
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,690
Two and a half and a half!

266
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,320
Why don't you come and get me, then?

267
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,110
Wait for me.
Wait till I get my hands on you!

268
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,240
Huh?

269
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,140
Did you fly over here?

270
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,090
I'm not talking to you.

271
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,320
You told me to pick you up, remember?

272
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,590
I came home for father, not for you.

273
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,010
What have you done right so far?

274
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,540
Other people get treated as a princess,

275
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,280
but look at me!

276
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,320
Just because you took my family out,

277
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,890
don't think your job is done.

278
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,280
I couldn't even go home over the holidays.

279
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,680
You think I married you to be your cook?

280
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,390
I should be regretting, not you!

281
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,740
Why won't you say anything?

282
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,280
Aunt Sunjeong told me I must listen when a woman talks.

283
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,540
You only listen to your aunt.

284
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,580
Why won't you listen to me?

285
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,320
Oh, my!

286
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,380
Why that...

287
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,950
Wifey, don't be mad at me.

288
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,190
Please.

289
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,240
Oh, man.

290
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,680
Who wants to?

291
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,240
Why don't you continue that in the house?

292
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,150
- We're home.
- We're home.

293
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,120
You said you had an important engagement.

294
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,920
Was dinner with your in laws good?

295
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,220
Are you their servant?

296
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,950
It wasn't like that.

297
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,120
We didn't have a housewarming party,

298
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,990
and her family is not doing...

299
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,190
And don't dance like that for your wife.

300
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,990
It's degrading.

301
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,410
What are you doing?

302
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,350
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

303
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,840
Honey,

304
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,180
if I retired...

305
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,840
When will it be?

306
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,710
You can't retire yet.

307
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,310
You still have a few years left.

308
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,580
Who knows what will happen?

309
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,840
I'll have to, if the board tells me to.

310
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,420
You can't sleep?

311
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,450
No.

312
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,880
Instead of thinking about stuff like that,

313
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,950
you should think about seeing Minjung.

314
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,510
He's doing this because we lost our house.

315
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,150
You should show him who you are.

316
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,320
He already had her waiting for him,

317
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,910
and that's why he went and got a divorce.

318
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,350
Maybe you should meet her and...

319
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,710
That's enough.

320
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,490
You're not a pit bull.
Just let him be.

321
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,720
I am a pit bull.

322
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,690
That's why I survived this long.

323
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,240
Mother, I'm going to work.

324
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,280
You're not having breakfast?

325
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,390
I'm not hungry.

326
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,740
That's because you were up all night pouting.

327
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,740
I'll see you later.

328
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,990
- Hello.
- Hi.

329
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,040
- Hello.
- Hi.

330
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,390
Hello.

331
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,510
Drink this.

332
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,510
What is it?

333
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,920
Vegetable juice.

334
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,780
It's great for pregnant women.

335
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,810
- What?
- Huh?

336
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,440
It's great for pregnant women and for everyone else.

337
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,390
Oh, I've been so tired lately. Exhausted.

338
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,740
You are? Exhausted?

339
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,610
Then listen to this kind of music.

340
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,150
- What's that?
- Uh,

341
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,690
prenatal music.

342
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,510
I'm not pregnant!

343
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,510
It's great for pregnant women and for everyone else.

344
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,240
When you're pregnant, you must feel peaceful.

345
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,490
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

346
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,280
Peace of mind's great for pregnant women

347
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,780
and for everyone else.

348
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,240
Stop that.

349
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,190
Pregnant and other women? As if!

350
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,420
Stop talking about pregnant women.

351
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,010
I can't stand you!

352
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,810
This is totally nuts.

353
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,990
The juice.

354
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,690
Oh.

355
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,990
Hobak, how is it going?

356
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,950
He's driving me crazy.

357
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,420
He's so interested and so jealous.

358
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,820
That's when you reel him in!

359
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,950
How?

360
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,950
What are you doing?

361
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,990
Oh.

362
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,080
Oh, I'm glad to see you.

363
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,110
What are you doing?

364
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,920
How can you dump Subak and do this?

365
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,010
You bastard!

366
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,510
Where are you going?

367
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,610
The restaurant.

368
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,020
That's not what's important here.

369
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,650
I couldn't come up with any other solutions.

370
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,740
Will you do as I say?

371
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,890
Do what?

372
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,520
I thought about what you said before.

373
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,510
When you said you'd raise my kids as your own, I was so grateful.

374
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,840
You've taught me a lot.

375
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,040
I should've said that before you did.

376
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:46,010
I'll think of Miho as my own.

377
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,040
Minjung.

378
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,490
Sunjeong, I'm coming to you.

379
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,310
Hold on, Minjung.

380
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,220
I'm so overwhelmed.

381
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,840
You really are coming to me?

382
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,840
It's been hard for me because of Miho.

383
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,210
She's heard somethings here and there,

384
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,920
and thinks I did something wrong.

385
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,190
She does?

386
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,640
I want to have a clear conscience, as a mother.

387
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,550
Sooner the better.

388
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,310
Okay.

389
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,140
I wonder if Miho will understand us.

390
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,890
She's at a sensitive age.

391
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,390
Miho really liked you from the beginning.

392
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,290
Which was rather weird.

393
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,990
She said she felt connected to you

394
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,390
and that she wished you were her dad.

395
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,240
She did?

396
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,920
Remember the money you gave her?

397
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,390
She even laminated that.

398
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,920
Oh, boy...

399
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,590
I'm glad she likes me.

400
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,440
Let's find a place for us to live first.

401
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,320
I want to move out before Gwangbak finds out.

402
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,080
She doesn't know about us yet.

403
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,720
You couldn't live with her if she did.

404
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,010
Let's find a place quickly.

405
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,190
Really?

406
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,390
Yes.

407
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,450
What do we do about Daebak?

408
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,780
That's that.

409
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,510
If you're happy, I'm happy, too.

410
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,880
You and him were in love a long time ago.

411
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,350
How did you know?

412
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,710
I'm a romance expert.

413
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,420
But don't tell anyone just yet.

414
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,990
I know that.

415
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,340
Miho.

416
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,190
Hello.

417
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,850
How did you come?
You came alone?

418
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,810
Yes.

419
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,240
Let's go in.

420
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,420
I don't have any snacks here.

421
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,990
It's okay.

422
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,820
Did you want to talk to me?

423
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,910
Mom told me everything.

424
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,150
You're going to marry my mom?

425
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,040
Yes.

426
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,810
Will you give me your blessings?

427
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,340
Yes. You're approved.

428
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,080
But I have a favor to ask.

429
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,910
What is it?

430
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,450
Be good to my mom.

431
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,510
And don't worry about me.

432
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,580
I know I'm getting a sister and a brother.

433
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,140
I can look after Aeji and Jungji.

434
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,720
I've been babysitting Jungji anyway.

435
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,580
So you just need to be good to my mom.

436
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,510
I will.

437
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,920
My mom had a very difficult life.

438
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,390
She was really popular,

439
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,050
but she never dated anyone.

440
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,410
I think she was waiting for you.

441
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,720
So promise me that you'll make my mom happy.

442
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,150
Dad!

443
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,890
Aeji, it's you!

444
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,990
Dad, did you miss me?

445
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,840
Of course, I missed you.

446
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,110
Mom said no, but I made her come.

447
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,240
You did?

448
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,890
Mom, did I say it right?

449
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,350
What do you mean?

450
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,490
You told me to say that.

451
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,420
I never told you to say anything.

452
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,890
Did you eat?

453
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,790
I ate at work.

454
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,780
What brings you here?

455
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,080
The kids said they missed their dad.

456
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,820
I never said that.

457
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,720
What's wrong with you?

458
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,510
Aeji, what would you like?

459
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,740
Dad, pizza! Pizza!

460
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,220
Okay. Let's get pizza.

461
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,780
Where did you go before?

462
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,780
The academy.

463
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,010
Just the academy?

464
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,280
Yes.

465
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,450
Miho was here just now.

466
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,540
She made me pinky swear that I will make you happy.

467
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,910
Your daughter is really amazing.

468
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,080
Mom, let's go home. I'm sleepy.

469
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,950
Yes. You should go.

470
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,240
Dad, can we sleep here?

471
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,720
Here?

472
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,420
Mom, was that good?

473
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,320
Did I say it like you asked me to?

474
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,780
Why are you saying these things?

475
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,610
You can't sleep here.

476
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,490
It gets really cold.

477
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,220
It's not that cold.

478
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,720
The kids will catch a cold.

479
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,120
Let's go. I'll take you home.

480
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,950
Aeji, good night.

481
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,390
Dad, good night.

482
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,590
Go inside.

483
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,890
I told you to sleep there.

484
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,740
How can I?

485
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,990
Why not?

486
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,580
You had two kids together.

487
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,080
Don't be so self conscious.

488
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,740
Why should you be?
You did nothing wrong.

489
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,220
One thing you did was losing the house.

490
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,350
But it wasn't his house!

491
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,410
Be confident.

492
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,090
You are his first wife.

493
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,540
Men love to see their wives in their aprons,

494
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:21,010
cooking dinner when they come home.

495
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,810
The next time you go, cook something

496
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,180
and spend the night there.

497
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,950
Yes, yes.

498
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,650
Say, "Spend the night there."

499
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:38,220
<i>I know! It must be love!</i>

500
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:51,780
Hobak, let's do something naughty together.

501
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,490
Who the heck is this?

502
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,740
His hobby is buying cars.

503
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,990
He has them lined up and picks from them,

504
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,580
like picking out what shoes to wear.

505
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,720
It'd be nice to have money like that.

506
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,650
I can picture him.

507
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,420
He must be unattractive.

508
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,780
Fat and bald, am I right?

509
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,990
You really have no clue.

510
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,580
Rich people take good care of themselves.

511
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,040
He's 28 or 29 and single.

512
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,720
You're 36 so how much younger is he?

513
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,890
Oh, you're a grandpa.

514
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,490
Grandpa?

515
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,580
You!

516
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,410
I don't look like a grandpa!

517
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,450
You actually do.

518
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,890
Whatever!

519
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,240
You didn't tell him you're married?

520
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,280
Crazy? Why would I say that?

521
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,810
You didn't tell him you have two kids?

522
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,450
It's good manners to pretend to be single.

523
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,780
This is nutty, nutty, nuts!

524
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,080
Have you no conscience at all?

525
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,610
At least I had a conscience!

526
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,690
I told her I was married with two kids.

527
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,620
So why are you acting like you're single?

528
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,350
He never asked, so why should I?

529
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:00,510
That's not playing fair!
You're a fraud.

530
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,110
It is troublesome.

531
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,220
He sends flowers and sushi.

532
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,540
Sit down.

533
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,910
It hurts my neck to look at you

534
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,050
And?

535
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,740
You ate what he sent?

536
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,420
I did, with my co-workers.

537
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,120
He keeps asking me what I want,

538
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,890
saying he wants to buy me a handbag.

539
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,420
Crazy bastard.

540
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,920
Why bother calling him names?

541
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,320
It's your fault for flirting with him!

542
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,410
I never flirted with him.

543
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,120
I was being a model, smiling.

544
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,820
Oh! This, this.

545
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,220
This, wave dance.

546
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,740
When I did this, he called me cute.

547
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,650
That's flirting!

548
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,150
No one's ever called me cute before.

549
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,390
- Quit! 
- Oh, you startled me.

550
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:50,310
Quit doing that model gig,

551
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,310
and this,

552
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,840
don't do this wave dance.

553
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,110
Don't do it for others.
Just do it for me.

554
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,350
You can only do it in front of me!

555
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,280
You said I looked awkward!

556
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,690
You don't. It's cute!

557
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,320
And d-d-don't believe a word men say.

558
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,990
All they want is to foo-fool around with you,

559
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,420
and you b-b-believe them?

560
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,120
Stop stuttering.

561
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:21,020
Why would a young, handsome rich man purse you, unless he's crazy?

562
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,740
I'm an expert in that field, and I'm  telling you, your life will be ruined.

563
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,010
Maybe this apartment is bad luck.

564
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,720
Why do we have to be tested like this?

565
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,350
I'm not being tested here.

566
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,180
I'm enjoying it.

567
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,690
Snap out of it.

568
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,890
Or you'll get kicked out in your undies.

569
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,790
Did you get kicked out in your undies?

570
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,580
Of course!

571
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,240
I mean, it could happen.

572
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,190
Don't worry.

573
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,850
I'm not interested in him.

574
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,340
There are many men who are interested in me.

575
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,650
There are many?

576
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,720
Hey, tell me.

577
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,080
Who are they? Who?

578
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,990
That's so funny!

579
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,420
That text was awesome. Perfect timing.

580
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,490
Hobak, let's do something naughty.

581
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,240
This is so much fun.

582
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,580
He must be so jealous.

583
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,720
Totally.

584
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,720
I had a hard time trying not to laugh.

585
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,310
I wish I'd known about this sooner.

586
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,510
You need some tension in your marriage.

587
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,690
He's here.

588
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,450
Hello.

589
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,180
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

590
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,880
I brought lunch.

591
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,520
I cooked all of it.

592
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,040
Don't eat sushi men buy you.

593
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,020
It's done. All you need to do is reheat it.

594
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,520
And pretend you cooked it.

595
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,220
Leave Aeji home.

596
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,580
Take Jungji and have some beer with him.

597
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,910
Okay.

598
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,280
Here.

599
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,950
Oh, you're home.

600
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,180
You must be tired.

601
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,150
When did you come?

602
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,580
Just now.

603
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,340
Is it a bit bland?

604
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,290
Will you taste this for me?

605
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,450
What's that?
Why are they out there?

606
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,950
They went bad.

607
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,620
Jungji, daddy's home.

608
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,320
Play with daddy while I set the table.

609
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,990
Where's Aeji?

610
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,150
Should I tell her to come?

611
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,310
It's okay.

612
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,890
It's good.

613
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,910
Oh!

614
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,840
Salla, wake up.

615
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,510
It's been a while.

616
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,650
Yes. May I help you stand up?

617
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,340
Yes, please.

618
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,750
Why are you crying?
Did I do something wrong?

619
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,580
No.

620
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,080
I thought you'd never come back.

621
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,620
So I decided to get over you.

622
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,950
Why wouldn't I come back?

623
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,520
Because of your ex-wife.

624
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,690
You never called again.

625
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,780
I thought you spent the holidays with her.

626
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,890
Am I crazy?

627
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,390
Why would I be with her?

628
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,990
Salla, you're a rash person.

629
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,580
How could you get over me so soon?

630
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,240
Please don't do that anymore.

631
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,890
When you decide to get over me,

632
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,310
tell me first.

633
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,990
Everyone told me to get remarried,

634
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,220
but I never did.

635
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,020
Because of my kids.

636
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,990
Now that they are all married,

637
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,810
I thought I had finally met someone good,

638
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:18,950
but when your ex-wife appeared and went crazy on me,

639
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,140
I thought it wasn't meant to be.

640
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,290
But here you are, proposing to me.

641
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,220
I can't help but cry.

642
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,750
Proposing to you?

643
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,790
Yes.

644
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,120
I can't believe what's happening.

645
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,250
I'm so happy.

646
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,520
Mom, where were you?

647
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,090
Mother, I'm here, too.

648
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,680
What's up Don?

649
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,880
- Did you just call me Don?
- Huh?

650
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,520
Oh, mother!

651
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,690
Let me down. I'm taken.

652
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,390
Mom,

653
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,090
you're taken?

654
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,890
Oh, no.

655
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,750
I misspoke because I was startled.

656
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,290
Where did you get those flowers?

657
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,250
Who gave them to you?

658
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,850
A friend.

659
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,840
Enjoy yourselves. Don, you too.

660
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,040
Thank you, mother.

661
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,720
Mom, is it him?

662
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,220
Shh.

663
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,350
He proposed to me.

664
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,750
- He did?
- Shh!

665
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,520
They'll hear you!

666
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,950
Keep this a secret from Sedal.

667
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,020
Why?

668
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,720
Loser wants to go.

669
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,850
Okay. Mom, I'm leaving.

670
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,650
Okay. Take care.

671
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,290
I'm leaving! Goof-off, bye!

672
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,050
How dare he...

673
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,110
What did you and Yeongdal talk about?

674
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,990
Nothing.

675
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,410
Mom, are you seeing someone?

676
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,420
Of course not.

677
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,720
Mom, please.

678
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,450
Don't go around meeting just anyone.

679
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,990
You've been down that road before.

680
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,950
She totally misunderstood you.

681
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,350
I gave her the flowers to cheer her up,

682
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,450
but she thinks I proposed to her. What do I do?

683
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,020
She's always jumping to conclusions.

684
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,720
Daese, you should get married.

685
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:39,250
You never remarried because of Sangnam,

686
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,790
but now you should live your life.

687
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,920
I don't know if I can.

688
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,580
I'm afraid of living with a woman.

689
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,850
Will I be able to make her happy?

690
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,850
I'm afraid of failing again.

691
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,620
And it's hard to adjust my lifestyle.

692
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,220
Don't be too scared.

693
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,990
I'm all for you getting remarried.

694
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,910
Could I really pull it off?

695
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,220
Of course.

696
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,850
What do I do?

697
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,920
Jungji fell asleep.

698
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,380
He might catch a cold if I take him home now.

699
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,850
Then spend the night here.

700
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,850
Should I?

701
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,950
I'll sleep at my office.

702
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,040
I...

703
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,810
Yes, director.

704
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,410
We're getting ready to go home.

705
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,140
Please hold.

706
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,610
Hobak, it's the director.

707
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,590
Yes, director?

708
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,120
Really?

709
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,180
Thank you!

710
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,220
Thank you!

711
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,850
Anna, congratulate me!

712
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,190
I'm going to Italy!

713
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,690
Congratulations!

714
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,120
I feel like I'm dreaming!

715
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:36,450
Wow!

716
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,180
- A month?
- Yes.

717
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,810
My shop's been selected as the best shop,

718
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,620
so I'm going to Italy to see the industry.

719
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,580
I can't believe my luck.

720
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,280
My heart's still pounding.

721
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,290
What about me, then?

722
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,090
You can do what you've been doing.

723
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,890
You're all excited, aren't you?

724
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,250
Do you have to go?

725
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,620
What do you mean?

726
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,420
I've been dying to go!

727
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,720
Everyone wanted to go!

728
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,290
It's not a vacation.
It's for business.

729
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,640
This is nuts.

730
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,390
What's up?

731
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,120
Can you buy me a drink?

732
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,790
In the middle of the day?

733
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,780
Come in. I'm not busy.

734
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,680
Is your life fun?

735
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,680
It must be.

736
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,990
You're living with my baby sister,

737
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,850
so it must be rainbows and butterflies.

738
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,190
Sedal, what's wrong?

739
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,310
Didn't you make my niece's life miserable?

740
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,720
I feel so little.

741
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,850
Your niece is so successful.

742
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,750
She's flying high, soaring, actually.

743
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:13,020
But I've fallen so low, down to the basement.

744
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,620
Things are even, then.

745
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,310
A couple is one body and mind.

746
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,890
Hobak is flying and you're falling down.

747
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,750
Add them up and you meet at ground level.

748
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,190
I don't understand this feeling.

749
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,840
I'm scared.

750
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,220
About what?

751
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:32,750
About her leaving me.

752
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,020
What?

753
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,990
Housewives in my neighborhood all worry

754
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,620
if their husbands become successful,

755
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:46,420
they might one day leave them.

756
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,520
What the...

757
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,640
I heard she's really popular.

758
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:54,110
Men won't leave her alone.

759
00:45:54,130 --> 00:46:00,310
I wish I could just beat them all up and tell your niece to quit.

760
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:04,120
"Quit your job and run the household

761
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:08,080
because I'll be working from now on!"

762
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,780
It's all my fault.

763
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,320
I can't blame anyone else.

764
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,810
I'm so happy.

765
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,620
I wanted to meet you formally.

766
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:39,250
Thank you for being Sunjeong's guardian.

767
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,690
She's like my own sister.

768
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:46,680
You were like a father and brother to me, too.

769
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:51,610
Daese, I want to thank you.

770
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,080
You're embarrassing me.

771
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,410
You ran the household.

772
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,410
You helped me out a lot.

773
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,080
I didn't do that for free. I got paid.

774
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:02,280
I knew you two would meet again someday.

775
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,620
Aren't you glad you waited for him?

776
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:05,620
Because of Miho...

777
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,310
Daese, let me poor you a drink.

778
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:14,240
He thinks raising Miho alone was hard.

779
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,820
Tell him.

780
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,810
Later.

781
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,410
Tell me what?

782
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,610
I'll tell you later.

783
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,690
Oh, I'm getting drunk.

784
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:30,110
I'll drink some more and go take a nap.

785
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,810
- You should.
- Here.

786
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,310
There are two rooms and three rooms.

787
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,280
How many rooms for 56 square meters?

788
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,520
Two.

789
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,220
-Two rooms.
- Okay.

790
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,310
Let's look for a few more days.

791
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,740
The ones we like are too expensive.

792
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,750
I'm sorry. I should pay for the house.

793
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,090
But I know how things are with you.

794
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,810
Does your ex-wife visit you?

795
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:10,880
I saw her.
I couldn't sleep last night.

796
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,850
I slept at the office.

797
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,540
Don't think about it.

798
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,910
And don't worry, either.

799
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,780
I still feel the same way.

800
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,590
I'll tell you what's going on right now.

801
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,910
Her parents want me to go back to her,

802
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,280
and she wants that, too.

803
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:36,010
Thank you for telling me everything.

804
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,640
We're finally by ourselves.

805
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,450
Good. What should we do?

806
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,950
Play the king game?

807
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,810
Let's play the robot cleaner game.

808
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,780
The winner makes the loser clean.

809
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,820
Okay.

810
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,490
Rock, paper, scissors!

811
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,220
I won!

812
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:07,320
Let's start the robot cleaner game.

813
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,810
Beep!

814
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,190
I'm your Blabbermouth Robot Cleaner.

815
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,950
Master, please choose.

816
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,810
Very clean, kind of clean.

817
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,990
Very clean, start!

818
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,310
Beep!

819
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,180
Very, very, very clean. Start.

820
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:32,910
When it's done, please kiss me.

821
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:39,120
Hurry, hurry!  Hey! Hurry up!

822
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,910
I need charging, I need charging.

823
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:50,420
Stay away! Why do you need charging already?

824
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,410
Go! Very clean, start.

825
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,910
Error, error.

826
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,140
Kind of, kind of, kind of clean, start.

827
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,380
Start cleaning.

828
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:03,620
Oh!

829
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:06,640
What are you doing?

830
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,020
Father, you were home?

831
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,120
What's going on here?

832
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:18,410
You think your husband is a joke?

833
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,010
How could you treat him like a slave?

834
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,190
Is he a vacuum cleaner?

835
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,140
We were just fooling around.

836
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,720
This is fooling around to you?

837
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,040
It was a game.

838
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:33,880
You're laughing?

839
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,680
No, I'm not.

840
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,740
I'm sorry, father.

841
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,020
We thought you weren't home.

842
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:43,350
So you've been doing this behind my back?

843
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,850
No, this was the first time.

844
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,120
Have you no dignity?
You're the problem!

845
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,310
This is why she treats you like a fool!

846
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,110
They were just playing a game.

847
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,540
Of all games, they have to play that?

848
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:19,540
If they were living by themselves,

849
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:22,540
they'd fool around all they want,

850
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:23,780
but we're here, so they can't do anything.

851
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:27,720
They were goofing around, thinking there was

852
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:30,220
nobody home, so don't be mad, Daese.

853
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:33,140
How can they do something like that?

854
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:38,040
She was treating him like he was a servant!

855
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:40,180
She gets on my nerves all the time.

856
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,510
That must be her special talent.

857
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,510
Hello?

858
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,220
It's me.

859
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,450
Who is this?

860
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,040
Don't pretend you don't know my voice.

861
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,510
I'm Minjung's mother in law.

862
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,550
Oh, okay.

863
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,510
Hello.

864
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,220
Let's cut to the chase.

865
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:28,490
I want to meet you.
Where can we meet?

866
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,750
I'm sorry, but I don't want to meet you.

867
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,590
What?

868
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,810
I'm older than you, so you should come.

869
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,220
You have no manners.

870
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,680
I have something to say, so come.

871
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,610
No thank you. And I have nothing to hear.

872
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,650
Who said you could decide that?

873
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,040
Are you feeling guilty?

874
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:51,350
I'm not going to beat you up,

875
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,390
so you should come and meet me.

876
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,390
I'm sorry, but I must hang up.

877
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,990
Hello? Hey!

878
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,420
The person you have called is unavailable...

879
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,410
Ugh...

880
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:30,880
I'm scared to go home.

881
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,720
Time flew by when I was working,

882
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,040
but now the day goes by so slowly.

883
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,810
Tell your family.

884
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,390
I should, but I can't do it.

885
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,290
I know how sad she'll become.

886
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,890
But you're getting pension.

887
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,790
Pension is not the issue.

888
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:54,620
I'm still strong, but I can't work anymore.

889
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,690
There's nothing for me to do.

890
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,310
What skills do I have?

891
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,680
I can't farm or do manual labor.

892
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:05,510
I've always been a teacher,

893
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:08,720
so what else could I do now?

894
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:11,720
I feel so lost.

895
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,450
I envy you for being a technician.

896
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:30,020
<i>Wishing my children to be happy...</i>

897
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,310
I'm home.

898
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,120
You're home?

899
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,650
- You're home?
- Did you have a good day?

900
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:43,910
Yes, I did.

901
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,620
You had a drink, didn't you?

902
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:49,220
Yes.

903
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,410
What's all this?

904
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,740
We're making envelopes.

905
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,190
We're making money.

906
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,080
Why don't you join us?

907
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:57,350
We need money if we want to buy a house.

908
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,290
Mother, you shouldn't do this.

909
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,450
Why should I just sit around, doing nothing?

910
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:05,290
It's better to make envelopes.

911
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,120
Everyone here wants to make money.

912
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:12,250
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

913
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,720
Come in here.

914
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,890
Subak is innocent,

915
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,650
but she can't say anything to Minjung.

916
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:29,220
How is she innocent?

917
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,890
She lost our house, not his!

918
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,150
Why don't you try talking to him?

919
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:36,280
What can I say?

920
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,550
What do you mean?

921
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,580
Sweet talk him into changing his mind.

922
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,040
Minjung, it's me.

923
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:52,510
When are you free?

924
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:54,350
Did something happen?

925
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,020
Does something have to happen for us to meet?

926
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,850
Make time for me this week.

927
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,120
This week?

928
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,150
Tell him tomorrow, tomorrow.

929
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,290
How about tomorrow?

930
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,120
I'm busy all week with work.

931
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:12,020
Let's have a drink.

932
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,650
I have something to say.

933
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,680
I'll make time and call you.

934
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,380
Okay. I got it.

935
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,620
What did he say?

936
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:26,950
He's busy.

937
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,890
He's too busy to even eat?

938
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,080
Why can't you do anything right?

939
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:36,390
You should've said meet me at so and so.

940
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,190
Why were you so timid?

941
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,810
We're not family, so I couldn't help it.

942
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:45,350
Not family? Ugh.

943
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,540
What is it?

944
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,950
I have a stomachache.

945
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,850
Maybe I have indigestion from dinner.

946
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,720
You have a stomachache?

947
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:05,120
How does it feel?
Are you nauseous?

948
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,990
I guess I do.

949
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,590
Don't take that!

950
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,450
What are you doing?

951
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:15,720
Medicine's bad if you're pregnant.

952
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:16,950
What?

953
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,490
It's great for pregnant women and for everyone else.

954
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,290
What's wrong with you?

955
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,150
Are you accusing me of something?

956
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,680
What?

957
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:31,110
You keep talking about pregnant women.

958
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:34,250
You think I'm cheating on you?

959
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,890
No, I don't think that.

960
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,290
I wouldn't do anything immoral.

961
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,650
How dare you!

962
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,410
If you say that again, I'll!

963
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,490
You'll what? You'll what?

964
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,380
I'll slap my mouth.

965
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,490
Oh, satisfied? Oh, I'm sorry.

966
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,290
Oh.

967
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,490
Mother, what's wrong?

968
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,650
Oh.

969
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:59,010
It's my bladder.
I had a lot of cold broth.

970
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:02,650
Why are you pacing here like a space cadet?

971
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,310
I couldn't fall asleep.

972
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,680
You know what "space cadet" means?

973
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,220
Yes. Yeongdal taught me.

974
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,120
Oh, boy.

975
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,250
Bong.

976
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,390
I'm here.

977
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,450
Why did you drink?

978
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,750
I met a friend.

979
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,820
And why can't you sleep?

980
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,880
I must be going through male menopause.

981
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,310
Whatever it is, don't worry so much.

982
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,620
It'll go away, no matter how hard it is.

983
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,310
Will it go away?

984
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,540
Of course.

985
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:50,840
I must go on, but it's too hard.

986
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,250
Bong, did you go in?

987
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,690
No, I didn't.

988
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:00,490
I'll stay here, so you take your time.

989
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,220
Having you there makes feel safe.

990
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:09,750
Mother, spring will come, won't it?

991
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,390
Of course.

992
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,520
It'll come very soon.

993
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,020
Doctor,

994
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:27,020
I'm only 37, so I'm scared.

995
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,550
I feel like I've ceased being a woman.

996
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,720
You said you have 2 kids?

997
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:31,910
Yes.

998
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,580
I don't care if it's menopause,

999
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:38,620
but to actually face it is...

1000
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:40,290
Look here.

1001
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,450
Can you see this?

1002
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,640
What's that?

1003
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,420
Is that...

1004
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,350
Is that like cancer?

1005
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,350
Didn't you say you have 2 kids?

1006
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,990
See this handsome little thing?

1007
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,350
Congratulations.

1008
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,720
What did you say?

1009
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,680
You're pregnant.

1010
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:07,220
No way.

1011
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:08,990
That can't be.

1012
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,250
Nothing happened, so how can I be pregnant?

1013
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,840
I'll be out for one hour.

1014
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,750
Just one hour.
Not even 10 minutes more.

1015
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,850
Okay.

1016
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:55,240
Don't do this.

1017
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,190
What?

1018
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:57,740
The plants did nothing wrong!

1019
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,090
They're all dead!

1020
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,810
I don't want any traces of you in there.

1021
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,910
And stop coming here.

1022
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,680
What will people say?

1023
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,540
You can't go in.

1024
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:09,510
You should go.

1025
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,190
- Out of my way!
- No!

1026
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:13,990
I have no time or energy to argue with you.

1027
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,310
Sunjeong!

1028
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,320
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

1029
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,190
I'm okay.

1030
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,620
Why are you here?

1031
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:35,040
I brought some plants for your place.

1032
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:36,850
She wouldn't let me go in.

1033
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,220
Subak,

1034
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,720
don't ever come here again.

1035
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,320
If I want to see the kids, I'll go there.

1036
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,950
So you should stop coming here.

1038
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,010
Living with your in laws is hell?

1039
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,950
Thank you for enduring it.

1040
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,310
Move out right now!

1041
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,910
Let's move out.

1042
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,010
I can't, not like this.

1043
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,550
What's going on here?

1044
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,910
It's not his fault.

1045
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,880
How can you break her heart like this?

1046
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,190
You should be ashamed of yourself!

1047
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,380
The breadwinner can't get sick.

1048
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,350
Get up, why don't you?

1049
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,040
Leave me alone! 
Just leave me alone!

1050
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:47,910
I'm sorry. For our kids' sake...

1051
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,610
I'm leaving.

1052
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:52,150
He's not family.
You can't expect anything.

1053
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:55,740
Father, please help me.

1054
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,220
I was so good to you!
You're a beast!

1055
01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:59,890
I...

1056
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,350
I didn't want to say this,

1057
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,150
but do you know why I divorced Subak?
