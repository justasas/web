2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,990
We're getting a divorce.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,480
I'm very sorry.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,220
Did you discuss it with Subak?

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,690
Or is it just you?

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,220
We agreed on it a long time ago.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,090
To be honest, the reason I didn't come home wasn't because I was busy.

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,990
I needed time to think about it.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,250
This is so out of the blue.

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,740
Why are you doing this?

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,380
Why are you getting a divorce?

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,680
Tell us what this is about.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,590
Did Subak do something wrong?

14
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,320
Tell us. It's okay.

15
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,590
She didn't do anything wrong.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,790
Then why is it?

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,910
Things are starting to get better for you.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,980
So what's the reason?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,220
Is there someone else?

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,480
Don't say that.

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,520
What else could it be?

22
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,390
Minjung wouldn't just ask for a divorce.

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,790
I'm totally heartbroken.

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,320
Just tell us the truth.

25
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,090
I'm really sorry.

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,340
Please forgive me.

27
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,710
It's all my fault.

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,780
Don't say that.

29
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,150
What about the kids?

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,210
How can you do this to them?

31
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,590
I was really worried about them and gave it a lot of thought.

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,490
Mother,

33
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,620
please take good care of Aeji and Jungji.

34
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,310
I'll pay child support,

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,340
and I'll pay you for your time.

36
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,410
Will you raise them until they enter elementary school?

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:17,280
I don't think I can work with peace of mind if someone else took care of them.

38
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:25,220
I know it's wrong of me to ask that of you,

39
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,150
but mother, please, I'm begging you.

40
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,990
I'll take them when they enter elementary school.

41
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,120
Goodbye.

42
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,890
Oh, Minjung! Oh, you can't divorce her.

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,850
You can never divorce her.

44
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,240
Is it because of me?

45
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,550
I've been horrible to you.

46
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm begging you, please don't.

47
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,950
We can't live without you.

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,020
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,890
Hey, Minjung! Minjung! Oh!

50
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,650
Minjung, don't go.

51
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,420
Don't go, for me.

52
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,850
What will I do if you leave like this?

53
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,440
Minjung, whatever it is, I'll take care of it.

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,490
I'll fix Subak, okay?

55
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,350
I can't live without you.

56
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,150
How can you leave like this?

57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,550
Let him go.

58
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,780
How can I? How?

59
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,480
You have nowhere to go.

60
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,680
It's freezing. Where will you go?

61
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,280
Say something! Tell him not to go!

62
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,120
You should go. We'll talk later.

63
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,710
Goodbye.

64
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,950
Minjung! Minjung!

65
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,280
Minjung...

66
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,690
Why did you come here?

67
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,950
I told them everything.

68
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,320
Told them what? What?

69
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,590
About our divorce.

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,110
Why did you tell them?

71
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,310
We could've done it in secret.

72
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,510
How much did you tell them?

73
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,190
I asked how much!

74
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,820
What are you afraid of?

75
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,550
I'm not afraid!

76
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,780
I just don't want to stir things up.

77
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,610
We decided to keep it between us.

78
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,180
I never promised you anything.

79
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,850
Must we pinky swear?

80
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,590
You should've known better.

81
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,710
So you told them?

82
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,590
You want my father to kill me?

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,210
Then why did you do it?

84
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,820
What did I do?

85
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,540
I didn't. It's too filthy for my mouth.

86
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,040
We'll make it official tomorrow.

87
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,250
Oh, man.

88
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,890
What's the reason?

89
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,590
There's no reason. Just because.

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,450
Just because?

91
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,390
Who gets divorced just because?

92
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,690
Is marriage a joke?

93
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,890
When did you first talk about it?

94
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,090
Who brought it up first?

95
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,340
A while ago.

96
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,890
We pushed it off because of Gwangbak's wedding.

97
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,650
Why did he come here and stir things up?

98
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,480
He's thoughtless.

99
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,610
You're the thoughtless one.

100
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,320
How could you try to get a divorce behind your parents back?

101
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,420
Who brought it up first?

102
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,840
I did.

103
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,610
What?

104
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,180
I mean, Minjung did.

105
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,150
What did you do to make him want to?

106
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,410
I didn't do anything.

107
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,650
Be honest!

108
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,210
You must have done something!

109
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,090
I said I didn't! That hurt!

110
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,110
I won't get mad, so tell us why.

111
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,340
We just, we just grew apart.

112
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,590
Grew apart how?

113
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,090
After his business went bankrupt, it happened.

114
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,820
How can it happen when you have two kids?

115
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:19,090
Mom and I both think you did something.

116
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,040
How could you?

117
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,780
How could you blame me for everything?

118
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,610
Whenever something happens, you blame me.

119
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,740
But that's so unfair.

120
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,990
You never believed in me, not even once.

121
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,150
When a couple decides to get a divorce,

122
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,950
they both have problems.

123
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,840
It's not just one person's fault!

124
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,710
Did you borrow money from a loan shark?

125
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,390
I didn't.

126
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,490
I'm not that stupid.

127
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,590
Then did you cheat on him?

128
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,690
Father.

129
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,320
Then why is he divorcing you?

130
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,190
He's not. I'm divorcing him.

131
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,790
Why are you?

132
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,310
We decided together!

133
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,950
You're completely out of your mind!

134
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,840
You can't do it.

135
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,480
When Hobak wanted to, you let her.

136
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,980
So why can't I do it?

137
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,410
Hobak's different from you.

138
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,810
Hobak can take care of herself, but not you.

139
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,620
Divorce isn't a reward!

140
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,480
Why do you want it so badly?

141
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,240
Did you have children for fun?

142
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,350
Why can't you put them first?

143
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,980
How can you get a divorce when there's no good enough reason?

144
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,680
I can't live with him in the same house.

145
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,590
I'm sick and tired of him.

146
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,820
That's the reason.

147
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,840
What more do I need?

148
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,450
I'm getting a divorce.

149
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,050
How dare you!

150
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,650
Oh, boy.

151
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,620
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

152
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,440
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

153
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,250
My wedding's off, right?

154
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,390
Why would it be off?

155
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,950
Look how things are going right now.

156
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,450
If she waited until Gwangbak's wedding,

157
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,190
why didn't she wait until your wedding?

158
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,420
She's so thoughtless.

159
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,210
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

160
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,690
You all blame me.

161
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,420
Why do you say it's my fault all the time?

162
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,290
Minjung wouldn't do this for no reason.

163
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,410
You can tell your mom.

164
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,790
Every breakup has a reason.

165
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,290
Did Minjung cheat on you?

166
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,950
I don't know.

167
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,610
Did he?

168
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,450
No, it's not like that.

169
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,710
I just fell out of love.

170
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,590
Mom, there were problems from the start.

171
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,320
We married 3 months after we first met.

172
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,110
And we lived together and had kids.

173
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,240
It wasn't because there was love.

174
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,840
And when he went bankrupt, I hated him.

175
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,550
You said you're worried about me.

176
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,750
Don't. I'll do better than Hobak.

177
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,510
What does Hobak have that I don't?

178
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,340
Only Minjung can stand you.

179
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,020
Beg him for forgiveness before he signs the papers.

180
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,090
But I didn't do anything wrong!

181
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,480
Other moms encourage their daughters when they think of getting divorced,

182
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,340
saying you shouldn't stay unhappily married.

183
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,950
Why can't you do that?

184
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,690
Staying together until death do us apart?

185
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,520
Who does that now?

186
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,940
Oh, unbelievable. I can't believe me ears.

187
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,920
You're out of your mind!

188
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,520
I'm done talking.

189
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,440
This is my problem and it's my life.

190
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,920
Mom, you stay out and tell father that, too.

191
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,780
I'm going to my class.

192
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,750
Okay, Aunt Sunjeong.
 I'll see you later.

193
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,550
Who is it?

194
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,920
Can't you see? It's me.

195
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,820
Hello.

196
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,550
Who is it?
When you saw me?

197
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,120
You should've said, hello, mother.

198
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,110
- What were you doing?
- I was vacuuming.

199
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,650
Clean every corner.

200
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,010
You should open the windows.

201
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,280
That's father's seat.

202
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,190
Did someone train you to say that?

203
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,210
Let me see your room.

204
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,240
It looks the same.

205
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,380
The wedding cost you nothing, huh?

206
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,040
No wedding gifts, no new furniture.

207
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,620
You brought nothing with you?

208
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,240
The bed is new.

209
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,590
You only brought a bed?

210
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,380
Talking to you is making me thirsty.

211
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,680
Do you have anything to drink?

212
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,420
There's jujube tea.

213
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,620
Miss Kim, one jujube tea for table 5.

214
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,510
I used to do that.

215
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,880
Go.

216
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,090
You already made it?

217
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,340
I had made a fresh pot a little while ago.

218
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,550
I'll have it downstairs.

219
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,520
Are you trying to save jujube?

220
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,780
Excuse me?

221
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,750
It doesn't tastes like jujube. It's water.

222
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,140
Why do you think they call it jujube tea?

223
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,840
On TV, the main characters appear the most.

224
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,980
Jujube is the main character of this tea!

225
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,480
Where's the jujube?

226
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,540
What did you learn before getting married?

227
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,950
Your mom didn't teach you anything?

228
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,320
When I ran a tea house, I didn't do this.

229
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,210
Customers would get angry if you did this.

230
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,190
Can you make Ssanghwa tea or kudzu tea?

231
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,450
No.

232
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,450
I'll teach you later.

233
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,950
My tea house was a happening place.

234
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,550
Especially my Ssanghwa tea.

235
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,120
Can you float an egg yolk in Ssanghwa tea?

236
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,640
No.

237
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,010
Men go wild over them.

238
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,590
You didn't get any wedding jewelry?

239
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,290
No, I only got a wedding band.

240
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,250
You should've gotten some wedding jewelry.

241
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,190
There must be something wrong with you.

242
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,340
Foolish girl.

243
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,110
You gave nothing to your father in law?

244
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,710
I gave a small gift to him.

245
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,050
Like what?

246
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,150
A tie pin and...

247
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,090
Ugh.

248
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,450
Talking to you is making me hungry.

249
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,240
Get me something to eat.

250
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,050
But the side dishes...

251
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,210
You can make fried rice, can't you?

252
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,140
I can try.

253
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,680
I will make it.

254
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,820
I will make it.

255
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,420
Mother.

256
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,150
I will make it, mother.

257
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,210
I'm so tired. I need to lie down.

258
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,010
Not in father's room.

259
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,590
Says who?

260
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,140
Aunt Sunjeong did.

261
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,880
Hey, you should know who's more important.

262
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,590
I'm your mother in law.
She's just an aunt.

263
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,280
I'm like the owner and she's the server in a tea house.

264
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,320
Don't be cheeky.

265
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,840
Mother.

266
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,410
Can I put some ham in it?

267
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,950
You can put anything you want.

268
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,980
Why do you have to ask that?

269
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,980
Mother.

270
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,210
The serum is perfect for this season.

271
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,320
Look at me. I use it.

272
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,610
I'll take it, then.

273
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,690
Have a nice day.

274
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,010
- Mom.
- Don't even call me mom.

275
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,690
Mom, I'll be happy.

276
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,920
Shut up.

277
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,480
Oh, mother, how are you?

278
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,740
Not good.

279
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,320
I'll drop by soon.

280
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,190
There's no need for that.

281
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,340
How are you at housekeeping?

282
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,980
I'm still learning.

283
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,740
But I'm trying to do my best.

284
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,090
That's not good.
You should do it well.

285
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,590
Making money isn't easy,

286
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,950
so don't waste any.

287
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,190
Don't snack like that and save money.

288
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,390
Your wife's working really hard,

289
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,480
so how can you eat stuff like that?

290
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,820
But I only ate one.

291
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,090
Did you get that for free?

292
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,480
If Hobak finds out, she'll flip out.

293
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,010
I won't eat stuff like this again.

294
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,510
What are you going to do about your sister?

295
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,780
Why is your mother being so difficult?

296
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,750
To be frank, we don't really care.

297
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,740
It's your sister who's in trouble.

298
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,840
You mom said that to me about Hobak.

299
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,420
She had no idea this would happen to her.

300
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,190
Why does it take 3 months?

301
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,820
Why does it have to be so complicated?

302
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,110
It should be much simpler to get a divorce.

303
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,110
Having to wait is too inconvenient.

304
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,940
So are we divorced or not?

305
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,440
Let's say we are,

306
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,680
even though we're not yet officially.

307
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,590
Goodbye.

308
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,940
Hold on.

309
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,120
Child support and money for my mom.

310
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,710
You promised to pay, so don't forget.

311
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,490
Thanks for divorcing me so quickly

312
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,920
and for not saying anything to my parents.

313
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,980
Should we grab lunch?

314
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,550
My treat.

315
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,550
I don't want to eat with you.

316
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,450
Take good care of the kids.

317
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,410
I'll send child support to your mother.

318
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,310
I'm clearing out of the office soon.

319
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:38,250
Make sure none of the investors find out.

320
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,720
Yes, Mr. Seo.
I'll talk to you later.

321
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,940
Congratulate me.

322
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,180
I'm coming from the courthouse.

323
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,040
It's done?

324
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,290
Of course.

325
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,950
I feel like a decade of baggage has been lifted off of my shoulders!

326
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,980
That baggage was too much for me.

327
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,710
Baggage?

328
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,850
10 year old baggage.
Don't they say that?

329
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,320
I feel so much lighter now that it's gone.

330
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,920
I guess it was easy for you.

331
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,680
When I got divorced, it was really hard.

332
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,340
I'm not one of those desperate kinds.

333
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,820
Yes, father.

334
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,910
I'd like to see you.

335
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,520
There's nothing more I can tell you.

336
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,020
Even so, let's meet.

337
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,990
I miss you.

338
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,520
And I have something to say.

339
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,220
Let me ask you one thing.

340
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,020
What was the reason?

341
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,980
Subak won't say it and you won't say it.

342
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,320
Who gets divorced without any reasons?

343
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,110
I've been married for forty years,

344
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,050
but when there are kids, divorce isn't easy.

345
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,940
I can't pinpoint a reason.

346
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:27,040
I think things just got all built up.

347
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,950
They say little things matter,

348
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,340
and we've have troubles for a long time.

349
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,180
I'm sorry.

350
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,550
You're not a man who'd do this to your kids.

351
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,640
I know what kind of person you are.

352
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,410
Isn't this Subak's fault?

353
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,010
You can tell me.

354
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,250
At least I should know.

355
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,990
She needs to fix whatever she did.

356
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,050
You can't just divorce her like this.

357
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,520
Father.

358
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:14,010
We already filed the papers.

359
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,590
What?

360
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,050
We have a 3 month waiting period.

361
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,820
This is all my fault.

362
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,790
Don't come down too hard on Subak.

363
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,880
Please let her move on with her life.

364
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,920
What about the kids?

365
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,840
The kids...

366
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,610
Minjung...

367
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,790
The kids...

368
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,140
I will take them, no matter what.

369
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,610
Please look after them for now.

370
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,290
Until, until they enter elementary school.

371
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,110
Goodbye.

372
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,380
They filed the papers.

373
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,290
He sounded really determined.

374
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,380
How can they do it so quickly?

375
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,290
They just brought it up!

376
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,990
I think they've been planning on it.

377
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,920
What did he say?

378
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,320
Nothing much.

379
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,840
He asked me to look after his kids.

380
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,880
He got choked up when he said it.

381
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,340
Something happened, I'm sure of it.

382
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,820
They have a three month waiting period,

383
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,220
so let's try to change their mind.

384
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,750
What is it, mom?

385
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,090
Is it about uncle?

386
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,440
I can't even think about your uncle right now.

387
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,410
Have you seen Minjung lately?

388
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,280
Minjung? No.

389
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,690
I saw him last at Gwangbak's wedding. Why?

390
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,290
Did you tell him about that thing?

391
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,590
What thing?

392
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,250
Why would I?
I swore I'd take that to the grave.

393
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,340
You really didn't?

394
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,020
I didn't.

395
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,790
What's going on?
Why did you ask me that?

396
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,720
Your sister got a divorce.

397
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,350
What?

398
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,480
Minjung.

399
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,220
What's going on?

400
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,320
I heard from mom.

401
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,020
Where are you staying?

402
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,140
I got a room.

403
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,410
It's not far from your parents place.

404
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,110
Because of the kids...

405
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,910
You look sick.

406
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,340
Did you take medicine?

407
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,480
It's not working.
It must be a severe cold.

408
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,380
Oh... You don't look well.

409
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,020
Minjung, you can tell me.

410
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,090
Why did you do it?

411
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,290
You already know why.

412
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,290
But I didn't tell your parents.

413
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,210
Subak is seeing her boss.

414
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,520
Minjung...

415
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,340
The problem was,

416
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,690
she demanded for a divorce even after what she did.

417
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,950
How could anyone do that?

418
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:17,380
I can't believe I had two kids with someone like that.

419
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:27,050
She should've apologized, at least.

420
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,340
Minjung...

421
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,480
I'm so sorry.

422
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,740
For the sake of my kids,

423
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,590
I wanted to stay together as a family.

424
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:55,140
But I just couldn't...

425
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,340
I know how that feels.

426
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:02,490
Others may not, but I know.

427
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,380
I just want to go somewhere and die.

428
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,880
I'm sorry.

429
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,980
I can't even ask you to forgive Subak.

430
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,750
Hobak.

431
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,820
Let me ask you one thing.

432
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,050
How long has she been seeing her boss?

433
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,990
She didn't meet him at work, did she?

434
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,520
You know something, don't you?

435
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,940
No, Minjung. 
I don't know anything.

436
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,880
There's no need to hide anything now.

437
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,610
Please be honest with me.

438
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,750
Hobak.

439
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,250
You're not even human.

440
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,890
What did you do to Minjung?

441
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,820
All you care about is Minjung!

442
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,320
I warned you to stop.

443
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,020
To end it before Minjung found out.

444
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,490
How could you let him find out?

445
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,290
You should've at least kept it a secret!

446
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,450
You understand him, but not me, do you?

447
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,380
Have you ever been on my side?

448
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,340
What are you going to do?

449
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,520
About what?

450
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,920
I'm going to marry him.

451
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,340
You're insane.

452
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,550
I'm sorry, but I'm not insane.

453
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,110
I'm actually glad.

454
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,880
Mom, father, and you may think Minjung's great,

455
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,590
but he's not right for me.

456
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,410
If I had married the other man,

457
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:44,440
I'd be living large, spending lots of money.

458
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,790
How can you be so mean?

459
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,090
You told me to never speak of it.

460
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,220
Then you should know better.

461
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,820
How could you date him again and get a divorce?

462
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,490
Go to Minjung and beg him to forgive you.

463
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,090
He said he wants to die.

464
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,320
Let him do whatever he wants.

465
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,410
Subak.

466
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,550
You met up with him again?

467
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,490
Mom asked me if I told him that.

468
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,320
That's why I met with him.

469
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,480
He's really sick,

470
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,840
but he's been working. He looked awful.

471
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,790
Don't you have any conscience?

472
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,020
You must think of mom and father.

473
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:26,340
They had to hide the fact that you were living with a man!

474
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,020
Was that a sin?

475
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,550
You weren't proud, so you hid it.

476
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,380
You always say you're the eldest child.

477
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,090
You want people to talk about your divorce?

478
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,290
Father's a respected vice principal in this town.

479
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,590
You should've done better!

480
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,750
I will do better.

481
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,820
Let's cut to the chase.

482
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,610
Win Minjung back in three months.

483
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,820
Why is everyone on my case?
It's my life!

484
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,610
You butt out!

485
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,820
Minjung doesn't know about that yet.

486
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,340
Don't let him find out.

487
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,290
Tell him!

488
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,820
It's over now, so who cares?

489
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,110
Don't do something you'll regret.

490
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,410
Don, really?

491
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,140
What do we do now?

492
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,320
What can we do?

493
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,790
We can't see each other until they say yes.

494
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,940
Don!

495
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,010
Don't cry.

496
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,220
Don't you miss me?

497
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,310
Of course I miss you.

498
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:52,620
I want to run to you and take you away to the ends of the world!

499
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,980
Bye.

500
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,240
Don! Don!

501
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,020
Don't cry, Yeongdal.

502
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,550
You shouldn't when you're pregnant.

503
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,210
What do I do, Hobak?

504
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:16,350
Don says we can't meet until mom says yes.

505
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,320
Don't worry.

506
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:23,020
You have a powerful weapon. The baby.

507
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,190
Don't worry.
Just focus on your baby.

508
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:30,040
Think peaceful and beautiful thoughts.

509
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,750
Hobak, thank you.

510
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,690
And I'm sorry.

511
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,590
When you married my brother,

512
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,720
I thought you were really pathetic

513
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,020
for getting pregnant and becoming a burden.

514
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,790
But that's right.

515
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,690
We're both pathetic, so we got pregnant to marry great guys.

516
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,380
Don't cry.

517
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,240
What's for dinner?
It smells good.

518
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,920
Stewed tofu. Your favorite.

519
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,140
Don't make it too salty.

520
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,590
I know.

521
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,840
Sedal,

522
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,440
I want us to agree on everything.

523
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,410
You mean Yeongdal?

524
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,210
Whatever it is.

525
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,220
We'll speak out as one.

526
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,220
That way, our opinion will have more weight.

527
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,910
Oh, boy...

528
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,320
What were you doing?

529
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,790
It was my turn to do the dishes.

530
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,020
Bong, come and sit down.

531
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,820
What is it, mother?

532
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,020
What are we going to do about Don?

533
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,110
He should get married before the baby comes.

534
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,880
He should.

535
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:00,110
I'll get him a place when Mrs. Park says yes.

536
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,610
Where will you get the money?

537
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,610
She's right.

538
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,180
I think they should live here.

539
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,740
He's too young.
I must take care of him.

540
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,340
Having Subak is bad enough.

541
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,710
I can't have Don live here, too!

542
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,220
I don't think so.

543
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,620
What?

544
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,910
Her mom won't let her marry Don.

545
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,550
I've never seen a meaner person.

546
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,220
She wouldn't shut up in front of Bong.

547
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,320
You should go talk to her.

548
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,290
I don't care what happens.

549
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,220
Leave her alone.

550
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,620
She'll come and beg us.

551
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,120
Her daughter's stomach is growing as we speak.

552
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,020
But you've experienced the same thing!

553
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,610
Think of when Hobak was pregnant.

554
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,950
Hobak and Yeongdal aren't the same!

555
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,220
If Don were my son, I would never let him marry Yeongdal.

556
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,410
She'll be your sister in law. Be nice.

557
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,640
Oh, I don't care!

558
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,090
I'm already upset.

559
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,450
He's more upset than you!

560
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,720
What's done is done, but he's afraid of you.

561
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,450
And Yeongdal's family won't approve of him.

562
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,550
No wonder he paces the yard all night!

563
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,720
He should go to work!
Just look at him.

564
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,140
Your bride wants red bean porridge.

565
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,750
Wait! Hold on!

566
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,140
I'm leaving red bean porridge by the door.

567
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,220
Eat it with your mother.

568
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,850
Hobak, it's red bean porridge.

569
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,290
Don left it by the door.

570
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,110
Oh, my uncle is so caring.

571
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,990
Go get mother.

572
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,590
I can't believe Loser.

573
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,820
Stop it.

574
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,450
Mom, come out.
Have some red bean porridge.

575
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,140
I don't want any.

576
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,450
Oh, my!

577
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,250
I can't believe how quickly he came.

578
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,280
What about mother?

579
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,410
She said, "I don't want any."

580
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,320
Yeongdal, eat.

581
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,890
You must eat what you crave to have a pretty baby.

582
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,290
Sedal, come here.

583
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,050
Come and have some.

584
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,390
I don't want any.

585
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,740
My uncle sent a lot so you can have some.

586
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,510
Yeongdal just gobbled it up.

587
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,840
It's really delicious. Please get up.

588
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,640
Sedal never did this for me when I was pregnant.

589
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,240
Yeongdal is really lucky.

590
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,010
My uncle is so caring.

591
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,240
This is being really lucky?
Really lucky?

592
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,280
Are you trying to make me go mad?

593
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:12,090
If you were me, would you let her marry Loser?

594
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,820
I wouldn't.

595
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,050
I'd want someone rich and handsome.

596
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,010
But what can we do?
She's pregnant.

597
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,520
Mother, my uncle isn't much right now,

598
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,180
but he'll cherish Yeongdal.

599
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,490
It takes him time, but he'll be successful.

600
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,390
My grandmother had him when she was older,

601
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,550
so he's always been a late bloomer.

602
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,740
- But in the end...
- Stop it.

603
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,710
I've known him since his middle school days.

604
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,850
Like you always say,

605
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,350
you must wait until the end...

606
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,150
I don't want to talk about this.

607
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,550
To see how your life turns out.

608
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,050
That's what you said.

609
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,680
How can you laugh at a time like this?

610
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,240
Take this and get out!

611
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,590
Congratulations, Daese.

612
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,910
Congratulations, father.

613
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,820
Father, you're amazing.

614
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,410
I'm proud of you.

615
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,720
This is made with 24 carat gold.

616
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:14,550
When I goth this, my heart was pounding.

617
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,990
I was so touched.

618
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,850
Your father's really amazing.

619
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,790
The employees collected money and bought it

620
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,110
for him for the foundation day to show gratitude.

621
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,620
When it comes to business, he's the best.

622
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:33,110
He never missed a deadline and never missed employees pay day.

623
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,420
Father, I really respect you.

624
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,820
You're amazing.

625
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:40,510
Your employees must respect you so much.

626
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,090
He cried when he got this at the office.

627
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,350
Let's give him a big hand.

628
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,750
Uncle and Yeongdal...

629
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,010
I'm not listening.

630
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,720
Sit down.

631
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,280
Why did you leave this out?
Fish cake?

632
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,910
Mom told me she saw it.

633
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,550
You were eating fish cake.

634
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,410
Huh? Uh...

635
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,820
Why did you leave that out?

636
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,490
Sorry.

637
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,990
I'll never leave it out again.

638
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,020
I'll record everything.

639
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,640
Please forgive me.

640
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,780
We're even, then.

641
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,210
About what?

642
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,890
My uncle.

643
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,790
No way.

644
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,790
Sedal, do as I say.

645
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,840
Sedal.

646
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,890
Didn't you see him getting porridge?

647
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,550
You never did that for me, remember?

648
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,910
My uncle's different.

649
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,180
He's the kind of man a woman should be with.

650
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,680
Yeongdal loves him and she's pregnant.

651
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,820
That's enough.
We started out like that, too.

652
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,090
What's done is done, so you should...

653
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:28,780
If you make my sister cry, I'll kill you.

654
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,410
You're giving me your blessing?

655
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,050
Respect me as your wife's older brother.

656
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,750
Thanks, Sedal.

657
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,780
I'm furious to give my sister away to a loser like you!

658
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,550
Sedal!

659
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,280
Sedal!

660
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,980
Who are you to give them blessings?

661
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,250
I'm not much,

662
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,140
but I'm Yeongdal's older brother.

663
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,820
Loser's an okay kid.

664
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,280
His only flaw is having no money,

665
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,480
but who doesn't have any flaws?

666
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,250
But that's a huge flaw!

667
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,550
We've been friends since middle school.

668
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,910
He's a nice guy and he's genuine.

669
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,050
And he'll never cheat on her.

670
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,890
He won't beat her or break her heart.

671
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,450
Mom, let them get married.
I'll vouch for him.

672
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,550
Your father said never to vouch for anyone.

673
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,220
I will do it this once.

674
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,450
Mom, let them get married.

675
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,890
My precious daughter's ruined! She's ruined!

676
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,820
I didn't raise her to give her away to Loser!

677
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,090
I spent so much money on Yeongdal!

678
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,890
And now she's marrying a penniless man!

679
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,890
I didn't get my money's worth, so I can't!

680
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,490
But this is Yeongdal's fate.

681
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,320
I gave up so it's your turn to give up.

682
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,720
Yeongdal's in love.

683
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:11,220
I can't give up.

684
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,320
Why are both of my kids putting me through such ordeals?

685
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:18,240
Why couldn't you marry someone I approve of?

686
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,410
How can the Wang family take both of my kids?

687
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,950
I'd rather die than see that happen.

688
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,680
I don't want anything to do with that family.

689
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,140
Why didn't you answer your phone?

690
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,340
I called you many times yesterday and today.

691
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,720
I have no time to answer my phone.

692
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,090
You're that busy?

693
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,750
I had to do the laundry, clean the house,

694
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,840
and this house is huge with lots to clean.

695
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,190
I'm a beginner, so it's really hard.

696
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,090
But you need to write, too.

697
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,850
I have no time to write.

698
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,290
Your mother came yesterday.

699
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:59,590
She did?
You two must be close.

700
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,590
Huh?

701
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,390
Honey, it's nice to be married.

702
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,450
I made up with mom because of it.

703
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,180
She deserves your compassion.

704
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,490
She's staying in Seoul to get to know you.

705
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,180
For how long?

706
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,510
I don't know. I think she likes you.

707
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,640
Good morning.

708
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,010
You're an early riser.

709
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,410
I'm not but I'm trying really hard.

710
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,680
They eat breakfast early, so we have to.

711
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,090
I heard my sister came yesterday.

712
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,280
Yes.

713
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,340
She's my sister and Sangnam's mom,

714
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,490
but she's not a nice person.

715
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,720
Don't let her push you around. Be wise.

716
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,680
Do you understand what I mean?

717
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,140
Any news?

718
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,290
You're married, so there should be news.

719
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,510
But we just got married, father.

720
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,680
Everything comes in due time.

721
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,640
Why? Other's have kids just like that.

722
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,010
Water.

723
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,410
Who washed this cup?

724
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,180
I did.

725
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,280
I washed it.

726
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,640
Why is it so dirty?

727
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,320
Don't you know how to do anything?

728
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,010
Father.

729
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,110
Am I wrong?

730
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:43,180
When you clean the bathroom, wipe the floor dry.

731
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,680
I almost slipped walking in.

732
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:45,950
I'll remember that.

733
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,090
She works hard all day.

734
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,320
She's not a housekeeper.

735
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,890
It's her first time, so give her credit.

736
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,120
What?

737
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,720
- Sangnam.
- Aunt Sunjeong, let me talk.

738
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,290
Father, I want to say something.

739
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,550
What's wrong, Sangnam?

740
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,890
Aunt Sunjeong cooks the meals,

741
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,320
but Gwangbak's too busy with cleaning and laundry.

742
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,890
She didn't marry me to do housekeeping.

743
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:11,050
She wants to be a writer, but she has no time.

744
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,220
In marriage, two people must help the other to grow.

745
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,620
And I promised her that.

746
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,550
What are you trying to say?

747
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,720
Sangnam, later.

748
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,390
After we both go to work,

749
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,320
I want her to have some free time.

750
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:28,550
We should all leave her alone so she can have her own time.

751
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,780
That way, she can read books and write.

752
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,380
Was it you?

753
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,610
- Excuse me?
- It wasn't her. It's all me.

754
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,750
You're already manipulating your husband?

755
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,380
How long have you been married?

756
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,890
How much work did you actually do?

757
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,920
She had nothing to do with what I said, father.

758
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,680
You stay out!

759
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:55,380
I know both of you are in on this!

760
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,420
Good for you, idiot.

761
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,590
You let your wife manipulate you.

762
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,780
How could you do this to me?

763
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,210
I'm in trouble now.

764
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:14,640
Is this your way of helping?

765
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,180
I don't know what just happened.

766
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,320
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.

767
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,550
How did my words get so twisted?

768
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,240
Don't try to help me from now on.

769
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,880
- I meant...
- I know.

770
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,220
I do, but the method was wrong.

771
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,220
Just pretend you don't know anything.

772
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,590
Even if your father and I end up fighting,

773
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,910
I want us to work things out.

774
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,410
It's better to do that than you butting in whenever something happens.

775
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,780
Anyone could've taken it the wrong way.

776
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,590
What do I do?
Did you see aunt's face?

777
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,590
Why are you making enemies?

778
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,120
Oh, this is hard.

779
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,550
I made another mistake?

780
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,680
This is my first time getting married.

781
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,240
Whatever.

782
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,280
Parcel service.

783
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:14,740
I'll be there in ten minutes.

784
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,820
Mom, are you coming from your class?

785
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,180
Yes.

786
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,550
What's that?

787
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,090
It's money.

788
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,720
Why did you laminate this?

789
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:02,220
That's the money that man gave me.

790
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,520
You didn't spend it?

791
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,680
No. I'm going to keep it.

792
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,590
I miss him.

793
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,990
I don't think he's at Daebak's house.

794
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,350
Mom, I'm going to my piano lesson.

795
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,340
I miss him.

796
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,320
I do, too.

797
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,790
Daebak, eat.

798
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:40,850
It's my sister's fault, right?

799
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:44,350
No, both of us are at fault.

800
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,850
That can't be.

801
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:51,240
She never cooked for you, and when your business went bankrupt, she was mean.

802
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,780
I know all that.

803
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:59,190
But can you change your mind for mom and father?

804
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,680
They think of you as their own son.

805
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,220
My father can't even eat these days.

806
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:09,250
Can't you be their son, just until I grow up?

807
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:19,340
Daebak, where have you been?

808
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,890
Did you finish your homework?

809
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,620
What will become of you?

810
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:24,250
You're not even studying.

811
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,940
I want to quit school.

812
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,090
Why? What's wrong?

813
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,890
Is there another girl?

814
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,490
It's not a girl.
My family's a mess.

815
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,490
We never have any peace at home.

816
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,850
Why? What happened?

817
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:46,750
Miho, I'm saying this for your sake.

818
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,590
Don't marry into my family.

819
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,410
You won't be able to handle it.

820
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,850
I'm letting you go out of love, so just go.

821
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,720
Daebak, tell me what it is.

822
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,140
What's going on?

823
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,390
Mom. mom. He got a divorce.

824
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,320
What?

825
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,590
He signed the papers, packed up and left.

826
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,180
He's been living alone for a while now.

827
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,720
No wonder I didn't see him.

828
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,250
Why? For what?

829
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:24,210
I don't know, but Subak did something.

830
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,520
My in laws are in trouble.

831
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,110
The person you have called is unavailable,

832
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,990
so your call will be directed to voicemail.

833
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,390
Where are you, Minjung?

834
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,290
Can we meet?

835
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,940
I made some side dishes for you.

836
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,690
Don't worry about me.

837
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,880
Have you been eating?

838
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,190
Yes. I'm working right now.

839
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,780
It'll only take a minute.

840
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:39,010
I'll come out to where you are. Okay?

841
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,650
Oh, yes.

842
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:53,640
Minjung!

843
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:54,610
Why did you come out?

844
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:56,890
I wanted to give you some side dishes.

845
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,390
And I wanted to see you.

846
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:03,320
Here's your daddy. Oh.

847
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:08,590
I brought him because I knew you miss him.

848
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:17,620
I brought some kimchi and other side dishes.

849
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:20,220
You're the one who made this kimchi,

850
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:23,790
so how could you leave without eating it all?

851
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:27,280
Whenever I eat it, I think of you.

852
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:32,680
When everyone eats it, I think of you.

853
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:37,780
When I think about you carrying me to the ER...

854
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,380
Are you cooking your own food?

855
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,490
Kind of...

856
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,510
It's not easy for a man to live on his own.

857
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,410
Where are you staying?

858
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:57,110
I just got a small room.

859
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,990
Is it far from here?

860
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,350
No.

861
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,290
Can I come by sometime?

862
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,820
I'd like to cook something for you.

863
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,140
It's okay.

864
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:09,010
I don't have time to eat at home.

865
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,140
My family's a mess.

866
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:15,720
My husband just might kill Subak.

867
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:21,520
We all believe it's Subak's fault.

868
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:29,750
Minjung, can't you give it another thought?

869
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:37,140
Drop by anytime to see the kids.

870
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,340
Jungji's been asking for you.

871
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,020
Huh?

872
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,210
He calls every man he sees "daddy."

873
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,390
I don't think he can talk yet.

874
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,720
He can!

875
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:51,020
When he sees men your age on TV,

876
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:55,280
he points to him and says, "Daddy, daddy."

877
00:52:55,290 --> 00:53:00,410
Jungji, say "Daddy. Daddy."

878
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:03,480
He said it before.

879
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,720
Say "Daddy. Daddy."

880
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,450
It's okay.

881
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:10,590
He must be feeling shy.

882
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:16,050
Whenever you want to see Aeji or Jungji,

883
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,350
just drop by the house.

884
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,920
If you don't want to see Subak,

885
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,720
come during the day when she's at work.

886
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,490
Goodbye, mother.
Thank you for this.

887
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,850
But don't bring me anymore food.

888
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:44,250
I'll drop by when I want to see the kids.

889
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,380
Take care of yourself.

890
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,850
Okay. Go.

891
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,450
Drive carefully, always.

892
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,780
Even if you're not married to Subak anymore,

893
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:57,780
don't cut off ties with me, okay?

894
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:33,020
And he turned around and my heart was...

895
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:38,410
I couldn't believe what's happening.

896
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,510
We're being torn apart here.

897
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,680
I grew fond of him

898
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:46,340
and thought of him as my own son,

899
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,720
but he left, just like that.

900
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:51,120
I don't know what to do.

901
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:55,050
I want to go somewhere and cry.

902
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,090
What did he say?

903
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,390
What could he say?

904
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,390
He looked awful.

905
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,450
His face shrank to this size.

906
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,320
He burst into tears when he saw Jungji.

907
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:08,490
But he tried hard not to cry.

908
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,290
It breaks your heart to see a man do that.

909
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:14,740
So where is he living?

910
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,110
Somewhere close.

911
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:21,550
He got a room near here.

912
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,950
Why didn't you get his address?

913
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,250
Oh, I should've.
I didn't think of that.

914
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,050
Let's go.

915
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,550
Already?

916
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,320
Have dinner with me.

917
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:39,350
I have a dinner appointment.

918
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,090
You seem to be very busy these days.

919
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,240
Men should keep busy.

920
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,790
Then call me later.

921
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:48,240
You can call me anytime.

922
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,880
I don't understand your parents.

923
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,020
They let you get a divorce?

924
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,880
I thought they wouldn't allow it.

925
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,290
What could they do?
I wanted it.

926
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,720
See you tomorrow.

927
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,450
I'm home.

928
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:32,620
What is it?

929
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,950
I met Minjung today.

930
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,020
Why did you meet him?

931
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,550
Why can't I?
He's my son in law.

932
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,680
Not anymore. We're divorced.

933
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,140
Legally, you're still married.

934
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,220
I brought Jungji with me and he cried.

935
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,020
How insane!

936
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,640
Why did you have to go meet him?

937
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,450
Just let me live my life, please.

938
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,320
You're always picking on me.

939
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:58,140
Everyone treats me like I'm invisible at home.

940
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:59,840
When I say hi, nobody replies.

941
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:03,020
Grandmother doesn't say, "You're home?"

942
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,710
It's because you're getting a divorce!

943
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:08,120
Go meet Minjung.

944
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,390
It's over between us.

945
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,790
If you keep this up, I'm moving out.

946
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,240
What about your kids?

947
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,610
How can I live here when you nag me?

948
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,050
If you want to leave, take your kids.

949
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,950
I have to work and make money!

950
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,720
You said you'd raise the kids.

951
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:26,290
Why would I do that when you're not here?

952
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:29,610
Minjung's going to pay you for raising them!

953
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:32,720
You're completely out of your mind.

954
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:36,490
My daughter's divorced, so how can I raise

955
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,820
her kids and get money from her ex-husband?

956
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:42,490
You're a bigger fool than I thought.

957
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,620
Why are you calling me a fool?

958
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,020
You're not giving me much choice.

959
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:50,090
Wait and see. I'll do great.

960
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,450
I can't live with someone who's poor.

961
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,180
So stop nagging me and just wait.

962
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:59,450
Something amazing will happen.

963
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:37,180
<i>My song comes back in a whistle</i>

964
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:44,220
<i>Memories build up in my small space</i>

965
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:52,290
<i>I don't understand why I'm tearing up</i>

966
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:38,950
<i>I put my little heart together and write</i>

967
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:50,020
<i>A poem, but it's not enough for you</i>

968
01:00:51,750 --> 01:01:05,090
<i>I'll become dust and fly</i>

969
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:12,450
<i>Blown by the wind</i>

970
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,720
<i>To your side...</i>

971
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,850
Minjung.

972
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,590
Minjung!

974
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:43,210
Don't think about anything.
Just get better.

975
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,140
Cheer up, Minjung.

976
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:45,220
Get me the deed to the house.

977
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:46,680
Why do you want that?

978
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:47,990
You can't take it.

979
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,720
Get as much money as possible.
There's no time.

980
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,990
I need it right now. 
It's my family.

981
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,910
Actually...

982
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,680
I think there's a reason why you come

983
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,320
when nobody else is home but me.

984
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:58,680
You're pretty smart.

985
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:00,720
Are you taking things out on Sangnam?

986
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:03,390
You're trying to come between me and him.

987
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,920
Is that how you were raised?

988
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:05,990
Did you want me to wait for you?

989
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,390
I won't say thank you.

990
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,220
I'll just remember it, always.
