00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,020
Oh, cold.

3
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,950
Where were you?

4
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,080
Go back to sleep.

5
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,910
I wasn't seeing a woman, so don't worry.

6
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,910
You better not!

7
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,590
Don, I have to go to the bathroom.

8
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,810
Bathroom?

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,710
Don, don't leave me. Stay, okay?

10
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,280
- Okay.
- You must, okay?

11
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,220
Okay.

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,620
Don!

13
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,880
Yeah?

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,090
Are you there?

15
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,240
I'm here, so don't worry.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,410
Don!

17
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,150
I'm here!

18
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,080
Don't go. I'm scared.

19
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,580
Don't worry. I won't go.

20
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,710
Ouch, ouch...

21
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,310
Don.

22
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,520
Yes?

23
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,950
Why are you out here?

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,110
Yeongdal said she was scared.

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,810
What?

26
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,050
But it's not a public bathroom!

27
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,390
She should be ashamed of herself!

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,390
Don!

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,080
Don, are you there? Don?

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,390
Don?

31
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,990
I'm not Don.

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,210
Is it you, Bong?

33
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,240
I'm scared, so can you stay there?

34
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,910
Huh? Uh, okay.

35
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,390
Bong!

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,850
Uh, yes.

37
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,050
I thought you left.

38
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,580
I'll stay here.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,180
Is someone in there?

40
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,340
Yeongdal.

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,690
Still? She's been in there forever!

42
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,390
Hey, hurry it up, won't you?

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,640
There are other people here, too, you know?

44
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,280
It's okay.

45
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,850
Some people have to go to work.

46
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,490
How can she just sit in there?

47
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,450
Please give me a few minutes.

48
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,110
She's so dense, so dense.

49
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,020
Hurry up!

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,220
Bong, are you still there?

51
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,280
Yes, I am.

52
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,350
Can you get me some toilet paper?

53
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,950
Uh, okay.

54
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,920
Hey, Don, Don...

55
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,740
Yeongdal, here.

56
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,090
Mother, did you sleep well?

57
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,020
I kept having bad dreams.

58
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,880
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo...

59
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,920
Telling me to hurry up won't help, 
especially when I'm constipated.

60
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,680
Oh, boy.

61
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,850
Huh? Mother...

62
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,890
Don't do this.

63
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,140
Enroll in a test prep course, judge.

64
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,290
Mom.

65
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,390
You've seen how things are going here.

66
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,880
You're the only hope for us.

67
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,110
There's no money for a test prep course.

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,420
I'll pay for it, no matter what.

69
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,720
So start studying again,

70
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,240
if you don't want me to die of anger.

71
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,640
It's too tiny here. I'll get indigestion.

72
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,320
This reminds me of when I fled from the war.

73
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,080
We didn't have a table like this back then,

74
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,720
so we ate on newspaper.

75
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,220
Oh, the bathroom is a problem.

76
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,920
It's too cold in there.

77
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,720
I thought my butt was going to freeze.

78
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,350
I thought my butt was going to freeze, too.

79
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,020
Bong didn't your butt freeze?

80
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,310
Huh? Uh, yes.

81
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,420
Oh, right.

82
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,490
I should be more polite, right?

83
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,440
Bottom.

84
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,580
No?

85
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,290
We should decide who goes first.

86
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,790
You can't just go in there early and stay there for hours.

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,590
Those who go to work should use it first,

88
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,050
and those who don't can go later.

89
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,020
Bong had to run to school this morning.

90
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,310
It was good exercise.

91
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,490
Running to the bathroom is not exercising!

92
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,290
Father, uncle, and Daebak should go first,

93
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,680
and the others can go later, I think.

94
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,740
Let Yeongdal go instead of me.

95
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,610
I can hold it.

96
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,090
Yeongdal's pregnant, so let her go first.

97
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,650
She has the priority pass.

98
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,450
You're the best, the best!

99
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,080
I'm eating!
Stop talking about the bathroom!

100
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,110
- Mommy!
- What is it? What?

101
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,420
I killed several yesterday.
My palm hurts.

102
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,440
You should learn to kill them.
It's not scary.

103
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,440
I can't do that!

104
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,340
You're eating with that hand?

105
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,790
You should go and wash your hands.

106
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,740
What about Subak?
Is she on a diet?

107
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,110
Don't give her any food!

108
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,850
She doesn't deserve any.

109
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,350
Look how she's acting.

110
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,550
She's still sleeping.

111
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,610
She won't even come out.

112
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,510
She hasn't learned anything from this.

113
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,640
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

114
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,820
She's too sorry to come out, I'm sure.

115
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,150
I'm going to wash my hands.

116
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,380
Haebak, take this to Subak.

117
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,240
Give it to me. I'll take it to her.

118
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,920
Subak's not here!

119
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,610
- She's not?
- No?

120
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,920
She's not here either.

121
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,740
Where did she go so early in the morning?

122
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,640
Come to think of it,

123
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,190
I haven't seen her all morning.

124
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,180
Me neither. But she slept with us.

125
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,680
Mom!

126
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,350
Look and her bag is missing.

127
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,550
Oh...

128
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,740
Mom, I'm sorry.

129
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,780
Father, I'm sorry.

130
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,940
I can't stay here. I must go.

131
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,650
I'll come back when I make money.

132
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:36,240
Mom, I'm sorry for being a bad daughter.

133
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,740
Please look after Aeji and Jungji.

134
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,350
I'll get our old house back.

135
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,640
I won't come back before that.

136
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,490
Mom, I'm sorry.

137
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,880
Father, please forgive me.

138
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,010
She's crazy...

139
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,040
I can't believe she's done this.

140
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,380
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo...

141
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,140
Where did she go?

142
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,240
She has nowhere to go.

143
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,950
She can't even do her own laundry.

144
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,090
How can she make any money?

145
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,010
She must be penniless...

146
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,720
What do we do?
What if something happens?

147
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,990
Don't cry.
You're wasting your tears.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,220
She needs to be punished for what she did.

149
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,550
She needs to suffer, so she'll wise up.

150
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,210
She'll be 40 soon and she can't even do laundry.

151
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,850
That's embarrassing!

152
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,090
She's healthy, so she'll be fine!

153
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,380
This is all your doing!

154
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,220
She was already scared out of her wits,

155
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,550
so why did you have to scream at her?

156
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,140
What if something awful happens to her?

157
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,220
What?

158
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,420
Mom, stop it.

159
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,340
I hope Subak doesn't do anything stupid.

160
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,720
How childish. When she's that old.

161
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,850
Do you have to go now?

162
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,240
Yes.

163
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,880
Can we talk?

164
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,740
I have to go to the construction site.

165
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,040
But you've been there already.

166
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,240
I have other places to go, too.

167
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,380
Sangnam, I'm sorry.

168
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,440
It was all my fault.

169
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,050
I shouldn't have treated your mother like that.

170
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,410
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,510
If you did that to my mom, I'd be mad, too.

172
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm really sorry.

173
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,610
Hobak.

174
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,090
Can we talk now?

175
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,640
Yes, I'm in my room.

176
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,610
Subak is gone.

177
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,240
What?

178
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,280
Do you know where she could've gone?

179
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,440
I don't know...

180
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,090
What's wrong with her?

181
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,490
I know.

182
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,280
How can she leave home right now?

183
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,010
What about her kids?

184
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:22,010
I'm sure she was upset for making everyone move there.

185
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,220
But what about mom and father?

186
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,850
This is nuts.

187
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,850
See if you can figure out where she went.

188
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,050
Okay, Hobak.

189
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,910
Imagine how she must have felt.

190
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,110
Imagine how awful she must have felt.

191
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:52,010
I was really angry at her, enough to want to beat her up, but I'm heartbroken now.

192
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,350
Where could she have gone?

193
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,490
I have no idea.

194
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,110
You can't even guess?

195
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,780
I really can't.

196
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,990
Doesn't Subak have any friends?

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,110
I don't know.

198
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,690
But you were married for so many years!

199
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,820
I know.

200
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,610
She didn't go to any of her friends.

201
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,540
I don't think she kept in contact with any.

202
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,540
Then where could she have gone?

203
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:27,910
What if she does something stupid?

204
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,310
She wanted to die when you went bankrupt.

205
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,650
The letter didn't have anything like that.

206
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,240
You should wait. I'll drop by after work.

207
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,640
Did Subak call?

208
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,850
Don't worry too much.

209
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,820
Okay.

210
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,340
Hey.

211
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,550
Did you bring it?

212
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,210
I couldn't because of the Old Geezer.

213
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,290
He goes through your bag at the gate.

214
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,340
Oh, I'm furious.

215
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,790
Why won't the Old Geezer transfer out?

216
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,910
He makes me not want to come to school.

217
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,580
I came because I had to.

218
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,640
Shouldn't he retire soon?

219
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,940
He must be ancient.

220
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,320
Why is he still working?

221
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,610
What did you just say?

222
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,010
We didn't say anything.

223
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,850
We were talking about Old Geezer.

224
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,450
Don't call him Old Geezer.

225
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,090
What's wrong with Old Geezer?

226
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,550
You call him that, too!

227
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,580
Does he like you because you're a Wang, too?

228
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,280
What are you doing?

229
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,310
Want Daebak, you stay.
The rest of you, go.

230
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,780
Come with me.

231
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,090
Tell me. Why did you fight?

232
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,920
Just because.

233
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,710
Were you smoking?

234
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,690
You know I've been feeling really badly.

235
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,720
How could you add to my problems?

236
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,010
How can you get into a fight?

237
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,240
How can you go up against three boys?

238
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,040
Will seeing you getting beat up make me glad?

239
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,410
You'll know how I feel when you have your own kids.

240
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,310
Do you know what you did wrong?

241
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,410
No.

242
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,510
What?

243
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,610
I don't think I did anything wrong.

244
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,240
How dare you!

245
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,950
If they do it again, I'll get them.

246
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,150
How will you get them?

247
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,780
Please don't cause problems at school.

248
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,340
How will I face the other students?

249
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,240
And how will I face other teachers?

250
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,510
If they knew you were my son,

251
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,310
they'd think I'm a bad teacher.

252
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,110
Keep this up and I'll tell everyone.

253
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,140
Please don't!

254
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,740
Then try listening to me.

255
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,020
Go.

256
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,140
Is this Yeongja?

257
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,680
Are you keeping in touch with Wang Subak?

258
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,320
Okay.

259
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,140
Yes?

260
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,110
Can we talk?

261
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,150
I'm busy at the moment.
Let's talk later.

262
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,520
Honey, I sent you $30 yesterday.

263
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,380
You spent that all?

264
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,120
When will you pass the exam?
Just give up.

265
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,720
I'm getting tired.

266
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,580
And why won't you answer your phone?

267
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,080
You're not seeing that girl, are you?

268
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,780
If you are, I'll kill you.

269
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,390
I'll talk to you again.

270
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,380
Hello, editor.

271
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,040
What brings you here?

272
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,640
I was passing by and thought of you.

273
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,190
Who'd believe that?

274
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,650
Why? You need something from me?

275
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,150
You're very sharp.

276
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,220
I'd like to work.
Do you have anything open?

277
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,150
I thought you got married.

278
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,650
Is your husband unemployed?

279
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,650
No, he isn't.

280
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,150
You yelled at me about my unemployed boyfriend.

281
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,390
I have an appointment.
 I'll see you later.

282
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,790
Editor.

283
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,280
Please.

284
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,190
I have to work.

285
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,640
You didn't think you'd come back to beg me for a job, did you?

286
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,550
Take these pastries back.

287
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,380
Don't you have to save every penny?

288
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,890
Come in.

289
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,810
Hello.

290
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,950
How are you?

291
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,240
You came to see your husband?

292
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,490
Yes.

293
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,450
Why won't you come visit?

294
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,220
I don't want to trouble you.

295
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,310
It's not trouble.
Come by for dinner.

296
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,310
And this is for you.

297
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,950
Thanks. I'll have it later.

298
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,620
Sangnam, I'll be back.

299
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,150
I'm meeting Mr. Kim.

300
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,990
Have a good meeting.

301
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,510
Goodbye.

302
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,440
What is it?

303
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,780
Can you buy me lunch?

304
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,810
I have plans.

305
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,740
How can you drop by like this?
I have a job.

306
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,350
I'm sorry.

307
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,450
You don't have to be.

308
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,840
Didn't her vice principal father teach her any manners?

309
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,640
It won't happen again.
I'll talk to her.

310
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,850
I couldn't sleep because I was so sad.

311
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,410
I'm supposed to be her mother in law,

312
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,820
so how could she talk to me like that?

313
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,380
If she respects you, she wouldn't do that.

314
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,890
Don't you think so?

315
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,920
Men these days are too nice to women.

316
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,850
You shouldn't be like that.

317
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,740
What if she treats your father like that?

318
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,620
She wouldn't.

319
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,950
How would you know?

320
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,540
You didn't date her very long.

321
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,720
You couldn't know her that well.

322
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,810
I'm okay, but

323
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,010
you should talk to her for

324
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,510
you and your father's sake.

325
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,010
I'll make her apologize to you.

326
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,580
I'm not saying this to make her apologize.

327
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,720
Where have you been?

328
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,240
There should be someone home.

329
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,040
How could you leave the house empty?

330
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,340
I thought aunt was home.

331
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,940
She has her cooking lessons!

332
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,620
I'm sorry.

333
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,150
I hate coming home to an empty house.

334
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,190
I never liked it.

335
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,350
You should get permission to go out!

336
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,310
Daese, I'm sorry.

337
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,550
Sunjeong, make sure you teach her well.

338
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:11,110
I'm tired of spelling everything out.

339
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,310
Why didn't you tell me you were going out?

340
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,180
I would've skipped my class if I knew.

341
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,920
I forgot.

342
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,950
I had an errand and I went to Sangnam...

343
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,220
You should be more thoughtful.

344
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,910
And don't cry so often.

345
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,350
Crying all the time is not a good thing.

346
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,740
And a newlywed shouldn't cry like that.

347
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,040
I won't.

348
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,420
No experience, no work history.

349
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,950
There's only manual labor.

350
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,950
Like what?

351
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,190
Restaurants or cleaning.

352
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,090
Even those are hard to come by.

353
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,780
You must get a medical check.

354
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,040
Have you done housekeeping or babysitting?

355
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,490
I'll do anything.

356
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,650
I'll get in trouble if you do badly.

357
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,650
How about working as a bar girl?

358
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,490
I can't do that.

359
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,220
Do the dishes and clear the tables.

360
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,420
Be quick on your feet.

361
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,240
Okay.

362
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,680
Hello.

363
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,780
Kitchen's that way!

364
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,890
Oh, what are you doing?
Be careful!

365
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:06,950
You can't make money like that.

366
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,540
This is all I can give you.

367
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,780
Be glad I'm not charging you for broken dishes.

368
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,220

369
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,010
You'll freeze to death.

370
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,040
Cover yourself with these.

371
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,950
Mom! Agh!

372
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,120
Mom!

373
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,720
Hey!

374
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,740
How dare you...

375
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,190
Where is she sleeping?

376
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,920
How can she do this to us?

377
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,190
She'll come home eventually.

378
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,420
She's just awful.

379
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,920
May I help you?

380
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,540
Well...

381
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,490
You can tell me.

382
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,620
I'm sorry,

383
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:18,150
but can I stay here until the morning?

384
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,540

385
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,450
<i>Pounding bounce, bounce...</i>

386
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,150
Oh, I can't sing because I'm upset.

387
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,190
There was an older girl who worked here,

388
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,490
but she was just awful.

389
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,340
She got fired because she was bad.

390
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,080
I hope you do better than her.

391
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,390
Keep the windows, floor and the bathroom clean, memorize the menu...

392
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,550
Memorize the point card and discount cards,

393
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,510
don't forget to stamp the coupons,

394
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,010
and don't make mistakes on orders.

395
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,310
Done?

396
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,540
Hello. May I take your order?

397
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,640
I'd like an Americano.

398
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,290
What size would you like?

399
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,640
Tall, please.

400
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,240
- Do you have the point card?
- Yes.

401
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,620
You can't!
You're too young.

402
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,490
I can do a good job.

403
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,490
You're pretty persistent.

404
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,720
How can you do this for two hours?

405
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,420
I have to make money. Please!

406
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,380
Fine.

407
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,690
Get your parents to sign this.

408
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,150
You're underage, so I need their permission.

409
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,420
Thank you.

Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

412
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,550
I'm sorry.

413
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,190
You've never done this before?

414
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,850
I have but it was really hot.

415
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,880
I'm sorry.

416
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,490
Goodbye.

417
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,010
What are you doing? Clean that up.

418
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,280
Okay.

419
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,490
Can we have some radish kimchi?

420
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,010
She was talking to you.

421
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,540
- Got it?
- Excuse me?

422
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,780
Radish kimchi.

423
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,580
What about kimchi?

424
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,840
Bring some to the customer.

425
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,740
Oh, okay.

- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

428
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,990
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

429
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,340
They belong to someone.

430
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,240
Oh, they don't belong to anyone!

431
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,720
They belong to who get them first.

432
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,990
I'll come by early tomorrow for more!

437
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,850
Hey!

438
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,710
How come there's none here?

439
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,920
Some old lady came and got them all.

440
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,320
What? That witch!

441
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,220
Here.

442
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,990
Oh, this is it?

443
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,920
I've actually given you a lot.

444
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,950
But I brought you a whole bunch!

445
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,540
Anyway, that feels great.

446
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,780
Oh, boy.

447
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,450
Don't you know what this house means...

448
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,310
Don't you know that?

449
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,890
She's having a hard time?

450
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,740
But she does whatever she wants!

451
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:25,950
You drove Minjung to bankruptcy, but when he divorced you, his luck changed!

452
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,650
How could you do such a horrible thing?

453
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,390
You're not even human!

454
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,080
Sangnam, I have an important engagement.

455
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,680
- Do whatever you want.
- Can you tell...

456
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,390
Excuse me,

457
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,650
I'm sorry, but can I get $100 in advance?

458
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,720
But you just started working here!

459
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,120
Is this what you've been doing?

460
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,150
Then can I get $50?

461
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,350
I really need it.

462
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,710
I'm begging you.

463
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,040
Gwangbak, how are you doing?

464
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,410
I'm fine.

465
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,420
Mom, I'll drop by for dinner.

466
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,320
Did you make father seaweed soup?

467
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,740
Seaweed soup?

468
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,190
Oh, I can't believe this.

469
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,350
I forgot your father's birthday!

470
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,710
You did?

471
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,310
What do we do?

472
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,380
Why do I bother?

473
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,820
Like your grandmother says, I should die.

474
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,610
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo...

475
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,850
I'll talk to Hobak and bring some food.

476
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,810
We can have a party.

477
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,040
I'll see you, mom.

478
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,610
Oh, boy.

479
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,280
Anggeum,

480
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:31,640
today's Bong's birthday.

481
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,020
I remember because Gwangbak called.

482
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,920
What do we do?

483
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,810
You and I are both useless.

484
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,490
How can we forget Bong's birthday?

485
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,910
Why didn't you remind me?

486
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,950
This is all Subak's fault!

487
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,640
You should make seaweed soup for dinner.

488
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,280
The girls are coming for dinner.

489
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,810
And stop talking about Subak. I hate it.

490
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,390
You still need to listen to it.

491
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,620
It's your fault for raising her like that.

492
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,920
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

493
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,040
Let's make everything except for the soup.

494
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,990
What will you make?

495
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,020
Braised short ribs?
You can make that?

496
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,450
Okay. Make that and some salad.

497
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,350
I'll make some noodles and get some sashimi.

498
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,990
I'll see you at dinner.

499
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,340
Subak!

500
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,620
Subak!

501
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,690
What happened?

502
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,610
Oh, man!

503
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,810
Where are you staying? Huh?

504
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,120
You don't need to know that.

505
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,190
I was so worried!

506
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,340
And you won't answer the phone!

507
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,720
It's cold. Let's go somewhere.

508
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,680
I can't. I have to go back.

509
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,920
Here.

510
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,240
What's this?

511
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,750
Today's father's birthday.

512
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,540
You didn't forget?

513
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,640
How could I?

514
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,840
It isn't much.

515
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,850
Please give it to him.

516
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,690
Tell him happy birthday.

517
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,110
Subak, let's go home.

518
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,750
They are all worried about you.

519
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,290
I can't go home without money.

520
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,450
No, I won't.

521
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,750
Hobak,

522
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,350
I'm grateful for you and Gwangbak.

523
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,220
You got them a place to live.

524
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,640
I'm the eldest, but I've been a nuisance.

525
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,580
Subak.

526
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,410
You're the eldest daughter now.

527
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,080
Pretend I don't even exist.

528
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,310
How can I do that?

529
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,910
Subak, tell me where you're staying.

530
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,340
Take care of mom and father.

531
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,650
And take care of the others.

532
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,240
Hobak,

533
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,290
I'm sorry.

534
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,520
I should go.

535
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,250
Subak. Subak!

536
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,740
Subak! Subak, hold on!

537
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,150
Come here! Wait!

538
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,540
Wait, hold on!

539
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,280
Subak! Hold on!

540
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:24,120
Subak! Hold on! Wait, Subak! Hold on!

541
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,510
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

542
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,990
Subak!

543
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,150
Subak!

544
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,990
Subak! Oh, no!

545
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,490
Subak is impossible.

546
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,910
She's so childish.

547
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,310
Stop it.

548
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,350
It broke my heart to see her like that.

549
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,080
She's nothing but trouble for your parents.

550
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,950
And I'm nothing but trouble for you, right?

551
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,280
Dad!

552
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,820
Yes, how was your day?

553
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,620
Go wash your hands and do your homework!

554
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,320
Look at them!
They won't even look at me.

555
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,510
Of course. I'm their mom.

556
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,190
You're not popular here anymore.

557
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,720
Sintong, Bangtong, you don't see me?

558
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,140
We do.

559
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,740
See? This is why I live.

560
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,950
That smells delicious.

561
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,720
Dad, what's all these?

562
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,580
How dare you!

563
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,620
Can I have one?

564
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,920
No! These are for your grandparents.

565
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,780
Where did you learn your manners?

566
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,520
I've never seen such bad table manners.

567
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:38,550
You eat so much and you never get sick.

568
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,510
I told you to wash your hands!

569
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,320
Go change and do your homework.

570
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,220
Fine.

571
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,220
Dad, I hate you.

572
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,450
Those little devils.

573
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,450
I don't know who they take after.

574
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,390
Such goof-offs.
Just like their dad.

575
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,810
What is it?

576
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,640
This is how you act?

577
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,950
You're like a mom.

578
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,680
You're a perfect housewife now.

579
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,880
Of course.

580
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,220
I do everything perfect.

581
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,410
You hurry up.
We have no time to waste.

582
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,490
Fine.

583
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,020
- What are you doing?
- Mommy!

584
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,950
You never say father?

585
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,180
Sunjeong calls for men when she's startled.

586
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,510
What's that? That smells good.

587
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,320
Braised short ribs.

588
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,990
You're taking that somewhere?

589
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,390
Well, yes...

590
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,490
You're stealing from this house?

591
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,180
How can you say that?

592
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,410
I caught you red handed, huh?

593
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,750
Give me herbal tea with egg yolk.

594
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,920
I can't make that.

595
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,450
I told you to learn how.

596
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,220
Oh, I'm still full from the sushi yesterday.

597
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,310
Is it because I ate it with my son?

598
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,810
I don't think I need anything else.

599
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,580
You had sushi with Sangnam?

600
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,620
Sangnam didn't tell you?

601
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,420
We had lunch yesterday.

602
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,580
He was so sorry because of you.

603
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:24,640
He kept apologizing for you.

604
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,490
You better be good to me,

605
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,990
if you want your husband to love you.

606
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,890
How can you not know that?

607
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,810
Don't you have a college degree?

608
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,540
Or did you get it illegally?

609
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,990
Excuse me?

610
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,220
Forget about it.

611
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,520
Who cares how you got your degree?

612
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,120
The important thing is who I am to you.

613
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:51,350
Oh, that sounded cool, right?

614
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,390
- Did you get it?
- Mother,

615
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,650
I didn't want to hurt Sangnam, so I said nothing.

616
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,490
About what?

617
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,180
You know what.

618
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,580
I don't believe you.

619
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,540
Are you talking back at me again?

620
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,510
Now I really have to get it from you.

621
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,520
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

622
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,750
And i don't have any money to give you.

623
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,950
Wait!

624
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,290
Oh, I'm thirsty.

625
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,690
Get me some fresh fruit juice.

626
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,190
That girl!

627
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,390
Where are you going?

628
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,750
Huh? Oh.

629
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,190
I forgot about an appointment.

630
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,640
Cancel the juice.

631
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,910
I don't have to pay, right?

632
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,890
What are you doing?

633
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,950
Mop the floor. Don't sit down!

634
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,310
It's not easy to make money!

635
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,140
You want me to deduct your pay?

636
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,990
That's mean.

637
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,180
That was the first time I sat down all day.

638
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,310
I ended up here because of a reason,

639
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,640
but don't be so mean to me.

640
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,140
I was in the Miss Korea pageant.

641
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,720
Miss Korea?

642
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,910
Yes.

643
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:55,540
Who cares if you were?

644
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,510
Can you cook? Can you clean?

645
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,450
I wasn't going to tell you this,

646
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,910
but I had models and actresses work here.

647
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,040
You don't know what you're talking about.

648
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,850
Hurry up and mop the floor.

649
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:10,720
Make it shine so you can see your Miss Korea face off it.

650
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,650
It's suffocating here.

651
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,410
Sit closer together.

652
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,110
Is someone sitting comfortably?

653
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,280
Father, you're an exception.

654
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,090
Since it's your birthday, you're forgiven.

655
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,580
Oh, I forgot to get cake.

656
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,910
Minjung's bringing it.

657
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,990
We should've made

658
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,720
seaweed soup for breakfast.

659
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,620
I'm so sorry, Bong.

660
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,620
I forgot, too.

661
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,690
I've never forgotten your birthday before.

662
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:54,280
You should just dump me.

663
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,090
It's okay. I'm glad everyone's here.

664
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,450
Thanks

665
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,640
for coming to celebrate my birthday.

666
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,990
This is all my fault.

667
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,450
Blame me.

668
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,720
We'll laugh about this one day.

669
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,850
Mom.

670
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,040
Father, don't cry on such a nice day.

671
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:25,350
We will laugh about this one day.

672
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,950
Yes, Bong.

673
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,620
Let's all eat.

674
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,720
Happy birthday, Bong.

675
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,490
Thank you, mother.

676
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,550
Not liking my in laws is affecting me.

677
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,620
You wait and see.

678
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,650
Like mother, like daughter.
I'll make her cry!

679
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,950
What else could I do?

680
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,080
[Provisional Attachment Notice]

681
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,720
Yes, mother.

682
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,040
Hey. Go in.

683
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,220
Yes, mother.

684
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,810
We don't live there anymore.

685
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,540
I'll explain what happened.

686
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,950
I'm here.

687
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,040
Go!

688
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,390
You're here?

689
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,240
Welcome.

690
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,090
Squeeze in.

691
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,520
The house will explode.

692
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,590
I can't believe my ears.

693
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,040
Sit here, Minjung.

694
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,720
Even Minjung is here, so where's Sangnam?

695
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,720
He went to China on business.

696
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:47,250
Father, I made these ribs.

697
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,920
And Sedal made this.

698
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,180
He's like a housewife now.

699
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,990
Housekeeping is getting more fun.

700
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,580
I'm becoming an expert now.

701
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,180
Good. Housekeeping is actually fun.

702
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,880
Father,

703
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,510
here.

704
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,150
Is that money?

705
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,450
Subak wanted me to give that to you.

706
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,620
You met her? Where is she?

707
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,990
How did you meet her?

708
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,580
She called.

709
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,780
She gave that to me for your birthday.

710
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,250
Oh...

711
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,420
She gave you that for him?

712
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:30,520
What is she doing?

713
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:33,150
I asked, but she wouldn't tell me.

714
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,780
She won't come home unless she makes money.

715
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,650
But you should've found out.

716
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,380
I tried, but I lost her.

717
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,650
How did she look?

718
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:44,040
She lost weight and she cried.

719
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,240
Oh, no.

720
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,420
Don't feel sorry for her.

721
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,220
She needs to suffer, so she'll learn.

722
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:57,020
She didn't want to live here, so she left.

723
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,650
I'm sure she didn't leave because of that.

724
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:04,040
Her letter said she'll get the house back.

725
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:05,740
You believe her?

726
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,590
How can she make money?

727
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,950
She left because of you!

728
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,810
What?

729
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:14,140
She left because you were mean to her.

730
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:16,990
Imagine how she must have felt!

731
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,140
You were so mean to her when we moved.

732
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,040
She was miserable already,

733
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,490
so how could you yell at her like that?

734
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,580
How could she stay here?

735
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:31,680
It's not like she borrowed money for her.

736
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,140
She was just trying to make money

737
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,110
because Minjung wasn't making enough.

738
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,490
So how could you be so mean?

739
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,120
You threw her out.

740
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,350
You're crazy.

741
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:48,810
You spoiled her rotten and you still haven't learned anything!

742
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,280
Mother, please stop.

743
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,750
Right. It's father's birthday.

744
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,450
Okay, let's move right on

745
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,720
and sing the birthday song.

746
00:46:58,730 --> 00:46:59,910
Grandmother, mother,

747
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,280
put your strength into the singing.

748
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,990
Go!

749
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,540
Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!

750
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:19,450
Happy birthday, dear father, happy birthday...

751
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:22,140
Father, make a wish and blow out the candles.

752
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:29,990
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

753
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,250
Happy birthday.

754
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,950
Are we there yet?

755
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,790
It's up ahead.

756
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,950
Are we there yet?

757
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:44,910
We're almost there.

758
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,390
You keep saying that!

759
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,650
Where is it?

760
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,580
Oh, I'm dying.

761
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:58,020
Here.

762
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,620
Mom! Bong!

763
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:12,950
Come out.

764
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,540
Oh...

765
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,390
Go.

766
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,020
I went this morning.

767
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,820
Go and pack!

768
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,850
No.

769
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,650
Do it now!

770
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,040
Don't scream.

771
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,180
You'll startle the baby.

772
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:35,790
Who cares about the baby when my daughter's dying?

773
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,850
I can't believe all of you.

774
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,720
How can you not tell me what happened?

775
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:44,140
How can you make my daughter live here?

776
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:45,410
Neighbors!

777
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,040
Oh, stop it, mother.

778
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,350
Why are you calling the neighbors?

779
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,720
You stay out!

780
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:51,850
Mom.

781
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,720
You stay out! You're all useless.

782
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:56,790
How can you be so sneaky?

783
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,520
Mrs. Park, please calm down.

784
00:48:58,530 --> 00:48:59,950
You stay out!

785
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,450
How dare you scream at my husband?

786
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,140
It's okay. I'm sure she didn't mean it.

787
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,640
I'm sorry.

788
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:11,450
I said go pack!

789
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,750
No! I'm not packing.

790
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,790
Don.

791
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,350
You come right here!

792
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:17,740
- Mother!
- Oh, mother.

793
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,650
Stop it! Loser, how can this be?

794
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:23,510
Loser? Don't call him that.

795
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:26,850
He's your son in law. 
How rude.

796
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,390
But you call my son Goof-off!

797
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,580
Let's go.

798
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:34,540
You don't even have your own room here!

799
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:38,140
How can you make them sleep out here?

800
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,790
I wanted it!

801
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,920
I told you to take the room! I'll sleep here!

802
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,010
Ask anyone! How can this be?

803
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,290
Let's go!

804
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,520
You should go with her.

805
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,050
No! I'm not going!

806
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:57,350
She won't go and I can't let her, mother.

807
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,040
Mom, mom. Let's go.
Mom, let's go home.

808
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:02,220
Let me go!

809
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:04,620
Father, we're leaving.

810
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,950
- You come here!
- Let's go, let's go.

811
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,950
Oh, boy.

812
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,520
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

813
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,550
What are you going to do?

814
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,040
You were supposed to take good care of her.

815
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:28,140
You're 35, no, 36.

816
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:32,990
How can you have no money at all?

817
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,810
Mother, if you just hold on...

818
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,780
Hold on? For what?

819
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,520
You should at least have your own room!

820
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,650
The whole family's there with you!

821
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:45,910
How can you sleep in the living room?

822
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,110
I'll get you a room, so move out!

823
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,690
I won't do that.

824
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:52,740
Why not?

825
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,550
I don't want your help.

826
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:56,120
So please remember that.

827
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:57,950
I'm different from Sedal.

828
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,040
What did Sedal do?

829
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:02,010
Did Sedal get help from your family?

830
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,090
Hobak supported him.

831
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,890
- Hey!
- He's right.

832
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,150
I'm going to support my wife and kid.

833
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,810
I won't get any help from anyone.

834
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,540
So stay out of our business. Bye.

835
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:14,990
Loser, you!

836
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,850
And I'm not Loser.

837
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,720
Call me Don.

838
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,290
If you keep calling me Loser,

839
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,820
I'll call you Mrs. Park.

840
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,490
Oh, my! Did you hear him?

841
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,810
He's right.

842
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,540
You're wrong!

843
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,680
If your family went bankrupt,

844
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,410
you should've told me!

845
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,110
Go and get her!

846
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:38,450
I can't drag Yeongdal here against her will.

847
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,620
Let her stay there for now, and if she can't

848
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,150
take it anymore, we'll go get her.

849
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,080
But we should leave her there for now.

850
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,950
Ditto.

851
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,750
What?

852
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,620
I agree with her.

853
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:52,390
Mom, just forget about her.

854
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,720
Let her live there, no matter what happens.

855
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:56,850
When I married Hobak,

856
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,290
we lived in a basement apartment.

857
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,420
What if her family dragged her home?

858
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,280
But she's different from you!

859
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,590
We're the same. Exactly the same.

860
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:08,120
All your kids are the same.

861
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,950
This was meant to be.

862
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,080
Ugh! Oh! Ugh!

863
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:13,510
This is nutty, nutty, nuts.

864
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,020
Oh, that stung!

865
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:39,920
I can't support you both.

866
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,950
Uncle has to go to college, too,

867
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,580
and Subak's in a different city so

868
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:47,850
I need to send her living expenses.

869
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,620
Hobak, you should drop out. You're younger.

870
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,850
Subak's the eldest.

871
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:58,190
Father, that's not fair.

872
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:00,280
I'm a better student.

873
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,190
I have to graduate. I can't drop out.

874
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:05,310
I want to become an announcer.

875
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,280
You can't.

876
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,620
How many times must I tell you?

877
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:12,120
The eldest should get a college degree.

878
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:17,390
You only care about Subak.

879
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,620
This isn't fair.

880
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,850
Subak.

881
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,250
Yes, father.

882
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,720
You must study hard.

883
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:37,250
You're studying for Hobak, too.

884
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:42,850
You're the eldest.
My firstborn, okay?

885
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,120
Minjung?

886
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,180
A registered letter came for Mr. Ko Minjung.

887
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:09,340
Thank you.

888
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,890
[Seoul Family Court, Mr. Ko Minjung]

889
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,620
Now only our family's here.

890
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,910
I'm in this family, right?

891
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,540
Of course, you are.

892
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,950
Thank you for staying with us.

893
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,040
I know.

894
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,040
Mr. Wang, wait.

895
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,490
Not that.

896
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,310
I keep forgetting.

897
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,650
This is my paycheck.

898
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:50,220
We should save money to buy a house.

899
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,810
We can do it if we worked together.

900
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,080
Oh, you should keep it.

901
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,780
It's okay.

902
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,020
I'm family, so I should pitch in.

903
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,450
She's offering so let's take it.

904
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,450
Oh, I didn't mean it.

905
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,520
I won't take money from Yeongdal.

906
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:12,220
Just pitch in a little bit.

907
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:15,950
You should save it for when you move out.

908
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,890
Remember how angry your mother was?

909
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,420
Bong, I made money, too.

910
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,850
How did you make money?

911
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,580
You don't need to know.

912
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,240
Mom, did you collect boxes?

913
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,620
How did you know?

914
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,390
It's obvious.

915
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,810
I brought a lot and he gave me just that.

916
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,280
Mother, please don't do that.

917
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,520
What if you fall and get hurt?

918
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:45,390
I won't. I'll walk carefully.

919
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,190
Making money was fun.

920
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:50,740
Father, I got a part time job, too.

921
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,020
Where?

922
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:54,520
I'm working at a cafe.

923
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:56,020
Shut up!

924
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,620
I won't yell since it's your father's birthday.

925
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,220
Enroll in a test prep course.

926
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:03,250
I will put you through college.

927
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,750
Father,

928
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,350
can you sign this?

929
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,810
[Employment Request for People under 15]

930
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,990
You want to work at a convenience store?

931
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,540
Yes, if I can get your signature...

932
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,220
Don't.

933
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:18,040
What's your job?

934
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,720
It's studying.

935
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,910
That's how you can help me.

936
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,740
But I'm a member of this family.

937
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,620
Aunt is giving her paycheck,

938
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:28,150
so I should help out, too.

939
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,180
I'm the eldest son.

940
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,950
Let me work during vacation.

941
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,120
Daebak,

942
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,120
there are others who can work,

943
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,120
so wait until you go to high school.

944
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,690
I'm against the idea, too.

945
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,950
Thank you, everyone.

946
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,810
I feel encouraged.

947
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,720
I feel strong.

948
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,540
I think I can get back on my feet again.

949
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:51,790
Okay! Bong's going to get back on his feet!

950
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,490
So I will sing a song now.

951
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,080
And I'll dance, since I know how its done.

952
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,610
Great!

953
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,350
Goof- off and Yeongdal are life savers.

954
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,490
What would we have done without them?

955
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,620
I know.

956
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,690
Be good to Yeongdal's mother.

957
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:22,220
We want to but she keeps ruining it.

958
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,850
Tonight's your night,

959
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:27,790
so why don't you sing a song? Singer Wang!

960
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,290
I will if you ask.

961
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:35,150
Yey! Applause! Yay!

962
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:38,280
One, two, three, four!

971
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,490
Hey, singer!

972
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,690
Right now? Why?

973
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:37,010
You'll find out.

974
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:40,620
Is something up at home?

975
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,620
Okay.

976
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,540
Hello.

977
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:00,950
Sit.

978
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:08,190
What's going on?

979
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,740
I thought we couldn't let this pass.

980
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,650
Apologize about last time.

981
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,580
Hurry.

982
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,140
I'm very sorry about what happened.

983
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,490
Please forgive me.

984
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,150
I was disappointed that day,

985
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:39,310
but now you apologized, I feel better.

986
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,780
Let's try to get along, okay?

987
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,250
Sangnam, get me some coffee.

988
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,550
Okay.

989
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:58,180
Did you see?

990
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:00,380
My son's on my side.

991
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,990
Don't be cheeky.

992
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,310
I'm sorry.

993
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,450
I have to go.

994
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,450
What are you doing?

995
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,350
I left the house empty. Goodbye.

996
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,850
This is my fault. I can't blame anyone.

997
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:32,040
She has no respect for me.

998
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:33,450
She left?

999
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:36,180
Leave her alone.

1000
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:38,510
At least she apologized.

1001
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,220
Sangnam!

1002
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,350
Oh, hot, hot.

1003
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:02,190
What's wrong?

1004
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,350
Why are you crying?

1005
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,540
You're upset about apologizing?

1006
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,350
But don't you think you should've?

1007
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,990
- So I did.
- But this is wrong.

1008
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,450
I wanted you to be sincere.

1009
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,620
You forced me to apologize.

1010
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,810
I wasn't prepared to do it.

1011
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,850
Why do you need to prepare?

1012
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,990
Why do you need that for apologizing?

1013
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,390
I'm sorry.

1014
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:30,220
She's my mom.

1015
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:34,020
All else aside, she brought me into this world.

1016
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:36,650
I won't let you mistreat her.

1017
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:39,540
You forcing me to apologize

1018
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:42,620
and me apologizing without sincerity

1019
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:45,350
made us the same people, so I'm sorry.

1020
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,790
Satisfied?

1021
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,140
Just forget it.

Did the document get processed?

1025

Not yet.

1026

After today, that becomes null and void.

Minjung didn't know it,

1028
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:35,110
but who could stand that?

1029
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,020
How can you do this?

1030
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:39,420
How can you turn Sangnam against me?

1031
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,110
I won't let it go on.

1032
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:44,120
How dare you talk to me like that?

1033
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:46,040
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

1034
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,780
I know someone here.

1035
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,620
Go see Minjung and beg him for forgiveness.

1036
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:55,890
You made me cry, but I still loved you.

1037
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,040
You remained the same.
