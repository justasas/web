[My Sweet Family]

3
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:05,952
I'm...

00:00:06,052 --> 00:00:07,052
Episode 15

5
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:10,222
okay with her being more interested in my money than myself.

6
00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:14,652
I have no problem with her scheming behind my back with my son.

7
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:17,452
She's a great lady.

8
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:20,852
She won't live with an old man like me for nothing.

9
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:25,122
Do you know why I haven't registered our marriage yet?

10
00:00:25,452 --> 00:00:26,752
I was afraid she'd change her mind.

11
00:00:27,752 --> 00:00:29,022
Once it becomes official,

12
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:31,952
she might ask for half of my money.

13
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:34,822
After thinking about it for days,

14
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:38,122
I had decided to trust her and register our marriage.

15
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,822
That's what I thought.

16
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:45,022
But then you fooled around with her, in my own house!

17
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:47,122
I'm never going to forgive you.

18
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:49,952
President! I'm sorry.

19
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:52,922
Burn in everlasting fire.

20
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:54,652
I'll catch up with you later.

21
00:00:58,752 --> 00:00:59,752
Boss!

22
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:00,922
- Mr Bong! - Boss!

23
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:02,922
Boss, stop.

24
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:05,652
Mr Bong, are you all right?

25
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:07,952
What are you doing?

26
00:01:08,022 --> 00:01:09,122
Boss.

27
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:11,422
Don't do this.

28
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:13,952
- Move. - No matter what...

29
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:16,422
Mr Bong did,

30
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,552
this isn't the way to handle it.

31
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:21,552
We can't make the movie without him.

32
00:01:21,552 --> 00:01:22,652
Movie?

33
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:24,952
Isn't this dramatic enough for you?

34
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:26,752
I will finish this movie right now.

35
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:28,552
- Leave! - Boss!

36
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:30,322
It's about someone's life.

37
00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:33,122
- I said leave! - Please, grant him mercy.

38
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:34,652
Didn't you hear me?

39
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:35,852
I can't leave...

40
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:38,552
without Mr Bong.

41
00:01:39,822 --> 00:01:42,152
Do you want to join him?

42
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:46,652
You...

43
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:48,522
deserve to burn...

44
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:52,052
in everlasting fire, too.

45
00:01:53,752 --> 00:01:54,822
Get them.

46
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,352
President.

47
00:02:14,352 --> 00:02:15,952
Ms Oh, what are you doing here?

48
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:20,652
I have something to tell you.

49
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:27,452
I...

50
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:30,052
I lied to you.

51
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:33,652
Mr Bong didn't use me or take advantage of me.

52
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:36,552
I...

53
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,762
seduced him.

54
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:40,652
Ms Oh.

55
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,052
I...

56
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:43,452
had feelings for...

57
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:46,652
Mr Bong.

58
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:50,822
What are you talking about?

59
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:53,452
Why are you talking nonsense?

60
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:55,652
How dare you threaten...

61
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:57,752
Living with you...

62
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:00,292
was very difficult...

63
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:03,952
and boring.

64
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:05,922
I just wanted to marry you...

65
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,052
and live a comfortable life.

66
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,752
That's the only thing that kept me going.

67
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:11,952
That's when I met Mr Bong.

68
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:14,652
I knew it would be the end of me if you found out,

69
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:18,022
but I couldn't help myself.

70
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:19,652
I am sorry, President.

71
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:24,322
Ms Oh.

72
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:27,752
Don't bet your life on something like this.

73
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:30,222
Tell me now.

74
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,452
I will pretend this never happened.

75
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:35,552
I will cut my wealth in half and give it to you.

76
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:37,552
I will let you do...

77
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,422
whatever you want.

78
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:41,952
Tell me it's not true.

79
00:03:42,552 --> 00:03:43,952
Tell me it's not true!

80
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,152
President.

81
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:47,652
I am so sorry, President.

82
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:52,352
But the person I really love is...

83
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:54,852
not you.

84
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:57,122
It's Mr Bong.

85
00:03:57,752 --> 00:04:00,752
President. Please spare his life.

86
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:02,952
Please don't kill him.

87
00:04:03,022 --> 00:04:05,252
I will take responsibility for everything.

88
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:08,052
- How... - Please, spare his life.

89
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:09,552
How can you...

90
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:12,222
How can you say something like that to me?

91
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:16,952
You know how much I loved you!

92
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:20,752
Boss!

93
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,152
- Boss! - No!

94
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:26,062
- No! - Stay with me, Boss!

95
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:28,952
- Boss! Boss! Wake up! - This can't happen.

96
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:30,452
Call an ambulance.

97
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,152
- Yes, Sir. - Boss! Stay with me!

98
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:34,652
- Boss! - No!

99
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:37,252
Boss! Boss! Stay with me!

100
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:38,952
Boss!

101
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:45,752
Ki Beom.

102
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:49,852
What did you do to my dad?

103
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:51,022
Ki Beom.

104
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:53,062
Let go and I'll tell you.

105
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,852
Hurry up and tell me what you did!

106
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:57,022
I...

107
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:00,852
I am to blame.

108
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:03,852
What?

109
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:08,062
I...

110
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:10,062
I am the one who did this to him.

111
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,952
Let's talk in private.

112
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:35,052
What?

113
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:37,452
Ms Oh is in love with Mr Bong?

114
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:39,852
Is that really true?

115
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:42,222
Keep it down. We're in a hospital.

116
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:46,252
Where is Mr Bong, that useless piece of jerk?

117
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:47,352
Where is he?

118
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:49,922
Are you going to go beat him up at a time like this?

119
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:52,392
Your dad is in surgery. You need to be here for him.

120
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:57,052
I didn't know something that hideous was going on in my own house!

121
00:05:57,352 --> 00:05:58,522
Ki Beom!

122
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:00,752
Gosh.

123
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:03,952
Are you serious?

124
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:06,022
Gosh, it was crazy.

125
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:07,552
It was unbelievable.

126
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:09,322
If it weren't for Tae Soo,

127
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,352
Mr Bong would've been long dead.

128
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:13,652
What about President?

129
00:06:14,022 --> 00:06:15,552
He still hasn't woken up?

130
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:18,952
I heard he's either getting a surgery or some kind of procedure.

131
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:20,452
I'm not sure which one.

132
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:24,422
Anyway, you need to fix the truck first.

133
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,392
I heard you will start selling food on that truck tomorrow.

134
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:28,752
Yes. I should fix it.

135
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:35,152
Because of his hypertension, it seems that...

136
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:36,752
he went into a state of shock.

137
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:39,752
He had a ruptured cerebral aneurysm.

138
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:42,252
But fortunately, he was brought to our hospital in time.

139
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,052
He only had to undergo a minor surgery.

140
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:48,052
Dr Kim. Will my father be okay?

141
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:50,652
He will be fine once he wakes up, right?

142
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:52,752
We will know for sure...

143
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:54,322
when he wakes up.

144
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:56,752
We need to observe him for the time being.

145
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:10,052
How dare you come in here?

146
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:14,952
Get out. The sight of you disgusts me.

147
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:16,222
Ki Beom.

148
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:17,852
I know that I did something terrible.

149
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:19,822
But...

150
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:22,322
please let me stay beside him.

151
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,452
You got some nerves.

152
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:26,552
Do you think my dad wants to see your face?

153
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:30,452
Leave while I let you walk out of here.

154
00:07:30,552 --> 00:07:32,552
I'm letting you go only because I don't want to make things worse.

155
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,192
So get out now!

156
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:36,052
I will go as soon as he wakes up.

157
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:37,222
Please, Ki Beom.

158
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,852
You really don't get it. Get out.

159
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:40,152
- Get out. - Ki Beom! Ki Beom!

160
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:42,752
- Ki Beom, please! - Get out!

161
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:44,252
Ki Beom, please!

162
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:46,022
Ki Beom! Ki Beom!

163
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:48,222
Ki Beom!

164
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:52,122
What am I going to do?

165
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,452
Please!

166
00:07:58,052 --> 00:07:59,052
Dad.

167
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:00,852
Wake up.

168
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:03,452
You didn't know what a conniving witch she was.

169
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:05,652
You said she was smart, beautiful,

170
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,322
and elegant. You made such a fuss over her.

171
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:09,322
You loved her with all your heart.

172
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,352
Look at you now.

173
00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:15,292
She really fooled you, didn't she?

174
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:17,952
Get up...

175
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:22,292
and say something.

176
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:25,152
Darn it!

177
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:40,662
You should've waited for me.

178
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:42,922
Why are you doing all this by yourself?

179
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:45,922
I heard from Sung Koo.

180
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,452
How is President doing?

181
00:08:48,952 --> 00:08:50,852
He needs to gain his consciousness.

182
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:53,662
Gosh, even so!

183
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:56,552
How could you just leave like that?

184
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:59,162
You're always getting involved in other people's business.

185
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:01,662
A person's life was at stake. What else could I have done?

186
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:04,752
Honey, I know it's in your nature...

187
00:09:04,822 --> 00:09:06,752
to help people in need.

188
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:10,352
But what good is that if it makes things difficult for your family?

189
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:15,552
Since a person's life was at stake, I will let this one slide.

190
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:17,052
But I won't let it slide again.

191
00:09:17,852 --> 00:09:20,422
Do you realise what an important time this is for our family?

192
00:09:22,452 --> 00:09:26,422
I don't want you to get involved with Choongshim from now on.

193
00:09:26,752 --> 00:09:28,352
Thinking about what they made us go through,

194
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:30,662
makes me shudder.

195
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:33,422
- Okay? - Gosh.

196
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:37,452
Don't worry. It won't ever happen again.

197
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:40,452
From now on, I will only think about the food truck.

198
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:43,752
From now on, I will only eat kimchi fried rice.

199
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,162
You really know how to talk yourself out of things, don't you?

200
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:49,952
Is there anything I can help you with?

201
00:09:50,662 --> 00:09:51,752
That's right.

202
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,452
We need to fix up the truck.

203
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,852
Thanks for remembering,

204
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:56,552
but while you were saving someone's life,

205
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:59,052
the children and Sung Koo fixed it up.

206
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:00,752
They did?

207
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:03,552
Do we need to move that?

208
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:07,452
What else do I have to do?

209
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:09,852
The weather is beautiful today.

210
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:11,852
It would have been nice if I went and helped you.

211
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:14,052
- It's all right. You stay here. - All right.

212
00:10:15,162 --> 00:10:16,662
I hope you make a lot of money, Dad. Good luck.

213
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:18,952
You will be rich, my son.

214
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:22,662
Let me know when you move locations, okay?

215
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:25,552
Be careful not to catch cold, Mum. Call me if something happens, Dad.

216
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:27,052
- Okay. - I'll see you later, Choon Boon.

217
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:28,162
Goodbye.

218
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:31,162
Here comes Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice!

219
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:33,052
- Let's go! - Let's go!

220
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,852
Bye!

221
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:41,022
Earn a lot of money!

222
00:10:41,662 --> 00:10:44,952
Check on the production company often and keep an eye on Mr Lee.

223
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:47,852
I'm sure he's still keeping in touch with that Mr Bong.

224
00:10:48,162 --> 00:10:49,252
- I'll do that. - Okay.

225
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:51,162
What's that?

226
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,252
President of Choongshim Construction.

227
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,152
- Show your face. - Come out.

228
00:10:55,252 --> 00:10:58,052
- We want to talk to you. - Come out!

229
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:01,452
- Let go! - He's the president. Move!

230
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:05,492
Are you Baek Ki Beom, the president of Choongshim Construction?

231
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:06,752
Sir, please go upstairs.

232
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:08,352
What is it? What is this all about?

233
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:10,252
I will tell you about it upstairs. Hurry.

234
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:12,752
- Let's talk! - What are you doing?

235
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:15,552
We're from Manbok Shophouse. There's something we need to say.

236
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:17,652
Please, head on up. Security!

237
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,352
- Sir. - We have something to say!

238
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:22,652
- Mr Baek! Let's talk! - I have something to tell you!

239
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,552
Manbok Shophouse will be redeveloped?

240
00:11:25,222 --> 00:11:26,552
It's my first time hearing about this.

241
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,052
Boss started this project just recently.

242
00:11:29,252 --> 00:11:31,552
Why didn't he tell me about it?

243
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:33,752
He said you were going through a lot of things.

244
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:36,652
He said he would let you take over once it was settled.

245
00:11:38,952 --> 00:11:41,852
- What do those guys want? - It's about compensation.

246
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:45,452
They think the compensation was too small.

247
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:49,352
- They already filed a lawsuit. - They filed a lawsuit?

248
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,352
There are always people like them.

249
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:54,652
They always get in our way.

250
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:58,422
I will take over this project.

251
00:11:58,752 --> 00:11:59,952
Bring all the documents related to this.

252
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:04,152
Why don't we just do it our way?

253
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:05,452
They are filing lawsuits...

254
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:08,052
because we are being too easy on them.

255
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:12,052
We could take care of this situation in no time.

256
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:14,052
You idiot! We're not gangsters.

257
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:16,552
We are businessmen.

258
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:18,522
You're not thinking straight.

259
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:20,452
I am sorry.

260
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:22,552
Young Il.

261
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:25,752
Keep a close eye on them and report back to me.

262
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:27,352
And arrange a meeting with the lawyer.

263
00:12:28,422 --> 00:12:29,552
I'm going to take care of this.

264
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:31,652
- Do you understand? - Yes, Sir.

265
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:36,152
(Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice)

266
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,752
Is it because the weather is cold? There's no one passing by.

267
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:41,922
It's already 1pm.

268
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:45,352
If we don't make money during lunch, we've wasted half a day.

269
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:48,522
This is why I told you we should go in front of a school.

270
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:51,552
They are on vacation. We won't be making money there.

271
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:54,552
And they said a dish like this sells better around office complexes...

272
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:56,322
because employees miss homemade meals.

273
00:12:56,352 --> 00:12:59,452
Is that right? Then let's wait a little more.

274
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:00,552
They will come.

275
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:05,152
- Welcome. - Welcome. What can I get you?

276
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:12,452
Sir?

277
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:21,652
What's wrong with him? Do you know him?

278
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:23,252
I've never seen him before.

279
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:25,652
He's a strange one, isn't he?

280
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:30,752
You can't sell food here. Do you want to pay a fine?

281
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:32,352
What do we do?

282
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:34,552
Gosh, this is such a hassle.

283
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:36,352
Show me your identification.

284
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:40,252
All right. All right.

285
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:41,952
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:44,752
We didn't sell anything today so please let this go.

287
00:13:44,852 --> 00:13:48,422
You can't sell food here. We will get complaints.

288
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:50,852
I am sorry. We will close now. I am sorry.

289
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,752
- Please let it pass. - We are sorry.

290
00:13:52,852 --> 00:13:54,352
- I'm sorry. - Hurry up and leave.

291
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:57,052
- Okay. - You can't block the street.

292
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:59,852
We will move now. We didn't even sell one bowl yet.

293
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:02,352
Ki Beom.

294
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:05,352
Your father still hasn't woken up.

295
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:07,452
Yes.

296
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:12,952
Okay.

297
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:17,152
Why are you still here?

298
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:19,152
Although...

299
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,152
I did a terrible thing,

300
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:25,252
I can't leave...

301
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:27,752
President like that.

302
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:32,952
I will stay here and repent my sins until he wakes up.

303
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:35,552
When he wakes up,

304
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:37,952
I will quietly disappear.

305
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:40,822
I can't understand why you're doing this all of a sudden.

306
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:43,652
When you did something like that,

307
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,452
you must have known that this day would come.

308
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,152
Do Kyung.

309
00:14:48,652 --> 00:14:50,152
Please, let me meet him once.

310
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:52,352
Please,

311
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:54,422
let me meet him one last time.

312
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:57,252
Meet him in your next life.

313
00:14:57,952 --> 00:15:00,652
Don't let Ki Beom catch you and put yourself in danger.

314
00:15:01,352 --> 00:15:03,052
You should leave for your own sake.

315
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:14,252
Goodness.

316
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:16,652
Why are we having a barbecue party?

317
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:19,952
For you to work in the cold, you need to be strong.

318
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,552
So you need to eat well.

319
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:23,552
- I bought these. - Really?

320
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,692
My Soo Min bought meat for us?

321
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:29,822
How can I afford to buy meat when I get such a small allowance?

322
00:15:29,852 --> 00:15:32,552
He bought the meat and I bought the vegetables.

323
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:36,052
- Gosh. - Help yourselves!

324
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:39,422
Of course. My boy is so thoughtful.

325
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:42,322
Let's eat. Let's eat, Mum.

326
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:45,152
- Here. - Wow. Here.

327
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:46,352
Let's eat.

328
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:48,152
It looks delicious. Thank you.

329
00:15:48,252 --> 00:15:51,452
How many bowls did you sell today? 100 bowls? 200 bowls?

330
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,822
Hey, it was just their first day.

331
00:15:56,452 --> 00:15:59,052
Actually, it turned out much better than we imagined.

332
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:00,752
Our customers went...

333
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:03,552
wild about our fried rice. Right, Honey?

334
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:06,322
Yes, it was very popular.

335
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:09,822
We will settle down soon. So don't worry about us.

336
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:12,252
I hope it works out so that you can...

337
00:16:12,352 --> 00:16:15,852
buy me a mink coat and take me abroad, too.

338
00:16:15,952 --> 00:16:17,552
Gosh, Mum.

339
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:20,652
Should we make a toast?

340
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,552
- Okay. - Okay.

341
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:25,822
To our health.

342
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,952
- To our health. - To our health.

343
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,852
Thank you. Thank you for the party.

344
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:34,052
It's delicious.

345
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:37,152
What's going on?

346
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:38,752
- Come on, Dad. - What is it?

347
00:16:39,852 --> 00:16:42,852
You should get a massage. Take a seat.

348
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:45,252
Okay. Thank you, Soo Min.

349
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:46,422
- Goodness. - Here we go.

350
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:50,152
- I will set it for you. - Gosh.

351
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,122
Does that feel good?

352
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:56,552
It feels very good. Goodness.

353
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:01,422
Soo Min! Why are you being so nice today?

354
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:04,362
- Do you need money? - No, that's not it.

355
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:06,152
I'm always nice to Mum and Dad.

356
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:09,652
- Right, Dad? - Of course.

357
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,952
My kids are the best.

358
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:18,752
This feels so nice. Gosh.

359
00:17:23,362 --> 00:17:24,752
Are you going over the numbers?

360
00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:30,422
Honey. We sold four bowls today.

361
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:33,052
We were out in the cold the whole day...

362
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:35,422
and all we earned was 16 dollars.

363
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:39,452
When we deduct expenses, we won't have anything left.

364
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:43,552
The family's so excited. How can we go on like this?

365
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:47,252
Should we lower the price? Is it too expensive?

366
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:49,452
But other places charge five dollars for a bowl.

367
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:53,452
Maybe it doesn't taste good. Should we change the menu?

368
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:54,552
Gosh.

369
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:57,552
I haven't met anyone that didn't like your cooking.

370
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:00,452
Then what's the problem?

371
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:03,952
Gosh, this is only the start.

372
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,052
It's not easy to do well from the start.

373
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,052
It will get better.

374
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:13,152
We will sell 10 bowls tomorrow and 15 bowls the day after.

375
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:16,052
Then, there will come a day when we sell 100 bowls a day.

376
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:19,952
Let's not expect too much for now. We need to look on the bright side.

377
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:25,652
You're right. I just became anxious all of a sudden.

378
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:28,862
It's okay.

379
00:18:44,362 --> 00:18:45,362
Ms Oh!

380
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:50,862
Are you mad? How can you come here?

381
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:53,752
I couldn't leave without you.

382
00:18:53,822 --> 00:18:55,052
Run away with me.

383
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:57,252
Let's not do this.

384
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:58,522
You and I...

385
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:00,052
are already over.

386
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:04,552
I thought you said you loved me.

387
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:08,252
You even said so in front of President.

388
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,052
Well, that's...

389
00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:13,252
It was so that I could save you.

390
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:16,652
Please, don't do this to me.

391
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:20,252
I have to stay by his side.

392
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:21,922
You call this staying by his side?

393
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,652
You can't even go inside.

394
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:24,752
Even still,

395
00:19:25,952 --> 00:19:27,422
I can't leave like this.

396
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:30,362
I'll regret it...

397
00:19:30,922 --> 00:19:32,252
for the rest of my life.

398
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:34,452
I feel guilty.

399
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:36,822
Please, wake up and smell the coffee!

400
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:38,652
You might be in danger.

401
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:57,022
Did you see that? Ki Beom just passed by.

402
00:19:57,122 --> 00:19:58,292
This is our reality.

403
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:01,322
If he finds out that we're here, who knows what will happen.

404
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:04,552
That's why you should leave right now.

405
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:05,652
Ms Oh!

406
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:07,952
Please, I'm begging you.

407
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:10,652
I'll wait for you...

408
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:13,322
at the terminal. Meet me at 12pm sharp.

409
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:16,022
No, don't wait for me.

410
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:18,862
I won't show up.

411
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:20,652
I'll wait until you do.

412
00:20:21,192 --> 00:20:22,252
I'll wait for you every single day.

413
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,452
Why isn't he waking up?

414
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:35,152
What if he never wakes up?

415
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:37,452
Don't say that.

416
00:20:38,522 --> 00:20:40,392
The doctor came by earlier...

417
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:42,122
and said that we need to be patient.

418
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:44,362
Dad.

419
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:46,252
Wake up.

420
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:47,862
You should get back on your feet...

421
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:50,362
and get revenge on those who betrayed you.

422
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:52,552
Doesn't it make you furious...

423
00:20:53,192 --> 00:20:54,252
to just lie here?

424
00:20:59,752 --> 00:21:00,752
Yes.

425
00:21:01,822 --> 00:21:02,822
What?

426
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:05,292
The tenants sent in another petition?

427
00:21:06,052 --> 00:21:09,222
Do they want to see me go crazy?

428
00:21:11,552 --> 00:21:13,052
All right. I'll be there.

429
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:16,822
What is it?

430
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:18,552
It's just work.

431
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,392
With your dad sick,

432
00:21:21,652 --> 00:21:24,022
you really need to take the lead and look after the company.

433
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:28,052
You said that you don't want to be someone who just holds the title.

434
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:31,292
You can live up to your title now.

435
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:32,922
Of course.

436
00:21:33,052 --> 00:21:35,222
That's why I've been trying to be more responsible...

437
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:36,652
and focused at work.

438
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,252
You just watch.

439
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,862
I'll show everyone.

440
00:21:39,952 --> 00:21:41,122
That's not what I meant.

441
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:44,052
I'm telling you to rebuild your life.

442
00:21:44,122 --> 00:21:46,392
Forget the past and make an honest living.

443
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:49,122
Don't forget.

444
00:21:49,452 --> 00:21:52,552
This is your chance to show Hyun Ji what an amazing dad you are.

445
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:54,052
I got it.

446
00:21:54,452 --> 00:21:57,052
I'll take care of it all.

447
00:21:57,252 --> 00:21:58,292
Do Kyung,

448
00:21:58,522 --> 00:22:00,152
you're my wife.

449
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,952
Take charge...

450
00:22:02,252 --> 00:22:03,652
and do what you want to do.

451
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:07,952
The time has come...

452
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:10,752
for us to spread our wings.

453
00:22:12,922 --> 00:22:13,952
(Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice)

454
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:15,052
- Are you all right? - Yes.

455
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:17,652
Welcome, welcome.

456
00:22:17,692 --> 00:22:19,052
Do you want some kimchi fried rice?

457
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,952
Oh.

458
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:25,152
You were here before, weren't you?

459
00:22:25,222 --> 00:22:26,452
What's the problem?

460
00:22:26,552 --> 00:22:28,652
I told you, didn't I?

461
00:22:29,052 --> 00:22:30,752
I didn't believe you, but you were right.

462
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:33,922
When will you ever stop bothering us?

463
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:36,122
I'm not sure what you mean.

464
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:37,752
Are you running your own business...

465
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:40,052
in front of our shops because we won't leave?

466
00:22:40,122 --> 00:22:42,552
I'm not sure I follow what you say.

467
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:46,222
We know that you are the head of the gangsters at Choongshim.

468
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,322
Excuse me, there must be a misunderstanding.

469
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:52,552
My husband has nothing to do with them any more.

470
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:54,822
Do you think we'll fall for that?

471
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:56,222
You don't remember me, do you?

472
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:59,752
Or did you do this to so many people that you can't remember?

473
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:01,852
Do you know me?

474
00:23:02,322 --> 00:23:04,352
- Where did you see me? - Do you really not remember?

475
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:06,552
Because of you, my dad...

476
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:07,652
Stop it.

477
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:09,192
You're wasting your breath.

478
00:23:09,652 --> 00:23:11,452
No matter what you do,

479
00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:13,652
we won't leave Manbok Shophouse.

480
00:23:13,752 --> 00:23:15,052
This is our home.

481
00:23:15,392 --> 00:23:18,252
We won't let you gangsters steal it away from us.

482
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:19,652
Let me make myself clear.

483
00:23:20,222 --> 00:23:22,292
I won't let you do that to me again.

484
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:27,452
Honey, what's going on?

485
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:31,292
You stay here for now. I'll be right back.

486
00:23:31,352 --> 00:23:32,852
Where are you going? Honey?

487
00:23:33,452 --> 00:23:34,652
Honey!

488
00:23:45,652 --> 00:23:47,422
I need to be on my way soon.

489
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:49,152
- Take care. - You too.

490
00:24:00,952 --> 00:24:03,052
- Aren't you cold? - I'm fine.

491
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:04,122
- Hello. - Hello.

492
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,322
- Thanks for the help. - No problem. We'll get going.

493
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:07,452
- I'll see you later. - Bye.

494
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:09,452
- See you. - It's so cold.

495
00:24:09,552 --> 00:24:10,952
Why did you wait outside?

496
00:24:11,022 --> 00:24:12,922
- It's fine. - Let's go inside.

497
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:14,952
Be careful.

498
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:26,752
Customers don't come out when it's so cold.

499
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:27,852
I know.

500
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:33,252
(Chul's Snack Bar)

501
00:24:40,252 --> 00:24:41,752
Go inside and stand by the heater.

502
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:42,852
Okay.

503
00:24:49,452 --> 00:24:51,322
- Welcome. - Welcome.

504
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:53,552
Who's the owner here?

505
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:58,652
I'm the owner. What's the matter?

506
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:00,452
I heard you wouldn't take our alcohol...

507
00:25:00,552 --> 00:25:02,152
because you already signed a contract with another company.

508
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:05,122
Yes, they offered a better price.

509
00:25:05,192 --> 00:25:06,192
What?

510
00:25:06,252 --> 00:25:07,292
Then,

511
00:25:08,322 --> 00:25:11,392
how much do you think our protection fee is?

512
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,852
You already ripped us off for years!

513
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:15,952
I think it's enough.

514
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:17,452
What did you just say?

515
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:20,952
Watch your language, Mister.

516
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,222
Should I make sure you don't say such a thing again?

517
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:24,652
Should I?

518
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:25,852
Please don't do this!

519
00:25:27,752 --> 00:25:29,152
Get off of him.

520
00:25:29,322 --> 00:25:30,452
Dad, are you okay?

521
00:25:30,552 --> 00:25:32,252
I'm fine. Don't call the police.

522
00:25:36,652 --> 00:25:39,192
You're the boss here, right?

523
00:25:39,422 --> 00:25:41,152
Please make them stop!

524
00:25:42,252 --> 00:25:43,652
I think it'd be best for you to leave.

525
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,122
Please.

526
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:48,292
You jerk!

527
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:50,052
Look here, Kid.

528
00:25:50,422 --> 00:25:52,752
You shouldn't talk like that to your elders.

529
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:54,452
Don't touch my son!

530
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,692
You asked for this.

531
00:25:57,252 --> 00:25:58,522
Dad!

532
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,652
Are you all right?

533
00:26:01,752 --> 00:26:04,022
Let's make sure this doesn't happen again.

534
00:26:04,052 --> 00:26:05,422
From now on,

535
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:10,252
you'll only buy alcohol from us. Do you understand?

536
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:11,952
Yes.

537
00:26:17,122 --> 00:26:18,252
We're done here.

538
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:55,192
Tae Soo.

539
00:26:56,052 --> 00:26:57,052
Yes.

540
00:26:57,692 --> 00:26:58,952
What did you find out?

541
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:00,152
Choongshim is planning...

542
00:27:00,222 --> 00:27:02,352
to redevelop Manbok Shophouse.

543
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:04,122
They're kicking them out...

544
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:06,292
but are offering a measly amount of compensation.

545
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:08,022
No wonder the tenants aren't leaving.

546
00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:11,922
They have filed lawsuits. It's a big mess right now.

547
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:14,152
I can't believe...

548
00:27:14,452 --> 00:27:15,752
that you just happened...

549
00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:17,652
to start your business in front of Manbok Shophouse.

550
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:19,122
That's why they thought you had other intentions.

551
00:27:19,552 --> 00:27:20,552
I think...

552
00:27:21,052 --> 00:27:22,952
it'd be best for you to change locations.

553
00:27:27,322 --> 00:27:28,352
Sung Koo.

554
00:27:29,452 --> 00:27:30,922
Do you remember that German bar?

555
00:27:31,452 --> 00:27:33,352
- Which one? - Five years ago,

556
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,122
Dong Pal started an alcohol business...

557
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:36,452
and tried to steal our customers.

558
00:27:36,552 --> 00:27:38,522
We went to that bar and gave them a scare.

559
00:27:38,552 --> 00:27:39,652
Right!

560
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,552
The German bar? Yes, I remember.

561
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:45,252
That owner's son was a smart one.

562
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:48,322
I know. That son...

563
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:51,922
runs a snack bar at Manbok Shophouse.

564
00:27:52,952 --> 00:27:54,652
He's looking after his father.

565
00:27:55,352 --> 00:27:58,322
He looks like he's about a year or two older than my son.

566
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:00,292
Back then,

567
00:28:00,952 --> 00:28:02,652
he must have been furious...

568
00:28:02,752 --> 00:28:04,152
that we did that to his dad.

569
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:08,752
He would have just gotten into high school five years ago.

570
00:28:08,852 --> 00:28:10,192
He would have been confused...

571
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:11,952
and scared.

572
00:28:12,052 --> 00:28:14,652
I'm sure he's still hurting from what happened then.

573
00:28:17,452 --> 00:28:19,652
But they're about to get kicked out because of Choongshim.

574
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:21,452
Come on.

575
00:28:21,852 --> 00:28:24,022
What are you thinking about?

576
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,822
So what do you plan to do about it?

577
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:30,252
After working on the food truck for a couple days,

578
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:34,452
I realised how much I've been ripping others off.

579
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:40,222
We've been sucking the life out of people like them.

580
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:41,452
Goodness.

581
00:28:43,652 --> 00:28:44,652
Well...

582
00:28:44,752 --> 00:28:46,952
I understand where you're coming from.

583
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:50,752
But we have nothing to do with Choongshim any more.

584
00:28:50,852 --> 00:28:52,752
So there's no need to think about that.

585
00:28:53,452 --> 00:28:55,022
We have problems of our own.

586
00:28:55,052 --> 00:28:56,652
What can we do?

587
00:28:58,052 --> 00:28:59,552
You're right.

588
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:03,852
I have no idea how I ended up here.

589
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:09,752
Gosh. You're getting drunk.

590
00:29:10,152 --> 00:29:13,852
Let's go home now. You have to work tomorrow.

591
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:15,852
All right. Let's go.

592
00:29:16,352 --> 00:29:18,652
Get up. Let's go.

593
00:29:19,352 --> 00:29:21,652
Goodness. Let's go.

594
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:28,552
Dad, you're home.

595
00:29:29,752 --> 00:29:33,392
Yes. My handsome son, you're still awake?

596
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:36,922
- Dad. You drank, didn't you? - Well, yes...

597
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:39,392
Drink this.

598
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:41,852
Thank you.

599
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:46,392
Mum will scold you again.

600
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:52,052
Even water tastes sweet and delicious...

601
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:53,392
when you give it to me.

602
00:29:55,122 --> 00:29:56,192
Dad, you're stressed, right?

603
00:29:58,052 --> 00:29:59,052
What?

604
00:30:00,452 --> 00:30:01,452
Dad.

605
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:05,752
I didn't mind it when you worked at Choongshim,

606
00:30:06,552 --> 00:30:08,192
but I'm proud of you now.

607
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:12,192
Cheer up.

608
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:16,052
Okay.

609
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:20,952
I know what you're trying to tell me.

610
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:25,292
Sleep well.

611
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:27,392
Okay. You too.

612
00:30:46,392 --> 00:30:49,052
Are you serious? Is business that slow?

613
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:53,552
Yes. Mum and Dad aren't telling us anything...

614
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:54,922
because they don't want us to worry.

615
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:56,292
Goodness. I'm just speechless.

616
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:59,852
Aunt. Shouldn't we do something to help?

617
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:00,952
Of course.

618
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,192
I have a great idea.

619
00:31:07,852 --> 00:31:10,752
- Sung Koo. You'll help us, right? - Yes.

620
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:13,392
But with what?

621
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:16,822
Try our kimchi fried rice! It's the best fried rice in Daejeon.

622
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:20,292
It's made with homemade kimchi and rice grown in Korea.

623
00:31:21,852 --> 00:31:23,292
Try our kimchi fried rice!

624
00:31:27,392 --> 00:31:29,392
- Honey. - Yes?

625
00:31:30,352 --> 00:31:32,852
What are you thinking about? Is there something worrying you?

626
00:31:33,822 --> 00:31:35,452
No, it's nothing.

627
00:31:37,652 --> 00:31:40,192
Try our kimchi fried rice!

628
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:43,952
It's the best kimchi fried rice in Daejeon. Try it now!

629
00:31:44,052 --> 00:31:46,452
What if we don't sell anything again today?

630
00:31:46,552 --> 00:31:49,352
Goodness. How can it be this slow?

631
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:57,292
- Hello! - You guys startled me. What's this?

632
00:31:57,392 --> 00:31:59,852
It's cold today. What are all of you doing here?

633
00:31:59,922 --> 00:32:02,452
You and Tae Soo don't really know how things work.

634
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:04,392
Don't you agree, Mr Radish?

635
00:32:05,252 --> 00:32:09,052
Regardless of how good the food is, nothing will sell without marketing.

636
00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:10,952
Don't you agree, Ms Cabbage?

637
00:32:11,452 --> 00:32:13,952
We're here to help you hit the jackpot!

638
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:15,822
So what are you going to do?

639
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:19,652
We're here to spread the news about your fried rice.

640
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:22,122
- Experience the homemade taste! - It's the best kimchi fried rice!

641
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:23,952
- Kimchi fried rice! - Kimchi fried rice!

642
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:26,452
- The best kimchi fried rice. - Try it now!

643
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:28,522
- Try our kimchi fried rice. - Kimchi fried rice.

644
00:32:28,552 --> 00:32:31,192
- I'd like three to go. - Thank you.

645
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:32,652
- Thank you. Thank you so much. - Kimchi fried rice!

646
00:32:32,752 --> 00:32:36,452
- Try our kimchi fried rice! - Kimchi fried rice!

647
00:32:36,552 --> 00:32:38,652
- Kimchi fried rice! - I hope you enjoy it!

648
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,752
- Thank you for waiting. - It will be a few minutes.

649
00:32:40,852 --> 00:32:42,952
Come to Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice and experience...

650
00:32:43,022 --> 00:32:46,052
the most delicious kimchi fried rice in Korea.

651
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:48,652
You and me.

652
00:32:49,452 --> 00:32:51,652
The two of us.

653
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:54,452
What happened to us?

654
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:57,652
Things got tangled up,

655
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:00,252
and everything is a mess now.

656
00:33:01,852 --> 00:33:04,392
I think about how cold you were...

657
00:33:04,452 --> 00:33:05,552
and I once again...

658
00:33:13,652 --> 00:33:14,652
Gosh.

659
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:18,752
Am I writing lyrics or a diary?

660
00:33:19,652 --> 00:33:20,852
Baek Hyun Ji, what's wrong with you?

661
00:33:21,452 --> 00:33:23,392
You're acting so immature about getting dumped.

662
00:33:26,952 --> 00:33:28,392
(Yoon Soo Min)

663
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:32,952
What's this?

664
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:36,392
Hi, Hyun Ji. It's me, Soo Min.

665
00:33:36,452 --> 00:33:38,552
Hi, Soo Min. What's up?

666
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:41,922
Come and try my parents' kimchi fried rice at their food truck.

667
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:43,752
Food truck?

668
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,522
I know you have tons of followers.

669
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:50,952
Please promote Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice.

670
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:53,952
That's right! Your boyfriend is here now.

671
00:33:59,052 --> 00:34:02,292
Come to Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice.

672
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:04,292
Come to Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice.

673
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:06,652
Try the kimchi fried rice. It's very delicious.

674
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:08,052
Come to Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice...

675
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:13,352
Give me some. I'll help you.

676
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:16,552
Gosh, seriously.

677
00:34:17,262 --> 00:34:18,652
I'll use my looks to promote your food.

678
00:34:18,952 --> 00:34:21,052
- Give me some. - It's okay. I'm almost done.

679
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:26,122
Wait. I don't want to be immature about this.

680
00:34:26,192 --> 00:34:29,192
But I need to know why you dumped me.

681
00:34:29,422 --> 00:34:30,452
Why did you?

682
00:34:32,352 --> 00:34:35,452
I already told you. I want to focus on studying.

683
00:34:37,022 --> 00:34:39,952
Do you think I'll believe that?

684
00:34:41,022 --> 00:34:43,652
Your dad left Choongshim and does a food truck business.

685
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:47,052
I know that it had something to do with my dad.

686
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,452
But that's what happened between our parents.

687
00:34:50,852 --> 00:34:51,952
Not us.

688
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:54,052
You didn't have to do this.

689
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:57,052
I'm begging you.

690
00:34:58,652 --> 00:35:01,552
Stop showing up like this and stop making me feel miserable.

691
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,392
Please.

692
00:35:16,262 --> 00:35:18,152
I went through a lot to arrange this meeting.

693
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:19,652
So let's stop being hostile towards each other.

694
00:35:19,762 --> 00:35:21,762
Let's meet each other half way.

695
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:23,452
You said you'd listen to our request.

696
00:35:24,152 --> 00:35:25,552
Have you changed your mind now?

697
00:35:25,652 --> 00:35:28,052
Now that I've heard what you want,

698
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:29,922
let's talk about it.

699
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:33,762
Protests and lawsuits will just exhaust both parties.

700
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:36,022
What we want is simple and clear.

701
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:37,452
We want to be properly compensated...

702
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,452
according to the Commercial Building Lease Protection Act.

703
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:41,392
We're not trying to be stubborn.

704
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:42,852
We've already compensated you!

705
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:45,952
- Calm down. - Nothing is getting through to him.

706
00:35:46,122 --> 00:35:47,192
Beob Kyu!

707
00:35:47,652 --> 00:35:49,392
You're the ones who are being unreasonable.

708
00:35:50,652 --> 00:35:51,762
Let's go.

709
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,762
Don't waste our time like this again.

710
00:35:58,052 --> 00:36:01,392
I hope you know how important time is for people like us...

711
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,762
who live from day to day.

712
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:06,292
Let's go.

713
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:13,352
Goodness. What a headache.

714
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:16,392
My father is already enough of a headache.

715
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:19,952
I'll meet their leader and try to talk to him again.

716
00:36:20,022 --> 00:36:21,552
You stay out of this. Ki Beom.

717
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:23,852
Let's do what we do best.

718
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:27,552
Things like this keep happening because we're trying to change.

719
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,452
Why should we take a more difficult road when we have a solution?

720
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:33,052
What are you going to do if it gets us in trouble?

721
00:36:33,552 --> 00:36:36,952
Gosh. I'm really torn.

722
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:43,052
Yes, Do Kyung.

723
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:45,952
What? My father?

724
00:36:49,852 --> 00:36:52,052
What are you talking about? Why would he disappear?

725
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:55,552
I don't know. I stepped out and when I came back, his bed was empty.

726
00:36:55,552 --> 00:36:56,852
Did you inform his doctors?

727
00:36:56,952 --> 00:36:59,052
They've informed everyone at the hospital and are looking for him.

728
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:00,652
Let's go. We should look for him too.

729
00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:08,052
What do you mean President disappeared? What happened?

730
00:37:08,552 --> 00:37:10,952
Why are you still here?

731
00:37:11,452 --> 00:37:13,852
Have you seen him?

732
00:37:14,552 --> 00:37:16,952
Why would I have come here if I had seen him?

733
00:37:17,392 --> 00:37:19,452
- Where did he go? - Tell me the truth.

734
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:21,652
Did you do something to my father?

735
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:24,652
Why are you doing this to me?

736
00:37:24,762 --> 00:37:27,122
- Why would I do anything to... - How can I believe you?

737
00:37:27,192 --> 00:37:28,852
How can I trust someone like you?

738
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:32,652
You jerk. What are you doing?

739
00:37:36,652 --> 00:37:39,852
- Dad! - How dare you yell at Ms Oh!

740
00:37:40,952 --> 00:37:42,052
Stop being rude to her.

741
00:37:44,852 --> 00:37:45,952
President.

742
00:37:49,192 --> 00:37:52,452
Here. This is the steamed bun that you like.

743
00:37:52,552 --> 00:37:53,552
Eat it before it gets cold.

744
00:37:56,952 --> 00:37:59,292
It's really sweet.

745
00:37:59,952 --> 00:38:02,192
Ms Oh. I'm sick of staying here at the hospital.

746
00:38:02,262 --> 00:38:04,952
Let's go on a date. We can go shopping, too.

747
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:08,762
- President. - Dad, are you crazy?

748
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:10,392
You're going to do what with this woman?

749
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,052
Did you forget what this woman did to you?

750
00:38:13,152 --> 00:38:14,222
Quiet.

751
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,652
Why are you being so rude to Ms Oh!

752
00:38:19,192 --> 00:38:22,392
Let's go. This way.

753
00:38:33,762 --> 00:38:36,552
It looks like he lost his memory.

754
00:38:37,052 --> 00:38:38,922
This is a rare case.

755
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:41,052
We can't rule out mental distress.

756
00:38:41,762 --> 00:38:43,762
He needs to receive regular treatment.

757
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,762
We'll also do a few additional tests.

758
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:49,392
The most important thing is for him to rest.

759
00:38:49,652 --> 00:38:52,052
If the patient wants to be discharged, he may do so.

760
00:38:53,352 --> 00:38:54,422
I'll speak to you later.

761
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:55,452
Thank you.

762
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:04,352
You did something to him, didn't you?

763
00:39:05,222 --> 00:39:06,322
No wonder you wouldn't leave.

764
00:39:06,422 --> 00:39:09,022
What did you do to a sick old man?

765
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,552
Ki Beom.

766
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:12,322
That's enough.

767
00:39:12,452 --> 00:39:13,552
You'll wake him up.

768
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:17,152
Gosh! You drive me insane.

769
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,952
I said, we should go on a date.

770
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:26,852
Why did we come home?

771
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:29,352
They say you need rest.

772
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:31,222
Don't treat me like a patient.

773
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:33,052
I'm completely fine.

774
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:36,952
Well, I'm a little tired.

775
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:38,552
Are you?

776
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:40,552
You should have told me.

777
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:42,122
Sit down, sit down.

778
00:39:43,552 --> 00:39:44,552
Dad.

779
00:39:45,262 --> 00:39:47,292
- What's wrong with you? - What?

780
00:39:47,322 --> 00:39:49,822
Don't you remember what she did?

781
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:52,762
I'm more concerned about what you did wrong.

782
00:39:52,822 --> 00:39:54,152
What did I do wrong?

783
00:39:54,222 --> 00:39:56,852
All you do is cause trouble.

784
00:39:59,762 --> 00:40:01,452
Stay here, Ms Oh.

785
00:40:01,552 --> 00:40:02,922
I'll get you some tea.

786
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:04,122
I'm okay.

787
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:05,262
It's okay.

788
00:40:05,422 --> 00:40:07,322
There's no need for that.

789
00:40:12,422 --> 00:40:14,822
I was going to...

790
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:16,552
leave when he woke up.

791
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:18,922
But it all happened so suddenly.

792
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:21,262
I'm not sure what to say.

793
00:40:21,322 --> 00:40:23,222
Just don't say anything.

794
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,452
You're driving me crazy.

795
00:40:27,652 --> 00:40:29,422
Since it came to this,

796
00:40:29,822 --> 00:40:31,152
Ms Oh should...

797
00:40:31,322 --> 00:40:33,552
take care of President so that he can rest.

798
00:40:33,762 --> 00:40:36,222
What are you talking about? She's not staying.

799
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,652
We don't have any other choice.

800
00:40:41,322 --> 00:40:42,922
I'm home.

801
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:45,452
Hi, Hyun Ji. You're late.

802
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:47,762
- How's Grandpa? - He got discharged.

803
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:49,322
Dad.

804
00:40:49,652 --> 00:40:50,952
Can we talk?

805
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:55,122
My princess!

806
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:57,292
What do you want to talk about?

807
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:58,852
- Dad. - Yes.

808
00:40:58,922 --> 00:41:00,452
I have something I want to ask you.

809
00:41:00,552 --> 00:41:02,222
Can you be honest with me?

810
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:05,222
Well, what is it?

811
00:41:06,322 --> 00:41:08,192
Were you the one who kicked out...

812
00:41:08,262 --> 00:41:09,322
Sung Min's dad?

813
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:13,192
What are you talking about?

814
00:41:13,822 --> 00:41:15,322
Why would I do that?

815
00:41:16,352 --> 00:41:17,652
Let me rephrase that.

816
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:20,452
Did you do something to Sung Min?

817
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:25,452
Did he say something?

818
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:28,052
Did he say that I did something wrong to him?

819
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,652
No, I'm asking you because he won't tell me.

820
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,152
There's something for sure, but he won't tell me.

821
00:41:35,852 --> 00:41:36,922
He's avoiding me.

822
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:41,552
Hyun Ji, I didn't do anything.

823
00:41:41,922 --> 00:41:43,552
Really? Can I trust you?

824
00:41:43,652 --> 00:41:44,762
Of course.

825
00:41:46,052 --> 00:41:47,122
Dad.

826
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,262
I hope you never disappoint me.

827
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:53,192
You know what I mean, right?

828
00:41:55,452 --> 00:41:56,852
Of course.

829
00:42:13,152 --> 00:42:16,052
(Stop the redevelopment project, Choongshim Construction)

830
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:33,292
What are you doing?

831
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:36,822
Oh.

832
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:41,452
- What is this? - It's...

833
00:42:42,052 --> 00:42:43,652
It's galbi.

834
00:42:43,822 --> 00:42:45,552
Cook some for your dad.

835
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,192
You should have some, too.

836
00:42:47,262 --> 00:42:48,422
Are you kidding me?

837
00:42:48,852 --> 00:42:50,152
What are you trying to pull?

838
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:52,822
Do you think you can bribe us with something like this?

839
00:42:53,922 --> 00:42:55,292
You're from that German bar, right?

840
00:42:55,452 --> 00:42:56,952
I guess you finally remembered.

841
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:01,422
There are no words...

842
00:43:01,952 --> 00:43:03,652
that could express how sorry I am.

843
00:43:03,822 --> 00:43:05,222
Are you going to be me for forgiveness?

844
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:11,322
What happened...

845
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,292
to your dad?

846
00:43:13,322 --> 00:43:15,852
After what happened to our store, he fell ill from the shock.

847
00:43:16,422 --> 00:43:18,022
You gangsters...

848
00:43:18,052 --> 00:43:19,922
broke my family apart.

849
00:43:29,262 --> 00:43:30,262
By the way,

850
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:32,222
what did Choongshim Construction say?

851
00:43:32,452 --> 00:43:33,652
Do they want you to leave?

852
00:43:34,552 --> 00:43:35,762
I'm sure that's what they said.

853
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:38,292
That's how it was like when I was there.

854
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:40,052
So what?

855
00:43:41,222 --> 00:43:42,292
Are you telling me...

856
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:44,052
to give up if I don't want to end up like my dad?

857
00:43:47,922 --> 00:43:49,652
Leave if that's all you have to say.

858
00:44:14,822 --> 00:44:16,552
Hi, Tae Soo.

859
00:44:16,652 --> 00:44:18,922
Why are you coming out from that room?

860
00:44:18,952 --> 00:44:20,552
You should go in.

861
00:44:20,652 --> 00:44:21,922
Eun Ok's sick.

862
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:23,552
What?

863
00:44:25,552 --> 00:44:26,552
Honey.

864
00:44:28,322 --> 00:44:30,292
What's wrong?

865
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:33,652
You're burning up.

866
00:44:33,652 --> 00:44:34,952
Get up, let's go to the hospital.

867
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:36,652
Goodness. There's no need for that.

868
00:44:37,192 --> 00:44:39,352
I took some pills and I feel fine now.

869
00:44:39,952 --> 00:44:41,052
The fever's coming down.

870
00:44:44,152 --> 00:44:45,552
You need to rest at home for a few days.

871
00:44:45,922 --> 00:44:48,122
What are you talking about? What about our business?

872
00:44:48,192 --> 00:44:49,922
You need a break.

873
00:44:49,952 --> 00:44:52,122
I can work with Sung Koo.

874
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:53,322
We have your sister, too.

875
00:44:53,752 --> 00:44:54,952
Don't say that.

876
00:44:55,052 --> 00:44:56,952
I can't let my will be broken.

877
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,292
I sure there will be many more days like this.

878
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,322
How can I take a break every time?

879
00:45:02,022 --> 00:45:03,922
You're so stubborn.

880
00:45:06,552 --> 00:45:09,222
I feel so much better after seeing my handsome husband.

881
00:45:11,422 --> 00:45:12,422
Honey.

882
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,652
Thank you for working so hard.

883
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:17,322
I feel like you've finally got on the right track.

884
00:45:17,452 --> 00:45:19,322
It puts me at ease.

885
00:45:19,952 --> 00:45:21,352
Although I'm physically tired,

886
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,452
I can sleep well.

887
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,552
Then, why are you sick?

888
00:45:28,652 --> 00:45:29,852
Go to bed.

889
00:45:30,422 --> 00:45:33,652
You have to get well for you to work again.

890
00:45:33,922 --> 00:45:35,322
You need to sleep, too.

891
00:45:35,422 --> 00:45:37,022
Let's go out early tomorrow.

892
00:45:37,052 --> 00:45:39,022
I went out early today,

893
00:45:39,052 --> 00:45:40,452
and it seemed like there were...

894
00:45:40,552 --> 00:45:42,922
a lot of people passing our food truck on their way to work.

895
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:45,422
Let's try to get more customers in the morning.

896
00:45:46,022 --> 00:45:47,652
Okay, let's do that.

897
00:45:48,322 --> 00:45:49,422
Go to bed.

898
00:46:30,192 --> 00:46:32,852
(Please allow me to get through the day.)

899
00:46:34,852 --> 00:46:38,252
We know that you are the head of the gangsters at Choongshim.

900
00:46:38,322 --> 00:46:40,152
There must be a misunderstanding.

901
00:46:40,222 --> 00:46:42,322
My husband has nothing to do with them any more.

902
00:46:42,422 --> 00:46:45,422
I don't want you to get involved with Choongshim from now on.

903
00:46:46,852 --> 00:46:48,652
Thinking about what they made us go through,

904
00:46:48,852 --> 00:46:50,552
makes me shudder.

905
00:46:51,352 --> 00:46:52,392
Okay?

906
00:46:52,452 --> 00:46:54,822
After what happened to our store, he fell ill from the shock.

907
00:46:54,922 --> 00:46:56,122
You gangsters...

908
00:46:56,252 --> 00:46:58,192
broke my family apart.

909
00:46:58,252 --> 00:46:59,552
Let me make myself clear.

910
00:46:59,952 --> 00:47:02,052
I won't let you do that to me again.

911
00:47:19,052 --> 00:47:21,922
Gosh, it's so cold.

912
00:47:21,952 --> 00:47:23,322
And there are no customers.

913
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:26,552
That's weird, I thought we would have more business.

914
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:28,652
How are you feeling?

915
00:47:29,692 --> 00:47:30,922
You still have the chills, don't you?

916
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:33,152
It's not that bad.

917
00:47:33,322 --> 00:47:35,392
We still have time until lunch.

918
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,252
Go get some rest.

919
00:47:37,552 --> 00:47:39,152
No, it'd be a waste of time.

920
00:47:41,422 --> 00:47:42,952
Then stay here.

921
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:44,952
I'll go get you some honey tea.

922
00:47:46,352 --> 00:47:47,352
Thank you.

923
00:48:10,422 --> 00:48:11,552
Get out of the way.

924
00:48:11,652 --> 00:48:14,452
You still don't get it, do you?

925
00:48:15,822 --> 00:48:16,952
What are you doing?

926
00:48:17,452 --> 00:48:20,852
Why are you still in business?

927
00:48:21,122 --> 00:48:23,222
You should leave since you received compensation.

928
00:48:23,322 --> 00:48:26,052
I told you, we need proper compensation.

929
00:48:26,152 --> 00:48:28,052
Look at this punk...

930
00:48:28,152 --> 00:48:29,822
talk back at me.

931
00:48:30,392 --> 00:48:32,422
Are you trying to play us...

932
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,452
to get more money out of it?

933
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:36,552
I don't know what your talking about.

934
00:48:36,652 --> 00:48:39,422
- You little... - Don't you dare touch him.

935
00:48:39,452 --> 00:48:40,752
I'll call the police.

936
00:48:40,822 --> 00:48:43,452
Please, call the police for us.

937
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:46,022
Let's ask them who's here illegally.

938
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:48,522
We don't have any reason to budge until our case has been tried.

939
00:48:48,752 --> 00:48:51,022
Our attorney told us that we can win this case.

940
00:48:51,152 --> 00:48:54,352
I was going to do this peacefully,

941
00:48:54,422 --> 00:48:56,422
but if you're going to be like this, we can't help you.

942
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:58,292
Shall we start?

943
00:48:58,422 --> 00:48:59,922
- Boys. - Yes.

944
00:49:04,422 --> 00:49:05,452
Stop it!

945
00:49:07,022 --> 00:49:09,322
Hey! Stop it now!

946
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,422
Beob Kyu, what do you think you're doing?

947
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:18,652
Seriously.

948
00:49:20,122 --> 00:49:22,922
It's none of your business. Stay out of it.

949
00:49:22,952 --> 00:49:24,222
We're doing business right now.

950
00:49:24,492 --> 00:49:27,652
You have no right to be involved in any matters related to Choongshim!

951
00:49:27,852 --> 00:49:29,222
If that's the case, do it right.

952
00:49:30,122 --> 00:49:31,852
Stop bothering innocent people.

953
00:49:34,452 --> 00:49:37,052
You can't do this, Tae Soo.

954
00:49:37,122 --> 00:49:39,152
You think you can do whatever you want because you've left Choongshim?

955
00:49:39,222 --> 00:49:41,752
I don't want to deal with you any more. Just leave.

956
00:49:41,852 --> 00:49:44,392
- Tae Soo! - Leave! Are you deaf?

957
00:49:50,952 --> 00:49:54,022
Fine. I can come back another day.

958
00:49:55,152 --> 00:49:56,752
- Let's go! - Yes, Sir.

959
00:49:57,652 --> 00:49:59,952
We'll see you later, okay?

960
00:50:01,322 --> 00:50:04,222
If you move out before that, it'd be better for all of us!

961
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:19,852
Are you okay?

962
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:23,392
You have to be careful in situations like this.

963
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:26,322
I know that you're angry, but your safety is more important.

964
00:50:28,752 --> 00:50:31,652
I'm moving my food truck. I came to say goodbye.

965
00:50:32,052 --> 00:50:33,552
I hope that the misunderstanding can be cleared up.

966
00:50:37,422 --> 00:50:38,522
Keep your chin up.

967
00:50:39,852 --> 00:50:41,422
I don't know what to tell you.

968
00:50:45,652 --> 00:50:46,952
Did you plot this with them?

969
00:50:47,022 --> 00:50:50,422
Are you playing good cop bad cop?

970
00:50:57,552 --> 00:51:01,422
All I can say is that I'm sorry.

971
00:51:01,922 --> 00:51:03,222
What do you mean there's nothing you can do?

972
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:05,452
You can help us.

973
00:51:08,822 --> 00:51:11,452
What's wrong with you? You're asking a gangster to help us?

974
00:51:13,222 --> 00:51:16,822
You held a high position when you were at Choongshim, right?

975
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:19,022
Then you should be able to help us.

976
00:51:33,022 --> 00:51:34,122
No.

977
00:51:35,322 --> 00:51:36,652
My husband doesn't do that any more.

978
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:38,922
He has nothing to do with Choongshim.

979
00:51:39,152 --> 00:51:40,152
Honey.

980
00:51:41,222 --> 00:51:42,322
Tell them.

981
00:51:42,752 --> 00:51:44,652
You promised me to never get involved with Choongshim again.

982
00:52:00,252 --> 00:52:01,252
I'm...

983
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,192
I'm sorry.

984
00:52:04,192 --> 00:52:06,022
I'm not in a position to help you.

985
00:52:07,752 --> 00:52:10,022
Everyone, I'm so sorry.

986
00:52:13,652 --> 00:52:15,322
I hate to say this to you,

987
00:52:16,822 --> 00:52:18,392
but you won't be able to win this battle.

988
00:52:19,652 --> 00:52:20,852
End it here.

989
00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:23,552
I don't want you to get hurt.

990
00:52:24,052 --> 00:52:25,152
No.

991
00:52:27,422 --> 00:52:30,222
Whether you help me or not, I will fight Choongshim.

992
00:52:32,322 --> 00:52:33,422
I can't back off now.

993
00:52:36,852 --> 00:52:39,322
Let's go. We should to back to our food truck now.

994
00:52:40,222 --> 00:52:41,222
Hurry up.

995
00:52:53,752 --> 00:52:56,222
What? Tae Soo got involved?

996
00:52:56,322 --> 00:52:58,852
Why would Tae Soo get involved in this?

997
00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:01,652
Well... I don't really know.

998
00:53:02,452 --> 00:53:04,592
Anyway, because of Tae Soo,

999
00:53:04,952 --> 00:53:07,122
those jerks at Manbok Shophouse think they can win.

1000
00:53:09,652 --> 00:53:12,922
He makes my life difficult even after leaving Choongshim.

1001
00:53:14,222 --> 00:53:17,922
Well, shouldn't we do something about it?

1002
00:53:20,452 --> 00:53:21,452
You're right.

1003
00:53:24,222 --> 00:53:25,922
Write your name and sign at the bottom.

1004
00:53:27,422 --> 00:53:28,422
What is this?

1005
00:53:28,522 --> 00:53:30,322
(I, Yoon Tae Soo, will never get involved with Choongshim.)

1006
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:31,422
Goodness.

1007
00:53:32,122 --> 00:53:35,552
Is this a joke? Are you seriously asking me to sign this?

1008
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:38,752
I'm doing this because I can't trust you.

1009
00:53:39,122 --> 00:53:42,252
Sign it. And report to me even when you go to the bathroom.

1010
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:45,222
I couldn't just walk by, so I said a few things. That's all.

1011
00:53:45,652 --> 00:53:48,652
It was a good chance to clear up the misunderstanding with them, too.

1012
00:53:48,752 --> 00:53:51,222
Then you could've just talked to them. You made me wait and...

1013
00:53:52,352 --> 00:53:54,152
Why were you listening to them ask you for help?

1014
00:53:55,122 --> 00:53:57,652
My heart sank when I saw you hesitate.

1015
00:53:58,852 --> 00:53:59,922
This way.

1016
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,752
Hey! Tae Soo!

1017
00:54:06,552 --> 00:54:07,652
Hello, Eun Ok.

1018
00:54:08,422 --> 00:54:09,952
What's this?

1019
00:54:10,552 --> 00:54:13,392
"I, Yoon Tae Soo, will never get involved with Choongshim."

1020
00:54:14,022 --> 00:54:16,122
Yes. This is great.

1021
00:54:16,692 --> 00:54:18,752
Eun Ok, I've always known that you're the wise one.

1022
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:21,192
Why are you here?

1023
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,652
I came her for the kimchi fried rice. Why else?

1024
00:54:23,952 --> 00:54:25,222
Can I get two servings?

1025
00:54:29,122 --> 00:54:30,822
Are you done for the day?

1026
00:54:31,652 --> 00:54:34,952
Why would we close up already? I'll make it for you now.

1027
00:54:35,822 --> 00:54:38,292
Thank you. That looks good.

1028
00:54:38,922 --> 00:54:40,122
Spare me a second.

1029
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,022
What do you want to talk to me about?

1030
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:50,952
Stay out of things that are none of your business.

1031
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:53,022
Just focus on your own business.

1032
00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:54,652
Do your job properly.

1033
00:54:55,452 --> 00:54:58,752
Why can't you give them what they rightfully deserve?

1034
00:54:59,322 --> 00:55:00,922
Doing so won't hurt Choongshim at all.

1035
00:55:01,322 --> 00:55:03,452
Rather, it'll improve the company's image.

1036
00:55:05,022 --> 00:55:08,952
Tae Soo. Everyone is telling me what to do these days.

1037
00:55:09,022 --> 00:55:12,452
Dad lectures at me. Even Do Kyung and Hyun Ji tell me what to do.

1038
00:55:12,552 --> 00:55:15,022
And now, you're going to join them and lecture me?

1039
00:55:15,822 --> 00:55:18,552
Mind your own business and make fried rice.

1040
00:55:18,922 --> 00:55:21,652
People's lives were ruined because of us.

1041
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:23,422
Have some decency and don't take them down again.

1042
00:55:23,452 --> 00:55:25,922
Stop worrying about other people. Worry about keeping your own life!

1043
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:28,552
- Are you threatening me now? - I'm not threatening you.

1044
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:31,122
I'm giving you a word of advice.

1045
00:55:31,652 --> 00:55:33,552
Anyway, this is the last advice I'll be giving you.

1046
00:55:34,192 --> 00:55:35,392
You know what's next, right?

1047
00:55:36,652 --> 00:55:37,852
What if I tell you that I don't know?

1048
00:55:41,222 --> 00:55:43,222
Here's your kimchi fried rice.

1049
00:55:44,122 --> 00:55:45,852
Thanks, Eun Ok.

1050
00:55:47,122 --> 00:55:48,322
You should go.

1051
00:55:49,322 --> 00:55:51,652
I'm sure Tae Soo understood everything you said.

1052
00:55:53,752 --> 00:55:55,452
Yes, I shall.

1053
00:55:56,292 --> 00:55:58,322
Tae Soo. I'm going now.

1054
00:55:59,452 --> 00:56:00,652
Beob Kyu, let's go!

1055
00:56:03,422 --> 00:56:05,122
Goodness.

1056
00:56:11,122 --> 00:56:14,652
Fine. I'll sign it.

1057
00:56:16,652 --> 00:56:18,922
Mr Choi. What are you talking about now?

1058
00:56:19,492 --> 00:56:22,652
What have I done to them? Why are they suing me now?

1059
00:56:22,852 --> 00:56:24,122
Gosh. This is making my blood boil.

1060
00:56:26,452 --> 00:56:27,552
I'll get back to you.

1061
00:56:30,222 --> 00:56:32,452
Are they suing you?

1062
00:56:32,452 --> 00:56:34,952
They're targeting me now because they haven't been able...

1063
00:56:35,022 --> 00:56:37,652
to get anything out of Choongshim.

1064
00:56:37,752 --> 00:56:40,452
These jerks. They have no idea what they're dealing with.

1065
00:56:40,552 --> 00:56:42,822
Ki Beom. Let's teach them a lesson.

1066
00:56:43,122 --> 00:56:45,322
We've been too easy on them.

1067
00:56:59,652 --> 00:57:00,652
Hello?

1068
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:04,322
It's me, Chul, from Manbok Shophouse.

1069
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,752
Who? Chul?

1070
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:11,222
The gangsters from Choongshim...

1071
00:57:12,122 --> 00:57:15,222
are vandalising our store right now! Can you help us?

1072
00:57:16,822 --> 00:57:17,822
Please help us!

1073
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:24,822
- Chul, it's... - Please help us!

1074
00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:27,392
You're the only one who can help us.

1075
00:57:28,222 --> 00:57:30,922
- Stop it! - Move out of the way.

1076
00:57:33,452 --> 00:57:34,452
Chul. Chul!

1077
00:57:38,652 --> 00:57:40,922
What's going on? Manbok Shophouse?

1078
00:57:41,452 --> 00:57:43,122
- They called you? - Yes.

1079
00:57:44,122 --> 00:57:45,922
I think Choongshim sent some guys.

1080
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,652
That boy is Sung Min's age. He was probably staying up all night to...

1081
00:57:50,322 --> 00:57:51,752
protect his shop.

1082
00:57:52,452 --> 00:57:55,452
So? Are you going to run over there?

1083
00:57:58,852 --> 00:57:59,852
Gosh.

1084
00:58:01,222 --> 00:58:02,322
Are you?

1085
00:58:03,222 --> 00:58:04,322
Goodness.

1086
00:58:08,422 --> 00:58:09,422
Well...

1087
00:58:10,752 --> 00:58:12,852
I promised you I wouldn't.

1088
00:58:13,852 --> 00:58:14,922
I'm not going.

1089
00:58:18,652 --> 00:58:19,652
Go back to sleep now.

1090
00:58:22,952 --> 00:58:26,392
- Honey. - I'm not going.

1091
00:58:32,122 --> 00:58:34,122
I'm getting myself a glass of water.

1092
00:58:35,552 --> 00:58:36,552
Go back to sleep.

1093
00:59:45,552 --> 00:59:47,022
Get off of him.

1094
00:59:47,652 --> 00:59:50,222
You're the boss here, right?

1095
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:51,852
Please make them stop!

1096
00:59:51,952 --> 00:59:53,352
You don't remember me, do you?

1097
00:59:53,752 --> 00:59:55,852
I won't let you do that to me again.

1098
00:59:55,952 --> 00:59:57,352
You can help us.

1099
00:59:57,452 --> 00:59:59,822
You held a high position when you were at Choongshim, right?

1100
01:00:00,052 --> 01:00:01,352
Then you should be able to help us.

1101
01:00:03,822 --> 01:00:05,352
Can you help us?

1102
01:00:06,652 --> 01:00:07,922
Please help us.

1103
01:00:08,052 --> 01:00:09,952
You're the only one who can help us.

1104
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:20,052
I don't want you to get involved with Choongshim from now on.

1105
01:00:20,922 --> 01:00:22,552
Thinking about what they made us go through,

1106
01:00:22,822 --> 01:00:24,552
makes me shudder.

1107
01:00:25,252 --> 01:00:26,292
Honey.

1108
01:00:26,822 --> 01:00:28,522
Thank you for working so hard.

1109
01:00:29,652 --> 01:00:31,652
I feel like you've finally got on the right track.

1110
01:00:31,922 --> 01:00:33,392
It puts me at ease.

1111
01:00:34,352 --> 01:00:35,692
Although I'm physically tired,

1112
01:00:35,952 --> 01:00:37,752
I can sleep well.

1113
01:00:38,352 --> 01:00:39,392
No.

1114
01:00:40,752 --> 01:00:42,392
My husband doesn't do that any more.

1115
01:00:42,452 --> 01:00:44,252
He has nothing to do with Choongshim.

1116
01:00:44,352 --> 01:00:46,052
Write your name and sign at the bottom.

1117
01:00:46,152 --> 01:00:47,752
Why were you listening to them ask you for help?

1118
01:00:48,922 --> 01:00:51,552
My heart sank when I saw you hesitate.

1119
01:01:07,652 --> 01:01:08,652
Go.

1120
01:01:24,392 --> 01:01:26,352
I must have been destined to be...

1121
01:01:26,652 --> 01:01:28,352
a wife of a gangster.

1122
01:01:31,022 --> 01:01:33,052
I thought 18 years was enough.

1123
01:01:34,392 --> 01:01:36,192
I wanted to live like a normal person.

1124
01:01:38,452 --> 01:01:40,252
But I guess it's not in the stars for me.

1125
01:01:44,752 --> 01:01:46,352
I won't be able to stop if I go now.

1126
01:01:47,822 --> 01:01:49,052
I'll have to help them until the end.

1127
01:01:51,822 --> 01:01:53,552
You think I don't know that?

1128
01:01:58,122 --> 01:01:59,152
Go.

1129
01:02:00,652 --> 01:02:02,152
Go save the country or go save a man.

1130
01:02:03,122 --> 01:02:04,452
Do whatever you want.

1131
01:02:06,392 --> 01:02:08,222
- Honey. - Go!

1132
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:11,052
Go before I change my mind.

1133
01:02:50,152 --> 01:02:52,152
(Sweet and Scary Family)

1134
01:02:52,752 --> 01:02:54,022
You'll be going behind bars.

1135
01:02:54,052 --> 01:02:55,552
Drop the lawsuit against Manbok Shophouse.

1136
01:02:56,052 --> 01:02:57,952
Did you stick your nose in someone else's business?

1137
01:02:58,052 --> 01:02:59,552
Will it get you in trouble?

1138
01:02:59,552 --> 01:03:00,852
You're not living this life alone.

1139
01:03:00,922 --> 01:03:02,652
You need to look around and help others.

1140
01:03:02,752 --> 01:03:05,552
Mr Park called and said that he's going to quit.

1141
01:03:05,652 --> 01:03:06,922
How can you fight without a lawyer?

1142
01:03:07,122 --> 01:03:08,922
If you want to win, you need to toughen up.

1143
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,322
We will lose if we don't unite.

1144
01:03:10,452 --> 01:03:12,152
You need to question me at the police station?

1145
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:13,652
You don't have to be someone I'm proud of.

1146
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:15,152
But don't be the person I am ashamed of.

1147
01:03:15,222 --> 01:03:17,922
Mum, let's move back to our old house.

1148
01:03:18,052 --> 01:03:19,222
For the last three years,

1149
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:21,022
I was really happy...

1150
01:03:21,052 --> 01:03:22,452
and thankful.

1151
01:03:22,552 --> 01:03:24,452
Just let me go.

1152
01:03:25,292 --> 01:03:27,452
Why are you waiting for someone that's not going to come?

1153
01:03:27,552 --> 01:03:30,052
We have to leave this place if we want to live.

1154
01:03:30,352 --> 01:03:32,552
Attacking them first can be our best defence.

1155
01:03:32,652 --> 01:03:33,652
I apologise.

1156
01:03:33,752 --> 01:03:36,192
I calculated the compensation,

1157
01:03:36,352 --> 01:03:38,552
and it turns out you should be getting twice the amount.

1158
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:41,352
We want you out of this.

1159
01:03:41,452 --> 01:03:44,192
With money and power, you can do anything.

1160
01:03:44,252 --> 01:03:45,552
Boss!

1161
01:04:15,752 --> 01:04:17,452
the Family Court is always full.

1162
01:04:17,552 --> 01:04:18,652
(Go Dong Mi, never had a boyfriend)

1163
01:04:18,752 --> 01:04:22,322
You should be suspicious. Reasonable suspicion is important.

1164
01:04:22,352 --> 01:04:23,352
(Baek Da Jeong, soon to be divorced)

1165
01:04:23,852 --> 01:04:26,552
Bring me the big ones. As big as melons!

1166
01:04:26,652 --> 01:04:27,652
(Hong Ae Ran, soon to be married)

1167
01:04:27,852 --> 01:04:29,952
(A romantic comedy with a cheerful energy)

1168
01:04:30,192 --> 01:04:32,952
(Happy Ending Once Again)
