00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,650
Tada! Look. 

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,670
Our family treasure. 

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,870
What's this? 

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,850
We'll hand this on the wall of our new place 

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,190
and salute to it every morning and night. 

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,270
I pledge allegiance to the purchase contract 

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,400
and to my wife's happiness, for which it stands, 

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,470
until the day I can no longer move. 

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,630
Salute! 

11
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,660
Don't make that dumb pot our family treasure. 

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,330
We should make this one it. 

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,410
Where is it? 

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,190
What's this? 

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,580
- What's this?
- You'll wake up the boys. 

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,430
Sintong! Bangtong! 

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,180
- Dad's calling you!
- Don't. 

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,340
They don't care about us. 

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,810
Let's rely on each other. 

20
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,770
My sweet wife. 

21
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,660
I'm so happy to see you smile like this. 

22
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,790
Oh, this brings back memories. 

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,440
When I was pregnant with Sintong, 

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,610
after agonizing about it, I told you, and... 

25
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,240
I was amazing. 

26
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,090
You disappeared right away. 

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,490
Bastard. 

28
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,930
That bastard disappeared, 

29
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,010
my belly was getting bigger and I got scared. 

30
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,190
But one day, Heo Sedal just appeared. 

31
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,340
And he grabbed me by my wrist 

32
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,210
and pushed open my front door, like today. 

33
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,270
And he got down on his knees and said, 

34
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,700
"Please let us get married!" 

35
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,640
"If you want to beat me up, I'll take it." 

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,350
Oh, you have no idea how amazing you were. 

37
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,840
It was always my role to look after you, 

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,610
but tonight, you were an amazing husband. 

39
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,400
You're not upset because of what I did? 

40
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,150
I'll deal with that later. 

41
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,710
You're crazy about me, right? 

42
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,770
Now you're like my baby sister. 

43
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,270
I don't look like your wife? 

44
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,960
Sadly, we're like family. 

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,680
What? 

46
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,230
Hold on, hold on. 

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,670
Here, here. 

48
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,660
We have to celebrate.
let's have some beer. 

49
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,230
No, let's do it at the new apartment. 

50
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,300
Let's do it there and here. 

51
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,330
I'll pay for this beer. 

52
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,630
Put it on my tab. 

53
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,370
And expect an exciting night. 

54
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,170
You said I'm like family! 

55
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,900
It'll be like a daytime soap then. 

56
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,570
I'll believe it when I experience it. 

57
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,500
Why you! 

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,290
Sedal, thanks. 

59
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,640
There's no need to be so touched. 

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,500
I think you like to be touched too much. 

61
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,800
I'll make sure you're touched to death. 

62
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,710
- Sedal!

63
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,790
Hey, hey, hey, hey! 

64
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,680
Let go of me.
Look how I'm sitting. 

65
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,490
Hey, hey, hold on a sec. 

66
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,790
- Huh?
- Hold on. 

67
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,290
Goof-off, you were pretty cool. 

68
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,650
Be good to my niece. 

69
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,750
Who? 

70
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,860
Your uncle. 

71
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,500
Loser, your niece is going to die tonight. 

72
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,680
What Sedal said was right. 

73
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,870
Will Anggeum let him get away with this? 

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,270
I'm worried about whom she'll take it out on. 

75
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,050
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo... 

76
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,710
Oh, man... 

77
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,360
How did it feel to be yelled at by Sedal? 

78
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,540
Don't add fuel to the fire. 

79
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,770
What did you do to Hobak for Sedal to say that? 

80
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,540
What do you mean by that? 

81
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,590
I'm never going to see them again. 

82
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,530
As if they ever did anything for me. 

83
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,620
They never even bought me underwear. 

84
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,010
Enough about the underwear. 

85
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,970
I'll buy you a truck load, okay? 

86
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,200
I keep forgetting to get them. 

87
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,390
I'm not saying I need underwear! 

88
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,770
I'm just making a point. 

89
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,750
They are taking care of themselves without asking for our help. 

90
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,070
You should be proud of that. 

91
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,510
But Subak took care of herself and us. 

92
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,130
You can't ignore that. 

93
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,970
So? Are you saying Sedal was right? 

94
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,710
What he said was right. 

95
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,140
How could you... 

96
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,280
Yelling at me like that was right? 

97
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,120
How come there's nobody on my side? 

98
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,500
You keep that up. 

99
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,210
What are you doing? 

100
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,600
Can't you tell?
I'm leaving. 

101
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,460
What? 

102
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,660
Try living without me. 

103
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,600
What? 

104
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,200
You always say, what? What? 

105
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,920
I can't stand that. 

106
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,250
Are you deaf? 

107
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,230
What? 

108
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, no! 

109
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
She's taking it out on your brother. 

110
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,910
What do we do, mom? 

111
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,960
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo... 

112
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,430
Mom. 

113
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,750
Why are you out here? 

114
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,080
Father called. 

115
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,050
He told me to send you right back home. 

116
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,200
He thinks he's so smart. 

117
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,160
What's going on? 

118
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,950
I don't even want to talk about it. 

119
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,310
Sedal was glaring and yelling at me. 

120
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,380
Oh my, Sedal? 

121
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,870
He was screaming and he said  

122
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,360
mother, don't ever bother Hobak again! 

123
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,290
Or I'll crush everyone be it you or Subak! 

124
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,960
He went crazy like that,
and Hobak came over and dragged him out. 

125
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,210
Oh my, he must be crazy. 

126
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,210
He did that in front of father? 

127
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,660
I couldn't believe my eyes. 

128
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,750
His bulging eyes were glaring. 

129
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,980
If nobody was there, he would've hit me. 

130
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,470
Hobak put him up to it. 

131
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,650
She grabbed my hair. 

132
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,650
They were both in on it. 

133
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,990
Right?
Hobak put him up to it. 

134
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,240
Of course! 

135
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,260
Sedal wouldn't have the guts to do that. 

136
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,260
What did father say? 

137
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,500
What do you think?
He sided with Sedal! 

138
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,410
Why do you think I'm here? 

139
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,890
I'm the villain, I am! 

140
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,250
I'm never going home. 

141
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,160
What about the girls? 

142
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,030
Your father will take care of them. 

143
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,140
What can father do? 

144
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,330
Grandmother's there and Gwangbak's there. 

145
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,730
They can take care of them! 

146
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,370
I don't care.
Go there if you want to. 

147
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,670
I'm not going home. 

148
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,400
Come back right now!
Hear the baby crying? 

149
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,310
How could you leave the kids here? 

150
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,400
Send Subak here. 

151
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,450
Hello? 

152
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,660
Hey! Hey! 

153
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,000
You... 

154
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,860
I'm out with friends. 

155
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,280
What's going on, father? 

156
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,720
Your mom's gone. 

157
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,250
What? 

158
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,280
The baby's crying.
What should I do? 

159
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,280
Huh? 

160
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,330
Bark like a dog? 

161
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,880
I can't do it. 

162
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,650
Okay. 

163
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,790
I can't take this anymore. 

164
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,140
What if he loses his voice? 

165
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,270
I know. 

166
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,550
You do it. 

167
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,550
She cries harder when I do it. 

168
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,610
This is really crazy. 

169
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,470
The Korean War was nothing compared to this. 

170
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,570
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo... 

171
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,620
Oh, oh, no... 

172
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,760
Father, I'll do it. Let me. 

173
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,360
Man... 

174
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,510
I tried, but it didn't work.
You're good. 

175
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,750
It has to sound like two dogs fighting. 

176
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,480
I'll sleep with her tonight. 

177
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,870
Father, you should leave mom alone. 

178
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,370
What Sedal said was right,
but mom's having a hard time, too. 

179
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,790
There's not a moment of peace in this house. 

180
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,390
I'm getting wrinkles. 

181
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,900
Don't get wrinkles, father. 

182
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,600
Everyone's been really sensitive. 

183
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,600
But still. 

184
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,550
How could she just leave the kids behind like that? 

185
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,460
I'm sure she's worried, too. 

186
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,190
If she's not, she's not human. 

187
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,770
Oh, this is delicious. 

188
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,630
I didn't know they deliver this late. 

189
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,040
They deliver 24 hours. 

190
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,090
If you're rich, the world is a good place. 

191
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,240
That's why everyone wants to become rich. 

192
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,100
Your father thinks eating this will kill him. 

193
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,150
But it's yummy. 

194
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,740
It's more delicious late at night. 

195
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,610
I'll get fat. 

196
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,000
It's just for tonight. 

197
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,500
Really? 

198
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,790
I love everything other people cook. 

199
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,950
Ugh... 

200
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,020
When will I ever get a daughter in law? 

201
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,670
I hate cooking every day. 

202
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,090
I don't want to wake up in the morning,
because I hate making breakfast. 

203
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,650
Everyone asks for food whenever they see me. 

204
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,770
As if I'm a rice cooker. 

205
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,320
You'll get one.
You have Daebak. 

206
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,200
But he's still a little boy! 

207
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,620
I'll die before he gets married. 

208
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,150
What the heck.
This is my vacation. 

209
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,250
Why didn't I think of this before? 

210
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,980
He thinks I'll have a hard time! 

211
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,070
I hope you have a really hard time at home! 

212
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,340
You drink, too. 

213
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,510
I love having you over. 

214
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,040
I can't believe what Sedal did. 

215
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,860
I'm going to get his mother for this. 

216
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,870
She should've raised him better. 

217
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,270
Ugh, how can I be this unlucky? 

218
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,040
Both my son in laws are losers. 

219
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,660
What did I ever do to deserve them? 

220
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,010
Son in laws are good for nothing. 

221
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,010
Mom, you're so funny. 

222
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,730
Oh, I feel drunk. 

223
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,430
I haven't had a drink in a long time. 

224
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,750
And it's been a while since I used a chamber pot. 

225
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,240
Mom, you must feel happy. 

226
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,890
I'm not. 

227
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,010
I feel miserable. 

228
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:02,720
You must be, too,
but I'm so embarrassed. 

229
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,160
I'm afraid someone will ask about Minjung. 

230
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,740
I can't tell them he went bankrupt. 

231
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,730
It's driving me crazy, too. 

232
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,660
I'm afraid of him running into someone we know. 

233
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,520
What if my friend recognizes him? 

234
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,850
I don't know how long I can take this, mom. 

235
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,610
I can't live with him. 

236
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,480
I don't even want to see his face. 

237
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,330
Or hear his voice. 

238
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,430
He looks ugly now that he can't make money. 

239
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,010
That's how everyone feels. 

240
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,520
He must do well to appear handsome. 

241
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,250
Who is it? 

242
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,930
Subak, it's me. Open the door. 

243
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,130
Huh? 

244
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,230
- What time is it?
- Oh. 

245
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,080
It's not even morning yet. 

246
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,660
Why are you here? 

247
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,600
I came to fetch you. 

248
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,280
Jungji cried all night, so father and I didn't sleep at all. 

249
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,390
You had a party here. 

250
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,520
I don't believe this. 

251
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,030
It's heaven here. 

252
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Let's go, mom. 

253
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,980
Am I crazy?
I'm not going back to that hell. 

254
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,830
What about breakfast?
Grandma will get mad. 

255
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,160
There it is again! 

256
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,350
Is everyone going to starve without me? 

257
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,180
See? Without me, they'll starve to death. 

258
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,600
You make breakfast.
Mom's stressed out. 

259
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,590
I don't know how to cook. 

260
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,360
Father's really angry. 

261
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,730
Let him be.
I'm not scared of him. 

262
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,300
I'm not coming home unless he changes. 

263
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,690
He keeps going, what? What? 

264
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,720
He has no respect for his wife. 

265
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,880
And that's why our son in laws disrespect me. 

266
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,470
I hate you too.
Go home. 

267
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,510
You guys try living without me! 

268
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,070
Mom. 

269
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,130
Hey! Minjung! 

270
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,610
Minjung! 

271
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,770
Minjung! 

272
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,370
Minjung! 

273
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,930
Where are the socks? 

274
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,770
Hey! Hey! 

275
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,570
Darn it. 

276
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,070
Father, what is it? 

277
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,760
I can't find my socks. 

278
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,430
Oh... 

279
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,340
Here. 

280
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,090
I tried, but I couldn't find them. 

281
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,040
It's tough without mom, huh? 

282
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,040
Not at all. 

283
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,470
She shouldn't dare come home. 

284
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,710
Just give her a call and say you're sorry. 

285
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,500
Did she ask me to call her? 

286
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,570
No, she didn't say that. 

287
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,020
Tell her to live there permanently. 

288
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,850
She didn't seem to miss home. 

289
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,430
She ordered fried chicken, alcohol and pig feet last night. 

290
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,810
She's having a lot of fun. 

291
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,820
Stupid sock! 

292
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,660
What's wrong? 

293
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,060
It's inside out. 

294
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,580
Can you make me an egg... 

295
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,270
Let's eat. 

296
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,050
Mother. 

297
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,460
It isn't much, but try it. 

298
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,140
There's nothing to try. 

299
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,330
I know. 

300
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,370
Oh... 

301
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,990
I don't believe this. 

302
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,520
What will your children learn? 

303
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,930
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo... 

304
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,280
What? 

305
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,740
I got fired. 

306
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,560
What did you just say? 

307
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,260
You want me to repeat?
I got fired. 

308
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,900
Since I came clean, don't be too harsh. 

309
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,680
How about a 3 day probation? 

310
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,770
You... 

311
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,730
Hey! 

312
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,410
- Stay still!
- Hey! Heo Sedal! 

313
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,410
Come back here! 

314
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,590
How dare you! 

315
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,660
Would you, if you were me? 

316
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,000
Are you trying to drive me mad? 

317
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,450
Stop embarrassing yourself and come inside! 

318
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,070
Hello! 

319
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,620
You're taking out the garbage? 

320
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,990
Why would you quit that amazing job? 

321
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,870
I should have known! 

322
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,750
Hey! 

323
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,300
What are you doing? 

324
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,460
Hobak, Hobak! 

325
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,520
What are you doing? 

326
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,410
Hey, Madam Park Salla! 

327
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,000
You haven't gone to work? 

328
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,120
Not before I yell at you! 

329
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,240
Come inside! 

330
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,660
Nice going. 

331
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,310
He might be younger, but he's your husband. 

332
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,670
How could you kick him out in his underwear? 

333
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,440
I had a good reason. 

334
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,710
Is Sedal having an affair? 

335
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,810
He can't because he has no money. 

336
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,780
Then what did he do to deserve that? 

337
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,370
It's embarrassing. 

338
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,040
I'm not embarrassed. 

339
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,300
I have a great body. Look. 

340
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,120
Oh, oh, oh! 

341
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,760
Are you okay? 

342
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,090
I have great reflexes. 

343
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,290
You think you can do this? 

344
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,570
Ask him what he did. 

345
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,040
Stay out of it, mom. 

346
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,500
Don't abuse my son! 

347
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,720
He's going to become the president of Korea! 

348
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,550
I was never going to see you,
but I just couldn't let it slide. 

349
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,860
What are you two doing? 

350
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,860
I heard what happened last night. 

351
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,570
Learn to control your husband. 

352
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,380
How dare he? 

353
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,700
If I were there, I would've kicked his butt. 

354
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,380
A son in law yelling at his mother in law? 

355
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,090
Who does that? 

356
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,100
Did you put him to it? 

357
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,440
Subak. 

358
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,060
You think I'm a nobody now that I'm poor,
but I'm still standing. 

359
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,920
I'm still the eldest daughter. 

360
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,760
I'm telling you, if he or you make one wrong move, I'll kill you both. 

361
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,250
Just who does Sedal think he is? 

362
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,160
Tell Sedal to come and apologize to mom. 

363
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,400
Understand? 

364
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,700
Yeah. 

365
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,360
Even if Sedal went wild,
you should've stopped him. 

366
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,670
You're older than him. 

367
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,010
Get up. 

368
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,390
Go apologize to mom. 

369
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,390
She's at my place. 

370
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,830
At your place? 

371
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,830
She had a fight with father. 

372
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,540
Look what you did to our family. 

373
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,680
Don't mess things up again. 

374
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,050
I asked to see you today because... 

375
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,050
I know, Mr. Wang. 

376
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,470
Don't call me that. 

377
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,870
Force of habit.
You used to be my teacher. 

378
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,620
What do you think about last night? 

379
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,290
Excuse me? 

380
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,800
You feel sorry about it, don't you? 

381
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,460
I'm sorry, 

382
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,930
but I don't think what I did was wrong. 

383
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,950
The problem is not what but how you said it. 

384
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,430
You were at your in laws house. 

385
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,230
Yelling and screaming there was okay? 

386
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,800
I'm sorry about that part. 

387
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,990
But Don's sister in law was mean, too. 

388
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,260
I actually thought Hobak was adopted. 

389
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,890
Stop calling her Don's sister in law. 

390
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,130
I've been calling her that since forever... 

391
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,900
I won't do that again. 

392
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:06,360
I'm actually relieved because now I know how you feel about Hobak. 

393
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,050
You've always been so immature. 

394
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,210
She's my wife. 

395
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,850
Shall we order some beer, Mr. Wang? 

396
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,140
I have to go back to school after lunch. 

397
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,310
Be kind to Hobak. 

398
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,500
After being married for 10 years,
you don't live on sparks. 

399
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,060
You live on compassion for each other. 

400
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,800
I'm relieved now that you're growing up. 

401
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,670
I'm not the growing up type,
but I'll work hard on it. 

402
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:48,060
Apologize to my wife in a few days. 

403
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,970
Yes, Mr. Wang.
I mean, father. 

404
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,760
Mom, Hobak's here. 

405
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:06,890
Mom, 

406
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,220
I'm sorry about last night. 

407
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,960
Sedal was drunk. 

408
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,430
He said he was sorry this morning. 

409
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,560
Why doesn't he just kill me? 

410
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,410
He has no respect for his mother in law. 

411
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,430
Put yourself in my shoes.
This is wrong. 

412
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,390
Have you forgotten our family motto? 

413
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,080
This will never happen again. 

414
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,700
Mom, I'm sorry. 

415
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,180
I know you were in on it. 

416
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,180
In on what? 

417
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,190
That didn't come from Sedal's head. 

418
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,810
You were behind it. 

419
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,310
That's not true.
I didn't know about it. 

420
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,320
Anyway, mom, don't be so mad. 

421
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,060
And Hobak, I'm sorry. 

422
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,600
Daebak, don't worry. 

423
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,770
She's probably went to the sauna. 

424
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,480
No, she didn't. 

425
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,190
She went to Subak's place. 

426
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,130
That's strange. 

427
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,170
I heard women go to the sauna after a fight. 

428
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,520
Your mom is extremely unique. 

429
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,650
Everything's a mess at home. 

430
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,430
Do you know how to cook? 

431
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:22,600
I can make spicy rice cake.
You want some? 

432
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
It's okay. 

433
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,670
How do I bring mom home? 

434
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,860
Your father will take care of it. 

435
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:35,290
A couple must work on their issues together because meddling can escalate things. 

436
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,900
- Understand?
- Yes. 

437
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,020
- Should I go get her number?
- Yes. 

438
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,000
- Stop that.
- Yes. 

439
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,230
Why did you do that? 

440
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,660
I should've asked Hobak to clean it. 

441
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,570
I can't stay longer because of the bathroom. 

442
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,980
Little girl! 

443
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,740
- Me?
- Can you help me? 

444
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,720
Do you know where this is? 

445
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,900
Oh, over there.
It's on the 3rd floor. 

446
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,110
The sign is hard to see. 

447
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,930
Oh. 

448
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,230
I don't give directions, but since you look kind, I made an exception. 

449
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:35,950
Huh? 

450
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,130
Mom told me to watch out for strangers. 

451
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,620
Right. You should. 

452
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,450
Watch out for kind looking people too. 

453
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,730
Mom told me that too. 

454
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,410
Smart girl! You must get good grades. 

455
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,410
I do pretty well. 

456
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,900
I'm sure you're a top student. 

457
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,130
I've heard that before. 

458
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,300
They say I should become a lawyer,
but I'm going to be a good wife. 

459
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,120
Thanks, little girl. 

460
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,570
Aeji! 

461
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,720
Dad! 

462
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,680
- Dad!
- Oh! 

463
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,310
Aeji, did you miss me? 

464
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,060
Yes. 

465
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,990
How much? 

466
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,890
Lots and lots. 

467
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,350
Dad missed Aeji lots and lots too. 

468
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,740
I want to live with you, dad. 

469
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,880
Dad, why won't you come visit me? 

470
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,850
Sorry. 

471
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,010
Let's go to grandfather's house later. 

472
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,560
Okay. 

473
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Mom, mom. 

474
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,290
I gave directions to a man earlier. 

475
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,250
I told you not to talk to strangers. 

476
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,670
He was nice, a parcel service man. 

477
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,100
He told me I look like a smart girl. 

478
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,740
A parcel service man? 

479
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,070
What did he look like? 

480
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,070
Like other men his age. 

481
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,180
What did he say? 

482
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,510
She's comfortable with her lifestyle. 

483
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,510
What if Sangnam gets married? 

484
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,220
Right now, Sangnam's living with you, 

485
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,350
but when he moves out, people will talk. 

486
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,060
You're her brother in law. 

487
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,950
And you won't be able to remarry. 

488
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,950
But I can't force her to get married. 

489
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,800
She hasn't gotten over her first love. 

490
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,830
He must have a family of his own. 

491
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,970
Probably. 

492
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,480
I'm sure he's forgotten all about her. 

493
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,700
She can't seem to get over it. 

494
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,630
I think she feels guilty. 

495
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,290
When I think about that,
I can't bring myself to forgive that woman. 

496
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,830
You should tell your mom to go home,
not let her stay here! 

497
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,830
You should've dragged her home. 

498
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,690
Why are you yelling at her?
It was my choice. 

499
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,910
Get up. 

500
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,850
No. 

501
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,250
I'm not scared. 

502
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,190
Help your mom get up. 

503
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,540
Why don't you make me get up? 

504
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,240
You get up on your own then. 

505
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
I'm too weak to get up. 

506
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,010
You're strong enough to yell at me. 

507
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,280
Help her get up, hurry. 

508
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,790
Father coming here means he's surrendering. 

509
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,560
I'm not really surrendering. 

510
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,030
He's not really surrendering. 

511
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,510
Hurry! He'll get mad at me.
Go home. 

512
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,400
I'm going because of the darn bathroom. 

513
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,560
Hurry up and come inside! 

514
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,690
Silly old woman. 

515
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,060
How can you be so childish? 

516
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,370
How could you run away to Subak's place? 

517
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,460
They only have one room! 

518
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,700
Minjung didn't come home. 

519
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,380
I didn't even see him. 

520
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,470
He doesn't come home? 

521
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,680
He didn't, when I was there. 

522
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
I talked to him, but it didn't work. 

523
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,170
I told him you said so, and that did no good. 

524
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,390
What's the problem with our son in laws? 

525
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,500
They have no respect for any of us. 

526
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Are they plotting against us? 

527
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,090
Plotting against us?
Are you mad? 

528
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,090
This is all your fault. 

529
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,980
You always scold me and that's why. 

530
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,300
What? 

531
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,910
There you go again with "what." 

532
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,110
Why did I come back to this hell? 

533
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,460
You won't earn any points that way. 

534
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,720
Go and beg. 

535
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,400
What's more important?
My pride or money? 

536
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,550
Money. 

537
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,950
Give me a harder question. 

538
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,720
I shouldn't have asked. 

539
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,730
Just hear me out. 

540
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:49,150
The manager was really getting on my nerves. 

541
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,540
Nobody has any respect for me. 

542
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,550
He said you got me the job. 

543
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,810
He's correct. 

544
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,160
Speaking of the devil. 

545
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,040
Is it the manager? 

546
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,130
Hey, hurry up and answer it. 

547
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:05,910
I don't want to. 

548
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,680
Come on! 

549
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,970
Hello? 

550
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,970
Why did you call? 

551
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,520
This late? 

552
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,310
I have to go to bed. 

553
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,290
Fine. 

554
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,110
Did he ask you to come in? 

555
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,180
He said to come quick. 

556
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,670
He did?
Is he giving you your job back? 

557
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,340
No way. 

558
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,290
Then why would he be calling you this late? 

559
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,880
How did he sound? 

560
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,960
I don't care about that. 

561
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,760
He said he'll pay for the cab. 

562
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,640
Hurry up and go then. 

563
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,640
Don't get your hopes up. 

564
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,750
You can't go to a hotel wearing that. 

565
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,240
Drive. 

566
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:07,990
Excuse me? 

567
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,900
You know how to drive, right? 

568
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,000
Yes, I was a driver in the army. 

569
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,470
I was under the commander. 

570
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,950
Now you're under me. 

571
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,980
She's in our board of directors. 

572
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,680
Director Eun Miran. 

573
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:34,100
Do whatever she tells you to do, got it? 

574
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,300
Oh! 

575
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,080
Wow, this is so cool. 

576
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,870
I'm sorry. 

577
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,870
Don't get scared.
Pretend this is your car. 

578
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,780
This is my car. This is my car. 

579
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,080
Step on it. 

580
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,260
We'll get a speeding ticket. 

581
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,770
Don't worry about it. 

582
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,760
Seriously? 

583
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,460
Ma'am, may I scream? 

584
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,270
Go ahead. 

585
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,680
Yay! 

586
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,720
This is nutty, nutty, nuts! 

587
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,900
Yay! 

588
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,050
- Tada!
- Whoa! 

589
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,280
Isn't this perfect as a late night snack? 

590
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,640
Did you make it? 

591
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,440
This is my specialty. 

592
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,250
Oh, it's amazing. Try it. 

593
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:38,130
This tastes better than I remember. 

594
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,390
What is it? 

595
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,100
It brings back memories. 

596
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,310
How hard it was when you were growing up. 

597
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,050
We've been through a lot. 

598
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,790
It wasn't hard for me. 

599
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,790
It was hard for you, though. 

600
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,020
When you cried, I cried,
and when I cried you cried. 

601
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,670
She was in and out when you were a baby, 

602
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,750
and when you were in the third grade,
she left for good. 

603
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:10,150
Though she wasn't good to you,
you cried everyday for her. 

604
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:15,280
And I'd make you these noodles,
and you'd stop crying. 

605
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,900
To make you fall asleep, 

606
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:25,000
I used to put you in the driver's seat of my truck and drive around the neighborhood. 

607
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That was the only method that worked. 

608
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,690
I was a really nasty kid. 

609
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,950
No, you were an amazing kid. 

610
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,050
And now you're a good man. 

611
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,260
Why didn't you wake me up? 

612
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,900
I just nodded off. 

613
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,690
No, this is actually fun. 

614
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,270
I'm good at this.
Would you like a taste? 

615
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,430
It's okay. 

616
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,130
I'll clean up. Go to bed. 

617
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,570
Just leave them in the sink. 

618
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,400
Good night, Daese. 

619
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,930
Good night. 

620
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,410
I hope she meets someone nice. 

621
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,520
Right, father? 

622
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,330
Yes, but I don't know what she wants. 

623
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,780
Call your wife. 

624
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,210
Tell her you won't come home for 3 days. 

625
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:11,870
Excuse me? 

626
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,790
I can't. We're moving tomorrow. 

627
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,970
Don't worry, Ms. Director. 

628
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,970
She can handle the move by herself. 

629
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,330
It's me. 

630
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,920
So? Did you get your job back? 

631
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,140
Of course! 

632
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,220
Really? That's great! 

633
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,530
I'm out of Seoul with the director. 

634
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,170
I don't think I can come home tonight. 

635
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,940
It's okay. I'll take care of the move. 

636
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,780
You're with the director? 

637
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,670
- Yes.
- Hurry up and hang up. 

638
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,330
It's okay. We can talk. 

639
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,470
No! Remember how you got that job? 

640
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,730
Just work really hard from now on, okay? 

641
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,800
Even if you have to beg, don't get fired. 

642
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,600
But I won't be home for about three days. 

643
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,460
It's okay. Don't come home! 

644
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,090
Even three months is okay, too. 

645
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:09,000
Don't call and suck up to the director. 

646
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,530
That's what I'm doing. 

647
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,210
Don't pretend you're working hard. 

648
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,800
Just do as you're told. 

649
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,130
If he tells you to lick, lick. 

650
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,080
What? 

651
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,570
Lick his feet if you have to, I mean. 

652
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,180
Keeping a job isn't easy! 

653
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,440
Fine. How about tomorrow? 

654
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,300
What about tomorrow? 

655
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,030
Aren't we moving tomorrow? 

656
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,970
As if you ever helped before. 

657
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:35,490
What I want most is for you to make money. 

658
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,750
So don't lose this job, okay? 

659
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,660
Bye. 

660
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,700
Hello? Hell... 

661
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,400
It's always money, money. 

662
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,490
Wow... 

663
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,240
Man... 

664
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,150
Hobak! 

665
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,530
Scrooge. How can we move by ourselves? 

666
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,940
There isn't much. 

667
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,050
You have to pay me. 

668
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,220
I'll buy you black bean noodles. 

669
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,410
Plus sweet and sour pork. 

670
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,210
Where's goof-off? 

671
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,760
He's on a three day business trip. 

672
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,050
How long is he going to keep that job? 

673
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,920
Traitor. 

674
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,460
Don't be like that. 

675
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,810
You're single but he has a family. 

676
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,260
He has to make money. 

677
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,320
Ugh! Stop arguing and start working! 

678
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,850
Be careful. 

679
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,040
Oh! 

680
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,740
Out of my way! 

681
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,050
Be careful. 

682
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,510
- Hey, hey!
- Ugh, uncle! 

683
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,300
- Careful, careful.
- Where is this going? 

684
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,270
- This way, this way.
- Uncle, a step! 

685
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:07,110
Be careful!
No! This was expensive. 

686
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,970
- Why aren't you lifting?
- Ugh, uncle! 

687
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,310
Try this on. 

688
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,880
Me? 

689
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,530
Oh... 

690
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,770
What are you doing?
That has wheels. 

691
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,190
They are all yours. 

692
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,070
Excuse me? 

693
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,070
I hate monotony. 

694
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,960
Change your suits often.
Do it for me. 

695
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,080
She's coming. 

696
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:56,250
- Hi! It's been so long.
- Hello. 

697
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,570
I'm the last one. 

698
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:03,110
I took a cab because my car's being fixed. 

699
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:07,390
I had a little accident coming out of the department store last week. 

700
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:10,910
They offered a rental car but I said no. 

701
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,470
Let's order.
What would you like? 

702
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:18,410
Should we have a big lunch? 

703
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,570
Let's keep it simple. 

704
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:21,640
Why? 

705
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,050
Uh... 

706
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,800
This looks good.
It's a lunch course. 

707
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,340
Let's order something cheap. 

708
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,220
Your husband must be having a hard time as a delivery man. 

709
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,270
I heard you moved into a basement efficiency. 

710
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,910
You should save money when you can. 

711
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,420
I didn't tell them.
They already knew. 

712
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,030
It's all over town.
Be honest. 

713
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,860
What is? 

714
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,950
Secrets don't exist. 

715
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,580
I heard you lost your house, car, your handbags and clothes. 

716
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,310
All you have left is that handbag. 

717
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,920
I heard they let you have it out of pity. 

718
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,200
Isn't this a small world? 

719
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,650
My relative was the collection agent. 

720
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,120
No way.
Why would people say that? 

721
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,760
Why would people make up stuff? 

722
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,260
Sometimes they do. 

723
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,580
Order whatever you like. My treat. 

724
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,690
We can't let you treat us. 

725
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:21,480
And let's pick a new manager. 

726
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,940
What do you mean? 

727
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,190
I still have 4 more months. 

728
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,170
Your hands must be full with the girls. 

729
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,890
You can't take care of the money. 

730
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:32,550
Right. 

731
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,930
You think I'm going to dip into our account? 

732
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:36,930
It's not that. 

733
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,270
To be honest, I couldn't be sure. 

734
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,630
If there's money, I'd use it. 

735
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,210
Even if it's someone else's money. 

736
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,920
Hand over the money and the book. 

737
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,760
It's better to be safe than sorry. 

738
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:50,760
Hey! 

739
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,060
I can't believe what you just said! 

740
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,550
Who here hasn't benefited from me? 

741
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,180
You'd all run over whenever I called and tried to kiss up. 

742
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,610
And now look at you! 

743
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,770
I'll spend the membership fees? Me? 

744
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,950
I was in the Miss Korea pageant! 

745
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:17,070
You were all my minions before. 

746
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:19,450
How dare you? 

747
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:24,110
You think I'd take your money? 

748
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:25,890
Crazy. 

749
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,400
I can't believe I thought of you as friends. 

750
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,560
Here! 

751
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,560
Take them! 

752
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,210
You disloyal bitches. 

753
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,370
[Apartment Purchase Contract] 

754
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:39,420
There, there.
No, a little to the right. 

755
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,120
Oh, does this have to go here? 

756
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,480
It's beautiful. 

757
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,630
Beautiful my butt. 

758
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,180
My arms are killing me.
Hurry up. 

759
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,280
There, there!
A little lower. 

760
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,260
Like this? Good? 

761
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,100
Okay. 

762
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,250
Don't move. Let me mark it. 

763
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,250
How's Hobak's move going? 

764
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,780
I'm sure they're doing fine. 

765
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,430
You didn't go?
Where are you? 

766
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,020
Uncle and Gwangbak went. 

767
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,390
My back hurts so I can't move anything. 

768
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,100
You should've gone. 

769
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,840
I can't go because of a meeting. 

770
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,010
You should drop by later. 

771
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,580
She's having a house warming party tonight. 

772
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,150
I'll deal with it so don't be concerned. 

773
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,570
As if you ever paid any attention to us. 

774
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,440
Hang up. It's time for my medicine. 

775
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,190
Oh, boy. 

776
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,860
I think you're the only one who has the purchase contract framed and hung. 

777
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,060
Doesn't it look like an artwork? 

778
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,790
And the handwriting is pretty. 

779
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,990
The realtor has beautiful penmanship. 

780
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:43,740
I don't believe this. 

781
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,810
I think we're done.
Let's eat something. 

782
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,290
I'm starving. 

783
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,440
What should we order? 

784
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,610
Hold on. I have to see who to order for. 

785
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,950
Mother, when are you coming? 

786
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:20,230
I'm ordering Chinese food. 

787
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,180
Please come and bring Yeongdal. 

788
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:26,910
Yeongdal has a date? 

789
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,250
With that man she met before? 

790
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,410
Okay. 

791
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,360
She can't come and Yeongdal has a date. 

792
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,680
So it's the three of us, Sintong, Bangtong, grandmother, mom, Hobak. 

793
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,630
Father's at the Office of Education. 

794
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,640
Haebak's at school, Daebak's at the academy. 

795
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,990
That means eight people. 

796
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:48,980
Hobak, take me off the list. 

797
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,610
Why? 

798
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,700
I have plans.
I just remembered. 

799
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:54,550
You should eat!
You did all that work. 

800
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:55,900
It's okay. I have to get going. 

801
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,060
Oh, but you worked so hard. 

802
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,880
Then come visit another time. 

803
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,950
Okay. 

804
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:03,580
- Uncle, I'm leaving.
- Yes, I will. 

805
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,440
Hey, I have to go to work. 

806
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,450
But I'm starving. 

807
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,380
Oh, no! I'm so sorry. 

808
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,350
I'll come another day. 

809
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:11,680
- Bye.
- Oh, boy. 

810
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:13,720
Thank you. 

811
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,350
- Bye, Hobak.
- Bye. 

812
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,000
You're really going to be a dating expert! 

813
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:24,530
Sangnam, I have a problem. 

814
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,150
What is it? 

815
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,940
I'm teaching someone and it's so hard. 

816
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,640
The sixth grader? 

817
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,670
She's 29 years old. 

818
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:34,870
Huh? 

819
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,250
A 29 year old woman is learning from you? 

820
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,660
She's never really dated anyone before. 

821
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,170
She always got dumped. 

822
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,550
I'm trying to teach her how it's done. 

823
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,080
Oh, boy. 

824
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,140
I feel bad for her, whoever she is,
but I'm sure you'll do a great job. 

825
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,050
I'll see you later. 

826
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,120
Where are you going? 

827
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,240
I have a date. 

828
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,760
Be careful of gold diggers! 

829
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:02,140
Yeongdal has a date?
With that man she met before? 

830
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,500
You're going home? 

831
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,910
Daebak's not home, so I'm leaving. 

832
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,500
Goodbye, Gwangbak. 

833
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,820
Uh, Miho, wait. 

834
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,300
What's the problem? 

835
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,770
She says a powerful rival appeared. 

836
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:23,920
Is she pretty? 

837
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,450
She has had a lot of work done. 

838
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,820
She's not naturally pretty. 

839
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,850
It doesn't matter if she's had work done because men love pretty women. 

840
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,610
I know. 

841
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,070
You know how cool men who can park well are? 

842
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,380
You wouldn't know. 

843
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,510
I know about the men who can park well. 

844
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,430
Women just love them. 

845
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:47,800
Especially when they back up real fast with only one hand on the wheel. 

846
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,830
Oh, you could write a book. 

847
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,750
They already have those books. 

848
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,900
Why haven't you read them? 

849
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,620
I know. 

850
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,960
I read useless books and became a teacher. 

851
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,230
Dating is hard. 

852
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:07,070
I can't control my heart,
so how can you control another's heart? 

853
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,230
World domination would be easier. 

854
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:14,140
Dating is a game where the one who loves more loses. 

855
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,630
I think so, too. 

856
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,510
To beat the rival,
you must get to the next stage. 

857
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:20,950
Physical contact. 

858
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,100
Physical contact? 

859
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:22,790
Kissing. 

860
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:25,150
I kiss him first? 

861
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:26,890
No, your friend. 

862
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,210
Oh, right. It's not me. 

863
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,060
Tell my friend to kiss him first? 

864
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,180
No, men don't like forward women. 

865
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:37,200
You must make him want to kiss you. 

866
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,470
How? 

867
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,060
The scary part is over. 

868
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,790
Oh... 

869
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,690
If you can't watch scary movies,
why did you pick this? 

870
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:43,920
It's exciting. 

871
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,390
It feels like I'm losing weight. 

872
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,330
I like your perfume. 

873
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,830
It's my shampoo. 

874
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,350
She has a date. 

875
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,150
It must be going well with that man from the blind date. 

876
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:43,190
Ugh! 

877
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,980
Ouch! Ouch... 

878
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,440
Stop doing stuff like that. 

879
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,170
Hey! Where were you? 

880
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:49,770
My bat's been crying out your name! 

881
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,770
As if I'm not mad enough already. 

882
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,120
What are you doing this weekend? 

883
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,820
I have a business trip to China. 

884
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,460
Is it a long trip? 

885
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,640
About 3 days? 

886
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,750
You want a present, don't you? 

887
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:06,750
Wrong. 

888
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:11,550
But I won't refuse it if you bring me one. 

889
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,830
Can I tell you what I want? 

890
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:13,570
Sure. 

891
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,750
Huh? Me? 

892
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,710
Yes. 

893
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,210
Come back safely. 

894
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:28,210
That'll be the best present. 

895
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,870
Let's hurry up.
I have a curfew. 

896
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,890
You have a curfew?
How old are you? 

897
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:38,900
My mom is really strict because she had to raise me on her own. 

898
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,380
She said a woman must be very careful. 

899
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,950
It used to be 9 but now its 10 pm. 

900
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:49,890
And on special occasions it's midnight. 

901
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,690
And tonight's a special occasion? 

902
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,130
Yes. 

903
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,600
Ugh! That hit the spot. 

904
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,280
Trying to act demure was hard, mom. 

905
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:06,740
Did he fall for you? 

906
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:09,910
I told you.
Nobody can escape from me. 

907
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,900
He'll fall for me hard. 

908
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,270
Oh, I feel bad for him. 

909
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,950
Yeongdal, how do you do it? 

910
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,780
Teach me how you do it. 

911
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,140
But what would you do with that? 

912
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:25,040
Everything you learn will come in handy someday, except for how to rob a house. 

913
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,050
I'm just saying. 

914
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,320
Listen carefully. 

915
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,470
You must use different techniques. 

916
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:33,720
Men in their 20s fall for your looks. 

917
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,090
Men in their 30s fall for your money. 

918
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,800
Men look at women's money? 

919
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:42,080
Then again, it's a difficult time. 

920
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,300
Both women and men are money crazy. 

921
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,460
With him, I can't be money crazy. 

922
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,770
I must pretend to be humble and naive. 

923
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,740
It's my dream to become a good wife. 

924
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,080
And that works? 

925
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:02,240
Oh, well, a rich man wouldn't need to make his wife work. 

926
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,570
I'm answering my own question. 

927
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,910
Oh, I can't drink. 

928
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:12,720
It's my first time. 

929
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,890
I have a curfew, so I must go home. 

930
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,020
My mom is very strict. 

931
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,560
This is what I do. 

932
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:24,660
You got awful grades at school,
but you're really good at things like this. 

933
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,570
It's because you took after me. 

934
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,310
Oh, he's going on a business trip. 

935
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,330
Did you ask him to bring a present? 

936
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,670
That's what the dumb girls do. 

937
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:37,990
I'm different. 

938
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,100
Have a safe trip. 

939
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,160
That'll be the best present. 

940
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:46,760
Oh, you're crafty. 

941
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:51,090
Dumb girls get greedy about little things and end up losing what's important. 

942
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:54,100
You have to look ahead.
Way ahead. 

943
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,540
Way into the future so I can milk him. 

944
00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:00,130
Oh, you're such a smart girl! 

945
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:01,990
Why do you think I dated all those men? 

946
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:04,640
I learned how to pick the best man. 

947
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,290
Experience is knowledge. 

948
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:07,650
Just wait, mom. 

949
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,480
He'll buy me a luxury brand handbag and propose to me in a month. 

950
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,890
Please make that happen. 

951
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,380
Don't be sad about not moving with Sedal. 

952
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:23,090
I'll make sure we live in a great big house. 

953
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,060
Just hearing that makes me happy. 

954
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,180
Find a good husband. 

955
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,840
I'm going to crush Anggeum. 

956
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,770
Though she's halfway there already. 

957
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,770
Oh... 

958
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,580
Mom, can't we eat first? 

959
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,420
Hold on. 

960
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,420
Grandmother, great grandmother and aunt are coming. 

961
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,190
Oh... This is torture. 

962
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,200
Slow down.
You'll get a stomachache. 

963
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,970
Mom, it's good even when it's soggy. 

964
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,480
Mom, you eat too. 

965
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:45,870
I'll eat later with your grandmother. 

966
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,710
Mom, can I have just one piece of pork? 

967
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,580
You shouldn't touch it before the adults eat. 

968
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,720
Just one! 

969
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,780
We should be grateful about the noodles. 

970
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:05,200
This is nuts. 

971
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,400
The only time I ate out was when I had black bean noodles on my painful anniversary. 

972
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:11,890
Painful anniversary? 

973
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:13,890
Yes. 

974
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:17,600
Painful days come right after your wedding. 

975
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,550
Only those who've done it can understand. 

976
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:23,870
My wife would go nuts if she came here. 

977
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:29,420
This is like straight out of a movie. 

978
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,520
I'm the male star and you are... 

979
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,480
Enough. 

980
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:34,720
- Let's drink.
- Okay. 

981
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,380
Sintong!  

982
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:14,380
Bangtong! 

983
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,340
Sintong, wake up. Wake up. 

984
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,210
Bangtong, have some sweet and sour pork. 

985
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,960
Get up and eat sweet and sour pork. 

986
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:39,010
Eat. You said you wanted it. Eat. 

987
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,470
It doesn't taste good. 

988
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,690
Why didn't you give it to us before? 

989
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:44,840
Mom, I'm full. 

990
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:47,290
I'm sleepy. 

991
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,460
Go to bed. 

992
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:55,300
Wow... 

993
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,740
Dad, I told you to leave me alone. 

994
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:11,060
What am I supposed to do with a man who hasn't called me since I came back? 

995
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:14,400
It's over between us! 

996
01:02:44,570 --> 01:03:09,800
Subtitles by KBS World 

997
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:12,810
What are you doing here?
To say goodbye? 

998
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:15,450
I've been waiting here for an hour. 

999
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:17,620
Incredible. I'm touched. 

1000
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:19,740
Please come with us. 

1001
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:21,050
Check what? 

1002
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:24,240
Oh, that woman must be crazy. 

1003
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:27,410
Do you know her? 

1004
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:28,300
No way. 

1005
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,450
Say you're sorry about treating me differently! 

1006
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:33,020
How could you say that? 

1007
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:35,750
That's what I get for raising you? 

1008
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:37,750
Come out. 

1009
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,420
Why can't you see how I feel? Why?
