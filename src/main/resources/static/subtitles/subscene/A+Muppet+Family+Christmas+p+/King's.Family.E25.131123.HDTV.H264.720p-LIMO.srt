2
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,190
You pulled a ligament.

3
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,760
And the tendons around it are swollen.

4
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,090
What's wrong with your arm?

5
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,240
I said what's wrong?

6
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,000
I fell and I pulled a ligament.

7
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,900
Why would you fall down like that? Huh?

8
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,240
Don't you watch where you're going?

9
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,270
What have you been up to these days?

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,100
Are you writing anything?

11
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,440
After you quit your teaching job,

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,930
you look really bad!

13
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,630
Why are you adding to my misery?

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,460
What am I supposed to do with you?

15
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,760
Just leave me alone, please.

16
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,770
What?

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,670
What do you know about me?

18
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,960
You don't care if I died!

19
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,030
You just want me to make lots of money!

20
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:32,170
All you care about is a daughter you can brag about to other people!

21
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,990
You don't care about me.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,960
You just want me to be successful so you can brag!

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,870
How dare you!

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,960
You're acting like this over a man?

25
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,370
Ugh! Seriously!

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,990
Where did you get those from?

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,900
I wanted you to eat them before going on your business trip.

28
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,460
You love pancakes.

29
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,240
I love the ones you make.

30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,740
I'm too weak and I've lost my touch,

31
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,300
so I can't make them like I used to.

32
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,370
There's a place that makes old style pancakes.

33
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,170
Did you have lunch?

34
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,600
Yes, I did.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,370
No, you didn't! 

36
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,060
Your face looks gaunt.

37
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,430
Bong,

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,490
you're upset with your children and wife.

39
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,590
But don't be.

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,960
They'll live according to their destiny.

41
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,490
Try some.

42
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,370
Okay. You eat, too.

43
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,400
I had lunch at the senior center.

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,400
Mmm, it's good.

45
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,930
Mother.

46
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,190
Seeing you like this...
You've gotten so old.

47
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,800
Me?

48
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,870
I didn't know it at home,

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,200
but here, you look like a grandfather.

50
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,570
I'm not. I look younger than my friends.

51
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,430
People would think you're my husband.

52
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,500
Don't worry.
I'm as strong as a horse.

53
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,030
Mother.

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,400
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

55
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,660
I shouldn't starve myself.

56
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,560
It's not like anyone cares.

57
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,270
I should just die!
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

58
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,900
Is anyone home?

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,840
What are you doing?

60
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,270
I took some medicine.

61
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,900
Did you eat?

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,490
I didn't.

63
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,200
I haven't eaten anything in days.

64
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,270
There's rice stuck to your lips.

65
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,900
Did you eat mixed rice?
I see chili paste.

66
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,400
You shouldn't lie.

67
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,870
If you ate something, just say so.

68
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,660
Why would you lie about that?

69
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,170
I'm coming from Bong's school,

70
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,790
and oh, seeing him outside the house,

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,460
he looked old enough to be my husband.

72
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,960
This is all your fault.

73
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,030
Bong getting wrinkles is my fault?

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:05,270
You lost control of your daughters and that stressed my son out, making him old!

75
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,840
I can't believe my ears!

76
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,940
Time goes by and people get old.

77
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,440
You should feel sorry for your husband.

78
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,840
You'll know what I mean when you lose him,

79
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,940
and people start treating you differently.

80
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,140
Your children respect you because of him.

81
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,140
But what if he's gone?

82
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,030
They'll treat you like nothing.

83
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,660
Without your husband, you're nothing,

84
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,960
so be good to him.

85
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,090
When I die, your son will be nothing, too.

86
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,440
If I starve, it's my loss.

87
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,070
Nobody understands me.

88
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,490
Sangnam!

89
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,800
I know we're both men, so I shouldn't say this,

90
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,660
but I just have to say one thing.

91
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,770
My sister

92
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,370
is sick.

93
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,770
Maybe you've been with many women,

94
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,400
but my sister...

95
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,400
For her, you're the first man!

96
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,800
She's not pretty and she's ill tempered,

97
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,770
but she's a very good sister.

98
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,500
Why would you make her cry?

99
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,340
You should've never let go of her!

100
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,790
A real man must protect the woman he loves!

101
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,860
Oh!

102
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,160
Good shot!

103
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,900
What was that?

104
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,900
It's hard. This is really hard.

105
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,070
Hello.

106
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,340
We have specially priced items.

107
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,340
If you need help, let me know.

108
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,960
This winter is going to be especially cold, and

109
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,960
this coat is warm but extremely light weight.

110
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,640
Would you like to try it on?

111
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,630
Oh! Oh! Oh!

112
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,030
Ugh!

113
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm home!

114
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,860
- Hobak!
- Yes!

115
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,290
You won't even come out and say hi?

116
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,390
I was busy cleaning.

117
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,990
How was your day?

118
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,090
Oh!

119
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,460
Mom, look. Hobak must have cleaned the room.

120
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,540
She has to. I'm her mother in law.

121
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,400
I have something to say to the both of you.

122
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,070
What is it?

123
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,840
Have some.

124
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,460
Mother, how's your shop going?

125
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,700
Very well. We'll pay back the loan soon.

126
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,840
- Whoa!
- There's nothing I can't do.

127
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,230
I heard I won't ever run out of money.

128
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,490
I know.

129
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,590
Can you bring me some samples?

130
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,840
I heard it's good, so I want to try it.

131
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,440
I can't! They're for the customers.

132
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,640
You should buy them.
You make money.

133
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,630
I've never seen you buy and skin care products.

134
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,530
Cosmetic companies will go bankrupt if everyone was like you.

135
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,240
And beauty salons, too.

136
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,860
After using the samples,

137
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,590
I was going to buy some.

138
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,260
I'm dressing up more now.

139
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,940
You have changed since you've become manger.

140
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,040
But you still have a long way to go.

141
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,840
It does matter how you take care of yourself.

142
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,130
Now that I handle customer service,

143
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,530
I must make a good impression.

144
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,000
You just wanted to ask for samples?

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,070
No.

146
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,740
I'd like to divide the chores up.

147
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,630
What?

148
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,360
I have a full time job, and I have kids,

149
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,940
so I was hoping you could help.

150
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,230
You're not the only one who works!

151
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,700
I know.

152
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,840
All three of us work and are busy,

153
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,590
so let's help each other out.

154
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,540
We live together now, and if things don't

155
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,640
work out, we'll end up hating each other.

156
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,460
As you know, my mom suffered a lot

157
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,990
because of my aunts and my grandmother.

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,460
They're still not on good terms,

159
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,130
and I don't want that to happen here.

160
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,160
So let's try to be considerate.

161
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,960
How do you want us to be considerate?

162
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,440
First of all, I'll do all the cooking.

163
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,260
But if you cook something special sometimes, that'd be nice, too.

164
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,860
Who will do the grocery shopping?

165
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,160
I joined the bundle program.

166
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,500
What's that?

167
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,860
Farmers send you the things they grow once a week.

168
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,990
Every week it's something different, and it's fresh.

169
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
I joined it after I moved here,

170
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,940
and it's convenient.

171
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,730
How about the dishes?

172
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,260
When you eat something, you should do it.

173
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,530
You two can do the laundry and cleaning.

174
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,590
Yeongdal, you clean the bathroom.

175
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,590
Me?

176
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,300
Or mother, you can do it.

177
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,590
Oh, man...

178
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,370
I finally went out to the field!

179
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,570
But I didn't do as well as I expected.

180
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,900
I was really good at the range.

181
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,460
That's normal.

182
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,860
What did your wife say?

183
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,630
Nothing. People around her say stuff, though.

184
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,130
Her family?

185
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,390
Yes.

186
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:02,170
It would've been so wonderful if you'd met me before getting married.

187
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,840
Oh, I'm craving for something spicy.

188
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,960
Don't you have anything different?

189
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,290
Spicy? Like what?

190
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,000
Something salty and savory.

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,340
Like kimchi or...

192
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,890
I don't eat kimchi. It's not classy.

193
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,490
Korean men are weird.

194
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,700
They have to have food like that.

195
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,800
I didn't eat kimchi before.

196
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,170
Don't underestimate me.

197
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,190
Have you thought about it?

198
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,730
Is it a sure thing?

199
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,940
You think I'd lie?

200
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:11,030
You'll turn a hundred thousand to two in a month?

201
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,340
Yes.

202
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,460
Oh...

203
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,840
I would love to do it.

204
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,570
I told you how to do it.

205
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,700
I'm scared.

206
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,440
It's not easy to make a hundred thousand.

207
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,270
You can give your father ten thousand.

208
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,990
That'll make your father very happy.

209
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,090
If it goes wrong, he'll kill me.

210
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,390
And I have younger siblings.

211
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,590
Forget it, then.
I was being considerate.

212
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,760
Let's go.

213
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,890
So it's a sure thing?

214
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,890
If the others found out, they'd kill me.

215
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,990
I'm letting you in behind their backs.

216
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,940
We never take investments that small.

217
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,570
It's always in millions.
You know that.

218
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,300
I do, but still...

219
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,790
Should we go on a trip?

220
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,160
When?

221
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,440
To where?

222
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,340
Soon.

223
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,360
You pick where to go.

224
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,200
I want some time off to clear my head.

225
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,340
You've set fire to my heart.

226
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,040
Ugh.

227
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,590
Ugh.

228
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,240
Nice. Nice and roomy.

229
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,530
This is so nice.

230
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,940
What are you doing up?

231
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,760
What about you, mother?

232
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,360
I can't sleep because Bong's not home.

233
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,400
Oh, I wonder if he's in bed and if the room's warm enough.

234
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,590
I'm sure he's sleeping really well

235
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,230
at a very nice hotel with a plush bed.

236
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,570
You can't sleep because you miss him!

237
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,800
I can't believe my ears.

238
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,590
With my nagging husband gone,

239
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,940
I feel as free as a bird.

240
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,770
It's freedom for me.

241
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,090
It must be nice to have all that room.

242
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,440
Oh, of course!

243
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,340
I have lots of room to roll around.

244
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,990
And I don't have to get up early and cook.

245
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,730
Good night.

246
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,840
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

247
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,730
Let's see...

248
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,730
Oh, he was so young back then.

249
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,590
He looks younger than me in this picture.

250
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,540
He looked so old and wrinkled.

251
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,570
He could pass as my husband.

252
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,190
You've gotten really old, honey.

253
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,590
It's your fault, did you know?

254
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,300
Then who made me this old?

255
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,540
This is our 100 day anniversary.

256
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,440
Honey!

257
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,940
You're the best!

258
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,270
Let's love each other forever.

259
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,340
Forever my butt.

260
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,840
Leave her alone. She's drunk.

261
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,240
You think it'll last forever, don't you?

262
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,140
Dream on!

263
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,390
Don't trust men.

264
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,990
There is no such thing as love!

265
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,590
What's wrong with you?
How rude!

266
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,630
Leave her be.

267
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,660
Let me go.

268
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,770
Hey, it looks like you got dumped.

269
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,940
You look really pathetic.

270
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,860
What?

271
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,730
Pathetic?

272
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,540
Hey!

273
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,440
I can't believe this.

274
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,260
So? What are you going to do about it?

275
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,340
I just feel really sorry for you both.

276
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,540
You're crazy!

277
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,670
This is why you got dumped!

278
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,530
Yes! I was! I was!

279
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,500
I got dumped. So what?

280
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,200
I'm as miserable as can be. So what?

281
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,340
Oh, Gwangbak, let's go.

282
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,930
Hey, pull yourself together!

283
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,660
Your boyfriend's here.

284
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,760
I'm not her boyfriend.

285
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,500
How awful.

286
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,790
How dare you...

287
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,000
Love is difficult.

288
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,140
Hey, ugh...

289
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,930
Ugh! Man...

290
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,630
Uncle, she hasn't been eating.

291
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,000
It's because this was her first love.

292
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,940
Haebak, you should practice dating.

293
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,360
When you go to college, start dating.

294
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,040
She's suffering from love sickness.

295
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,470
What do we do, uncle?

296
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,440
This is love sickness?

297
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,360
I know what it is.

298
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,840
- Father.
- Yes?

299
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,500
Minsuk will be here soon.

300
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,400
It's a very busy day for me.

301
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
It's Tuesday.

302
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,940
You should go.

303
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,160
But you didn't get any sleep.

304
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,070
I took a nap when you were asleep.

305
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,470
You should sleep a little more.

306
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,500
I really like the caregiver.

307
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,270
Where did you find such a nice person?

308
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,570
You like her?

309
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,160
Yes, and she's considerate.

310
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,960
She's a great cook, too.

311
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,600
She's perfect in every way.

312
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,530
Has she done that for a long time?

313
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,570
I think so.

314
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,660
I'm glad you like her.

315
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,660
But,

316
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,030
if she comes every day,

317
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,670
it would be expensive.

318
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,430
Don't worry about it.
Just get well.

319
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,160
Minjung.

320
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,000
Yes, uncle?

321
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,640
Can we talk?

322
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,240
Love sickness?

323
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,940
What else could it be?

324
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,300
What do we do?

325
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,130
Why are you asking me?

326
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,460
Is there anything we can do?

327
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,300
This just might end up killing Gwangbak.

328
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,300
Did you sleep well?

329
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,090
I didn't. Ugh...

330
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,540
Where's Subak?

331
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,700
She must be sleeping in her room.

332
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,840
But she's not there.

333
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,130
Where else could she be?

334
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,190
I don't think Subak came home last night.

335
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,240
Why would you say that?

336
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,740
She's sleeping in my room.

337
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,240
She slept with me last night.

338
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,940
I didn't see her.
I was up pretty late.

339
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,690
She came home really, really late.

340
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,690
You don't know anything.

341
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,930
What? What? What are you doing?

342
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,090
I have to ask her something.

343
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,130
Ask her later.

344
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,800
Do you have to wake her up?

345
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,590
She got home really late.

346
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,300
You can call her later and ask.

347
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,890
Why are you coming home now?

348
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,300
I told you I left really late.

349
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,570
Shh!

350
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,590
Say you came home really late last night.

351
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,430
If your father finds out, he'll be furious.

352
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,090
Minjung came home early in the morning.

353
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,690
Why didn't he go to work from the hospital?

354
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,430
He came to change before going to work.

355
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,930
I told him you were asleep.

356
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,960
Don't tell him what really happened.

357
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,040
I wasn't out partying. I was working.

358
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,730
Sunjeong.

359
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,430
Yes?

360
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,340
Tell Sangnam I found a woman for him.

361
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,570
Okay. I'll meet her.

362
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,540
Huh?

363
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,840
Sunjeong!

364
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,670
- Sunjeong. 
- Minsuk!

365
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,260
Sunjeong! Sunjeong!

366
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,300
Minjung told me about you.

367
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,440
He said he ran into you making deliveries.

368
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,430
Yes.

369
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,790
This was meant to be.

370
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,860
You look the same.

371
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,590
You do, too.

372
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,570
I've grown old.

373
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,940
It's all in the past,

374
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,530
but after you left him,

375
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,590
he was totally messed up.

376
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,190
I thought he was going to die.

377
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,430
He might have done something stupid

378
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,890
if it weren't for our parents.

379
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,570
But after a year, he started working hard.

380
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,930
He was lucky and he became successful.

381
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,660
What if you waited for him?

382
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,690
We used to talk about you a lot.

383
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,360
Mom and father never met you,

384
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,730
but they talked a lot about you.

385
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,240
People started introducing women to him,

386
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,860
and he married Subak 3 months after meeting her.

387
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,390
I thought he was rushing in,

388
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,190
and it was because of you.

389
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,430
He was trying to forget you.

390
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,040
But he's not happily married.

391
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,590
I'm telling you this because I trust you,

392
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,960
but Minjung married the wrong woman.

393
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,500
She looked pretty in the picture.

394
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,140
Who cares about looks?
She's not nice.

395
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,730
She's never done anything for my parents.

396
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,800
She's never once cooked them a warm meal.

397
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,200
He has no control over his wife.

398
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,030
He's a kind soul.

399
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,990
He's not. He's stupid.

400
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,590
You should've married him.

401
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,090
He'll get mad if he finds out I told you this.

402
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,840
It's a secret.

403
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,000
Anyway, Sunjeong, thank you so much.

404
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,970
I owe you one.

405
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,370
I'm paying back for my past mistakes.

406
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,800
I know it's not enough.

407
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,930
I'm doing it so I can feel better.

408
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,690
It'll double in a month. Double.

409
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,090
Invest a hundred thousand.

410
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,190
I'll double it to two hundred thousand.

411
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,160
Mom!

412
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,800
Mom!

413
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,570
What are you doing?

414
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,390
Huh?

415
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,260
What are you searching for?

416
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,440
Oh,

417
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,340
have you seen Aeji's red sweater?

418
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,740
She wants it.

419
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,870
Aeji's clothes are in your room, not here.

420
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,000
I only have Jungji's clothes.

421
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,340
Right. I forgot.

422
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,340
Ugh.

423
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,590
Mom, you're not going to the market?

424
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,930
I'm not.

425
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,490
Go to the sauna, then. I'll pay for it.

426
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,160
I'm too tired for it.

427
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,190
I'll boil them,

428
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,860
so you go to the sauna and relax.

429
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,860
You've been really tired lately.

430
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,160
And father's been stressing you out.

431
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,630
I don't feel like it.

432
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,990
This is how you get old!
Don't be like this.

433
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,400
You have to live until I send you on a cruise.

434
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,540
Whatever.

435
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,130
I'm never going on a cruise.

436
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,360
You will!

437
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,540
Mom, go and meet your friends.

438
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,540
You haven't seen them lately.

439
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,440
Go singing with them or something.

440
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,430
I can't sing when I'm depressed.

441
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,000
What's wrong with you?
I'm too tired.

442
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,970
I want to make you feel better.

443
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,230
Yes, it's me.

444
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,570
What?

445
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,930
How did it happen?

446
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,630
That is so tragic.

447
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,070
Right now?

448
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,770
You want to go now?

449
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,700
Okay.

450
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,130
Mom, are you going somewhere?

451
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,190
Someone died and I have to go to the funeral.

452
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,430
Oh, right now?

453
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,840
Didn't you hear me right?

454
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,890
Someone died and I'm going to the funeral.

455
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,960
Oh!

456
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,040
I think I heard wrong.

457
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,700
Mom, I'll do this, so go get dressed up.

458
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,890
I can't get dressed up for a funeral.

459
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,030
Oh, what's wrong with me?

460
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,590
I keep saying stupid things.

461
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,630
Call your boss. Say you can't come to work.

462
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,990
Don't worry about that.

463
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,270
I should take care of the kids.

464
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,400
Take the laundry in later.

465
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,590
Okay. Don't worry.

466
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,130
Take good care of Jungji.

467
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,340
I said don't worry.

468
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,040
I'll be back.

469
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,070
Life is so futile.

470
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,200
Nobody knows when he or she will die.

471
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,800
Mom, see you later.

472
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,200
Oh, honey...

473
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,460
How am I supposed to live...

474
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:19,000
How could you leave me like this...

475
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,770
Father...

476
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,540
I should've been better to you...

477
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:28,000
I should've stopped nagging...

478
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,740
I'm sorry.

479
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:37,400
Honey, I'm so sorry...

480
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,890
I'm sorry...

481
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,590
I can't go on...

482
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,960
How can I go on alone?

483
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,740
Calm down, calm down.

484
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,840
Who am I going to talk to now?

485
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:03,340
How could you leave me just like that?

486
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,930
Why wasn't I better to you?

487
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,660
Mother! Mother!

488
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,530
What are you doing? 
Bring some water!

489
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,040
This could happen to anyone.

490
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,130
He died from a heart attack.

491
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,990
How sad...

492
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,140
Her husband retired.

493
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,070
I think he was forced to retire early,

494
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,500
and she was really mean to him for that.

495
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,670
Right. She didn't even cook for him.

496
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,890
They slept in separate rooms, too.

497
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,490
But she must feel really guilty now.

498
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,000
She might be bawling now, but she'll recover.

499
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,900
I feel sorry for the dead.

500
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,460
Right. Look at me.

501
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,370
When my husband died,

502
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,730
I thought I'd die too, but I'm alive.

503
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,500
My husband must be tired of waiting.

504
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,740
You can't die.
You have children.

505
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,370
But they can't beat having a husband.

506
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,840
Even if he's bed bound, he's the best.

507
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,190
- Right.
- Yes.

508
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,660
No husband, no respect from your kids.

509
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,900
I envy you the most, Anggeum.

510
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,190
Our husbands are all old and retired,

511
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,090
but your husband is still a vice principal.

512
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,890
What's the use of saying I should've?

513
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,540
I should've been better and stopped nagging.

514
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,300
If you still have husbands,\

515
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,090
treat them well, instead of regretting later.

516
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,300
Right, right.

517
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,940
I'm going to start being good to my husband today.

518
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,990
Let's go.

519
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,670
I have to make dinner for my husband.

520
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:45,260
Since I'm single, I should go to work.

521
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,200
Anggeum, let's go.

522
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,990
Oh, my!

523
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,840
Oh, seriously...

524
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,800
Haebak called us, saying you might die.

525
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,460
Was he a two timer?

526
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,770
No, that was a misunderstanding.

527
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,430
Stop working here.

528
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,800
You can't even eat, so how can you work?

529
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,970
When I'm here, I can forget.

530
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,800
I can't stay home.

531
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,070
I keep checking my phone all day.

532
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,200
Waiting for him to call me.

533
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,700
I keep deleting and saving his number.

534
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,570
And I keep checking the phone again.

535
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,930
It's driving me crazy.

536
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,140
Oh, boy.

537
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,840
I don't know what to say.

538
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,860
Trying to console someone is the hardest.

539
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,800
You should get plastic surgery.

540
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,160
What?

541
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,160
Why?

542
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,340
After you get surgery,

543
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,530
you'll be swollen and stuck in your room.

544
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,960
You'd be horrified about getting calls.

545
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,600
It happened to me once.

546
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,900
I forgot about men and looked in the mirror.

547
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,270
That makes sense.

548
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,800
Tell her something she can actually do.

549
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,700
I'm just frustrated. That's why.

550
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,000
Then you should convince father.

551
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,160
I'm sure she couldn't even try because mom and father fought over my issues.

552
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,930
Love causes all kinds of trouble.

553
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,390
Don't worry. I won't die.

554
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,090
I'll try to beat this.

555
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:53,070
You need time.

556
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,700
You two could run away together.

557
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,340
This isn't the Joseon Dynasty.

558
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,340
Who breaks up because of their parents?

559
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,990
He's pretty awful.

560
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,690
He broke up with you over that?

561
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,070
Did you really break up with Gwangbak?

562
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,590
How could you give up so easily?

563
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,900
I was so frustrated, so I called you.

564
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,390
Gwangbak can't even eat.

565
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,590
She's a kind and innocent soul.

566
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:50,440
You can't just leave a woman like that.

567
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,860
I've lived longer than you,

568
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,900
and meeting the perfect mate isn't easy.

569
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,990
You think you'll find another one? No.

570
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,370
If someone feels right,

571
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,260
don't let go of her.

572
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,300
If I could've, I would've a thousand times.

573
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,970
I would've done everything I could.

574
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,040
I would've begged her parents to say yes,

575
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,640
but this isn't something I can change.

576
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,740
It's about my education and family.

577
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,890
I didn't want to make things hard for her.

578
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:48,190
Oh, you're a good boy!

579
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,070
You're such a good boy.

580
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,600
Where are you going?

581
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,840
Grandma, grandma.

582
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,660
Let's see how yummy this is.

583
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,030
Is it you, honey?

584
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,970
It's your honey's little brother.

585
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,540
Why are you out here?

586
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,570
I was just taking out the trash.

587
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,040
Mother, I'm home.

588
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,630
Oh, you are!

589
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,400
How was your trip?

590
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,890
- Grandma, hello.
- Hi.

591
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,360
Good. How have you been?

592
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,800
I missed you so much that I almost got sick.

593
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,600
I don't think I can live without you.

594
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,040
I can't either, mother.

595
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,190
You must be really happy to see him.

596
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,540
- Father, you're back.
- Hello.

597
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,990
Yes.

598
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,530
- Let me have that.
- Okay.

599
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:05,300
Why don't you say hi?
You waited for him.

600
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,570
I didn't wait for anyone!

601
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,760
You cooked all these for father.

602
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:13,160
I cooked for everyone, not just your father.

603
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,090
Oh, it's a feast.

604
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,070
This is better than my husband's ancestral rites feast.

605
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,530
You only care about your husband, don't you?

606
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,760
I didn't cook all these just for my husband.

607
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,090
Father,

608
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,240
mom was outside the door waiting for you.

609
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,340
I wasn't!

610
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,390
I saw her waiting for you, too.

611
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,030
She didn't sleep last night,

612
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,660
saying she missed you.

613
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,490
Why would you all say such a thing?

614
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,570
Did you miss me that much?

615
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,840
I can't believe my ears.

616
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,890
- Mother.
- Yes?

617
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,840
It was so nice I didn't want to come home.

618
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:55,160
I came back because of you.

619
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,570
I don't believe a word of that.

620
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:04,900
A wife came back from her class reunion all annoyed, so her husband asked her.

621
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,570
What's wrong?

622
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,370
Did your friend bring a new luxury bag? No.

623
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,000
Are you jealous of someone's son? No.

624
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,730
Then did someone come in an imported car? No.

625
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,870
So why are you acting this way, he asked.

626
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,940
Oh, I'm the only one with a husband! Right?

627
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,660
They don't know what they're talking about.

628
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,970
But it's nice to hear you both laugh.

629
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,070
The mood was icy the last couple of days.

630
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,970
The most important people in this family are Bong and Anggeum, understand?

631
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,390
Where's Gwangbak?

632
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,970
She went to the library.

633
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,270
Father, about Gwangbak...

634
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,860
Let's not talk about her.

635
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,770
Subak, what's going on?

636
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,190
- What do you mean?
- A woman for Don.

637
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,000
Stop putting it off,

638
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,960
and just find someone already.

639
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,740
All my friends have girlfriends.

640
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,340
What?

641
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,370
Half the kids have girlfriends.

642
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,040
Ugh...

643
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,260
The school should provide sex education.

644
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:20,390
Not just about eggs and sperms,
 but about how to use condoms and stuff.

645
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,640
Thank you for dinner.

646
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,870
I'm shocked.

647
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,700
That's nothing.

648
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,930
Father, Daebak's right.

649
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,590
The school should provide real sex education.

650
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,840
Kinds these days are so precocious.

651
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,300
I actually agree with you.

652
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,740
Did you think about what you did?

653
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,440
You should think about what you did.

654
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,370
Was it nice sleeping alone?

655
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,340
Of course.

656
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,930
I rolled around the room all night.

657
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,630
What are you doing?

658
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,240
What happened to you during the trip?

659
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,370
Be still.

660
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,770
Man.

661
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,000
I was really harsh, wasn't I?

662
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:18,030
I said awful things out of anger.

663
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,430
I'm sorry.

664
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,630
I must be getting old.

665
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,470
Little things seem to bother me greatly.

666
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,490
We're both getting old.

667
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,570
It's the same for me, too.

668
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,490
It's hard to age gracefully.

669
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,990
I keep getting meaner,

670
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,070
and everything is getting rough.

671
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,370
My hands are getting rough,

672
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,040
and even my words are getting rough.

673
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,360
Oh, right!

674
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,440
The grain shop woman's husband died.

675
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,690
But he's not even 70 yet.

676
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,770
I know.

677
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,360
I went to the funeral and it felt weird.

678
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,200
Why?

679
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,500
Are you afraid of becoming a widow?

680
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,490
Not afraid. I was jealous.

681
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,760
No making breakfast, no nagging.

682
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,030
I was so jealous of her.

683
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,130
Oh, where are you going?

684
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,690
I'm going on another business trip.

685
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,570
You're not going anywhere!

686
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,590
Oh, boy.

687
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,930
Coming back from the funeral,

688
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,860
I felt really weird.

689
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,340
Who will be by my side at the end of my life?

690
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,200
Who will massage my aching body

691
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,600
and bring me a glass of water?

692
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,230
You have to live a long life.

693
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,070
You can nag me all you want,

694
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,190
but stay by my side for a long time.

695
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,890
The person you have called is unavailable,

696
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,260
so you will be connected to voice mail.

697
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:39,900
Sedal, I need to talk to you, so call me.

698
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,090
It's not going to be bad, so call me.

699
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,840
It's me.

700
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,660
Oh, yes, yes.

701
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,800
Can you come and meet me?

702
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:01,990
I have a few conditions.

703
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,660
Conditions?

704
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,430
Tell me.

705
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,760
It can't be anywhere secluded.

706
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:13,840
Not like the riverbank, like last time.

707
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,970
I want to meet somewhere crowded.

708
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:23,130
And don't bring Loser or a baseball bat.

709
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,840
I'll see you there, then.

710
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,590
Okay.

711
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,240
Sedal, I'm glad you came.

712
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,990
Where's Loser?

713
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,160
I didn't bring him.

714
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,130
And I didn't bring a bat.

715
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,500
Sit.

716
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,890
Make yourself comfortable.

717
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,760
I won't beat you.

718
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:18,130
I didn't ask you here to beat you up.

719
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,470
Really?

720
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,260
- Sedal.
- What are you doing?

721
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,260
You said you won't beat me.

722
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,230
I won't.

723
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,770
Sit, sit.

724
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,430
What would you like to drink?

725
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,140
I'll pick something later.

726
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,070
I'd like to talk first.

727
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,160
I'm sorry about before.

728
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,430
I was too emotional.

729
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,970
I thought about it and I do understand you.

730
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,430
You do?

731
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,890
I knew you would understand me.

732
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,300
That's why you're a teacher.

733
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:07,530
Life is long,

734
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,090
so you might want to cheat on your wife.

735
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,540
Right?

736
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,990
You feel that way too, don't you?

737
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,130
Oh, be honest with me.

738
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:18,640
You do, don't you?

739
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,300
Let's say I do.

740
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:23,160
There is no "let's say."

741
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:26,090
Oh, now we're communicating.

742
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:32,970
I'm sorry I didn't treat you better.

743
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:37,340
I'm apologizing on behalf of my family.

744
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,590
Everything you said was correct.

745
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:41,070
I'm sorry.

746
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,970
It's too late for an apology.

747
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,640
In the past, punishment for sins came late,

748
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:50,670
but now, it comes right away, with speed.

749
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,700
See? You treated me like that,

750
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,300
and look what happened to your family.

751
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,660
Your favorite son in law went bankrupt,

752
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:00,490
Gwangbak is now unemployed,

753
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,030
and I left your daughter.

754
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,860
It's a total mess.

755
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,540
Father,

756
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,130
you should become a strong leader.

757
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,340
Don't let mother push you around.

758
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:17,240
She's all bark and no bite.

759
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,890
Sedal,

760
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,430
let's pretend none of this happened,

761
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,430
and go home.

762
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,300
Where would you find anyone like Hobak?

763
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,030
She became stubborn to make a living,

764
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,730
but she really loves you.

765
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,370
But I loathe her.

766
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:45,990
Who's going to take care of you when you're old and sick?

767
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,530
Think about who will be there for you when that happens.

768
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,230
The answer will be easy.

769
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,870
When I'm old?

770
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,370
Yes.

771
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,800
Just think about it.

772
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,470
I knew it.

773
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,770
Goof-off! God's punishing you!

774
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,890
I'm so glad you're sick!

775
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,490
I'm hungry. Give me some food.

776
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,930
Food?

777
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,070
Have you lost your mind?

778
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,140
Why did you cheat on me?

779
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,400
I told you I'd get you back!

780
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,590
You deserve more pain than this!

781
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:33,660
What's that?

782
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:36,860
Oh, yuck! I hate you!

783
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,200
I wish you were dead!

784
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,640
Oppa.

785
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,070
Girls, say hello.

786
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,640
They are your caregivers, oppa.

787
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:15,570
Money can buy anything, so don't worry.

788
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,470
I'll get you new organs.

789
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,840
Let's enjoy a long life together.

790
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,740
This is nuts.

791
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,030
I got my answer.

792
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,930
Huh?

793
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,070
What's up?

794
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,100
Look at you! You don't look right.

795
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,700
Dressing up will do you no good.

796
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,590
- Let's get some coffee.
- No.

797
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,100
I want a divorce.

798
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,530
What?

799
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,430
It's not working out.
I want a divorce.

800
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,740
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

801
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,870
- Hey!
- What?

802
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,740
I'm being extremely patient here!

803
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,040
Don't be patient.
There's no need for that.

804
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,630
I don't want to talk about this ever again.

805
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,840
You said you wanted a month of freedom.

806
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:32,800
But why should we wait a month?

807
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,870
You're so weird.

808
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,800
Why do you love me so much?

809
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,740
Even so, it just won't work.

810
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:43,300
I'm living in a different world now.

811
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,760
So think about it.

812
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,860
I can't go back to how I was before.

813
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,540
You live the way you used to before.

814
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,500
I'm Choi Sangnam.

815
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,100
It's the first snow.

816
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,500
Meeting you tonight feels very meaningful.

817
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,490
You didn't make any special plans tonight?

818
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,030
Excuse me?

819
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:15,140
People make plans to meet up on the day of the first snow.

820
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:17,040
Lovers say that, too.

821
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,530
Well, I'm here because I have nobody.

822
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,970
You're right.

823
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,300
It's not like our friends introduced us.

824
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,340
It was our parents who got us together,

825
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:35,570
so I don't want to waste any time.

826
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,030
I like you, Sangnam.

827
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,300
What do you think about me?

828
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,890
I appreciate you saying that,

829
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,890
but do you know about me?

830
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:48,890
Like what?

831
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,070
Everything.

832
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:56,140
You can't fully know someone,

833
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:59,670
so I don't know what kind of person you are.

834
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:04,070
But I know what you do and about the environment you grew up in.

835
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,300
I heard from my parents.

836
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,470
Is there anything else I need to know?

837
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:13,430
My parents are divorced.

838
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,070
It happened when I was really young.

839
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,930
And I dropped out of high school.

840
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,030
I heard.

841
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,160
I don't care about that.

842
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,760
Your parents divorce isn't your fault.

843
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:33,940
It's wrong to think you'd be weird because you grew up in a single parent family.

844
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:38,090
And a college degree isn't a must these days.

845
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:41,200
You have a good job and you're set,

846
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,470
so who cares about your education?

847
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:07,130
It's snowing a lot for the first snow.

848
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,040
Should we go for a walk?

849
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,300
I wore comfortable shoes, just in case.

850
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,070
May I pet him?

851
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,340
Yes.

852
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,840
You must like dogs.

853
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,740
I want to kiss you under a street light

854
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,660
when it snows for the first time.

855
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:49,990
Let's meet when it snows for the first time.

856
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:00,370
You're here.

857
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:03,500
I'm sorry I'm late. It's snowing outside.

858
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,230
It is?

859
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,160
It really is.

860
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,740
It's the first snow.

861
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,030
Why didn't you tell me?

862
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,470
About not being married.

863
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,660
About him being your brother in law.

864
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:31,990
I thought it would break your heart if you found out I was divorced.

865
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,700
If your ex is doing well, you get upset,

866
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,700
if she's miserable, you feel sad,

867
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,390
and if she wants you back, you get a headache.

868
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,800
Is that so?

869
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,040
That sounds about right.

870
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,870
Everything happened because of my sister.

871
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,190
She was so wild,

872
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:00,770
and she ruined our family in no time at all.

873
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,630
I had to get married

874
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:08,840
to save my family,

875
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,930
and my husband was

876
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,970
nineteen years older than me.

877
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,300
Right after I married him,

878
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:22,530
I knew it was wrong.

879
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,530
I couldn't live with another man

880
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:28,030
while the man I loved still

881
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,660
remained within me.

882
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:34,660
I had to see him every day,

883
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,930
eat with him,

884
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:40,260
and sleep in the same bed,

885
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,470
and I just couldn't do it.

886
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:50,040
I left him right after my daughter was born.

887
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:54,870
I lived with him less than a year.

888
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:00,030
I had to support my daughter,

889
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,890
so I worked really hard.

890
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:09,240
I had to bring my baby to work,

891
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,140
and people didn't like it.

892
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:21,490
Eventually, I ended up in Geoje-do Island,

893
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,090
and I ran into my brother in law there.

894
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,740
He brought us back to Seoul.

895
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,600
He had built up his business in Seoul,

896
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,390
and now I live with him and his son.

897
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,360
Our lives were ruined by my sister.

898
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,340
And now we all live together.

899
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,530
My story is pathetic, isn't it?

900
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:49,240
No.

901
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:53,300
I'm comfortable and happy.

902
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,590
I have a place to sleep,

903
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,470
there's always food on the table,

904
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:01,730
I can send Miho to school,

905
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,140
and I met you.

906
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:07,070
That's all I need.

907
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,200
You've had such a hard life.

908
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:16,600
I had no idea.

909
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:29,360
Should we go out in the snow?

910
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,530
Like in the old days?

911
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,070
Oh, this is nice.

912
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:12,030
Hey! You!

913
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:13,740
Don't!

914
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,930
It's snowing and I miss you.

915
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,660
Can we meet up now?

916
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,090
I want to walk in the snow with you all night.

917
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,370
Like in the old days.

918
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:06,700
Your father might wake up.

919
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:10,570
We should go back.

920
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,990
Who is she?

921
01:02:42,010 --> 01:03:07,750
Subtitles by KBS World

922
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,800
Subak didn't come home?

923
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:10,990
She did.

924
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,340
But she went to work early.

925
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,030
It doesn't look like she came home.

926
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,760
What are you doing home at this hour?

927
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:18,490
Sign it.

928
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:21,840
I'm begging you. Let me breathe.

929
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:23,840
I want to meet her parents this weekend.

930
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,490
My parents said yes.

931
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,840
I miss you so, so much.

932
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:30,300
You should forget about me.

933
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:32,100
They're setting the date.

934
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:34,700
And it'll be over between you two.

935
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,270
Tell him I wish him happiness.
