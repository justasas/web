00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,950
<i>If I can't free myself this time,
I'll be tied down forever.</i>

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,640
I'll always be their dog!

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,260
<i>Whatever price I have to pay
to become a human being, I'll pay it.</i>

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,860
<i>Honey.</i>

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,540
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,600
I feel like I'm going to die.
You've broken my heart into pieces.

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,740
"After this time, it'll get better."
"After this passes, it'll be okay."

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,480
That's how I've lived for twenty years.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,580
I have no heart left
with which to feel anxiety.

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,980
I can't live like this.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,630
<i>How can you lay down
your weapon during a war?</i>

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,810
<i>I've been preparing for this
from the very beginning.</i>

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,770
<i>I'll be out soon.
Why did you bother coming here?</i>

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,250
<i>You won't be able to get out.</i>

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,320
<i>I met with the chairman.</i>

17
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,870
Give it to me. The recorder.

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,300
That's the only way you're getting out.

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,540
<i>I've thought about this a lot.</i>

20
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:17,110
If you keep this up, our kids' blood,
my blood... it'll all be on your hands.

21
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,020
<i>If that's the only alternative</i>

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,740
then I would rather live separately
from one another.

23
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,770
Eun Ok! Eun Ok! Eun Ok...

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,890
Eun Ok! Eun Ok! Eun Ok!

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,910
Eun Ok!

26
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,580
<i>I've been preparing for this
from the very beginning.</i>

27
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,230
<i>I'm prepared to sacrifice
whatever I need to.</i>

28
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,450
- Mother?
- Yeah?

29
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,960
What are you doing?

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,170
The exterminators are here.
They're spraying the second floor.

31
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,160
Exterminators?

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,010
I got chewed up by those red ants,
you know. I was suffering!

33
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,530
I had them spray every room!

34
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,850
They said it was free, so I let them in.

35
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,430
They came on their own?

36
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,790
Yeah!

37
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,060
But how could you just let
strangers into the house?

38
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,980
You should've watched them, at least.

39
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,260
He told me to stay away,
because the chemicals are toxic.

40
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,580
He locked the door.
He's been in there for quite some time.

41
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,340
It's a free service,
but he's really thorough supposedly.

42
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,490
What?

43
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,920
It's all done.

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,970
- You don't need to worry anymore.
- Thank you!

45
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,420
Bye.

46
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,820
Wait a second.

47
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,610
What's the name of your company?

48
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,900
Well, we're brand new.
You wouldn't have heard of us.

49
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,540
I'm sorry, but do you have any
identification I can take a look at?

50
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,090
I'm just trying to be cautious.

51
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,630
Oh... hold on.

52
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,370
Did I bring my card?

53
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,260
- Eun Ok!
- Hey!

54
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,940
- Eun Ok.
- Who are you?

55
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,120
Oh, my! What just happened?

56
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,940
Sung Goo, catch him!

57
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,070
You have to catch him!

58
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,600
Stop right there!

59
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,660
Geez...

60
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,990
Sung Goo, what happened?

61
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,870
Geez, I couldn't catch him.

62
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,570
Who were they, anyway?

63
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,120
They were exterminators, supposedly,
but they were very suspicious.

64
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,050
I think the chairman sent them.

65
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,890
He did?

66
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,840
This is serious.

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,820
<i>Yoon Tae Soo, you have a visitor.</i>

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,490
Geez, you look like
you're suffering, boss.

69
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,850
Are they feeding you all right in there?

70
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,360
This isn't the time
to worry about my meals.

71
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,030
The chairman must really
be pressuring Eun Ok.

72
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,800
It must be seriously bad
if she's asking for a divorce.

73
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,180
But maybe she's right.

74
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,200
Why not just give them
the recorder and be done with it?

75
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,200
Do you know what just happened?

76
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,920
Some guys came looking for the recorder.
They pretended to be exterminators.

77
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,330
I chased them off after Eun Ok
got suspicious. Your family is in shock.

78
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,020
What? Did anyone get hurt?

79
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,750
Luckily, no.

80
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,910
This is an endless battle!

81
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,630
Just give him the recorder
and be done with him!

82
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,900
You need to get out of here!

83
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,980
Boss, please!

84
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,800
Sung Goo.

85
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,440
I need you to do something for me.

86
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,690
Oh, how long has it been?

87
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,510
You've been well, right?

88
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,330
Is something wrong?

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,670
Why don't you sit down?

90
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,990
What is this?

91
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,770
That's what I would like to ask you!

92
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,500
<i>[SEPTEMBER 10: 1.5 MILLION WON,
SEPTEMBER 13: 3 MILLION WON]</i>

93
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,520
What are you trying to do?

94
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,910
Are you trying to ruin my election?

95
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,780
Of course not, Assemblyman.
There must have been a mistake.

96
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,650
You need to resolve this immediately.

97
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,700
Yes, Assemblyman.
I'll take care of this right away.

98
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,210
Congratulations on your election.

99
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,930
<i>[FIVE YEARS AGO]</i>

100
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,810
That should be enough
to buy a few buildings.

101
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,200
Buildings in this area,
or in Seoul, you mean?

102
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,290
You'll be working in the capital now.

103
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,010
Of course I mean Seoul.

104
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,980
Chairman Baek Man Bo.

105
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,500
You and I, Jang Gook Han,
are now in the same boat.

106
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,010
From now on,
I will take care of Choong Shim.

107
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,330
Tae Soo! You piece of...

108
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,670
Tae Soo.

109
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
Why are you still here?

110
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,780
Well, fortunately, you came
before I could send out the recording.

111
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,650
Tae Soo, what's wrong with you?

112
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,620
Let's talk it out. Talk.

113
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,970
You and I, we go way back.

114
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm a stupid guy.

115
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,010
If had used this weapon of mine sooner

116
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,870
you would not have sent
visitors to my house.

117
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,240
What are you talking about?

118
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,670
Make it easy for me to understand.

119
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,430
Mr. Chairman.

120
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,010
From now on, think of me as a mine.

121
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,130
And I'm a mine
in the center of a mine field.

122
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,760
You really better
stay away from that mine.

123
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,930
If you don't step towards the mine,
you have no chance of striking anything.

124
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,010
Let us go our separate ways.

125
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,580
Then, no one will get hurt.

126
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,700
Mr. Chairman, first, I need to get out.

127
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,760
What?

128
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,770
If I don't get out,
you're coming in here too.

129
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,750
Honey, I'm back.

130
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,800
How did you get out?

131
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,250
How? I walked right out, of course.

132
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,930
Do we have any tofu?

133
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,390
To cast away bad luck!

134
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,130
Let's talk in the room.
Soo Min will be home soon.

135
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,690
Tell me the truth.

136
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,800
How did you get out?

137
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,910
Who helped you get out?

138
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,000
The chairman came and got me out himself.

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,540
He did?

140
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,970
Why did he do that?

141
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,740
It all worked out, and I got out.

142
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,990
Your husband is a capable man!

143
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,970
You can't see that I'm not
in the joking mood?

144
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,040
I'm not either!

145
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,320
I heard that strange
people came to our home.

146
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,880
I warned him of the consequences,
and so it won't happen again.

147
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,800
You don't need to worry about a thing.

148
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,990
No.

149
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,900
Give it to me first.

150
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,650
Give me the recorder.

151
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,900
Honey!

152
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,830
I can't live with a ticking time bomb
in my home! Give it to me!

153
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,430
I got out because I had that recorder!

154
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,910
That's why I can't give it to you.

155
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,610
Are you going to put us in danger again?

156
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,050
I wasn't joking when I said
that we should get a divorce.

157
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,240
Yes.

158
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,460
It was a warning, partially.

159
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,630
I felt the need to do it.

160
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,980
But...

161
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,550
Have I ever been like this before?

162
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,050
Geez, I know. I know this!

163
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,210
You were always on my side,
no matter what I did.

164
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,620
That's why you should listen to me!

165
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,890
This isn't just about trying
to break a rock with an egg.

166
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,150
Please, honey?

167
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,420
Just give him the recorder
and be done with him. Please?

168
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,690
Geez, I'm sorry, Eun Ok.

169
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,270
Eun Ok, please!

170
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,050
Geez.

171
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,510
Where are you going?

172
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,530
I'm moving in with Do Kyung.

173
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,090
I'll come back
for the rest of my stuff.

174
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,490
Aren't you past the age
of running away for a girl?

175
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,520
Do you know what I just went through?

176
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,950
Do you know what your
granddaughter went through?

177
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,160
She was stalked by some creep, for years,
and she came to Daejeon to avoid him!

178
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,450
She wanted my protection!

179
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,830
As her father, I had no idea.

180
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,320
I lived without worry for
all of these years.

181
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,590
I won't do that anymore.

182
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,230
She will be by my side!
I will protect her!

183
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,970
The moment you leave this house

184
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,360
you will be giving up
your title, and your wealth.

185
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,020
What an idiot...

186
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,050
Without money and power,
you aren't a father, or a man.

187
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,410
Without money,
you're just their burden.

188
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,140
You better realize that
before you make any decisions!

189
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,840
Dad, is that really the only leverage
you choose to use to keep your son?

190
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,730
Right.

191
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,360
That's all you have.

192
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,610
You wanted to see me, Sir?

193
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,760
Mr. Hong.

194
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,920
What's wrong with you?

195
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,830
I told you to conduct a treasure hunt,
not a game of hide and seek.

196
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,260
This is all you got, huh?

197
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,190
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

198
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,690
I'm bleeding from Tae Soo's whip.

199
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:53,380
I thought you'd be a good fit to replace
Tae Soo, but I guess I was wrong.

200
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,480
I'm not sure if you've had
any real chances so far.

201
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,560
But this, here, is definitely
a once-in-a-lifetime chance for you.

202
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,840
I can guarantee it. Understand?

203
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,570
Yes, Sir.

204
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,240
This is making me go crazy.

205
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,700
Pee sitting down.

206
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,240
What? Why?

207
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,370
For hygiene, and for good health.

208
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,370
For heath?

209
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,900
Listen, that's our house rule.

210
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,090
And don't forget to wash your hands
before you leave the bathroom.

211
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,870
Oh, Dad's snoring is really bad.

212
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,980
That can't be controlled.
Give the guy a break.

213
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,200
Okay.

214
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,540
I cook. Hyun Jee washes the dishes.

215
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,940
I need you to be in charge
of the grocery shopping.

216
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,570
Sure, sure. I love shopping.

217
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,900
Oh, the most important thing.

218
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,110
- Huh?
- You barged into my room earlier.

219
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,000
I hope that won't happen again.
Good manners, please.

220
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,020
Hyun Jee, I'm a gentleman.

221
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,270
Gentleman!

222
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,650
While you're here,
please maintain proper etiquette.

223
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,000
Respect one another's privacy.

224
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,250
And don't come into my room
if you don't have a good reason to do so.

225
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,510
What? Then where will I sleep?

226
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,700
- Here.
- Here.

227
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,380
In the living room? By myself?

228
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,280
You better not have
any expectations set for me!

229
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,190
I'm letting you stay here
because you want to protect us.

230
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,740
I have no other intentions.

231
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,540
If you change your mind,
you can leave at any moment.

232
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,750
No, no, no! Of course not!

233
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,470
Well, I'll just be sleeping here then.

234
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,880
It's great!

235
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,640
What is this?

236
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,970
Who knew that I would
be sleeping alone, even here?

237
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,210
Geez!

238
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,980
I miss my king size bed!

239
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,550
Geez.

240
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,860
<i>Our whole family is here!</i>

241
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,830
This feels wonderful!

242
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,640
Don't get me started.

243
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,580
We were invaded by thieves
while you were gone.

244
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,310
Thieves are getting smarter these days.

245
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,470
They fooled me!
They told me it was a free service!

246
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,990
So, now, hopefully you'll remember
to not let any strangers into the house!

247
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,100
Everyone should remember that.

248
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,590
Everyone should be careful.

249
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,840
By the way, you didn't
get us any Christmas gifts.

250
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,920
Christmas passed a long time ago!

251
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,660
That's why he should speed it up!
I have no shoes to wear!

252
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,470
Geez, that's my daughter.

253
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,230
Be patient. I'll keep my promise.

254
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,310
Well...

255
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,340
Listen.

256
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,210
I have something to tell you.

257
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,440
You would've found out eventually anyway.

258
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,740
So, I thought I should tell you
when we all gathered as a family.

259
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,160
You already know, Mom.

260
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,990
Sung Min, Soo Min.

261
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,760
And you, Eun Sil. Listen carefully.

262
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,480
I...

263
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,610
I left Choong Shim.

264
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,080
Then... what will you do now?

265
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,490
Are you unemployed now?

266
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,340
Unemployed? Of course not!

267
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,780
Have you ever seen me slack off?

268
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,780
Then?

269
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,070
I do promotions and deliveries.

270
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,450
I have multiple jobs.

271
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,870
Wow. Then you must
make more money, right?

272
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,530
Well, that's great.

273
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,310
I was always worried sick about you.

274
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,940
I bet you left Choong Shim
so you could do great things!

275
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,710
Then what about the movie?

276
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,420
You'll keep working on it, right?

277
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,220
I won't be involved in anything
related to Choong Shim.

278
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,540
Also, we have to leave this house.

279
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,010
Well...

280
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,100
We'll move out soon.

281
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,520
We'll move into a small house for now.

282
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,150
But I'll make sure that
we buy a big house soon!

283
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,450
It may be a bit inconvenient.
But please, be understanding.

284
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,900
Okay?

285
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,710
How embarrassing!

286
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,120
He should just stick
to the movie business!

287
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,390
Be quiet.

288
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,530
You'll hurt his feelings.

289
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,960
I don't care! I won't have my own room
if we live in a small house.

290
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,530
My goodness! Tae Soo!

291
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:30,010
How can I mooch off of you now?

292
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,570
You'll have to work yourself to death!

293
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,940
What are you doing, Grim Reaper?
Come and get me, please!

294
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,990
Please calm down.

295
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,680
I'm more worried about my sister.

296
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,420
What about her?

297
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,600
A wife suffers when her husband suffers.

298
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,640
My goodness...

299
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,360
Ta-da!

300
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,130
Wow, it's so pretty!

301
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,160
Do we really have to do this?

302
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,220
Matching scarves would be enough.

303
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,870
Of course! We have to!

304
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,920
We kiss! Couples rings are a must!

305
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,050
Please.

306
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,660
You're blushing. Now you look
like the real Yoon Sung Min.

307
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,820
You know how long it's been since
you've acted like your real self?

308
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,930
What?

309
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,190
You've been so distracted lately.

310
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,250
You were really worried about your dad.

311
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,890
My dad came home.

312
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,010
What? Really?

313
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,250
Why are you just telling me this now?

314
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,750
I forgot about it.

315
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,590
What a relief.

316
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,520
It must have been hard on you.

317
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,360
I felt really bad.

318
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,770
I felt responsible for
what happened to him.

319
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,380
Oh, I wrote a new song.
Do you want to check it out inside?

320
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,860
Where?

321
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,930
Your house?

322
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,550
It's too cold.

323
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,580
Let's go inside. It's cold.

324
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,320
- But...
- It's cold! So cold!

325
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,560
Do you like that
new famous British singer?

326
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,920
Hyun Jee!

327
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,130
Dad!

328
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,280
You're home?
Aren't you going to work?

329
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,160
Huh? I took the day off.

330
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,110
What brings you here, Sung Min?

331
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,970
Do you come here often?
There are only women in this house.

332
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,670
No, it's not like that.

333
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,290
I invited him over because
I had something to show him.

334
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,410
You should behave respectfully,
like a gentleman, Sung Min.

335
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,780
You know how precious she is to me.

336
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,260
If you get caught
doing anything funny...

337
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,850
Sung Min isn't you! He's not like that.

338
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,690
And don't you remember
how he saved my life?

339
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,580
You should thank him
instead of being like this.

340
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,250
Let's go, Sung Min.

341
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,230
Hyun Jee, would you like some snacks?

342
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,670
What should I make?

343
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,290
<i>"I can't lie. I want to hold you."</i>

344
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,530
I've been wanting to finish
this song, but it's hard.

345
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,900
Give me that. I'll try.

346
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,940
"I'm holding myself for you, but..."

347
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,730
I've never seen this before. Is it new?

348
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,330
My dad gave it to me.

349
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,630
Oh, it looks nice.

350
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,270
- It suits you.
- Yeah?

351
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,830
Yeah.

352
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,840
Dad!

353
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,330
I wasn't peeking.
I brought you fruits.

354
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,190
You should knock on the door, then!
Why were you just staring at us?

355
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,440
That was just...
Sung Min.

356
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,490
Yes?

357
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,400
Be good to Hyun Jee.

358
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,710
Yes.

359
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,130
What were you doing?

360
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,450
Go!

361
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,980
Go! Get out! Get out. Get out.

362
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,780
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

363
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,230
What is it now?

364
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,520
Just leave it open. Okay.

365
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,020
Geez.

366
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,100
Hello!

367
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,610
Did the assemblyman calm down a bit?

368
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,230
<i>What do you want?</i>

369
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,110
Oh... well...

370
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,520
I would like to make
a donation to his office.

371
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,080
That won't work.

372
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,190
The assemblyman told me to keep
my distance from Choong Shim.

373
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,630
Sir?

374
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,500
Sir?

375
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,690
Madam Oh!

376
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,240
Madam Oh!

377
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,500
Madam Oh!

378
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,650
What?

379
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,140
He's been missing this entire time?

380
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,470
Yes! He hasn't come home.
And his phone is off.

381
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,800
Think. Can you think of anything?

382
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,560
I wonder... if he went back to Seoul?

383
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,480
I tried calling his home in Seoul.
They said he didn't come there either.

384
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,600
Producer Lee wouldn't have met
with the chairman, right?

385
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,470
The chairman doesn't know anything.

386
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,990
There's no sign of that yet.

387
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,290
Right. If he had found out,
we wouldn't be alive right now.

388
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,120
That's why I told you to be careful.

389
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,760
You kissed me first,
then you hugged me... oh, forget it.

390
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,000
By the way, is it okay for you
to be out at this hour?

391
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,690
Stop using the script as an excuse!
He'll get suspicious of you.

392
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,040
I was so anxious.
I had to get out of the house.

393
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,190
Please get up, now.

394
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,890
Okay? I think it'll be best for us
to not see each other for a while.

395
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,240
Let's go.

396
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,930
Oh, my!

397
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,750
Madam Oh!

398
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,280
Mr. Chairman!

399
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,080
What's the matter?

400
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,430
Oh... I feel dizzy.

401
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,500
Oh no!

402
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,870
Madam Oh.

403
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,740
Where were you, so late at night?

404
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,770
Were you working on the script?

405
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,800
Don't talk. I'm worried your
blood pressure might go up again.

406
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm fine now, now that you're here.

407
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,830
Please don't say that.

408
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,100
It's not like I'm a doctor.
Dr. Kim will be here soon.

409
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,530
To me, you're the doctor
and the medicine.

410
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,160
Mr. Chairman...

411
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,820
Madam Oh.

412
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:48,050
Do you know what I thought about
while I was collapsing earlier?

413
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,750
I thought I was about to die,
lonely, without anyone.

414
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,770
What?

415
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,120
You weren't here.
Gi Bum wasn't here either.

416
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:02,270
The thought that I was alone in this
big house made me feel so lonely.

417
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:07,290
That's why you really need
a family as you get older.

418
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,820
You don't have Tae Soo now.

419
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:15,170
If you lose Gi Bum,
you will be really alone.

420
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,630
I have you, Madam Oh.

421
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,610
Of course, I'm here with you.

422
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,840
But he's still your blood.

423
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,510
You'll feel real security
from having your son right beside you.

424
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,220
He left the house on his own.

425
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,230
He chose the difficult path, himself!

426
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,840
Why would you make your son suffer?

427
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,180
What if he never comes back?

428
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,230
He won't even last a month.

429
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,440
Please don't be like that.

430
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,010
Give Do Kyung and her daughter a chance.

431
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,690
Isn't it much better to take in
a daughter in-law and a granddaughter,

432
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,600
than to lose a son?

433
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,740
Mr. Chairman, in this house...

434
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,940
you are too lonely.

435
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,160
Geez.

436
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,310
When I'm feeling sick and weak...

437
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,750
What is my son doing?

438
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,780
Oh, man!

439
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,390
Are you okay?

440
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,270
Huh? Oh, kitchen towels! Kitchen towels!

441
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,370
Ah... oh, hot! Hot!

442
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,940
They didn't burn.

443
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,420
You must be tired.

444
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,030
Drink this, rest a little bit.

445
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,110
Okay. Thanks.

446
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,030
Tell me the truth.

447
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,220
You regret it, right?

448
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,730
What do you mean?

449
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,190
Looking at you these days...

450
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,820
I wonder if I've made you suffer
by allowing you to stay with us.

451
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,970
You can go back if you want.

452
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,940
No, no! I really like it now.

453
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,150
But I don't.

454
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,660
Huh?

455
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,210
I wanted a strong fortress for Hyun Jee.

456
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,180
Not a house maid.

457
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,510
Do Kyung, that's...

458
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:49,250
Gi Bum, I'm really curious
about your plans for the future.

459
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,710
I don't need your empty words,
that you'll protect Hyun Jee and I.

460
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,100
Show me more concrete,
realistic ways to do that.

461
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,080
Yeah... I...

462
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,390
Boss! Boss!

463
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,430
You should go home now.

464
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,060
Why should I?
I just moved out.

465
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,150
Well, the chairman is sick.

466
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,330
Well, then I really shouldn’t go.

467
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,990
He'll get sicker if he sees me.

468
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,120
Boss, he told me to bring you home.

469
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,450
I said forget it!

470
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,860
You should go.

471
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,570
Forget it. He's faking it.

472
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:25,190
Whether he's faking it or not,
he says he's sick.

473
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,520
Going is the right thing for you to do.

474
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,650
Hurry up.

475
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,010
Dad! Dad...

476
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,630
Dad.

477
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,620
Are you really sick?

478
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,420
Did you think I was faking it?

479
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,430
His blood pressure spiked up.

480
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,590
Why? What happened?

481
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,940
Tae Soo got me.

482
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,770
You got me.

483
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,780
An old man can't handle these things.

484
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,160
I collapsed from the stress,
and from high blood pressure.

485
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,920
But there was no one in the house.

486
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,050
What about Madam Oh?

487
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,630
You didn't come home last night?

488
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,590
Of course that's not what happened.

489
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,550
I went to the office
to work on the script...

490
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,440
Are you living for this movie?

491
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,930
Is the movie more
important than his life?

492
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,700
If I'm not home, you should
step up to the plate. Isn't that right?

493
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,270
What did the doctor say?
Are you okay now?

494
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,850
He told me to retire.

495
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,910
Huh?

496
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,890
He says, I should retire and rest.

497
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,090
I do listen to my doctor.

498
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,490
Your era has come, Gi Bum.

499
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,440
It's time for you to lead Choong Shim.

500
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,070
Can you do that?

501
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,810
Dad.

502
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,530
I can just sit back now
and be an old man.

503
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,670
I'd humiliate myself if I kept going.

504
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,490
Gi Bum.

505
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,760
Do you know that Tae Soo is trying
to corner me with the recorder?

506
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,910
Recorder?

507
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,150
Whenever he would accompany me
to meetings with old guys and bosses

508
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,940
he would record everything for evidence.

509
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,970
He's trying to destroy
Choong Shim with it.

510
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,170
What?

511
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,030
What's on it?

512
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,090
This, and that.

513
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,960
But the biggest issue
is Assemblyman Jang.

514
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,690
You mean Assemblyman Jang,
who is running for Presidency?

515
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,940
He changed the status
of our company land for us!

516
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,120
Geez, this is serious.

517
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,790
You mean...

518
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,870
Tae Soo has evidence that you
gave bribery money to Assemblyman Jang?

519
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,690
That's right.

520
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,090
Why did you leave that
important thing with Tae Soo?

521
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,650
Back then I couldn't trust
Assemblyman Jang.

522
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,640
But I thought of Tae Soo as my own son!

523
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,370
You brought this upon yourself.

524
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,330
You reap what you sow!

525
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,760
Who will own all of this when I die?

526
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,930
You could lose all of
the wealth you're worth!

527
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,630
Gi Bum, get that recorder from Tae Soo.

528
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,780
It looks like a pen that
you can wear on your clothes.

529
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,060
If you do that...

530
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,470
I'll adjust my thought process about
you getting back together with Do Kyung.

531
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,910
What's there to think about?
I'm already living with her!

532
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,300
How long will you be able
to live with them with no money?

533
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,260
They won't like you very much
if you have no money!

534
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,280
Now that you put it that way...

535
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,590
I can finally see my plans
for the future!

536
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:40,560
Boss! Did you hear about the bars?

537
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,080
Geez, do I really have to
worry about them, at my rank?

538
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,230
Talk to Tae Soo. He's in charge...

539
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,060
Oh, he left.

540
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,260
Everything is a huge mess now.

541
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,210
Since Tae Soo left,
all of the bars are out of control.

542
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,750
One bar in Eunhaeng-dong
hasn't paid us in months!

543
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,460
What?

544
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,760
You take care of the bars for now.

545
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,050
Pardon? Me?

546
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,690
Do it right.

547
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,000
Do it right so that no one
asks for Tae Soo again, okay?

548
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,670
Yes! Thank you!

549
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,970
Thank you, Boss!

550
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,140
I will do a good job!

551
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,710
Wow!

552
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,980
The medicine my son
bought for me tastes so sweet!

553
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,070
You deliver milk in the morning.

554
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,460
You hand out flyers and do deliveries
for a supermarket in the afternoon.

555
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,660
And you clean a spa at dawn.

556
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,410
When do you sleep then?

557
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,850
What's the point of sleeping more?
You'll sleep forever when you die.

558
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,880
It's hard, right?

559
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,620
Don't look at me like that.

560
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,740
You know what?

561
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
I really like it now.

562
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,830
Even though it's hard,
and I'm hungry, I like it.

563
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,680
I just like how it is now.

564
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,060
Oh? What is that ring?

565
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,060
Huh?

566
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,320
- Oh...
- You!

567
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,500
Did you get rings with your girlfriend?

568
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,900
It's not like that.

569
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,550
I'm fine with it, but don't
let your mom see that.

570
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:30,080
Also, don't get distracted
from your school work, okay?

571
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,940
Of course not. I'm your son!

572
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,580
Oh, get out of here now.
You'll be late for cram school.

573
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,860
Okay.
Oh.

574
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,820
Here, Dad.

575
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,560
Don't work too hard. I'm going.

576
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:51,150
Okay. It's cold. Stay warm, okay?

577
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,040
Go!

578
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,870
Yes, Home Mart Deliveries?

579
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,940
Okay, yes, I'll be there within the hour.

580
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,880
Come on in, Tae Soo.

581
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,540
Hey, what's up?

582
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,000
Do Kyung let me live with them.

583
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,300
Oh, I see.

584
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,060
Congratulations.

585
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,580
It's cold outside. Have some tea.
I got it ready for you.

586
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,060
You drink the tea.

587
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,530
Tae Soo, just five minutes.

588
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,770
I'm a busy man. Can't you see that?

589
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,480
Then three minutes. One minute!

590
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,780
Okay, what is it?

591
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,310
Tae Soo, our era has finally come!

592
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,630
My dad wants to hand it over
to me, and sit down for good.

593
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,690
The dream we had at 20
is about to come true!

594
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,240
Choong Shim's twin towers!
The two pillars of Choong Shim!

595
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,700
The two of us will lead Choong Shim!

596
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,150
- Really?
- Yes!

597
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:20,930
That's great! I feel like dancing now!

598
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:24,810
Did you think I would say that?

599
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,280
I left Choong Shim,
and I'm living just fine.

600
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,580
But you enjoy the throne!

601
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,700
If this is about the recorder,
don't even think about it.

602
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,780
I told him, all he needs to do is leave
us alone, and nothing will happen.

603
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,450
Don't you know what my dad is like?

604
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,910
He makes anything happen
once he puts his mind to it.

605
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,800
The recorder will fall into
my father's hands eventually.

606
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,600
Don't waste your energy!
Pass it over while you have the chance!

607
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,540
I'm saying this as your friend.

608
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:36,450
<i>Dad was eating cold bread and milk
in the car without the heater on.</i>

609
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,430
<i>Mom, I don't know what's
going on between you and Dad.</i>

610
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,780
<i>But I just wish you would
make him feel at ease.</i>

611
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,930
What is it? I'm busy now.

612
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,600
Don't be like that.
I came to say thank you.

613
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,580
Because you chose to pursue a new life,
I got all of the good positions you had.

614
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,870
I guess I shouldn't
call you boss anymore.

615
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,560
Anyway, call me the Knight of Nights!

616
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,070
Man, don't laugh like that.
You're making me upset.

617
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:14,650
I would let it go, if you
were my boss. But not now.

618
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,780
Don't you think so, Yoon Tae Soo?

619
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,000
Bub Gyu, I'm saying nicely, just go.

620
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,800
Oh! How scary!

621
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,610
You look scary!

622
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,330
Listen to what this
delivery boy is saying!

623
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,410
"I'm saying nicely, just go."

624
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,760
You sound more like a gangster
than a delivery boy!

625
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,610
I know you're just trying to
provoke me so that I use my fists.

626
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,200
But it won't work. Just go.

627
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,790
Don't be like that, huh?

628
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,210
It's no fun when you're like this.

629
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,710
Maybe...

630
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,260
It's a lie that you beat up
18 guys at once, right?

631
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,980
Stop it. I'm busy.

632
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,010
I'm busy too!

633
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,840
Who isn't busy in Korea, right?

634
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,100
What's up with you, huh?

635
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,030
What are you doing?

636
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,850
Come here!
You really want me to let him go?

637
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,480
Do I look like a saint?

638
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,610
You don't know why he's doing that?

639
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,790
Yoon Tae Soo!
I won't leave you guys alone!

640
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,960
- What?
- I said, stop!

641
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,210
Boss!

642
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:19,740
If you act this way,
you're no different from him, okay?

643
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,590
You said you left Choong Shim.

644
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,100
You said you aren't a gangster!

645
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,310
You think everything is over
just because you said you quit?

646
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,840
Whether we break, or they break...

647
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,030
one of us is going to break!

648
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:37,610
They're not the kinds of people
who just let things go!

649
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,050
What's going on?

650
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,690
What's the matter, Mr. Chairman?

651
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,560
What... what brought you here?

652
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,020
You humiliated me!

653
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,330
Why do I keep having this dream?
It's driving me nuts!

654
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,780
You scared me!

655
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,630
Why? Are you scared
of the thought that you could die?

656
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,960
It's not that I'm scared...

657
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,440
Where have you been?
I was worried about you...

658
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,760
Don't do that!
You give me goosebumps!

659
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,540
Are you trying to get me killed too?

660
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,000
Madam Oh is the chairman's woman.
If you get caught, everything is over.

661
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,590
I won't be safe, just because
I know the truth. We'll all be dead.

662
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,780
I know.

663
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,920
I was struggling with the script so much
that I must have gone crazy.

664
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,660
Geez, I shouldn't have done that...

665
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,970
Are you saying now that you regret it?

666
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,180
I do! I regret it every waking day!

667
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,900
I regret it in the morning,
at night, and every minute of every day!

668
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,120
However!

669
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,960
What I regret the most, is that
I cannot escape Madam Oh's charm!

670
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,760
I thought you came to your senses!

671
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:26,260
Do you know how I agonized at the temple
after witnessing that shocking scene?

672
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,290
You were at a temple?

673
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,820
I went to a church too.

674
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,360
"Forget about the movie.
I have to run for my life."

675
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,840
Do you know why I came back,
even though I thought that many times?

676
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,470
It was for the movie.

677
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,680
I wanted to complete our movie.

678
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,370
Oh, Producer Lee.

679
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,480
So, you choose.
Madam Oh or the movie.

680
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,930
I can't choose!

681
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:57,170
Then, I have no choice.
I'll go tell the chairman.

682
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,520
Are you crazy? Are you trying
to save yourself by killing me?

683
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,830
Then you should choose.

684
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,120
Is it Madam Oh, or the movie?

685
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,410
Is it the woman or your life?

686
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,780
Ah!

687
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,090
Geez.

688
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,330
<i>The movie director?</i>

689
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,610
Wow!

690
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,830
Madam Oh from One Heart?

691
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,660
This painting has a hidden secret.

692
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,880
<i>Secret!</i>

693
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,550
Why did you ask me
to come here? It's cold!

694
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:28,560
That way, I can cherish
this moment later.

695
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,560
What is it that you want to say?

696
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:35,110
Say it quickly, so we can
go somewhere warm.

697
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,560
Let's break up.

698
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,890
What?

699
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,350
We have no choice.

700
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,310
We have to end it.

701
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,800
Is it because we got
caught by Producer Lee?

702
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,100
No. That can't be the true reason.

703
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,930
- It's because I want to survive!
- Like deer!

704
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,330
You said that's how we should live,
leaning on one another.

705
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:04,620
You said the kind of life one leads
outweighs the length of that life.

706
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:07,090
But there are too many days left to live.

707
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,080
I can't live, this young, without
being able to make a good movie.

708
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,020
At the very least,
I shouldn't die like a dog!

709
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,200
Please forgive my cowardice.
Forget me, Madam.

710
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,550
Okay.

711
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,280
Let's end it.

712
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,580
What?

713
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,250
It's the same for me.

714
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:37,880
I've felt so guilty, I haven't been able
to live with peace in my heart.

715
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,830
It's not that I wasn't
afraid of the chairman.

716
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,510
I just felt pathetic.

717
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:51,080
I'm everything to the chairman.

718
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,770
It wasn't right for me to do this to him.

719
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:58,970
Won't... won't you come to regret this?

720
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:02,490
I am sure...

721
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,330
I will regret it.

722
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,920
I will regret every day.

723
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,260
However...

724
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:17,000
Once I've left a man,
I never look back.

725
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,600
Goodbye, Mr. Director.

726
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,570
Bye.

727
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,900
Madam! Madam!

728
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,310
Madam!

729
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,750
Please don't forgive me!

730
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,500
Because of you, I was happy!

731
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,600
My Josephine!

732
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,160
Please be happy!

733
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,090
You have to be happy!

734
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,330
You didn't tell me you were coming.

735
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:16,230
Do I have to give you notice
before I come? Aren't we friends?

736
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,680
Do you want some tea?

737
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,120
Before that...

738
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,680
I want to give this to you.

739
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,480
What's this?

740
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:27,970
It's a gift from my pure, innocent heart.

741
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,140
What?

742
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,580
You know my husband
just on took an important job.

743
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:35,060
I thought about it,
and it was all thanks to you.

744
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,850
What do you mean?

745
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:40,300
Because of your support,
Director Baek came back to the company.

746
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:44,310
And because of that,
Bub Gyu got Tae Soo's job.

747
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,930
Do Kyung, thank you so much.

748
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:50,240
I told him, work hard! Work to death!

749
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,550
I didn't do anything.

750
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,720
You're being humble.

751
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:59,290
By the way, how was
your first night with him?

752
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,180
Well, actually, it isn't
the first night with him.

753
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,600
It's the second first night.

754
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,960
Don't be ridiculous.
It's not like that.

755
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:13,750
Gi Bum loves Hyun Jee so much,
he would give up everything for her.

756
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,750
So I took him in as her guardian.

757
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,520
Do Kyung.

758
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,050
That's what you think.
I bet Gi Bum doesn't think that.

759
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:26,740
He waited for you all this time.
You should accept him.

760
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,720
And, tell him good things
about my husband.

761
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,930
Open it.

762
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,980
Come on.

763
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,010
I'm here, Mr. Chairman.

764
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,350
Where the heck have you been?

765
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,300
I'm sorry. I couldn't face you
because I haven't succeeded.

766
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,060
I guess I've misjudged you.

767
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,280
How can you do great things
with that weak heart of yours?

768
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:13,950
You can do anything
for your family, can you?

769
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:18,240
Once you miss an opportunity,
you don't get it back!

770
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,180
I will succeed this time.

771
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,740
This is your last chance.

772
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,010
Yes.

773
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:26,660
Wow, what's this?

774
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,710
Mother, do you know how I feel now?

775
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,340
Let's say it's...

776
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:38,870
<i>It's just amazing!</i>

777
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:43,010
Get off now! Let me try it!

778
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,640
I don't want to. I won't.

779
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,010
What? Didn't you buy it for me?

780
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,530
I was kidding.

781
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,300
Mother, try it.

782
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,250
Sit on it?

783
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,540
Put your legs in there.
Both of them... like that.

784
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,870
And sit down.

785
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:05,180
Put your arms there. And...

786
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,590
Okay.

787
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:12,420
Wow, that feels great!

788
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,590
This is nice!

789
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,020
Mother, you're worried
about Tae Soo, right?

790
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,150
Yeah.

791
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:27,020
He quit his decent job,
during tough times like these.

792
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,520
What is he thinking?

793
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,010
I know.

794
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:33,920
We have to move into a tiny house.

795
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,920
Oh, my. That's why I came here.

796
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:44,320
You should talk to him, so that
he comes back to Choong Shim.

797
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,830
Are we strangers?
Why should we live like enemies?

798
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:50,130
Someone has to yield.

799
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,410
Gi Bum!

800
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,810
You're home, Eun Ok.

801
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,970
What are you doing here?

802
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,530
And what's that?

803
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,140
Eun Ok!

804
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:06,390
Gi Bum brought this as a gift!

805
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,360
Why did you do that?
That thing is a burden.

806
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,760
It's a New Year's gift.
And I thought of her.

807
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,730
Don't feel burdened.

808
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,480
I need to talk to you, Gi Bum.

809
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,100
- Mother, enjoy.
- Okay.

810
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,990
Did you come here about the recorder?

811
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,860
You're so straightforward.
I'm a bit appalled.

812
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:39,280
I'll be frank.

813
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:42,910
Eun Ok, just give it to me.

814
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:45,530
Don't make everyone suffer.

815
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,490
I don't even know where it is.

816
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:49,360
Don't be like that.

817
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,490
If you wouldn't know, who would?

818
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,760
Let me see what it looks like.

819
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,720
Well, it looks like a normal pen.

820
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,550
It's looks classy.
You put it on your clothes, like this.

821
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:02,700
See you later, Grandma.

822
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,470
It's cold outside. Stay warm.

823
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:05,750
I'm going out.

824
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,200
Hello.

825
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:09,930
Yeah...

826
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,070
"I can't lie. I want to hold you."

827
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,910
I've never seen this before. Is it new?

828
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,540
Dad gave it to me.

829
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:21,460
Oh... cool!

830
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,980
See you later.

831
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,450
Go on.

832
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:28,540
Huh?

833
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,510
What does it look like?

834
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:34,740
Eun Ok, I just realized I have
something very urgent to do.

835
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,030
I'll talk to you later.

836
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,980
Go on in.

837
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,150
Sir, I'm fine, really.

838
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:48,300
But it's not fine with me.

839
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,210
I didn't get to properly
thank you for saving Hyun Jee.

840
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:54,330
I just wanted to buy you
something nice, since I saw you today.

841
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:56,780
Give me two combos.

842
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,730
I'm a regular here.
Isn't it great?

843
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,560
Yes.

844
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:11,080
Well... do you have
something to say to me?

845
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,190
For now, eat.

846
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,500
Well, I have something to ask you.

847
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,520
Yeah?

848
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,270
How did you get out before my dad?

849
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,670
I mean at the police station.

850
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,630
Oh... That's right.

851
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,700
I wonder why that was...

852
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,720
Sung Min.

853
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:41,680
Your dad gave you a really nice gift.

854
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,100
Huh?

855
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,470
I mean the pen you carry
around with you. The classy one.

856
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,650
Can I take a look at it?

857
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:53,130
Why?

858
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,960
Hyun Jee seems
to want one just like yours.

859
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,980
But I can't find one
that nice in any store.

860
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,400
I see.

861
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,350
I'll be back.

862
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,280
Hello.

863
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,070
Eun Ok, I just realized I have
something very urgent to do.

864
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,120
Have some fruit.

865
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,650
Thank you.

866
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,700
<i>Well, it looks like a normal pen.</i>

867
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,250
<i>It's looks classy.
You put it on your clothes, like this.</i>

868
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,040
Here.

869
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,300
Oh.

870
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:35,180
Sir, excuse me for a moment.

871
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,260
Okay, take your call.

872
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:45,330
Mom.

873
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,650
Are you with Hyun Jee's dad now?

874
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,460
Yes, why?

875
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:52,860
Sung Min, don't give him your dad's pen!

876
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:56,030
Bring the pen home. Right now!

877
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:57,400
Okay.

878
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:21,910
Sung Min!

879
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:25,510
Mom, he took the pen with him.

880
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,670
What? Why did you give it to him?

881
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:33,310
I turned around while I was talking
to you. And he disappeared with the pen.

882
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,240
What is it?

883
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,510
What's so important about that pen?

884
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,800
I'll be back before 4 p.m.
Okay, don't worry.

885
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,430
Okay.

886
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,980
Oh, hey.

887
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,250
<i>Where are you now?</i>

888
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,950
I'm working. Why?

889
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,160
I have to see you now.
I have something to tell you.

890
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,530
I said I'm working.

891
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,610
Let's talk when I come home tonight.

892
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:09,920
Gi Bum took the recorder from Sung Min.

893
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,060
What?

894
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,800
<i>What do we do now?</i>

895
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,530
Let me park the truck.

896
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:19,590
What's wrong?

897
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:22,100
My brakes aren't working!

898
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,870
- Huh? No!
<i>- Honey!</i>

899
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,350
<i>Honey!</i>

900
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:35,210
Excuse me. Do you have
a patient named Yoon Tae Soo?

901
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:36,690
Yoon Tae Soo?

902
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,090
Eun Ok!

903
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,260
Sung Goo!

904
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:53,690
Luckily, it was a minor accident.

905
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:01,580
He tried to impress your mom with a gift.

906
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,800
He sent Mr. Chang to provoke you.

907
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:05,580
He met with Sung Min himself.

908
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,580
And he did this to you.

909
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,800
He got the recorder.
He must be dancing around now.

910
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,930
Dad! Dad!

911
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:17,050
What's all the noise? Calm down!

912
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,630
Is that it?

913
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,000
Yes, Dad!

914
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:36,170
I'm proud of you, Son!

915
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,850
Good job!

916
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:40,060
You did a good job!

917
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,480
So we lost.

918
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:50,430
No. Both sides lost.

919
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:52,520
What?

920
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,930
In this kind of war,
no one should win.

921
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,150
Honey, what do you mean by that?

922
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,150
How do you like it?

923
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,120
Does it write well?

924
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,010
Yes, I like it.

925
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:20,230
Dad, do you know Hyun Jee's dad
is living at her house now?

926
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:22,140
What?

927
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:25,150
I went earlier,
and he was wearing an apron.

928
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:30,970
Did he say anything to you?

929
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:32,380
Nope.

930
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:43,810
Well, let me borrow that pen for one day.

931
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:57,150
They say prevention
is the best remedy for disaster.

932
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,510
That really is true.

933
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:02,010
Did you...

934
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:08,470
You did a good job! I knew you would!

935
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:20,320
<i>Go, go, Baek Man Bo!</i>

936
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,880
What is this?

937
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,820
That's what I wanted to ask you.

938
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,860
What the heck did you bring me?

939
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:36,510
<i>If you're listening to this now, it means
Gi Bum stole something from my son.</i>

940
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:39,010
<i>Shame on you!</i>

941
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,120
<i>You're listening too, Mr. Chairman?</i>

942
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,230
<i>I'm sorry for surprising you.</i>

943
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:51,810
If you let me, I'd like
to end this, my way.

944
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:56,110
I should have done it sooner,
but I simply couldn't.

945
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,380
I wanted to take
the punishment and end it.

946
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,290
But I was worried
about you, and the kids.

947
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:08,350
But... it's time to do it.

948
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,880
This was something
I just could not avoid.

949
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:15,710
Are you sure...

950
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,530
you won't regret it?

951
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,130
Yes.

952
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:32,120
<i>Mr. Chairman,
do you remember what I said?</i>

953
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:36,540
<i>I told you to keep
your feet out of the mine field.</i>

954
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:40,260
You just struck a mine.

955
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,680
Now, I have no choice.

956
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,350
What the heck is he talking about?

957
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:45,730
Be quiet.

958
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:50,660
<i>I realized a long time ago, that I should
pay the cost of living a brand new life.</i>

959
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,480
<i>It's my fault that I didn't
put that plan into action.</i>

960
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:58,140
I'm taking the original
recordings to a reporter.

961
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:00,890
It'll be a big story in
tomorrow's newspaper.

962
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,250
<i>It's time to end this ridicule.</i>

963
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,700
Let's pay the prices for our sins.

<i>You have a real reason.</i>

975
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:30,910
<i>Is it about my parents and your parents?</i>

976

977
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,320

978

01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:37,970

980
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:39,280

981

<i>Director Oh, say something.</i>

982
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,990
<i>Director Oh will die! Please save him!</i>

983
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:45,310
