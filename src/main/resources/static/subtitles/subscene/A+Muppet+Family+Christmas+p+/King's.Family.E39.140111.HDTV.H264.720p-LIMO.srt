00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,290
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

3
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,540
What was that?

4
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,400
It sounded like a mobile phone.

5
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,600
Who's there?

6
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,140
I someone here?

7
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,540
Okay, Daese. I'll be right there.

8
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,100
Nobody's there.

9
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,700
People usually don't come up here.

10
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,170
Maybe it was the landlady.

11
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,790
I have to go.
Something came up at home.

12
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,830
My brother in law called.

13
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,390
You need a new lock. It's broken.

14
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,290
There's nothing to steal.
Nobody comes here.

15
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,990
Why didn't you answer your phone?

16
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,770
You called me?

17
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,200
It was really loud so I didn't hear it.

18
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,970
You should go home.

19
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,170
Your family called many times.

20
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,760
Where were you?

21
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,760
Why did you leave Jungji with Miho?

22
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,760
Jungji's not the problem here.

23
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,360
- Oh, my heart.
- What's wrong?

24
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,490
Here, there, everywhere.

25
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,140
I couldn't get anything done.

26
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,890
What are you talking about?

27
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,170
Ugh! Minjung is seeing someone.

28
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,730
What?

29
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,540
Why did you have to call me right then?

30
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,400
I should've burst the door open and checked.

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,830
You probably heard wrong.

32
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,260
You went to Minjung's place?

33
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,830
Yes.

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,700
Where does he live?

35
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,330
It's not that far.

36
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,090
What do we do?

37
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,200
The ink on the divorce paper isn't even dry,

38
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,540
and he's already seeing a woman!

39
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,290
He has no conscience.

40
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,430
Oh! Legally, they're not divorced yet.

41
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,940
Right?

42
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,200
I'm sorry, father.

43
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,700
She's been begging for forgiveness for an hour now.

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,170
It was totally your fault.

45
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,540
I know.

46
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,700
Your family can come for a visit.

47
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,470
They should've said hello,

48
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,270
instead of hiding under the table.

49
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,040
But Daese,

50
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,570
I think they were curious of how she's doing.

51
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,340
They probably wanted to drop by when nobody

52
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,590
was home, but you came home, unfortunately.

53
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,970
So I'm saying it was my fault.

54
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,070
My fault for coming home then and there.

55
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,590
Father.

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,760
You should let this one pass.

57
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,590
And we should invite her family over.

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,590
If they lived by themselves, they would've had a housewarming party already.

59
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,860
So I'm saying this was my fault.

60
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,000
Gwangbak is faultless.

61
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,970
I'm the weird one who caused all this.

62
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,390
I shouldn't have gotten on her nerves.

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,260
I'm very sorry for all this, Gwangbak.

64
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,200
Oh, honey.

65
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,760
We can never have a quiet day.

66
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,440
What will we do?

67
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,330
I'm disappointed in you.

68
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,860
Why?

69
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,960
I know I made father angry. It's my fault.

70
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,960
But how could you not say anything?

71
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,760
Looking at me like, 
"It's all your fault."

72
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,290
You told me not to butt in.

73
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,400
But today, you should've said something.

74
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,330
Oh, boy. What am I supposed to do?

75
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,260
I'm damned if I do, I'm damned if I don't.

76
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,000
Because you do when you shouldn't,

77
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,040
and you don't when you actually should.

78
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,490
I knew it.

79
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,370
Just leave it all to you? Yeah, right!

80
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,200
Why can't your father just laugh it off?

81
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,260
You heard?

82
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,260
He called to complain, so I yelled at him.

83
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,660
Why did you come back?

84
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,060
I have to finish this.

85
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,090
This month was okay.

86
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,570
Winter is the slow season, but we're okay.

87
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,090
Thanks to you.

88
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,530
No, thanks to you.

89
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,830
You convinced the men to stay with us,

90
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,160
and you kept bringing in work.

91
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,460
But marriage isn't that easy, right?

92
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,760
How did you know?

93
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,790
Your wife's home, but you're here.

94
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,240
It's so difficult.

95
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,570
It's like my mind goes blank.

96
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,090
Sometimes I don't recognize her.

97
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,140
Even after dozens of years, you'd feel that.

98
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,890
If it gets too bad, you get a divorce.

99
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,530
You should work harder.

100
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,590
You're a man.

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,200
I would, if I knew how.

102
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,390
But no matter how hard I try, I just... Ugh.

103
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,960
Father, what happened today was my fault.

104
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,260
Please forgive me.

105
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:00,330
You say I have no respect for your family or you,

106
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,390
but I respect you deeply.

107
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,640
I learned a lot from the golden key you got.

108
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:13,040
I will remember what you said about love

109
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,560
and respect, and I'll work very hard.

110
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,140
A woman? He said that?

111
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,960
It looks like it.

112
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,730
Who cares if he does?

113
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,170
We're over.

114
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,660
You're not! You have kids.

115
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,860
Don't say such old fashioned things.

116
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,040
Who lives for their kids?

117
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,660
Everyone does!
Who else could you live for?

118
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,570
Mom, women in the old days might have, but not us.

119
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,330
My life is more important than my kids.

120
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,890
It's just you.

121
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,370
Everyone else puts their kids first.

122
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,170
My life is my kid's life, and vice versa.

123
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,390
You can't separate yourself from them.

124
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,240
How can you be so childish?

125
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,940
Anyway, change Minjung's mind before...

126
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,660
I'm not crazy!

127
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,030
Mom, stop it and go to bed.

128
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,460
And mind your own business.

129
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,970
I'm scared he might want to come back.

130
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,970
What? Oh...

131
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,140
Blabbermouth, narrow minded Sangnam!

132
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,870
Don't wake me up.
I have to get up early.

133
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,470
- We're off. 
See you later.

134
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,540
- Daebak, have a nice day.
- Have a good day.

135
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,230
Gwangbak's father in law is really nasty.

136
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,840
Oh, really?

137
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,870
Are you happy to hear that?

138
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,790
Not happy. Just worried.

139
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
You clap and laugh when you're worried?

140
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,030
My princess is kind of different.

141
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,740
Princess my butt.

142
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,470
You know how weird you've gotten after marriage?

143
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,800
Did Gwangbak tell you that?

144
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,260
He comes home whenever he feels like it

145
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,260
and starts nagging at Gwangbak,

146
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:12,030
threatening to kill her if she's mean to his son. Unbelievable.

147
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,460
Right, father. I heard it, too.

148
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,840
"Don't control Sangnam behind his back."

149
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,570
Or was it beside? Where? His head?

150
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,330
I think it must be "behind."

151
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,640
People usually control others from behind.

152
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,600
You're smart, my princess.

153
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,870
Did your mother teach you that?

154
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,500
You better not get between me and Sangnam.

155
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,030
I'll get you!

156
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,500
Mrs. Lee, you're really funny.

157
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,070
Or is it sister? What was it?

158
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,230
Sister in law.

159
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,140
Why does law have to get involved?

160
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,930
Oh, quiet!

161
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,330
I mean, please keep it down.

162
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,670
How did you see that?

163
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,660
I heard it from under the table.

164
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,590
Mom and I went to her house,

165
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,600
but her father in law came, so we hid.

166
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,300
I was so nervous about getting caught.

167
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,430
Oh, you hid under the table? How funny.

168
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,060
I know.

169
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,490
Why did you have to go there?

170
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,700
I was wondering how Gwangbak was doing.

171
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,260
Is she doing well?

172
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,160
Where were you? She's miserable.

173
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,590
I feel sorry for Gwangbak.

174
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,070
I can call her Gwangbak, right?

175
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,360
I'm way above her.

176
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,570
Yes.

177
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't ever try that again.

178
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,260
But I'm glad you didn't get caught.

179
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,840
We did.

180
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,000
You did?

181
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,460
Hello, Mr. Choi.
I'm Gwangbak's dad.

182
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,070
Hello.

183
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,790
I heard about what happened.

184
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,260
What my wife did was very rude.

185
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,430
I don't know what to say.

186
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,860
Can you find it in your heart to...

187
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,240
I thought about it, but I can't understand it.

188
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,870
Oh, I'm sure.

189
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,290
But she just wanted to check on Gwangbak.

190
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,590
She didn't want you to find out, but...

191
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,930
Mr. Choi, do you have time for lunch?

192
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,490
I have plans.

193
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,830
How about dinner, then?

194
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,470
I'm busy. Goodbye.

195
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,570
What did he say?

196
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,930
How could you be so thoughtless?

197
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,190
Didn't you think of Gwangbak?

198
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,360
I didn't know he'd come home.

199
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,440
Then why didn't you say hello?

200
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,930
Why would you hide under the table?

201
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,490
I'd be furious, too.

202
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,000
Gwangbak's in trouble now.

203
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,700
What you did was wrong. Ugh.

204
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,060
Oh...

205
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,160
What's that?

206
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,530
Beef in soy sauce. It's for Minjung.

207
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,930
But they are divorced.

208
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,860
He's still like my son in law.

209
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,100
Oh, I can't believe my ears.

210
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,260
Are you mad I stole your line?

211
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,740
Please babysit Jungji for me.

212
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,700
He ate, so you can just watch him.

213
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,830
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

214
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,890
Minjung, drop by for lunch.

215
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,890
I'd love to wait, but I have a class.

216
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,370
I'll call you later.

217
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,600
Oh, my legs.

218
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,460
Mother.

219
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,890
Why are you so surprised? 
You scared me.

220
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,100
What are you doing here?
How did you know?

221
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,200
I have ways, you know?

222
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,530
- Were you expecting someone else?
- Huh?

223
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,870
Who else could visit you but me?

224
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,870
Unless you are seeing someone in secret.

225
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,600
Was someone here?

226
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,870
It's clean here and the fridge, too.

227
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,240
The stew looks like it was just made.

228
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,200
I made it.

229
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,640
You did?

230
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,970
I had to go get something.

231
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,260
Anyway, what are you doing...

232
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,390
What do you think?
To make you some food.

233
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,470
Please don't.
I can take care of myself.

234
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,870
I don't want you coming here.

235
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,660
How could you say that?
Are we strangers?

236
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,330
Minjung, let's sit down.

237
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,100
You're making me uncomfortable.

238
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,600
I'm grateful that you care,

239
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,970
but you're making things harder for me.

240
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,460
Yeongdal.

241
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,000
Tada! Blood sausage!

242
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,940
You're the best! How exciting!

243
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,060
Oh, wow.

244
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,760
Shh!

245
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,070
Say ah!

246
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,360
Ah.

247
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,290
Yeongdal!

248
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,800
Come down.

249
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,740
Why?

250
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,070
Why won't you even come out of your room?

251
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,840
Come down and help me.

252
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,300
Me? But I'm pregnant.

253
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,070
Hah! You think that's so special.

254
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,800
Since you're pregnant, you should help.

255
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,890
Two of you can do more work.

256
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,230
I was told not to move.

257
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,370
Who said that?

258
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,570
You have to move around. Come down.

259
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,160
Clean these.

260
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,640
Clean them, rinse them, and put them in the basket.

261
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,570
When that's done, turn the stove off,

262
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,040
rinse them in clean water and hang them.

263
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,440
I can't do stuff like this, Mrs. Lee.

264
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,260
Don't call me Mrs. Lee.

265
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,440
You should try doing things.

266
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,760
Oh, man.

267
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,830
Where is she?

268
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,370
What are you doing?

269
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,660
Mrs. Lee keeps giving me work.

270
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,730
You're too precious to work.

271
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,760
Come out.

272
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,260
Oh.

273
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,770
Yeongdal!

274
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,270
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

275
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,600
What do you want?

276
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,840
Yeongdal, come out.

277
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,070
You're going to boss her around again?

278
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,140
I only asked her to clean the bean sprouts!

279
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,270
Hey, she's my daughter in law, not yours.

280
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,770
But aren't we all family here?

281
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,870
Go and clean the bean sprouts.

282
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,740
Mother, you're crushing the rice cake.

283
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,390
How did you know?

284
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,490
Would you like some? Oh.

285
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,830
I won't eat rice cake you sat on.

286
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,960
Mother, I'm hurt.

287
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,140
About what?

288
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,160
I had 5 kids and you never bought me food.

289
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,930
It's not like they're expensive.

290
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,260
I should come before her,

291
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,140
if you want her to learn any manners.

292
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,960
You should respect the hierarchy.

293
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:07,690
Yeongdal was eating blood sausage that Don bought her all by herself. Did you know?

294
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,890
What?

295
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,870
Why that little...

296
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,390
- How are the kids?
- They're fine.

297
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,540
Why do you keep giving my mom false hope?

298
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,760
What do you mean?

299
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,770
We're divorced, so why do you hang around?

300
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,700
I heard you live near here?

301
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,870
I can't move far away because of the kids.

302
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,430
I'm not interested in you, so don't mind me.

303
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,370
You're giving my parents hope.

304
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,600
Stop sending them any wrong signals.

305
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,140
They're all nagging me now.

306
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,540
Just sever the ties.

307
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,470
I'm not going back to you.

308
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,690
Dream on.

309
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,890
Even if you begged me, I won't go back.

310
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,660
You and I are over.

311
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,070
We already signed the papers.

312
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,040
I met your mother because she called me.

313
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,540
I'm actually offended here.

314
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,300
Don't answer my parents phone calls.

315
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,270
It makes my life miserable.

316
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,370
Please find it for me, please.

317
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,000
You should go home and wait.

318
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,030
I'm not sure if we'll find it very soon.

319
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,370
I have to get it back. It's my livelihood.

320
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,570
I'm begging you.

321
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,100
Minjung.

322
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,640
Sunjeong.

323
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,600
How could this happen?

324
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,600
How could anyone steal a delivery truck?

325
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,570
Officer, please catch that bastard.

326
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,070
Minjung is a hard working man.

327
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,660
Men like that thief is the worst.

328
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,660
Wait until I get my hands on him.

329
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,760
I'm going to wring his neck.

330
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,300
How can he do this?

331
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,970
How can he steal a delivery truck?

332
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,660
Sir, please catch him. Please.

333
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,640
You were pretty good at swearing.

334
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,640
Me? When?

335
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,370
Just now. Remember what you said?

336
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,930
That bastard, wring his neck...

337
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,890
Minjung, I'm older now.

338
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,930
I'm not the same Sunjeong you used to know.

339
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,490
Try living in this world alone.

340
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,330
You can't help but swear.

341
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,690
You're right.
I'm good at swearing, too.

342
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,260
But what do we do now?

343
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,640
You'll have to pay for the packages.

344
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,870
I'll have to.

345
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,660
I can't believe this happened.

346
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,760
How far do I have to go down?

347
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,160
I have no more tears to shed.

348
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,960
Mom!

349
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,460
Where's mom?

350
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,530
Hi. She went to the market.

351
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,390
I heard your father in law's mean.

352
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,460
- Who told you that?
- Your mom.

353
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,390
I posted it and everyone's talking.

354
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,260
Why did you do that?
What's wrong with you?

355
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,070
What did you just say?

356
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,540
What?

357
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,340
I'm your aunt!

358
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,840
Whatever.

359
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,660
Let me ask you something.

360
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,870
You're family now, so don't cause problems.

361
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,840
Help my mom out with the chores.

362
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,570
I know you're pregnant and all

363
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,100
but she won't ask you to do hard labor.

364
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,340
You know grandmother and mom don't get along.

365
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,640
So you should be their mediator.

366
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,690
You're lecturing me now?
That's funny.

367
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,960
Just do as I say.

368
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,190
And why are you dressed like this?

369
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,600
Put on some decent clothes for your baby.

370
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,960
My family thinks you're obscene.

371
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,830
You're really rude, aren't you?

372
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,690
I'm your aunt.

373
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,870
Rude?

374
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,190
You think I'm still your friend?

375
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,760
How dare you talk to me like that?

376
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,300
You think you're better than me

377
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,270
because you got good grades in school?

378
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,200
Watch your manners!

379
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,390
What? Watch my manners?

380
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,840
Don't be cheeky.

381
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,890
I'm ranked fifth in the family.

382
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,660
You're tenth in the family.

383
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,600
I'm double that!

384
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,870
From now on, call me aunt.

385
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,230
So stupid.

386
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,530
And to think you used to be a teacher!

387
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,670
Do this again and I'm telling your father.

388
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,890
Your father does everything I say.

389
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,960
And he talks to me very politely.

390
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,190
You don't know anything!

391
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,190
Hey! You!

392
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,530
Hey, Wang Gwangbak!

393
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,300
Uncle.

394
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,160
What's wrong with you?

395
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:21,990
What?

396
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,290
Just because you got good grades doesn't mean you can behave badly.

397
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,440
You're so mean.

398
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,100
Don't come to my house anymore.

399
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,800
Just don't.

400
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,040
Did Yeongdal put you up to this?

401
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,390
She's your aunt now.

402
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,870
Is this really who you are?

403
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,070
You're siding with your immature wife?

404
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,340
I'm so disappointed in you.

405
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,100
I don't care if you are.

406
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,140
All I care about is my princess' opinion.

407
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,040
Princess?

408
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:47,970
Yes.

409
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,690
You think your princess is still your friend?

410
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,960
She married me, so she's your aunt.

411
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,190
You don't even know basic manners?

412
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,840
And to think you used to be a teacher!

413
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,160
This is why...

414
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,930
Your father in law is mean to you.

415
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,430
Call her aunt from now on.

416
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,230
Uncle!

417
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,290
Ugh!

418
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,890
Mr. Choi.

419
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,040
Yes, Mrs. Lee?

420
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,040
I just have to say this.

421
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,970
How could you be so mean to Gwangbak?

422
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,930
What did I teach her?

423
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,100
You'll get her if she causes troubles?

424
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,160
And what else? Extreme measures?

425
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,840
What is that? What are you going to do?

426
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,970
Force them to get a divorce?

427
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,840
You're not going to move away?

428
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,640
What?

429
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,770
I hate running into you like this.

430
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,840
Then you should move away.

431
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,430
My family's been here for 40 years.

432
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,190
I'm sorry I didn't get your permission,

433
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,870
but what you did was far worse.

434
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,430
You shouldn't mistreat someone else's child.

435
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,760
She's your only daughter in law, and won't

436
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,540
she have to take care of you when you're old?

437
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:40,430
Sunjeong! Sunjeong, water! With ice!

438
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,490
Aunt isn't home.

439
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,690
You're banned from visiting your parents.

440
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,470
Is business good?

441
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,990
Yes, it's winter.

442
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,360
What's up?

443
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,460
What happened? Investing.

444
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,490
I need to think about it.

445
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,960
What's there to think about? It'll double.

446
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,660
I'm too scared to try things like that.

447
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,030
And of course, I have no money.

448
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,570
Then you'll live like this forever.

449
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,340
Oh, whatever.

450
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,840
Subak, give me one more day.

451
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,140
I'll have to take out a second mortgage.

452
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,140
A chance like this won't come again.

453
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,040
I took out a mortgage, too.

454
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,440
But you don't own a house.

455
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,730
Do you have an account I didn't know about?

456
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,530
Well...

457
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,600
Is this the police?

458
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,070
I'm Ko Minjung.

459
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,240
You haven't caught them yet?

460
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,800
Okay.

461
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,390
I see.

462
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,960
How's your back?

463
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,100
It's getting better.

464
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,300
The weather's probably making it worse.

465
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,940
What brings you?

466
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,640
You probably know about the divorce.

467
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,460
I heard.

468
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:42,260
So I was hoping you could talk Minjung out of it.

469
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,500
Why did they get divorced?

470
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,090
I don't think there's a specific reason.

471
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:51,140
Little things built up and exploded.

472
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:55,600
I'm always on my son's side.

473
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:01,140
I'm sure they've really thought about it,

474
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,800
so I don't think I can change anything.

475
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,100
But they have little kids.

476
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,270
One is still a baby.

477
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,800
Mr. Ko, even if Minjung made up his mind,

478
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:18,070
your opinion might make him rethink things.

479
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,540
There's still cooling off period,

480
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,760
so please help me try to change his mind.

481
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,430
The person you have called is unavailable,

482
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,140
so your call will be directed to voice mail.

483
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,540
Are you sure?

484
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,800
Of course!

485
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,640
Mom, I'll be back.

486
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,930
This is nuts.

487
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,890
They got divorced?

488
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,890
I knew it.

489
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,100
Pretend you don't know.

490
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,430
How can I?

491
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,600
I watched them with my own two eyes!

492
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,240
How can this happen?
I'm shaking!

493
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,870
I can't let them get away with this.

494
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,300
Home-wreckers are the worst in the world.

495
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,700
They must be punished.

496
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,260
What are you going to do?

497
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,160
This is wrong.

498
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,470
Oh, nice.

499
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,690
Right now?

500
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,140
Okay, Sedal.

501
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,570
There are two exits, here and there.

502
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,640
Let's wait out here and attack him.

503
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,190
Okay.

504
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,800
Here.

505
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,140
I don't need them. I'll be over there.

506
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,790
I knew my mom had some money saved.

507
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,460
But this isn't even $100,000.

508
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,640
But this is all she has.

509
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,600
She's really excited.

510
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,040
But Hobak chickened out.

511
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,670
She'll never be rich.

512
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,190
Take good care of my mom's money.

513
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,490
Don't worry.

514
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,160
This is like petty cash. It'll be fine.

515
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,800
Let's go. I have an appointment.

516
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,840
We're not having dinner?

517
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,840
I'll take you somewhere nice next time.

518
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,070
Okay.

519
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,840
Subak, hold on.

520
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:30,870
What is it?

521
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,070
I was so happy to see you again.

522
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,930
Silly.

523
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,340
I'm serious. I won't forget you.

524
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,040
You sound like you're going somewhere.

525
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,800
How can I go anywhere without you?

526
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,200
Thanks, Subak.

527
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,060
When your father dragged you home.

528
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,270
I was at a loss for a long time.

529
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,840
He said he won't give his daughter to me.

530
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,600
It still echoes in my ears.

531
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,140
You should forget that.

532
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,040
I think I will be able to now.

533
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:13,300
You should come and meet my parents soon.

534
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:18,470
Sure. You should go.
I'll clean up here.

535
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,460
Okay. See you tomorrow.

536
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,200
Yes. Did you buy the plane tickets?

537
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,930
And the passports?

538
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,460
Okay.

539
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,140
Hey! Sangnam! Here!

540
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,270
Who are you? What?

541
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,170
Who are you? Huh?

542
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,200
- Who are you?
- Sangnam!

543
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,770
- Sangnam!
- Are you a thief?

544
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,340
Who are you?

545
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,260
Help!

546
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,570
What are you? Huh? A thief?

547
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,930
Wait, wait.

548
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,370
Sangnam!

549
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,740
This is for my brother in law.

550
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,230
Don't mess with another man's woman.

551
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,060
Watch your back wherever you go.

552
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,960
I'm warning you. Don't ever do this.

553
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,690
Who do you think you are?
I'll kill you.

554
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,830
Run!

555
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,100
How...

556
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,140
Minjung.

557
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,040
Sangnam and I paid him back real good,

558
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,040
so you can go to bed feeling reassured.

559
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:38,100
Don't ask what.
Just remember what I said.

560
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,270
Why don't you join us?

561
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,570
Next time? Okay.

562
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,830
Here is Sangnam.

563
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,540
Yes, Minjung. This is Sangnam.

564
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,500
We will protect you, okay?

565
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,800
Cheer up. We're the Wang's son in laws.

566
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,260
I'll buy you a drink sometime.

567
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,870
Okay. Whatever it is, thank you.

568
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,190
Bye.

569
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,230
Hey, your kick was amazing.

570
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,100
Hey, no need to turn around.

571
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,140
Minjung, you didn't answer my call.

572
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,290
Don't take this the wrong way.

573
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,600
I'm not giving this to you. It's a loan.

574
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,670
So don't say no.

575
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,040
You will get back on your feet soon.

576
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,800
Cheer up. You can do it.

577
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,770
Sunjeong, thanks. 
I'll pay you back.

578
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,600
I'm glad I can help you.

579
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,190
Don't skip dinner and cheer up.

580
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,370
Hello?

581
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,640
Who is this?

582
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,190
Mother.

583
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,830
I'm home.

584
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,260
You're home?

585
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,790
Did you have dinner?

586
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,640
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

587
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,560
What is it?

588
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,730
I'm so heartbroken.

589
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,140
Why do I bother living?

590
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,600
I should just die.

591
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,190
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

592
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,930
Did Anggeum say something to you?

593
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,570
I'm more upset about Don.

594
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:53,190
I'm also upset about Yeongdal.

595
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,690
What happened?

596
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,470
Bong.

597
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,400
Are you coming home now?

598
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,400
Yes.

599
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,470
Uh, no, I got home a while ago.

600
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,230
Didn't you learn any manners?

601
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,230
Where do I go first when I come home?

602
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,160
The front door.

603
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,940
What?

604
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:20,000
You come through the door, right?

605
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:25,070
Which room do I go in first?

606
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,100
Mom's room.

607
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,290
Right.

608
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,260
And you've learned nothing from that?

609
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,300
I'm sorry, Bong.

610
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,960
And you shouldn't play favorites with food.

611
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,290
It's the worst of all.

612
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,490
What were you thinking?

613
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:47,100
Why didn't you get mother blood sausages?

614
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,960
Mom.

615
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,370
Oh, what's wrong with you?

616
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,140
You only care about your wife!

617
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,460
I don't matter to you anymore?

618
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,430
You don't care about your mother?

619
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,470
You're upset over that?

620
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,460
Why don't you get married, too, then?

621
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,230
Don't you have some old man you've been eying?

622
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,500
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

623
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,660
I wish I didn't have to see her.

624
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,370
Living with her is stressful.

625
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,940
You should try to teach her.

626
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,340
You think she'll listen to me?

627
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,460
Don is head over heels in love with her.

628
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,960
Maybe you should try talking to her.

629
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,660
I can't. She's my sister in law.

630
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,700
Why are you so forgiving?

631
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,270
You aren't with your daughters.

632
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,400
She's not my daughter.

633
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,870
When the weather warms up,

634
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,870
I'll try to find a small apartment for them.

635
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,640
With what money?

636
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,170
I'll have to see.

637
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,670
I have some former students who work at the bank, 

638
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,440
so I can take out a mortgage.

639
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,170
You can't do that.

640
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,970
Don't touch this house.

641
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,330
Even when Subak had nowhere to go,

642
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,830
I didn't even think about doing that.

643
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,290
So don't touch this house.

644
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,890
What are you talking about?

645
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,340
We want you to run the company again.

646
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:21,430
We hired someone and the business was bad.

647
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,840
The company will go belly up at this rate.

648
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,100
Can you please come back?

649
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,370
Are you serious?

650
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,100
From what you've done in the past,

651
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,460
you could settle the debt in 3 years.

652
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,400
After that, you can have the company back.

653
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,500
Thank you so much.

654
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,770
Thank you very much.

655
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,170
Thank you.

656
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm happy for you, Minjung.

657
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,960
I can't believe this is really happening.

658
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,600
How could this happen?

659
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,500
See?

660
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,000
I knew you'd make it.

661
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,400
I could even dance.

662
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,500
Would you like to?

663
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,570
You think I'd say no?

664
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,730
Then get up.

665
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,060
No.

666
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:22,790
The timing was perfect, too.

667
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,790
What if I actually used it?

668
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,140
I know.

669
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,170
If you had bought a truck with this,

670
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,870
it would've been a waste of money.

671
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,770
It's automatic.

672
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,670
What will you do with the parcel service?

673
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,270
I'm giving it back to my friend.

674
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,940
When good things happen, I think of you.

675
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,000
In the past, I didn't have anyone to share good news with.

676
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:58,300
My wife hated when I think about work.

677
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,390
I had to celebrate alone,

678
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,100
but now I have you to share it with.

679
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,190
I know how that feels, Minjung.

680
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,960
It was the same for me.

681
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,430
When I was raising Miho alone

682
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,400
when she first started crawling,

683
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,670
when she took her first step,

684
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,870
when she first said mom,

685
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,870
when she received awards at school,

686
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,100
I had nobody to tell,

687
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,270
so I cried.

688
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,960
Whenever she did something lovely,

689
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,930
I wanted to tell someone,

690
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:38,170
but I had nobody. It was so sad.

691
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,500
You should've called me.

692
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,770
Minjung, let's go.

693
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,870
Go where?

694
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,270
Follow me.

695
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,870
What are we doing here?

696
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,270
Let's get a suit. My gift.

697
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,730
You should wear something nice.

698
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,460
You don't have to. It looks expensive here.

699
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,100
Don't look at the price tag.

700
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,440
They have lots of nice suits.

701
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,970
You don't like the hair pin?

702
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:08,960
Huh?

703
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,600
You don't ever wear it.

704
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,440
I'm saving it for a special occasion.

705
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:16,070
What if I lose it?

706
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,990
If you lose it, I'll buy you another one.

707
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:31,960
Miho, did you see my hair pin?

708
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:35,040
No. Mom, my money is gone, too.

709
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,170
What money?

710
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,700
The laminated one that man gave me.

711
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,500
I haven't seen it. It's gone?

712
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:46,000
Has my sister been here?

713
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,140
Yes.

714
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,600
She went into my room, didn't she?

715
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,370
Yes.

716
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,730
Give it back.

717
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,390
You say that whenever you see me.

718
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,570
Give what back? What?

719
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:05,140
That hair pin! Take it off!

720
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,830
Say hello first.

721
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,600
Take it off!

722
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:11,060
You came here for this stupid hair pin?

723
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,230
You're impossible.

724
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,730
Take it off before I get really mad.

725
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,270
Or I'll take it off for you!

726
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,270
Girl!

727
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,170
You don't even wear it, so why can't I?

728
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,170
This isn't something you can wear!

729
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,730
Oh, girl!

730
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,370
It's not even made with diamonds.

731
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,070
What else?

732
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,760
The money.

733
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,870
What money?

734
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,100
The laminated ten dollar bill.

735
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,370
It was only ten dollars!

736
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,040
I said give it back!

737
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,640
How can you steal from your niece?

738
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,290
Give it back right now.

739
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:55,770
Fine! Here!

740
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,840
I want the laminated one back!

741
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,730
I don't know where that is!

742
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,290
Go laminate that one.

743
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,190
You are unbelievable.

744
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,960
You think all money is the same?

745
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:10,660
You didn't think about why it was laminated?

746
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,430
When your niece got it laminated, even if you're money-crazy,

747
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:19,470
it didn't occur to you that it must be special?

748
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:23,400
Don't you dare come back to my house again.

749
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,240
It's not your house!

750
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,560
She's so rude.

751
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,600
Father!

752
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,440
Oh, hi.

753
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,440
Hello.

754
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,640
I should...

755
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,300
Why don't you finish eating?

756
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,900
What is she doing here?

757
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:57,140
Just because.

758
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,540
Just because?

759
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,040
She heard I hurt my back,

760
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,040
and she's been coming here, cooking me food.

761
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,300
I told her not to come.

762
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:11,470
Why is she doing that?

763
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,670
It's not like that.

764
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,400
What do you mean?

765
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,140
I'm glad, father.

766
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,500
I knew she had feelings for you.

767
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,670
Don't even.

768
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,340
What are you doing here?

769
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,100
You look happy.

770
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,870
Mother.

771
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,140
Hi.

772
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,000
Let me do that.

773
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:52,840
Leave it.

774
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,530
No, I'm good at doing the dishes.

775
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,640
Mother, you open that bag.

776
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:57,940
What is it?

777
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,440
Do you like it?

778
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:12,040
Of course I do!

779
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,190
Try it on.

780
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,830
If it doesn't fit, I'll get it exchanged.

781
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,600
Oh, it's perfect.

782
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:21,670
Whoa!

783
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,270
Shh! Shh!

784
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:27,270
If grandmother finds out, she'll be mad.

785
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,270
I'm not good enough for that?
Egh, hyo, hyo...

786
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,270
Oh, why did you buy this?

787
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,340
This must be expensive.

788
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,600
Mother, I'm sorry about everything.

789
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,670
I know you're upset about my father.

790
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,300
I know he can be too much to handle.

791
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:57,100
Actually, I was so upset that I didn't even want to see you.

792
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:00,290
It's not because of his coat,

793
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,100
but I guess I know how he feels.

794
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:08,040
My family motto is put yourself in others shoes.

795
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:12,340
Having to be on his own must have been hard.

796
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,390
I'll have to be more understanding.

797
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,190
Thank you, mother.

798
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,930
Oh, my. Wow...

799
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,600
Mr. Blabbermouth is here.

800
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:36,400
What? Do I even deserve your hug?

801
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,800
Mom called. It worked like magic.

802
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,160
Where did you get such an idea?

803
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,740
I put myself in her shoes.

804
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,060
My darling husband.

805
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,370
But I should spank you.

806
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,000
You were to talk to me when spending money.

807
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,670
I charged it. You have to pay the bill.

808
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,240
What?

809
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,740
I'm a blabbermouth?

810
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,190
Will you call me that again?

811
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,230
You've had a few days off, so come to work.

812
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,790
I can't run it on my own.

813
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,140
Okay.

814
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,770
Are you finished?

815
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,670
I'm getting ready to go home.

816
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,000
Would you like to learn how to drink?

817
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:24,230
I told you I'd teach you, but I've been busy.

818
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,100
Okay. Let me put these away first.

819
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,290
I'll do it for you.

820
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,500
There's no elevator here.

821
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:41,100
We should've gone to a place with one.

822
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:43,290
A tent bar in the winter is pretty nice.

823
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,430
It's perfect for learning to drink.

824
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,340
I've been feeling lonely.

825
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,760
Probably because your daughter got married.

826
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,800
It's not just because of that.

827
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,960
I get so lonely at night.

828
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,730
Turn the heater on high.

829
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,600
That doesn't help.

830
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:16,440
My feet don't touch anyone else's feet when I stretch my legs out.

831
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:19,900
I feel so lonely.

832
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,870
Daese, you don't feel that way?

833
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,140
I have no time to feel lonely.

834
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:25,730
I'm busy training my daughter in law.

835
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,890
You're training your daughter in law?

836
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:32,200
I should, if I don't want my son to suffer.

837
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:37,600
It must be nice to be so busy with that.

838
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:41,140
When I turn the pages of the calendar,

839
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,540
I feel so heartbroken, as if I'm dying.

840
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:48,170
I'll get another year older this year.

841
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,140
Age is just a number.

842
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:53,460
I've forgotten about my age already.

843
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:00,190
It must be nice.

844
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,930
I don't feel like drinking with no elevator.

845
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,190
Hey! You!

846
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:21,390
It's okay. Things happen.

847
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,640
I'm sorry.

848
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,230
Don't be.

849
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,730
You should go.

850
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,140
Just like that?

851
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,460
You had a drink, so you'll sleep well.

852
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:36,830
Turn the heater on and don't stretch your legs.

853
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,690
Goodnight, Salla.

854
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,390
I'm not sure if I'll fall asleep well.

855
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,100
Goodbye.

856
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,660
Dream about me.

857
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,940
No thanks.

858
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:00,830
Mom, did you eat?

859
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,890
Yes.

860
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:06,330
Did you drink? With whom?

861
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:10,390
A friend. A friend who's clueless.

862
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,970
Daese, were you on a date?

863
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,190
How did you know?

864
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,960
You and Sangnam are the same.

865
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,790
You whistle when you meet women.

866
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,890
I got you!

867
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,270
You did.

868
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,460
Don't tell anyone.

869
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:35,370
I haven't felt this way in a long time.

870
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:38,370
I can't believe I can still feel this way.

871
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,270
I thought I'd grow old all alone.

872
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,960
It's like I'm back in my twenties.

873
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,730
You look the same, too.

874
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,690
I know you're lying, but I still feel good.

875
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,890
Good for you.

876
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:54,540
You deserve to be happy.

877
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:57,270
Who is she? I'm curious.

878
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,900
Later.

879
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,640
Don't tell the kids yet.

880
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,440
It's embarrassing.

881
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,670
I'll have to see.

882
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,100
If you keep being mean, I'll tell Gwangbak.

883
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:11,040
Daese, would you like to have a beer?

884
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:15,460
He's divorced?

885
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,160
Yes.

886
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:21,270
He moved out recently.

887
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,370
That's good.

888
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,000
Did you tell him about Miho?

889
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,230
Not yet.

890
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,390
Tell him! He's divorced now.

891
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:33,800
Daese,

892
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,100
I think I  must be a really bad woman.

893
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,640
I didn't show it, but when I heard

894
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,460
he was divorced, I was so happy,

895
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:48,460
as if I was waiting for that to happen.

896
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,370
I'm so mean, aren't I?

897
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,100
But it's natural.

898
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:55,730
You two were meant to be together.

899
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,560
She wasn't the right woman for him,

900
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:01,640
since they got a divorce.

901
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,440
Don't let him go.

902
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:06,870
It happened so he could be with you.

903
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,730
Is it okay?

904
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,330
Can I have him?

905
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,530
You weren't the cause of their divorce.

906
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:17,670
They broke up on their own.

907
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,170
You two are meant to be together.

908
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,670
It's a good thing, Sunjeong.

909
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,930
Your father in law dropped by.

910
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:50,290
I'm also worried about the kids.

911
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,290
I'm sorry, father.

912
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:59,290
I'm going to bring them when things improve.

913
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,460
How will you raise them?

914
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:09,690
They're my kids, so I must.

915
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:26,060
Welcome!

916
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,440
Thank you.

917
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:04,770
See how much I can borrow on my credit.

918
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,960
Or I'll have to take out a mortgage.

919
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,230
Yes. Call me right back.

920
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,830
Where is Subak?

921
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,460
She said she has plans.

922
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:17,370
Oh, she's such a goof off.

923
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:20,170
She leaves when there's work.

924
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,940
That's your nickname.

925
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,640
I'm making dumpling stew, your favorite,

926
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,560
so why don't you drop by?

927
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:51,530
You're busy?

928
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:52,770
Okay.

929
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,890
Judge, you don't have to do that.

930
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:01,140
Yeongdal, you move the dumplings.

931
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,770
Don't ask our judge to do it.

932
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,060
When's the announcement?

933
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,370
Huh?

934
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,770
Seoul National University.

935
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,460
It isn't yet.

936
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,460
Mom.

937
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:22,870
I have something to tell you.

938
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,190
What is it?

939
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,160
I'm sorry, mom.

940
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:33,070
I can't become a judge.

941
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:34,830
I got into the Maritime University.

942
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,930
It was early admission, so I can't change it.

943
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:39,670
I'm going to become a captain.

944
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,000
What did you say?

945
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,870
What did you just say?

946
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,560
I'm going to become a captain.

947
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,260
What?

948
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,960
Are you out of your mind?

949
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:53,600
What's happening?
They were fine just now.

950
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,870
I think Haebak did something.

951
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,270
- Did she get pregnant?
- Man.

952
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,270
What are you going to do?

953
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,030
Let's go.

954
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:06,060
What's wrong?

955
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,690
Captain?

956
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:10,640
How can you become a captain?

957
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:13,960
I had such high hopes for you!

958
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,600
Anggeum, don't hit her.

959
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:23,160
How can all my daughters disappoint me like this? Huh?

960
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,770
Captain? How could you?

961
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,160
- Get out.
- Hey!

962
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,870
Uncle, let me go.

963
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,140
Daebak, tell your father to come home! Hurry!

964
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,100
Oh, boy.

965
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:36,640
Ugh!

966
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:39,290
Oh, what do I do?

967
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,040
Aeji, Jungji.

968
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:46,640
They're asleep. Sit.

969
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:52,240
Haebak, the kids are asleep, so tell me.

970
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,640
I've already been there, so I know.

971
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:58,730
You must be shaking with fear.

972
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,430
Don't be scared. The baby is your weapon.

973
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,600
Have you seen a doctor?

974
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:05,400
No.

975
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,670
No?

976
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,440
Who is it?

977
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,370
What do you mean?

978
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,690
Who is the bastard?

979
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,770
You have to tell me, so we can fix this.

980
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,400
He's a captain?

981
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:16,440
Huh?

982
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:18,140
A captain of which ship?

983
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:21,140
Is he hiding from you?

984
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:22,600
I don't know what you're saying.

985
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:26,370
I know everything.
Your belly will grow soon.

986
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,290
That captain won't take care of you?

987
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,870
That bastard!

988
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,370
Give me his number.

989
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,000
We should teach him a lesson.

990
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:35,800
Why are there so many people like us here?

991
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,930
How many is it already?

992
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:39,670
Hobak, me, you.

993
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,640
Come here.

994
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:44,960
You're dead. Come here!

995
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:48,000
Mrs. Lee, I mean, Anggeum, don't do this.

996
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:49,800
What's done is done.

997
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,660
I'll meet the captain and take care of it.

998
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,640
You don't know what you're talking about.

999
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:57,870
Oh, of course I do! I have experience.

1000
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:02,400
When I found out, I wanted to die.

1001
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,140
What are you talking about?

1002
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,060
It's not that. Come here.

1003
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:10,030
It's not? What is it, then? He's a captain?

1004
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,940
The person you called is unavailable,

1005
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,900
so your call will be directed...

1006
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:35,230
Are you busy? You didn't have to come.

1007
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,440
Because I was happy.

1008
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,500
I've been having great luck since we started

1009
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:42,000
seeing each other again, so

1010
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:43,570
I wanted to take you out.

1011
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:47,190
Would you like a picture?

1012
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,500
Yes, please.

1013
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:51,540
Minjung, is it okay?

1014
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,440
Sure, let's do it.

1015
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,270
Here it is.

1016
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,960
What are you talking about?

1017
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,070
I lost my house?

1018
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:22,600
Hello?

1019
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:24,540
Is anyone home?

1020
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,260
Honey, what are they talking about?

1021
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,730
They told us to move out of the house.

1022
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:45,190
Oh, Bong. Oh...

1023
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:50,830
The deeds to the house.

1024
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:53,070
The deeds to the house.

1025
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,940
The deeds to the house!

1026
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:01,600
Where are the deeds to the house?

1027
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:08,370
Bong! Oh, no! Bong! Oh...

1029
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,330
Minjung, don't go into shock...

1030
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:45,330
I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't.

1031
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,460
Why are you hesitating?

1032
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:48,000
Don't you know what this house means?

1033
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,190
This is all your fault, Anggeum!

1034
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,370
You and I should die!

1035
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:53,540
- Get out!
- Mom!

1036
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:56,140
Please leave. 
I won't call you mother.

1037
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:57,000
Stop it!

1038
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,570
I won't come back again.

1039
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:02,100
I came to see her, but she hates me.

1040
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:05,190
Remember when we put up the door plate?

1041
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,290
Will I be able to put this up again?

1042
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,640
This is all your fault!

1043
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:13,870
Get out!
Go somewhere and die or something!

1044
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,870
Mother, I'm sorry.

1045
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,830
Why would you be sorry?

1046
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,390
I didn't raise my children properly.
