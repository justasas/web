2
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,960
I need this for my writing.

3
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,030
I need to know how it feels.

4
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,870
Your teeth.

5
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,140
I know, I've been brushing like crazy.

6
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,700
Hey, hey.

7
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,040
Where are you going?

8
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,670
Research.

9
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,900
Hey, aren't you going to say hi?

10
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,970
Why won't you say hi?

11
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,570
I'm your brother's friend!
Can't you say hi?

12
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,940
No.

13
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,500
You...

14
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,790
But I'm like your brother.

15
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,260
Stop following me. It's embarrassing.

16
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,330
Yes, I'm on my way.

17
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,730
I'll be there in about five minutes.

18
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,070
Yes. I'll be there soon.

19
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,870
Parcel service!

20
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,960
Hello?

21
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,240
Dad!

22
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,490
Yes, Aeji!

23
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,200
 Why is your phone always busy?

24
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,790
It's because I'm really busy.

25
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,330
I'm going to forget your face, dad.

26
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,860
But I won't forget your face.

27
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,530
Why did you call?
Tell me why you called.

28
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,900
Dad, I want to learn taekwondo.

29
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,730
You want to learn taekwondo?

30
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,890
Okay. I'll tell mom to send you.

31
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,460
Aeji, I'll talk to you later.

32
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,460
Oh, dad, don't do the cat sound.

33
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,760
Aeji, I'm getting a call.

34
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,660
Aeji, I love you.

35
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,390
Yes, parcel service.

36
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,700
Oh, my! Son!

37
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,460
Make my day.

38
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,460
Madam Park Salla, do whatever you want.

39
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,530
Get in.

40
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,790
Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my...

41
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,660
Oh, my. I'm so excited.
A foreign car!

42
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,160
How much does a car like this cost?

43
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,490
You wouldn't know.

44
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,330
Your father never got to enjoy this.

45
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,790
Why did he have to leave us so soon?

46
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,700
His temper was just as short as yours.

47
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,870
That darn old man!

48
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,430
How could he just die leaving behind two little children?

49
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,940
I'm sure he didn't want to die.

50
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,370
And to be honest, he wasn't old.

51
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,670
He was my age when he died.

52
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,030
He probably aged on the other side.

53
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,990
I wonder if he got remarried.

54
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,040
He was like me, so he must be popular.

55
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,230
He better not!

56
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,070
If he did, I'm going to destroy him.

57
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,760
Stop thinking about him and enjoy your life.

58
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,390
You should meet someone.

59
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,440
No, I'm too old for that.

60
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,540
There were many chances,

61
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,640
but I never took them because of you.

62
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,460
Mom, do whatever you want to do today.

63
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,960
I got a credit card.

64
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,760
Really? I can just use it?

65
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,290
Yes. The director gave me permission.

66
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,530
Those darn women.

67
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,590
I'll make them crazy jealous!

68
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,440
Look at her walking.

69
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,240
Honk at her.

70
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,230
Roll down the window.

71
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,260
Anggeum!

72
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,260
What kind of car...

73
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,070
Mother.

74
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,330
This is my son's car.
It's a foreign car.

75
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,140
It's not my car.

76
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,070
I'd ask you to get in, but there's no room.

77
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,760
Hey, roll up the window.

78
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,600
Mom, was that something you wanted to do?

79
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,790
Of course.

80
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,270
Did you see her getting upset?

81
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,200
That was nothing compared to what she put me through.

82
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,670
Hey, park really close.

83
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,140
Park close to the window so they can see.

84
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,300
Closer. Honk.

85
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,600
Oh, my.

86
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,000
- Who's car is that.
- Closer, closer.

87
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,070
A little closer. Closer.

88
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,000
I see Salla in the car.

89
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,390
A little closer.

90
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,960
Subak could do it, so why can't you?

91
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,760
Why did you break the window?

92
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,070
Oh, what do I do?

93
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,590
Don't worry.

94
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,430
I'll replace it with stronger glass.

95
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,200
Call the window repair shop.

96
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,090
Did you hear that?

97
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,140
Okay, everyone.

98
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,560
Don't worry about the cracked window.

99
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,830
A flying bird doesn't look back.

100
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:14,840
Forget about your husbands or kids
and have a good time here.

101
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,470
Oh, let me introduce myself.

102
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,340
I'm Heo Sedal,
Madam Park Salla's only son

103
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:27,370
and Madam Lee Anggeum's son in law.

104
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,740
And I have an announcement.

105
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,140
I'll pay for today's lunch.

106
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,430
Oh, please sit.
The window will crack more.

107
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,760
Enjoy two orders each.

108
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,640
I see some who need three orders.

109
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,660
And do take two orders to go.

110
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll pay with this.

111
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,200
Add the cost for the new window.

112
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,530
Salla, your son is amazing.

113
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,090
I wish I had a son like him.

114
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,200
I know.

115
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,860
A son in law is someone else's son.

116
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,440
But my son is mine and that's what counts.

117
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,160
Bragging about your son in law is no good.

118
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,030
Don't you agree?

119
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,430
Right.

120
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,790
Your son must be doing great.

121
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,370
He is doing really great.

122
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:34,470
A few nights ago he bought a bunch of gifts for his wife's family.

123
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,300
Anggeum, I heard you really enjoyed that.

124
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,890
This is why you shouldn't mistreat people.

125
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,260
You never know what will happen.

126
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,930
Oh, Minjung.

127
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,990
You deliver here?

128
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,260
Yes.

129
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,060
Mom, say hello.
This is Minjung.

130
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,230
He's making a delivery here.

131
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,460
Oh, you're Subak's husband!

132
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,760
Oh, it must be so hard on you.

133
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,500
I heard you're living with your in laws.

134
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,840
Yes. Hello.

135
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,000
Things must be really tough.

136
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,140
I feel so bad for you.

137
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,140
Your mother in law is here.
Say hello.

138
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,940
She's not going to get away with this.

139
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,790
She can't do that to me!

140
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,830
Mom, did you boil Jungji's bottles?

141
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,890
That's not my job! You do it.

142
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,370
What's wrong?
Wasn't lunch fun?

143
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,260
I'm furious. That's why.

144
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,600
The beauty salon woman,
she's acting like she owns the world.

145
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:59,560
Sedal drove her to the restaurant in a foreign car and broke their window trying to park really close.

146
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,260
He broke the window?

147
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,060
She was just trying to imitate you.

148
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,660
Why did Minjung have to make a delivery just then?

149
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,740
I couldn't believe my eyes.

150
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,370
He came to that restaurant?

151
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,470
Unbelievable.

152
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:23,340
They were laughing at me for having bragged about my son in law, and it was humiliating.

153
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,940
I don't even want to see you.

154
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,030
How can you say that to me?

155
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,640
You enjoyed a lot of things thanks to me.

156
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,600
This is why money is important.

157
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,100
When I gave you money, you loved me and Minjung, but now, you hate us.

158
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,390
How could you change so completely?

159
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,930
Mom, you're really mean!

160
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,500
Daughters are useless.

161
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,760
Where did my knife go?

162
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,340
And the cutting board is missing, too.

163
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,190
Huh?

164
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,030
What happened here?

165
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,140
Uncle! Uncle!

166
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,090
Yes?

167
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,730
Did you empty out the fridge?

168
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,370
Why would I do that?

169
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,840
The vegetables I bought yesterday are gone,

170
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,570
my knife cutting board and pots are gone.

171
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,830
You didn't put them somewhere?

172
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,160
I saw Gwangbak carrying all kinds of stuff.

173
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,290
Huh?

174
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,860
Why did you bring so much stuff?

175
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,790
It's not like you're moving.

176
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,960
It just sort of happened.

177
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,260
I thought we'd need them if we wanted to make stew and cut the fish.

178
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,470
Oh, boy.

179
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,340
They might think we're moving in together.

180
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,240
You like me a lot, huh?

181
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,030
Why do you always tease me?

182
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,430
What are your plans?

183
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,260
Plans?

184
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,530
You lured me to go night fishing with no plans?

185
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,930
I didn't lure you.

186
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,790
You did.

187
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,790
Let's catch some fish and eat them.

188
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,240
- And?
- And make stew.

189
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,260
And?

190
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,960
With stew, we'd need alcohol. Let's drink.

191
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,600
And?

192
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,970
And make noodles.

193
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,300
And?

194
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,030
Reheat the stew and eat it again.

195
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,260
And?

196
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,340
And eat more noodles?

197
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,640
Just be honest. You want to kiss me.

198
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,640
I don't! Stop teasing me!

199
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,100
Did I make you nervous?

200
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,340
Yes.

201
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,140
So I made you nervous.

202
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,740
I was going to do it, if you were honest.

203
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,470
Honesty is in right now.

204
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,000
Giving it to you straight.

205
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,740
So be honest with me.

206
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,470
You want to kiss me, don't you?

207
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,470
Yes.

208
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,790
Did you brush your teeth?

209
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,570
I brushed them really clean.

210
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,360
I brushed them three times today.

211
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,790
I'm impressed,

212
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,390
but there'll be lots of people there.

213
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,530
Hey, aim it right.

214
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,660
You should open your mouth wider.

215
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,870
How would I do that?

216
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,370
My mouth is pretty big as it is. Ah.

217
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,790
There you go!

218
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,030
Who am I?

219
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,600
Honey!

220
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,160
Louder.

221
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,390
My honey!

222
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,240
Oh, good job.

223
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,160
Others might say we're being silly,

224
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,240
but I'd say we're being romantic.

225
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,240
Romantic is different from silly, okay?

226
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,570
I know.

227
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,390
How do you spell it?

228
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,600
I lived in the States since I was young.

229
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,340
That woman at home wouldn't know that.

230
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,300
I'm going.

231
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,760
Just like that?

232
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,100
This looks perfectly fine.

233
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,760
That's enough. Stop.

234
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,240
Sedal!

235
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,500
Oh, it's been a while.

236
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,030
You live here?

237
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,140
Was that the director's car?

238
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,430
Yes.

239
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,990
How long have you been out here? So sneaky!

240
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,230
How much did you see?

241
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,030
See what?

242
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,660
If you didn't see anything, that's fine.

243
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,540
Did the director drive you home?

244
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,390
Of course.

245
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,300
Your director must be a very nice person.

246
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,100
Yes, very nice.

247
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,890
He gave me $100,000 when you gave me $3!

248
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,040
What?

249
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,770
Wait for me, Sedal!

250
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,040
Dad!

251
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,700
Hey! You're wrinkling my suit.

252
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,060
They're just happy to see their dad.

253
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,640
Dad, you smell really nice.

254
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,960
I don't.

255
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,560
It's really nice. It's fantastic.

256
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,430
You do! Are you wearing perfume?

257
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,430
Where did you get such keen sense of smell?

258
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,070
Of course I smell nice.

259
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,700
The director wears expensive perfume.

260
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,990
You smell like a woman.

261
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,160
The director uses women's perfume?

262
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,870
Of course.

263
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,960
Oh, he has lots of different kinds of perfume.

264
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,190
The director likes a wide variety of stuff.

265
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,530
Pack me some rice rolls tomorrow.

266
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,890
Why?

267
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,870
I'm going to an amusement park.

268
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,500
With her?

269
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,330
What?

270
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,540
The woman who calls you "honey."

271
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,840
What is he talking about?

272
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,240
You shouldn't say things like that!

273
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,870
Why an amusement park?

274
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,040
The director wants to go because he's lived in the States all his life.

275
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,930
So he wants to experience Korean amusement parks.

276
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,570
He lived in the States for a long time?

277
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,890
Yes.

278
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,490
Be nice to the director.
It must get lonely.

279
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,830
I'll make really good rice rolls.

280
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,270
What do I have?
I should go grocery shopping.

281
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,300
Mom.

282
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,890
Why aren't you in bed?

283
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,260
I can't fall asleep.

284
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,540
A woman called dad "honey."

285
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,540
It was a spam message.

286
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,600
Don't worry about it and go to bed.

287
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,370
Mom, you don't know anything.

288
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,140
They won't bite.

289
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,390
They must know we're here.

290
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,230
Should we just go home?

291
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,560
Give it more time. We just got here.

292
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:55,490
Right, since you packed so much stuff, we should stay here for days.

293
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,930
Not for days.

294
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,290
Oh, it's cold.

295
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,440
You're cold?

296
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,660
Yes, it must be because of the water.

297
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,890
I think it's nice and cool.

298
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,760
To catch a fish...

299
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,640
I have coffee in the truck.

300
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,570
Go get some.
I have to keep my eye on that.

301
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,890
They won't bite yet.

302
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,930
I think I have a fever.

303
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,660
You have a fever?

304
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,140
Yes, I'm shivering.

305
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,060
Catching fish isn't very important.

306
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,470
Let's go.

307
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,790
Oh! Oh! What are you doing? Sangnam!

308
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,440
Oh, my.

309
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,340
Did you bring this from home?

310
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,100
Yes. I brought a CD player, too.

311
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,190
You came prepared.

312
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,060
You brought everything but the kitchen sink.

313
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,500
Didn't your mom say anything?

314
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,190
Oh, you snuck out.
Like the movies.

315
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,690
It's research.

316
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,260
Research on night fishing.

317
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,370
How do you want to do it?

318
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,190
It's a bit creepy here.

319
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,390
I'm a bit scared.

320
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,560
You can lean on me.

321
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,540
What?

322
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,470
When you go night fishing, it's scary,

323
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,960
so you tend to lean on each other.

324
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,690
Says who?

325
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,340
Someone. A dating expert.

326
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,540
Are you warm now?

327
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,500
Yes.

328
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,360
Can you stay here?
I'll check on the rod.

329
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,570
Stay. I'm scared.

330
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,160
But you told me to lean on you.

331
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,800
Fishing isn't important.

332
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:34,770
Here and now.
We are what's important.

333
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,270
Oh!

334
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,370
Us? Here and now?

335
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,500
I don't go night fishing with just anyone.

336
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,260
This is my first time.

337
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,970
Ha! All women say it's their first time.

338
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,390
This is my first time night fishing.

339
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,390
Earlier,

340
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,300
if I remember correctly,

341
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,200
you said you wanted to make fish stew

342
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,260
and have a drink.

343
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,440
But let's switch the order.

344
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,300
Look at me.

345
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,170
Stop that and just look.

346
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,970
Don't change your mind later.

347
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,400
I won't.

348
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,340
Don't call the police.

349
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,660
Never.

350
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,100
Your eyes are very pretty.

351
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,560
They look like puppy eyes.

352
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,240
Puppies have my eyes.

353
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,490
Whatever.

354
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,030
It's biting!

355
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,970
You didn't come here for that, did you?

356
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,930
There's a motel over there.

357
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,790
We're leaving in a while.

358
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,030
Let's finish what we started.

359
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,270
Did you order noodles?

360
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,470
No, we didn't!
Unbelievable!

361
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,890
Why would you bring that?

362
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,300
Someone ordered it for sure.

363
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,740
Give it to us. We'll eat it.

364
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,290
You sure?

365
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,970
Here.

366
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,570
It looks good.

367
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,860
Let's eat.

368
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,460
You're not eating?

369
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,640
I don't feel like it.

370
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:38,000
Having hot noodles at a quiet place is making me miss one thing.

371
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,030
What do you miss?

372
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,990
Guess what it is.

373
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:53,170
I wish someone could guess what it is.

374
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,640
Sir! What's wrong with you?

375
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,770
- Do you need...
- No, we don't!

376
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,570
You're really sharp.

377
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,870
I was just thinking of this.
Thank you.

378
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,160
I never knew fishing would be this crazy.

379
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,190
I thought we'd be left alone.

380
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,230
You seem very desperate.

381
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,930
Normally, it's the men.

382
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,260
Sir!

383
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,430
Sunjeong, thanks.

384
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,840
When you're finished, just leave them.

385
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,770
No, I'll clean up.

386
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,000
Why don't you eat with us?

387
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,360
I ate earlier with Miho.

388
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,230
She doesn't look so good.

389
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,030
I feel so bad for her.

390
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,700
Everyone has a sad story.

391
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,930
This is all because of her.

392
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,660
She borrowed so much money

393
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,190
that Sunjeong had to break up with

394
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,060
the man she loved and married an older man.

395
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,100
And she divorced him soon after.

396
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,740
Whenever I see her, I feel guilty.

397
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,290
And heartbroken.

398
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,790
She ruined many lives.

399
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,470
I was bankrupt, her family went bankrupt.

400
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,790
And she ruined her little sister's life.

401
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,470
I guess it's fate.

402
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,870
I wish we could find someone nice for her.

403
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,890
Oh, how old is she?

404
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,870
Thirty-eight.

405
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,840
She's at her prime, but look at her.

406
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,430
I'll ask around.

407
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,870
The problem is that she hasn't gotten over him.

408
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,540
He's probably married by now.

409
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,270
Probably.

410
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,260
When she meets someone, she'll get over him.

411
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,500
I should start asking around tomorrow.

412
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,230
I'm home.

413
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,100
Who is it?

414
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,370
It's me, mother.
Don't be alarmed.

415
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,070
What are you doing?

416
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,370
I'm trying to see my girls.

417
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,800
But what if you wake them up?

418
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,740
They already woke up several times.

419
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,490
What's going on?

420
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,290
It's Minjung.

421
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,840
He surprised me trying to see the girls.

422
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:37,040
That's enough. He just misses them.

423
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,300
Go to bed.

424
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,470
Yes, father.

425
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,840
I'm sorry, mother.

426
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,540
Good night.

427
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,030
It's like he wants me to hate him more.

428
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,870
You're still up?

429
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,770
I don't go to sleep early.
That's tacky.

430
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,070
Did you sign Aeji up for taekwondo?

431
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,040
No, I signed her up for ballet.

432
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,730
Why?

433
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,140
Mom said a girl shouldn't learn taekwondo.

434
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,430
She said ballet would be better.

435
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,840
I took ballet lessons when I was little.

436
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,930
But Aeji wants to learn taekwondo.

437
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,160
I already enrolled her.

438
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,230
It's nice and cheap.

439
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,500
I didn't go to an expensive one.

440
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,190
Subak,

441
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,870
Aeji's our daughter.

442
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,600
You should talk to me, not your mother.

443
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,900
What's wrong with talking to my mom?

444
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,990
She's raising our girls?

445
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,090
Then why don't you take care of everything?

446
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,230
Why did you have to deliver the package then?

447
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,960
You have no common sense!

448
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,870
Mom got embarrassed and yelled at me!

449
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,160
Sedal drove his mom in a foreign car,

450
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,230
but you had to deliver a package.

451
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,640
Don't you feel anything?

452
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,890
What am I supposed to feel?

453
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,100
What?

454
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,770
Sunjeong.

455
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,370
What do you want from me?
I told you!

456
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,000
I never loved you!

457
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,930
Sunjeong, why are you acting like this?

458
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,570
Don't do this.
This isn't like you.

459
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,740
This is so sudden!

460
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,830
I just want to break up with you!

461
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,890
Let me go. I told you I hate you.

462
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,390
Just tell me the reason.

463
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,800
I'll change.

464
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,800
I'll change everything you don't like.

465
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,940
I'm tired of you.

466
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,190
I hate you.

467
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,490
Is it because of him?

468
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,860
It can't be him.

469
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,730
He can't make you happy.

470
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,590
Why not? He's rich.

471
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,100
Can you make me happy?

472
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,840
Do you have money?

473
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:08,600
Why? We're going to feed off love?

474
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,270
Dream on.

475
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,270
The 7 years with you have been exhausting.

476
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,470
All we do is go for walks when we're on dates.

477
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,100
I'm sick and tired of it.

478
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,930
I don't want a poor man.

479
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,490
Don't drag this on.
Let me go.

480
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,730
I can't break up with you like this.

481
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,090
I can't let you go to him.

482
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,770
How...

483
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,270
We've been in love for 7 years.

484
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,400
How could you throw that all away?

485
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,730
Can you live without me?

486
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,330
Can you forget me?

487
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,430
I can't forget you.

488
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,500
Do it.

489
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,660
I'm choosing money, so get over me.

490
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,770
Don't ever call me again.

491
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,570
Ever.

492
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,660
Sunjeong! Sunjeong!

493
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,570
Sunjeong! Sunjeong!

494
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,760
Sunjeong!

495
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,870
Sunjeong!

496
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,100
Who's there?

497
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,140
What are you doing?

498
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,890
Mother.

499
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,640
You were the cat?

500
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,870
I can't believe you did that.

501
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,600
Was it fun to trick me?

502
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,790
You saw Sedal at my get-together, right?

503
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,140
Didn't you feel anything about it?

504
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,500
I guess you'd never know.

505
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,700
What's going on?

506
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,660
He was making the cat noise.

507
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,000
Why would he do that?

508
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,730
Ask him yourself.

509
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:45,000
You're eating that?
You should eat rice.

510
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,440
There's no rice.

511
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,000
How can there be no rice?

512
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,140
Anyone of us could get hungry.

513
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,230
Make more rice from now on.

514
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,160
Don't give him stress about food.

515
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,040
Being stressed about food is the worst.

516
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,670
It's not because I want him to starve.

517
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,870
I just didn't like him lying to me.

518
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,290
He was being sneaky and lying to me.

519
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,230
I can't seem to like him.

520
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,730
Why can't you just let it slide?

521
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,190
This isn't life or death.

522
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,640
He could look for food if he's hungry.

523
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,060
He's just being careful.

524
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,390
But he's doing whatever he wants.

525
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,300
He steals, fights, lies and makes cat noises.

526
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,790
Don't be like that.

527
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,640
You said it yourself.

528
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,730
That it's like he wants you to hate him.

529
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,040
You're intentionally hating him.

530
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,960
I shouldn't have let them move in with us.

531
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,690
You're the one who begged me to let them.

532
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,330
He's not friendly like other son in laws.

533
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,030
You said you like him because he's quiet.

534
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,430
Other son in laws treat their mother in laws like their own mothers.

535
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,270
But my son in laws are not like that.

536
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,870
Son in laws aren't your real sons.

537
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,500
You said it yourself.

538
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,960
A daughter in law isn't your daughter.

539
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,560
I feel so lonely, so lonely.

540
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,960
How come you never side with me?

541
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,100
Put yourself in my shoes.

542
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,500
Eat, eat. Take your time.

543
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,500
- Eat.
- Okay.

544
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,640
Don't worry about other people.

545
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,170
Eat whatever you want to eat.

546
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,270
Turn the lights on.

547
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,230
And don't make any cat noises.

548
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,730
I won't.

549
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,540
And try to be friendly to my wife.

550
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,690
Joke around with her sometimes.

551
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,830
Do you understand what I mean?

552
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,690
Think of her as your own mother.

553
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,560
She likes that kind of stuff.

554
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,430
Eat. It'll get soggy.

555
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,770
What did you save my name as in your phone?

556
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,460
It's a secret.

557
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,770
What did you save my name as?

558
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,570
I'm not tell you, either.

559
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,530
It's obvious.

560
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,170
Husband?

561
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,290
No way.

562
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,030
My love Sangnam?

563
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,730
Eww.

564
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,160
If you show me yours, I'll tell you.

565
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,260
Call me.

566
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,060
You,

567
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,300
are,

568
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,830
my?

569
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,060
I got it!

570
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,190
What is it?

571
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,370
Isn't it the movie title?

572
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,190
This was a movie?

573
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,200
You are my destiny.

574
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,190
Right?

575
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,870
No?

576
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,370
Dream on.

577
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,370
Then what is it?
Show me.

578
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,160
- It's my sister.
- Answer it.

579
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,940
What is it?

580
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,840
I'm doing research.

581
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,870
Right now?

582
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,000
Man...

583
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,760
Hello?

584
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,800
I'm the manager,

585
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,160
and the fish are biting.

586
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,670
I called because that woman is angry.

587
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,800
I think she has an ulterior motive.

588
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,640
You should hurry up and do whatever it is.

589
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,460
You're a really dense guy.

590
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,890
Don't make her anxious. Just do it.

591
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,700
She's really asking for it.

592
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,690
I'm not asking for it!

593
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,960
I can't believe you!

594
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,200
Let's take care of that later and deal with the fish first.

595
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,660
Grab it, hurry.

596
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,340
Why are you grabbing me?

597
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,490
Huh?

598
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,000
Help! Help!

599
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,440
Help!

600
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,340
Why are you swimming here?

601
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,830
It's not deep. Get out of there.

602
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,260
Hurry up and get out.

603
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,230
Get out!

604
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,770
It's only knee deep.

605
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh, I'm sleepy.

606
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,640
You can sleep when your father goes to work.

607
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,270
We have to do what he says.

608
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,900
Mom, this milk is expired.
Throw it out.

609
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,970
A few days is okay.

610
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,690
Leave it. Minjung or uncle can drink it.

611
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,690
Did you sleep well, mother?

612
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,390
I didn't because of a cat.

613
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,440
Oh, mother,

614
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,140
I'm sorry. I won't do that again.

615
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,540
Oh, why are you massaging my shoulders?

616
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,690
I'll try to be more like your own son.

617
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,640
Oh, that hurts.

618
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,830
Stop that.

619
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,990
My mom doesn't like stuff like that.

620
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,040
It's too early for that!

621
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,830
I'm going to work.

622
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,800
Oh, I don't believe you.

623
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,500
Why couldn't you go along with that?

624
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,870
You said you wanted him to act like your son.

625
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,370
Nothing will make you happy.

626
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,500
Only I can deal with your temper.

627
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,870
He's not good at being friendly.

628
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,940
Ugh!

629
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,000
His grip is too strong!

630
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,540
We didn't have any fish stew.

631
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,440
And we didn't kiss.

632
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,390
Let's save it for a special occasion.

633
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,060
Ouch!

634
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,600
Stop drooling and go over there.

635
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,600
I'll give you some later.

636
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,460
Stay far away from me.

637
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,690
How mean.
You're only packing dad's lunch.

638
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,930
Your son is starving here.

639
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,870
You don't even know who that's for!

640
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,640
It's for your dad and the director.

641
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,940
It might be someone else.

642
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,000
Stop that.

643
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,600
How dare you!

644
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,370
Stop drooling over food.

645
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,740
You should be more picky, like other kids.

646
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,830
Even if I gave you dog food, you'd eat it.

647
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,160
Yours is here.

648
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,600
Eat this.

649
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,100
But it isn't pretty!

650
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,340
How can you give this to your son?

651
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:01,290
Oh, but the ends are more delicious!

652
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,990
Oh...

653
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:09,970
Okay, okay.

654
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:13,560
Don't make him cry! It's bad luck.

655
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,270
Why is he crying so early in the morning?

656
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,270
Mom won't give me rice rolls.

657
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,670
Give them some. Don't starve them.

658
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,870
They can eat later.

659
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,500
I hope the director likes them.

660
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,570
You don't look like you're going to work.

661
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,600
You look like you're going to goof off.

662
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,730
My nickname is Goof-off.

663
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,270
Goof-off Heo Sedal. Bye.

664
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,770
You look cool, honey.

665
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,500
Oh, you love it when I go to work.

666
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:50,500
I do! Work hard for the director, okay?

667
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,140
I hope the rice rolls are good.

668
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,000
I hope the director likes them.

669
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,870
I'll see you later.

670
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,370
Have a good day.

671
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,940
Okay.

672
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,140
Oh, I'm dizzy.

673
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,800
It's me.

674
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,730
How are you?
Can you go out for fish stew?

675
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,040
I made reservations.

676
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,370
I would love to but I'm coughing.

677
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh, no.

678
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,900
I can't believe you caught a cold.

679
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,670
You didn't catch a cold?

680
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,600
I never do.

681
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,730
I'm sorry.

682
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,370
Let's meet another time.

683
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,140
I don't want to give this to you.

684
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,230
Okay, then.

685
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,660
Take care of yourself.

686
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,440
I know this sounds lame,

687
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:26,540
but who cares?

688
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,270
We're apart but our hearts are together.

689
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,230
Bye.

690
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,040
Okay.

691
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:16,770
You must like this kind of food.

692
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,790
I had made reservations here for today.

693
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,960
And I felt like having fish stew.

694
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:30,030
Well, are you the type who doesn't like to splurge on food?

695
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,900
- What?
- The restaurants we've been to.

696
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,840
You always eat stuff like this.

697
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,430
I'm not saying this is bad.

698
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:40,400
I actually love food like this.

699
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:48,870
Are you asking if I'm stingy comparatively to what I earn?

700
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,230
No, I'm not really asking that.

701
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,830
Actually,

702
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,330
I spend a lot of money on food and clothes.

703
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,260
I make money to spend it.

704
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,540
The same goes for women.

705
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:05,370
I do whatever the woman asks.

706
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:09,160
You said okay when I asked you to this restaurant.

707
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,970
Actually, I would've gone to any restaurant.

708
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:18,400
When I went to China, if you had asked me for a handbag, I would've bought you one.

709
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:21,770
So don't try to test me.

710
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,440
You should be honest with me.

711
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:27,170
Okay. I will.

712
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,690
Oh, my!

713
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,960
He said he'll do anything for you?

714
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,790
Yes.

715
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,730
I don't have to explain anything to him.

716
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,870
I didn't say anything but he knew.

717
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,100
He was fighting the urges to do things for me and was wondering about me.

718
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:47,330
He told me to ask for anything.

719
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,430
I thought he might be stingy.

720
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,600
He might be testing me.

721
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:53,730
Testing you?

722
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,640
To see if I'm after his money.

723
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,270
But that's for the really rich people.

724
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,040
But why did you come home so early?

725
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:02,440
He has to go to work.

726
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:04,240
Right after lunch.

727
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,370
But it's Sunday.

728
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,870
He's busy. He's making money.

729
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,140
Right.

730
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,830
The man makes the money and the woman spends the money.

731
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,560
That's the ideal couple.

732
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,100
Be prepared for him to propose.

733
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,500
Of course.

734
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:39,460
Excuse me...

735
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,540
Oh?

736
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,960
You came!

737
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:46,600
I thought I'd drop by.

738
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,690
You can't just drop by.
You must work out.

739
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,000
I don't know how to do this.

740
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:53,500
I've never worked out before.

741
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,440
I'll teach you. First of all.

742
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:58,690
Oh, my! Agh!

743
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,700
You've seen MMA on TV, right?

744
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,930
This is the position.

745
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,870
Isn't it a bit too steamy?

746
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,100
This can't be.

747
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,400
Is this how it's done?

748
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,840
That's for those who are good.

749
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,230
It won't be that hard in the beginning.

750
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,560
 We'll start with the basics.

751
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,230
I think it might be fun.

752
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,470
Hello.

753
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,370
If you need a parcel service, please call us.

754
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,870
I told you we have someone else.

755
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,330
You're starting to bother me.

756
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,330
I'm sorry.

757
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,160
But if you change your mind, do call us.

758
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,940
We'll give you a good deal.

759
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,640
Have a nice day.

760
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,570
I'll take this out.

761
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,790
Just leave it.

762
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,760
It's okay. I'm on my way out anyway.

763
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:45,960
Huh?

764
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,840
Mom, did you see the yogurt?

765
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,370
I was going to use it for a facial.

766
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,570
Uncle, did you eat it?

767
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:05,290
What?

768
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,000
I put yogurt and fruit in the fridge for a facial.

769
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:10,540
I didn't see it.

770
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,670
Who else would eat that?

771
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,970
You should've asked.

772
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,660
I can't believe you.

773
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,970
I said I didn't eat it.

774
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,460
Why are you all standing here?

775
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,890
It's nothing, mom.

776
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,200
Subak was in the Miss Korea pageant!

777
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,540
But now she can't even go get facials.

778
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,840
So how could you eat the yogurt that she was going to use for a facial?

779
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,990
You eat too much.

780
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:38,840
It's because you have nothing better to do.

781
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,930
What?

782
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:42,770
Why didn't he ask if he could eat it?

783
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,190
He took the herbal tea I made for my husband

784
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,060
and ate the snacks I bought for Daebak.

785
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,460
Everything just disappears.

786
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,040
Are you upset about him eating?

787
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,100
It's his brother who's feeding him.

788
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,000
It's not you!

789
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,730
She didn't say that.

790
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,140
Grandmother, why are you yelling?

791
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,960
What?

792
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:08,230
Wow, you've teamed up against me!

793
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,160
Uncle, you shouldn't have done that.

794
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,440
But it wasn't me!

795
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:15,270
How can you yell at him over yogurt?

796
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,930
My son's spending money my other son made, so what's your problem?

797
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:21,700
How dare you yell at my son?

798
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:27,690
My son has to work really hard to support you two, so shut up!

799
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,000
If he makes a mistake, I can scold him.

800
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:32,370
I have the right to, don't you think?

801
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,400
I raised him like my own child.

802
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,940
I even nursed him.

803
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:39,140
You didn't raise him!

804
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:43,140
He never received proper care because of your children!

805
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:47,100
Oh, I feel sorry for my hard working son.

806
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:51,140
You spend money on food to poop and to put on your faces.

807
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:56,730
You leeched off Minjung, and now you're leeching off my precious son!

808
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,190
Grandmother, what's wrong with you?

809
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,600
I'm not leeching off dad.

810
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,770
How dare you yell at her?
She's my mom.

811
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,940
Your mom yelled at my mom first!

812
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,570
What? Your mom?

813
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:09,870
Uncle, calm down.
Subak, that's enough.

814
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,060
Oh, I don't believe this.

815
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:13,960
Just look at what's going on.

816
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,460
Just tell me.

817
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:19,140
Is your daughter's face more important than my son's stomach?

818
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:20,270
What's going on?

819
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,040
You don't need to know.

820
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,370
When did you come home?

821
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,870
But I didn't eat it. Man.

822
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,190
I put yogurt in the fridge to use for a facial, but uncle ate it!

823
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,160
But I ate that.

824
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,560
And now my stomach hurts.

825
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:40,560
What?

826
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,530
Minjung, you ate it?

827
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,560
I'll talk to you later.

828
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:50,330
Why you little! Subak! Come out!

829
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,640
Grandmother.

830
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:54,440
I'm sorry.

831
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:56,370
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo...

832
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,890
How was it?

833
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,300
The first day i s hard, right?

834
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,230
Thanks.

835
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:12,940
But is this really free?

836
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:15,270
I was going to charge you a lot of money,

837
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,070
but I can't.

838
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:19,260
You're my teacher's daughter.

839
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,740
How do you feel?

840
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,170
I feel amazing.

841
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,040
You might feel aches and pain tonight.

842
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:30,900
And tomorrow, you might get muscle pain.

843
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:36,340
Minjung!

844
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,230
Hobak.

845
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,570
Isn't it hard living there?

846
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,460
It's a big family.

847
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,690
I expected it.

848
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:59,830
Especially my mom. You know how she's harsh with words.

849
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,160
I can imagine how it must be for you.

850
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,000
She's even hard on me.

851
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,900
But don't let it bother you.

852
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,600
Or it'll become too much to handle.

853
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,140
I can't seem to be able to do it, though.

854
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,560
I didn't know when I was living there,

855
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:17,060
but now that I am...

856
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,960
I'm sure.

857
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:21,100
Have you had lunch?

858
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:24,900
No, I have a stomachache.

859
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,640
Why?

860
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,100
I think it was something I ate.

861
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:30,960
You should be more careful.

862
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,600
Anyway,

863
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:40,940
Hobak.

864
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,300
Yes?

865
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,330
There's something I want to ask.

866
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:49,040
Does Subak have some kind of secret?

867
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:50,690
Excuse me?

868
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,870
What do you mean...

869
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,230
I mean,

870
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,190
both you and Sedal seem

871
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,540
to know something I don't.

872
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,790
I think you should get out more.

873
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,100
Living with mom and dad isn't easy.

874
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:12,290
I used to love visiting mom,

875
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,690
but now, I feel really uncomfortable.

876
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,390
How's your cold?

877
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:21,600
I can't even be sick at home.

878
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:23,290
Would you like to get coffee?

879
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:33,960
That's Hobak.
And Minjung's there, too.

880
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:35,390
Hobak!

881
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,040
What are you doing here?

882
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:46,040
Why are you here?
I thought you had work.

883
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:50,140
Yes. I ran into her. Sit.

884
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,200
You did?

885
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,000
But why are you talking to her at a cafe?

886
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,800
We weren't really talking.

887
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,940
We just ran into each other in the street so I asked him to have some coffee.

888
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:05,600
What were you talking about?

889
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:08,230
I'm sure you didn't sit here in silence.

890
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,870
We just talked about silly stuff.

891
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,400
How funny.

892
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:16,970
Why would my husband and my sister meet at a cafe and drink coffee?

893
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:20,160
Why can't she have coffee with Minjung?

894
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,770
We're all family.

895
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,870
Family?

896
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,270
He became family when he married you.

897
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,940
I just asked her about how she's doing because I haven't seen her in a while.

898
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,960
I'm leaving. You guys talk.

899
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:34,730
Okay.

900
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,600
I'll see you later.

901
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,830
Subak, coffee?

902
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,190
Anything's fine.

903
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,040
What did you talk about?

904
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,840
We didn't talk about much.

905
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,930
Watch your mouth.

906
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,560
Keep it shut until you die.

907
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:56,140
I know.

908
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,940
I won't talk even after I'm dead.

909
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,370
How are you doing?

910
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,440
Is everything okay?

911
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,660
Why did you stop visiting mom?

912
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,170
Is it because you bought an apartment and your husband's doing well now?

913
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:19,800
Like mom said, you never did anything for her so shouldn't you start now?

914
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,890
How could you stop visiting just like that?

915
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:26,140
I know.

916
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,540
I'm rude.

917
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,270
That's why my life turned out like this.

918
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,960
Are you kidding me?

919
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:38,040
Subak, I'm too busy with my life to kid anyone.

920
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:44,870
And I'm not visiting mom because I think we need some time apart.

921
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,000
I'd like you to stay out of this.

922
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:48,460
Stay out?

923
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:50,270
I'm the eldest daughter.

924
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,800
I need to be on top of what's going on.

925
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:55,430
It's between me and mom.

926
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,890
You wouldn't know what it is because you were always her favorite.

927
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:01,600
You're funny.

928
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:04,230
Mom didn't like you because you were dumb,

929
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,730
but you always blame me.

930
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,270
Do you know why mom hated you?

931
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,190
Grandmother was mean to her because of you.

932
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,190
She hated her because you were a daughter.

933
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,270
Was that my fault?

934
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,770
How could you just repeat what mom said?

935
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:22,730
I never asked to be born.

936
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,160
You have children, so how can you say that?

937
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:29,170
This is why mom doesn't like you.

938
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,740
Subak, that's enough.

939
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,640
Hobak, let's stop this.

940
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:35,790
I thought we could have a nice chat.

941
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,370
I'm leaving.

942
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,440
Gwangbak, bye.

943
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,830
Your hairband!

944
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,070
Are you doing your homework?

945
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:20,640
You have to finish your homework.

946
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:21,960
Or there's no dinner!

947
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,790
- Okay.
- Stepmom!

948
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,430
You want to get off here?

949
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:32,800
People might see us.

950
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,830
You don't want me to get caught, right?

951
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,330
Are you scared?

952
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,060
I'm not.

953
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,830
I just don't want it to get messy.

954
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,930
I can't handle her crying and going crazy.

955
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:46,440
And for your sake, baby, I can't get caught.

956
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:47,640
Go.

957
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,730
Daebak,

958
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,290
isn't that your brother in law?

959
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:11,840

960
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:20,460
I'm left breathless from running around all day, in search of love, in search of life

961
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:28,770
Beneath the skies of Seoul I get closer to my dreams

962
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:36,880
Both love and friendship coexist under the sky

963
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,690
You must get back at her, okay?

964
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,870
- You!
- One more word!

965
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,000
Mom, forgive me. I'm sorry.

966
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,640
I'm going to pretend I never had you.

967
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:50,830
My father would pass out if he found out.

968
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,230
I'm so happy I'm going nuts.

969
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,100
You must have come to ask for money,

970
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,270
but as you can see, I don't have any.

971
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,100
Is that all you can say?

972
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,670
Why did you come?

973
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,700
Because you're his mom!
