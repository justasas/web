00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,850
Yes, yes!

3
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,590
Get up. Make breakfast.

4
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,010
I got it, father.

5
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,890
Minjung, I left when your fever broke.

6
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,290
I made porridge, so eat it and take the medicine.

7
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,340
You should take today off, but you can't, right?

8
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,820
Your heater's broken, so your room's cold.

9
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,120
I'll get it fixed this afternoon.

10
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,590
Don't think about anything.
Just get better.

11
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,750
I've heard about what happened to you.

12
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,390
Cheer up, Minjung and take care of yourself.

13
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,510
Wake up.

14
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,840
Why?

15
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,980
Call Loser right now!

16
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,690
Really?

17
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:41,820
Thank you for making up your mind.

18
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,640
What is there to thank her for?

19
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,690
She's the one who's desperate.

20
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,010
I'm not desperate.

21
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,250
We were desperate.

22
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,790
I think this was meant to be.

23
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,080
Thanks, friend!

24
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,340
You gave your son and daughter to us.

25
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,180
Thank you for raising your kids for us.

26
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,050
Please don't put it like that.

27
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,420
I'm already angry,

28
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,580
and you saying that is making me furious.

29
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,780
I didn't work so hard to raise my kids,

30
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,910
so they could marry into this family.

31
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,640
You awful girl.

32
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,690
Oh!

33
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,620
You can't hit her when she's pregnant.

34
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,640
Hit me instead, hit me.

35
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,040
What?

36
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,580
Don't feel furious. Think positive.

37
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,210
Right.

38
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,320
Think of this as a good thing, Mrs. Park.

39
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,010
So, what kind of wedding would you like?

40
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,780
I think they should get married right away.

41
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,710
We can't have it this winter.

42
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,040
We can't have weddings back to back.

43
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,220
In lunar calendar, it's two weddings in a year.

44
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,610
Nobody does that.

45
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,540
She can move in first and have the wedding later.

46
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,290
There will be no wedding?

47
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,540
What's wrong with you?

48
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,990
What do you take us for?

49
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,820
Let's go.

50
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,190
Mother.

51
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,640
This is why you seduced her?

52
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,190
Mom, I don't want the wedding now.

53
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,510
What?

54
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,820
I want to look good in my wedding gown.

55
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,990
I don't want to have it when I'm pregnant.

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,650
I'll  have it after I give birth.

57
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,210
Sir, I want my wedding after the baby's born.

58
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,320
He's not sir.
He's my older brother, so...

59
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,290
Older brother, I want my wedding later.

60
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,410
Don't say that.

61
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,610
He's your brother in law.

62
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,040
Stop being angry and furious,

63
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,020
and teach your daughter some manners.

64
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,710
How come you didn't teach her anything?

65
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,820
I didn't think she'd end up calling her friend's father "brother in law."

66
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:46,910
How about getting a marriage certificate first and having the wedding later?

67
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,180
Where will they live?

68
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,920
They can live here.

69
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,010
There's no room here.

70
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,040
Of course, there is.

71
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,920
Haebak can move into my room,

72
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,240
and they can move into her room.

73
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,250
Live with mother in law, brother in law and

74
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,990
his wife who's worse than the mother in law?

75
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,220
She can't do that.

76
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,480
Get them a place.

77
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,320
Can you cook?

78
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,640
No.

79
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,540
Then move in here.

80
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,750
Okay.

81
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,750
- Is it okay with you?
- Yes.

82
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,690
She can't do that!

83
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,290
They need to be on their own.

84
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,140
Don't think I'll cook for you.

85
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,190
I can't take care of both of you.

86
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,950
Let's just take them in for this winter.

87
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,890
How can these children live on their own?

88
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,780
They're not children! 
They are old!

89
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,910
I'll find them a place when it gets warm,

90
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,310
so I think they should move in here for now.

91
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,790
Okay, bother in law.

92
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,910
I mean, brother in law.

93
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,640
I'll do it, mom.
Finding a place now is hard.

94
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,120
This is crazy.

95
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,420
How can you be so thoughtless?

96
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,010
You didn't know she was thoughtless?

97
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,180
Don't yell at Yeongdal, mother.

98
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,410
You can beat me up instead.

99
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,710
Why should she beat you up?

100
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:08,250
If you touch him, I'll get you, okay?

101
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,220
He's not the only one at fault.

102
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,720
Ask anyone.

103
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,890
Mother, that's enough.

104
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,140
She has every right to be upset.

105
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,890
Upset? It's like your heart is shattered.

106
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,890
Now you know how I felt? Mrs. Park?

107
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,040
You better buy furniture and wedding gifts.

108
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,120
Why do we need furniture for one room?

109
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,850
I want family wedding gifts.

110
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,510
You didn't send Hobak with anything,

111
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,750
so why would you say that?

112
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,410
Ask anyone.

113
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,040
Why does my daughter deserve this?

114
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,090
You know I'm being forced to do this, right?

115
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,250
Yes.

116
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,750
You know Yeongdal is precious to me, right?

117
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,010
Mrs. Park,

118
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,390
they just need a bed and a wardrobe.

119
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,620
If you can't afford even that,

120
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,450
we'll get the...

121
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,180
Where will you get the money to buy those?

122
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,540
We don't have money to get them a place!

123
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,120
We should get a loan for that.

124
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,280
I don't believe you.

125
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,840
What are we going to live on, then?

126
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,450
Daebak's still young and Haebak, too.

127
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,110
How can we give uncle everything we have?

128
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,490
We'll get retirement pension,

129
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,220
and we can move into a smaller house.

130
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,010
Ugh.

131
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,410
After Don leaves, it will be

132
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,710
mother, you, me, Haebak, and Daebak.

133
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,950
This house would be too big.

134
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,010
Give me the deeds to this house.

135
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,680
Why do you want that?
You can't.

136
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,240
You better not do anything with it.

137
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,410
That's like our life.

138
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,310
How can newlyweds live in here?

139
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,810
And why not?

140
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,710
This room is a lucky room.

141
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,190
A judge will come out of this room.

142
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,620
We'll have to wait and see.

143
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,350
Don't get ahead of yourself.

144
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,720
You really want to live in this room?

145
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,490
You dumped everyone who offered to buy you

146
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,620
a house and send you on trips abroad,

147
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,890
and you chose Loser?

148
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,780
Your life turned out all wrong!

149
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,890
I can start over.

150
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,090
That will do you no good!

151
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,690
Once it's ruined, it's difficult to fix.

152
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,480
Life isn't a game.

153
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,640
That's not what you said before!

154
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,250
What are you talking about?

155
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,750
You may be my daughter,

156
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,320
but I don't get you at all.

157
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,210
You never laid eyes on men who are poor,

158
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,140
but it's like you lost your head.

159
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,720
Stop drinking so much. I blame the alcohol.

160
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,550
Don said the same thing. Alcohol is to blame.

161
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,640
He regretted it after he got sober.

162
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,780
Is that true? He said that?

163
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,010
Hey!

164
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,720
I ran over from the market when you called.

165
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,390
What's up?

166
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,640
Congratulate me.

167
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,090
For what?

168
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,190
Did you get a job? Where?

169
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,610
It's better than that.

170
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,320
Better than getting a job?

171
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,010
Did you win the lottery?

172
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,720
That's nothing compared to this.

173
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,120
It's not a job or the lottery.

174
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,040
You can't be getting married.

175
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,490
Right. I'm getting married.

176
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,910
You are?

177
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,140
With whom? When?
You had a blind date?

178
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,910
Or that woman Subak introduced you to?

179
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,310
- I knew it!
- Ouch.

180
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,610
You're glowing!

181
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,850
Who is she? How old?

182
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,850
What does she do? Is she pretty?

183
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,190
You know her.

184
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,440
I know her? Who?

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,010
Yeongdal.

186
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,940
Yeongdal?

187
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,420
My friend? Sedal's little sister?

188
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,750
Yes.

189
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,140
Incredible.

190
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,750
That can't be.

191
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,540
She's joking with you.

192
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,410
It's not a joke.

193
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,410
She's moving in tomorrow.

194
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,410
Who'd believe that?
Moving in tomorrow?

195
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,140
What else can we do?
She's pregnant.

196
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,440
She doesn't even like men who are poor.

197
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,240
How could you...

198
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,510
Wait a minute.

199
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,620
What did you just say?

200
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,750
Pregnant?

201
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,850
It just happened.

202
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,350
Oh, my good.

203
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,920
She got pregnant? When?

204
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,780
Must I tell you when?

205
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,510
You're not yet, are you?

206
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,510
At least our kid won't be beaten up by yours.

207
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,950
Hold on.

208
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,780
I can't sort this out.

209
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,250
Yeongdal and you?

210
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,040
Oh, uncle!
This isn't a simple matter.

211
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,940
Can you handle Yeongdal?

212
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,080
I'll have to. Oh!

213
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,220
Did you know about Subak's divorce?

214
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,780
What? When? Why?

215
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,490
Oh, it's cold.

216
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,320
I was shivering like a dog.

217
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,010
What took you so long?

218
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,490
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,440
Make me some fresh fruit juice.

220
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,250
Keep the fridge tidy.

221
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,280
When I ran a tea room, it was so tidy

222
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,890
that all the coffee cans were lined up

223
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,390
and the coffee cups were squeaky clean.

224
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,510
It was the biggest tea room in town,

225
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,310
and it was always packed.

226
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,410
Those were the good old days!

227
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,750
I think she's trying to get something,

228
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,950
so don't let her push your around. Be wise.

229
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,090
Oh, my!

230
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,850
Is it ready yet?

231
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,350
It's ready.

232
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,990
Mother, I need to talk to you.

233
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,510
About what?

234
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,040
I think there's a reason why you come

235
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,490
when nobody else is home but me.

236
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,250
You can tell me.

237
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,010
You're pretty smart.

238
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,350
Come in, this way.

239
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,420
Watch out.

240
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,910
Any scratches, and I'm returning them.

241
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,640
Careful, careful, careful.

242
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,940
Yes, this way.

243
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,280
Mom.

244
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,990
What do you think?

245
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,950
What do you mean?

246
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,040
They told you to do this by yourself?

247
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,620
She's my only sister in law, so I should.

248
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,390
You must be a saint.

249
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,510
If I do my part, I can demand them to do theirs.

250
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,750
Your mother in law was unbelievable.

251
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,250
When you got married, she told the whole

252
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,750
neighborhood how you didn't bring any gifts.

253
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,720
How can she do this to us now?

254
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,250
But there's no wedding.

255
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,120
That shouldn't matter.

256
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,620
She should send the basic gift,

257
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,520
since she made such a big deal.

258
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,520
I'm going to be really hard on Yeongdal,

259
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,790
just like how her mom was hard on you.

260
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,250
Let's see how the beauty salon woman takes it.

261
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,340
Oh, she's now the makeup store woman.

262
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,140
Yeongdal's not your daughter in law.

263
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,980
Same thing.

264
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,410
She was so brazen, I couldn't believe it.

265
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,210
She didn't know how to hold her tongue.

266
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,640
As if being pregnant makes her special.

267
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,850
How imprudent!

268
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,320
I wasn't like that, you know?

269
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,290
Why are you laughing?

270
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,490
You were just as bad when I got married.

271
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,410
Be nice to Yeongdal.
She's Gwangbak's friend.

272
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,440
If you hate her, she won't be able to forget it.

273
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,040
So don't be mean. Try to be warm.

274
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,290
Whatever.

275
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,640
They were mean to you and mean to me.

276
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,290
I'm going to pay them back for it.

277
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,680
Minjung.

278
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,140
You're here?

279
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,510
Come in. You must be tired.

280
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,290
I made pollack stew, your favorite.

281
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,620
I made this for you once.

282
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,120
Remember?

283
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,740
Yes.

284
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,680
Did you take your medicine?

285
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,850
How do you feel?

286
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,350
I'm almost as good as new.

287
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,850
I feel like I'm in someone else's place.

288
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,250
Do you like it?

289
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,540
Yes.

290
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,180
Wash your hands and eat.

291
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,140
I'll go.

292
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,010
Do you have to go now?

293
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,520
Huh?

294
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,410
If you can stay, have dinner with me.

295
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,050
It's delicious.

296
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,740
Don't eat noodles. Try to have rice.

297
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,410
And when you eat out, try to get rice.

298
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,710
Don't have soup or stew that are too salty.

299
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,440
And don't drink when you're upset.

300
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,810
Eat slowly, especially when you're hungry.

301
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,140
When it's cold, you'll get a stomachache.

302
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,820
What is it?

303
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,580
I'm happy.

304
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,250
About what?

305
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,180
Hearing you nag.

306
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,620
Nobody ever nagged me to take care of myself.

307
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,440
I think I understand.

308
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,410
You never told me,

309
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,850
but I heard things from people around.

310
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,640
I know you had a hard life.

311
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,550
Isn't the floor warm? I got the heater fixed.

312
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,890
It's nice and warm.
Did the landlord fix it?

313
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,620
I went and talked to him.

314
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,440
I said, "This isn't acceptable.

315
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,910
You should've maintained it when he rented the room out.

316
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,980
How could you accept his money like that?

317
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,090
And why didn't you fix it when it was broken?

318
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,180
What if he dies in the freezing cold?

319
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,180
Will you take responsibility for his death?

320
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,390
Pay him what he's due for getting sick!"

321
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,550
You told him off like that?

322
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,990
Actually, I begged him to fix it.

323
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,310
But I wanted to say that to him.

324
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,640
Oh, boy.

325
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,940
This is the last night we'll spend together.

326
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,980
- Oh.
- Are you happy?

327
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,010
Of course, I am.

328
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,620
I'm sad.

329
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,180
You're lying.

330
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,850
Your smile couldn't be bigger!

331
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,990
I'm glad I don't have to listen to you snore.

332
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,890
I'll come sleep with you after I'm married.

333
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,620
What a liar!

334
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,050
Why you little.

335
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,980
Mom, I'm sorry.

336
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,010
I'm not even having a wedding,

337
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,550
and my husband isn't even rich.

338
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,120
I'm at a loss for words.

339
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,550
You had such high standards.
What happened?

340
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,850
I can't believe you fell for him.

341
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,410
Yeongdal, think about it again.

342
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,940
It's not too late.

343
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,850
Mom.

344
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,890
I can't give you to Loser!

345
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,050
I can't take it back. I'm pregnant.

346
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,320
- You could...
- Shh!

347
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,520
Don't. My baby's listening.

348
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,710
Fast food tastes good once in a while.

349
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,740
It's just like that.

350
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,910
Think it over.

351
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,640
After tomorrow, it'll be too late.

352
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,890
Mom, I love Loser.

353
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,790
He's not like the other men I've dated.

354
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,890
I've been faking my affection until now.

355
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,910
I was never in love.

356
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,480
What do you mean?

357
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,740
Loser's seen me before my plastic surgery.

358
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,310
He's the only one who knows the real me.

359
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,410
I was ugly and I got bad grades.

360
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,410
Loser's the only one who knows about us.

361
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,210
I was never at ease meeting other men.

362
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,350
Mom, you know what a girdle is, right?

363
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,350
What about it?

364
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,390
What if you had to wear it all day?

365
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,090
How uncomfortable would that be?

366
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,680
Meeting other men was like wearing that.

367
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,390
But now, I feel like I took it off.

368
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,290
I don't have to be coy.
I can say anything.

369
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,450
I don't have to try to impress him.

370
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,850
He sees me as who I really am.

371
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,280
You're not making any sense.

372
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,220
I was just babbling on.

373
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,540
Mom, I'll be really happy.

374
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,820
Yeah, right. With a delivery boy.

375
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,320
He's going to open a pizza shop.

376
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,520
Who knows when that will happen?

377
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,250
Didn't you see his sister in law?

378
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,110
She won't let it happen, I'm telling you.

379
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,120
Even though his brother wants to do it.

380
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:54,180
I've done everything I need to do now.

381
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,090
I wanted to see you have kids before I died.

382
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,820
Now you can die happy?

383
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,950
Not really.

384
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,310
I want to see that child grow up,

385
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,220
go to school and go to the army.

386
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,640
It might be a girl.

387
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,140
Anyway, live a very long life.

388
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,640
I can send my daughter to the army.

389
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,510
Keep your wife in line.

390
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,650
Look at Anggeum.

391
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:25,440
Bong gave her an inch and she took a mile!

392
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,210
I never saw her take anything.

393
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,620
Why you little! I'm serious!

394
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,440
Mom!

395
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,040
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

396
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,940
He looks good in this outfit.

397
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,510
Clothes do make a man.

398
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,320
Hey, sir, how are you?

399
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,120
He looks like he's single.

400
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,120
You'd fall for him, if he was real, right?

401
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,710
I don't care how a man looks.

402
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,140
Then what do you care about?

403
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,210
Money?

404
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,640
Chemistry. Sparks!

405
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,090
But I don't feel anything with him.

406
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,680
Oh, I have to go.

407
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,980
Yes, go!

408
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,810
I'm sorry I have to leave again today.

409
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,050
I'll make it up to you.

410
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,940
Oh, it's so cold.

411
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,550
Don.

412
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,340
- You took a cab?
- Yes.

413
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,180
We can't afford to take cabs anymore.

414
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,440
Okay. I won't.

415
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,210
But it's not that expensive.

416
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,520
Don.

417
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,190
Look at this. How exciting.

418
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,280
It feels weird.

419
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,690
Me, too.

420
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,850
Now I feel like we're married.

421
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,790
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

422
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,640
You're not?

423
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:55,410
Now I'm tied to one woman for good.

424
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,210
My life is really over.

425
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,510
Huh?

426
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,350
Tie me down real tight.
Cut off my circulation.

427
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,490
It's not enough.

428
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,580
Get as much money as possible.
There's no time.

429
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,890
I'll get as much as I can.

430
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,680
Is your passport ready?

431
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,050
We can flee to Southeast Asia or China.

432
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,210
Okay, Mr. Seo.
I'll call you right back.

433
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,280
Don't worry.
I'll send the $5 million now.

434
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,120
What happened to my money?

435
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,120
Actually,

436
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,120
give me one more week.

437
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,820
It'll triple.

438
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,850
Triple?

439
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,910
More times means more interest.

440
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,410
That's nice,

441
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,620
but I need the money. It's my family.

442
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,480
This is top secret,

443
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,120
but is there anyone you want to help out?

444
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,620
Why?

445
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,210
They can invest, too.

446
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,280
It's almost over. Double.
For you, triple.

447
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,250
Invest?
I have no money to invest.

448
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,910
You don't have a secret stash?

449
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,090
You said all married women have some.

450
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,320
How could I, on our budget?

451
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,590
It'll double.

452
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,910
It's like popcorn, I'm telling you.

453
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,140
That sounds like a scam.

454
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,290
You always doubt everything!

455
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,490
To my boss, $100,000 is child's play.

456
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,910
You should invest.

457
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,010
Do it. A chance like this won't come again.

458
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,220
That's that, and this is this.

459
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,640
What do you mean?

460
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,980
Nothing. Hobak should invest.

461
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,840
Take out a second mortgage.

462
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,320
So if I invest $1,000, it'll be $2,000?

463
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,410
Your scale is so small.

464
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,620
It should be at least $100,000.

465
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,910
If that's true, everyone would be rich.

466
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,280
Let me know if you want to.
You have 1 week.

467
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,540
Oh.

468
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,020
How's it coming?

469
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,390
Why are we doing this here?

470
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,620
Shouldn't the bride's family do this?

471
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,290
Don't nitpick.

472
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,390
Father, you're home.

473
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,390
Are you going somewhere?

474
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,440
To Gwangbak's parents house.

475
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,980
Why go there at dinner time?

476
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,410
What about my dinner?

477
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,850
You said you were eating out.

478
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,520
You said you were meeting Mr. Kim.

479
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,120
I changed my mind.

480
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,940
I have to get permission from you?

481
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,910
So? There's no dinner for me?

482
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,280
I'll make it for you.

483
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,890
Father, we have to go.

484
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,940
What?

485
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,640
No, we don't have to.

486
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,820
I'll prepare it for you.

487
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,390
Her family's having dinner tonight

488
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,180
as a kind of wedding for her uncle.

489
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,890
A kind of wedding?

490
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,290
They can't have a wedding now.

491
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,220
Why can't they have a wedding first?

492
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,050
They have a baby on the way.

493
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,390
Father, hold on. 
I'll fix you dinner.

494
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,590
It's okay.
I'll order Chinese.

495
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,950
Let's go.

496
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,210
How can we?

497
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,640
Didn't you hear?
He's ordering Chinese.

498
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,050
You're so dense.

499
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,520
Oh, what do I do?

500
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,390
Aunt isn't here and there's no food.

501
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,320
Is there anything you can cook quickly?

502
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,320
Anything?

503
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,710
Go buy me some chicken!

504
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,620
Mom.

505
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,940
You're here!

506
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,640
Hello, I'm here.

507
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,410
When things were difficult,

508
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,280
people got married like this.

509
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,640
- Bow.
- Okay.

510
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,180
The bride and groom will bow.

511
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,390
Have a happy marriage, dear sister in law.

512
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,350
Welcome to Wang's family.

513
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,640
Let's sit. Sit down.

514
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,180
The wedding's over.
Let's eat now.

515
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,410
We should put that away.

516
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,940
Where's Minjung?

517
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,350
Is he delivering parcels?

518
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,850
Oh,

519
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,050
he's too busy.

520
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,050
Where's Gwangbak?

521
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,050
Oh, she'll be a bit late.

522
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,240
Don, take good care of each other.

523
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,780
You know our family motto, don't you?

524
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,420
Yes, I do.

525
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:11,740
Yeongdal, our family motto is put yourself in other's shoes.

526
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,140
I know. I've seen it many times.

527
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,350
If you put yourself in other's shoes,

528
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,440
you'll be able to avoid many arguments.

529
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,010
Once again, welcome.

530
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:31,120
I'm sorry you have to start out like this.

531
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,020
Mother, stop sighing.

532
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:42,140
You always said, you must wait until the end to see how your life turns out.

533
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,510
I know!

534
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,090
Stop saying that.

535
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,250
I haven't said that in a long time.

536
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:53,140
And stop saying, "I know" or "No way."

537
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,820
It's not very polite.

538
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,180
He's your son in law now.

539
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,510
You have to respect him.

540
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:05,420
I learned this from Mrs. Lee.

541
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,850
Then you should be mean to my daughter in law just like you.

542
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,490
Mother, she's your sister in law.

543
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,480
How's your housekeeping going?

544
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,580
Well...

545
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,790
I'm not great, but I'm doing my best.

546
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,090
Making money isn't easy.

547
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,320
Money doesn't grow on trees!

548
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,550
Not now.

549
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,910
I'm going to drop by unannounced to check.

550
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,010
I got it, mother.

551
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,450
Don't squander Hobak's hard earned money.

552
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,240
That's enough.

553
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,810
I did that to demonstrate our family motto.

554
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,120
It doesn't feel good when I do that, right?

555
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,590
If you keep scolding Don in front of his mother,

556
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,440
how do you think she feels? Huh?

557
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,890
Anggeum, stop that!

558
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,910
It's my feelings, not yours.

559
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,510
Mr. Wang, let's take a photo.

560
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,090
Grandmother, come. Everyone, come.

561
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,250
Not grandmother, but mother.

562
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,540
She'll get used to it.

563
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,140
It won't happen overnight.

564
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,290
Hey, wear something warm.

565
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,390
The baby must be cold.

566
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,680
It's okay. The baby's in my stomach.

567
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,540
It's not in my legs.

568
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,140
Hobak, come.

569
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,320
Girls, come.
Let's take a picture.

570
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,910
Hey.

571
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,440
Hurry, come. Hurry up.

572
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,350
Take a picture.

573
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,910
- Go ahead.
- Do it.

574
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,410
Make us look good.

575
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,410
One, two, three.

576
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,440
Whoa!

577
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,780
It smells great.

578
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,850
How did you know?
That's my father's favorite.

579
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,020
You'll score some points for this one!

580
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,320
Go get him.

581
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,520
Father, come out.

582
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,250
She made your favorite.

583
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,440
What is it?

584
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,110
Father, enjoy.

585
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,090
I'm not sure if it'll be good, but I tried my best.

586
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,520
Father, doesn't it look good?

587
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,890
You're so dense.

588
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,590
You really have no idea at all, do you?

589
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,640
After fighting with you over that chicken,

590
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,050
I stopped eating it.

591
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,780
You rallied up your whole family!

592
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,210
Do you know how humiliating that was?

593
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,350
Who was that bastard who pushed me?

594
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,190
He wasn't a bastard.

595
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,590
He was my uncle.

596
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:51,780
The same uncle who got a girl pregnant?

597
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,090
Now I get it.

598
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,680
How can he do that to someone's daughter?

599
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,920
They had their reasons.

600
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,850
I think your family has issues.

601
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,790
Father.

602
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,290
Why? What is it?

603
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,690
You shouldn't say...

604
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,220
Was I wrong?

605
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,310
She mad it for you, so you should try...

606
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,280
I'm not going to eat this.

607
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,210
You eat it.

608
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,390
Father.

609
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,410
Why did you tell him about my uncle?

610
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,120
Father, I was inconsiderate.

611
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,480
I'll make you something else.
What would you like?

612
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,580
Forget it.

613
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,440
I can't eat when I'm upset.

614
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,080
Is this the Chinese place?

615
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,520
Don't try to help me from now on.

616
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,750
And that thing with my uncle?

617
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,980
That's nothing to brag about.

618
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,680
You didn't have to tell him that.

619
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,520
I didn't know, but you're a blabbermouth.

620
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,080
What? A blabbermouth?

621
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,810
You are.

622
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,740
I thought you weren't,

623
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,420
but now that we're married, I know.

624
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,390
How can you call me a blabbermouth?

625
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,580
I've never heard that before.

626
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,150
How could you say that?

627
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,050
Are you upset?

628
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,820
Don't be so petty.

629
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,910
It just came out.

630
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,950
Are you a blabbermouth.

631
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,710
You're so petty.

632
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,980
Petty? Are you serious?

633
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,750
Sunjeong.

634
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,210
I brought roasted chestnuts.

635
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,620
Daese.

636
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,810
It's good.

637
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,750
Why was he eating that?

638
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,290
You didn't make him dinner?

639
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:03,120
I made spicy chicken, but he got angry saying he doesn't eat chicken.

640
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,250
That's right.

641
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,890
He stopped eating it after that incident.

642
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,440
You didn't know?

643
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,750
No. I'm sorry.

644
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,710
Still, you should've softened him up.

645
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,140
How could you let him eat noodles?

646
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,820
You just go married.

647
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,210
This is really bad.

648
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,210
I didn't know how to talk to him.

649
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,310
I told him I was sorry, but it didn't work.

650
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,540
Try to be friends with him.

651
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,810
You have to try.
What else can we do?

652
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,780
It was bad to begin with.
It won't be easy.

653
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,210
But try to warm up to him, listen to him,

654
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,310
and make him accept you.

655
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,680
I got it.

656
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,950
I really need to work on a lot of things.

657
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,520
Thank god you came home.

658
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,620
Can we talk?

659
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,820
Minjung.

660
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,980
When did you leave?

661
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,120
A little while ago.

662
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,920
Why didn't you wait?

663
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,320
You wanted me to wait for you?

664
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,280
I had bought some roasted chestnuts.

665
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,420
I ran home, thinking you were waiting.

666
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:26,850
I'm happy when I work, thinking of you.

667
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,150
You are?

668
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,050
Only believe half of what men say.

669
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,180
And what could I not say right now?

670
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,090
Especially if I want you to keep cooking.

671
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,810
It's great to hear you joking.

672
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,180
I wasn't joking.

673
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,250
I hope you get over everything soon.

674
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,820
Minjung, I made stew.
Did you eat it?

675
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,080
Yes. It was good.
I'm doing the dishes.

676
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,240
You should've left them.

677
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,480
I could've done them tomorrow.

678
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,480
I'm good at doing the dishes.

679
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,620
I didn't drink today.

680
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,920
And I didn't eat instant noodles.

681
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:58,950
Aren't you proud of me?

682
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,850
I'm glad you're such a good listener.

683
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,580
You deserve an award.

684
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,140
Sunjeong, I won't say thank you.

685
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,250
I know you don't like it.

686
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,210
But I'll never forget it.

687
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,480
Good night.

688
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,690
You too.

689
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,640
Let's go.

690
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,540
Have a happy life.

691
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,940
Mom.

692
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,580
Don't worry about her, mother.

693
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,250
But it's hard to...

694
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,940
I want to take you home!

695
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:49,020
Look at Yeongdal.
She doesn't want to go.

696
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,920
Mom, let's go.

697
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,520
Please look after my baby sister.

698
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,980
Okay, Don?

699
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,080
Yes, sir.

700
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,820
Mrs. Park, don't cry.

701
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,280
I won't mistreat my precious daughter in law.

702
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,020
Yeongdal, have sweet dreams.

703
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,050
Uncle, be good to her.

704
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,680
Mother, let's go.

705
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,520
Let's go, let's go.

706
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,390
- Goodbye. 
- Good night.

707
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,710
- Okay.
- Bye.

708
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,850
- Let's go.
- Okay.

709
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,050
Let's go inside.
Sintong, Bangtong, come in.

710
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,020
Mom,

711
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,890
would you like to go singing?

712
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,120
No.

713
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,420
Would you like a drink?

714
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,190
No.

715
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,550
This is nuts.

716
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,980
This is our first night.

717
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,550
Actually, it isn't really our first night.

718
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,890
There's evidence inside you.

719
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,650
I don't remember it, so it doesn't count.

720
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,720
So this is our official first night.

721
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,980
Yeongdal, my princess.

722
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,520
I'll work even harder.

723
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,290
I can't say you'll live like a queen,

724
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,980
but I won't let you starve.

725
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,420
I still can't believe it.

726
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:17,150
How could someone so pretty marry me?

727
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,120
I'm sorry about having to start out like this.

728
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:27,710
You should've worn a pretty wedding gown and have a beautiful wedding.

729
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,690
I promise you,

730
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,920
I won't ever make you cry.

731
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:36,120
I won't give you any scars.

732
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:39,790
I watched Bong and his wife, 

733
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,290
and I learned that a woman's heart is a fragile thing.

734
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,820
Look at his wife.

735
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,820
I'm not like her.

736
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,410
I feel very responsible when I look at that.

737
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:59,420
I've never felt this way, but it's not bad.

738
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:06,050
I'm on edge as if I'm on a tight leash.

739
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,080
- Is that good?
- Yes.

740
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,890
That's good, then.

741
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,420
But Don, did you really blame the alcohol?

742
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,450
You said you regretted it afterwards.

743
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,940
Who told you that?

744
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,250
I owe my life to alcohol.

745
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,820
It brought you to me.

746
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,710
Let me ask you something, too.

747
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,810
What is it?

748
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,810
Did you mean it?

749
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,890
I wasn't good?

750
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,390
Oh! Hey, hold on.

751
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,210
- Why?
- Shh!

752
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,710
Don't do that!

753
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,080
Goodnight!

754
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,910
Have sweet dreams!

755
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,790
You must practice.

756
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,320
Not grandmother, but mother.

757
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,780
Mother.

758
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,920
Not Mr. Wang, since he's your brother in law.

759
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,290
Can I just call him brother?

760
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,620
You can't! You're not in a gang.

761
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,310
And you don't call Anggeum Mrs Lee.

762
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,480
I can't call them Mrs. Lee or Mr. Wang.

763
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,120
That's easy.

764
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,420
People are so dumb, right?

765
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,220
I know. But you're so smart.

766
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,850
Don, I won't memorize how to call them.

767
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,520
I hated memorizing when I was a student.

768
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:29,210
But you must.
Family hierarchy is important.

769
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,810
Hierarchy?

770
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,850
You're above Gwangbak now.

771
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,980
And above Subak.

772
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,080
Really?

773
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:42,180
So I can order Subak around?

774
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,390
No way.

775
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,850
You shouldn't order her around.

776
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,250
How do you know these things so well?

777
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,520
Your grades were even worse than Sedal's.

778
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,480
What's my ranking?

779
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,810
Let me see.

780
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:04,390
Mom, Bong, Anggeum, me, you...

781
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,890
Fifth?

782
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,310
Wow!

783
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:17,540
Be honest with me.

784
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,510
Was I really that bad?

785
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,820
It's a secret.

786
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,890
Don't! Don't!

787
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,940
Darling,

788
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:36,120
our baby boy got married today.

789
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:39,290
There wasn't a nice wedding,

790
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,480
but we got a daughter in law and a grandchild.

791
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:47,640
Please look after them for me.

792
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:49,710
Mother.

793
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,680
You're not sleeping?

794
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,190
I'm not sleepy.

795
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,750
Bet you feel a little empty.

796
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,480
Not at all. He's right upstairs.

797
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:10,350
But he slept next to you all his life.

798
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,150
But it's better to have him upstairs, right?

799
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,890
I'm so happy today.

800
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,150
I'm glad you are.

801
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:24,190
We'll have a big party next year.

802
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,350
We'll pass out rice cakes and grill up a whole pig.

803
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,920
Yes, we should.

804
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,940
Your father would've been so happy.

805
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:40,440
Why did he have to leave me so early?

806
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:45,440
I'll get him for it when I see him in heaven.

807
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,310
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

808
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,440
Mother.

809
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,890
Honey...

810
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,580
Yeongdal, Yeongdal.

811
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,890
Good morning, Anggeum.

812
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,080
Tell Yeongdal to come down.

813
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,620
I think the baby's making her tired.

814
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:39,550
I'm not trying to make her work. Go get her.

815
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,580
She's living with her in laws now,

816
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,980
so she should pretend to help out a bit.

817
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,540
I'll help out.

818
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,810
Clean these, then.

819
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,910
Okay.

820
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,180
What are you doing?

821
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,420
- Get out.
- I'll clean them.

822
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,090
Aren't you in charge of cooking?

823
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:02,890
Before Yeongdal came, but not anymore.

824
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,940
She's Gwangbak's friend.

825
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,540
She probably can't cook.

826
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:09,120
Mother, we'll be in trouble if you do this.

827
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:11,250
Remember what you used to say?

828
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,420
You can't show how much you love someone.

829
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:19,420
Yeongdal's going to give you a big headache.

830
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:22,520
How can she sleep in on her first morning

831
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:26,750
and not even show up in the kitchen?

832
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,210
But she's pregnant.

833
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,580
I better get pregnant, too.

834
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,280
Look how I'm being treated because I'm not.

835
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,820
If you can, go ahead.
Who's stopping you?

836
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,890
Where's Yeongdal?

837
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,390
She's skipping breakfast.
She's tired.

838
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,310
What did she do to be so tired?

839
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,910
Everyone feels tired after a wedding.

840
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,790
That little brat has no manners.

841
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,320
She should get her lazy butt up.

842
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,520
Subak, that was a bit...

843
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:02,420
She's your aunt.
Watch what you say.

844
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:03,650
I'm just no used to it.

845
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,150
She was Gwangbak's childhood friend,

846
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,990
so how can she call her aunt just like that?

847
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:11,540
And it's not like they got along that well.

848
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,390
How can she call her aunt?

849
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,390
Don't we have any manners?

850
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,050
Respect her as your aunt.

851
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,680
Yeongdal will do well.

852
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,120
I trained her all night last night.

853
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,690
That's not all you did!

854
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,820
Mom, don't say that!

855
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,350
Mr. Want.

856
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,810
No, brother! What was it?

857
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,740
I'm your brother in law.

858
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,320
Right, you are.

859
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,890
It's hard to remember.

860
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,250
You're going to work?
You're so hard working.

861
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,650
Go in and have breakfast.

862
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,620
Oh, no! Oh, no!

863
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,650
Ouch, ouch.

864
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,050
Are you okay?

865
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:04,850
An old man like you shouldn't run around.

866
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:08,250
Okay. You should go inside now.

867
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,120
Mr. Wang, have a good day.

868
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:14,120
No, brother. What was that again?

869
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:16,150
Oh, who cares.

870
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,520
Good morning. Mrs. Lee, food please.

871
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,020
Come and sit. Come.

872
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:25,690
Bring some soup and the fish.

873
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,950
Bring them.

874
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:30,890
What are you wearing?
You're married now.

875
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,350
The makeup woman taught you nothing.

876
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,540
Don't talk about my mom like that.

877
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,390
Right.

878
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,790
You think what you're wearing is appropriate?

879
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,890
Don't scold me.
I'm not your daughter.

880
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,190
We're the same level.

881
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,250
What?

882
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:52,050
In hierarchy, you and I are two steps apart.

883
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:53,510
Hah!

884
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,120
You can't wear that in this house,

885
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,750
so watch what you wear from now on.

886
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,650
I can't even wear what I want to wear?

887
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,590
This is what everyone wears.

888
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:03,620
Subak and Gwangbak all wear this,

889
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,620
so stop picking on me.

890
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:10,850
She's pregnant, so let her eat first.

891
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,350
Will you be late?
Let's go to my parent's house

892
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,120
since we couldn't go yesterday.

893
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,850
I have plans.

894
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,350
I'll go next time.

895
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,680
The petty blabbermouth is going to work.

896
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,620
Yes?

897
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:40,550
- Hello.
- Hi.

898
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:41,890
What brings you here?

899
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,790
She probably has something to say.

900
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,920
You're really quick.

901
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,910
I dropped by on my way to class.

902
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:50,420
Should I leave you two alone?

903
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:53,320
It's okay.
You know everything about us,

904
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,640
and you helped the kids with their marriage.

905
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:00,410
Daese, stop being so mean to Gwangbak.

906
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,090
When was I mean to her?

907
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:06,240
Imagine how scared she must have been.

908
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,890
You know I don't eat chicken anymore!

909
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,580
I have nothing more to say.

910
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:14,140
Daese, I feel so uncomfortable.

911
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,850
Can't you try to get along for my sake?

912
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,580
Set a good example. She'll follow suit.

913
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,890
You have to accept her first.

914
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,710
She should be scared of at least one person.

915
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,040
You've met her mother.

916
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,780
She couldn't have learned anything good.

917
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,190
She just blurts out anything.

918
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,620
She's indifferent to others feelings.

919
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,580
I'm trying to teach her, so you stay out.

920
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,620
I know how you feel.

921
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:42,420
But that can hurt Sangnam in the end.

922
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:44,980
Hurt Sangnam?

923
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:49,250
Women take things out on their husbands.

924
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,420
Who really loves their daughter in laws?

925
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:55,790
They do it for the sake of their sons.

926
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,980
So go easy on her.
Don't be too harsh.

927
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,940
Do I have to walk on eggshells?

928
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:06,440
You really don't get it, do you?

929
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:07,980
Why can't you understand me?

930
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:09,390
I'm still healthy.

931
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,850
I don't have to be careful around her.

932
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,390
I might, when I'm old and shriveled.

933
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,920
How dare she take it out on Sangnam?

934
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,420
She better not.

935
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:26,440
If you're curious, you should've come.

936
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:28,350
You betrayed us when you got married.

937
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,710
You don't call, you don't visit.

938
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,350
Should I come over with mom?

939
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,420
You said nobody was home.

940
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:37,850
We'll drop by, then.

941
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,150
Come in, mom.

942
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,310
Daughters are so useless.

943
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:52,850
You got married and don't even call me!

944
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,020
No news is good news.

945
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,020
It's because I'm doing well.

946
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:01,480
Would you be happy if I called and cried?

947
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:03,250
Am I invisible?

948
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,790
Subak, it's been a while.

949
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,150
Where's Jungji?

950
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,920
Miho's babysitting.

951
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:11,420
She's better at it than your grandmother.

952
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,950
I'm sure she could get married right now.

953
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:16,020
She's perfect for Daebak.

954
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,480
We'll see about that.

955
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,390
I heard lots of things happened.

956
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,420
Ugh...

957
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:27,190
How are you? How is Minjung?

958
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,890
Let's not talk about me. It's boring.

959
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,480
You want us to stand here?

960
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,050
Oh, right.
Sit. Mom, have a seat.

961
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,780
I'm not sitting there.

962
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,940
This darn chair!

963
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,410
Let me sit here.

964
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,720
He sat here, like he's someone important,

965
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,790
and he treated me like a servant.

966
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,920
Is your father in law good to you?

967
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,990
Yes, he is.

968
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,410
He's not giving you a hard time?

969
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,790
No, he's so nice to me.

970
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,120
But you've lost weight.

971
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:57,890
Are you pregnant?

972
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,310
No.

973
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,180
How is Yeongdal?

974
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,490
Don't get me started.

975
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,350
She's giving me a hard time.

976
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,650
Now my sister in law is ordering me around.

977
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,750
How can uncle fall for a girl like her?

978
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,190
He said no to a semi real estate tycoon.

979
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,450
You should come and talk to her.

980
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:18,040
You used to know how to deal with her.

981
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,510
Is she being rude to you?

982
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,520
Oh, the clothes she wears!

983
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,980
She shows too much skin.

984
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:27,440
I told her to cover up a bit,

985
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,120
and she talked back to me!

986
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:33,680
And she talked back saying not to talk about her mother!

987
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,350
I couldn't believe it.

988
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,480
I better show her who's the boss.

989
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:40,120
But she's our aunt.

990
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:46,520
Grandmother, your father, and uncle are

991
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:51,090
all on her side, saying she's pregnant.

992
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,780
I don't believe it.

993
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,650
Don't worry. I'll teach her a lesson.

994
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,150
Your house is nice. Give us a tour.

995
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,390
Oh, it's really nice. I envy you.

996
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,140
But it's my father in law's house.

997
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,090
But you'll inherit it. He only has one son.

998
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,440
Is this his room?

999
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,410
Don't open the door.

1000
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:29,420
Mom, tangerines.
Subak, come here.

1001
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,590
Oh...

1002
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,940
What a great room!

1003
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:36,620
I'm going to move into a small apartment

1004
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,190
next year when everyone moves out.

1005
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,950
Why am I living in such a full house?

1006
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:45,210
I'm sick of it.

1007
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,410
Yes.

1008
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:50,620
I told Mr. Kim no when I met him yesterday.

1009
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:56,650
My company will enter the Chinese market alone.

1010
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,620
Right.

1011
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,440
Sangnam will go to China soon.

1012
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,620
He signed an agreement there.

1013
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,650
Yes. Okay.

1014
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,440
Okay.

1015
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,020
Father.

1016
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:13,040
Why are you so surprised?

1017
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,620
Oh?

1018
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:17,790
I'm not. 
You came home so suddenly.

1019
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:22,450
You want me to call when I'm coming home to my own house?

1020
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,620
You're going to eat all these alone?

1021
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:27,850
No.

1022
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,710
I mean, yes.

1023
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,640
I love tangerines.

1024
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,820
Why are there so many shoes at the door?

1025
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:41,980
I was cleaning. I'm sorting them out.

1026
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:49,120
Is there jujube tea?
Let me have some.

1027
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:50,420
Yes, father.

1028
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:53,820
I'll bring it to your room.

1029
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,850
I'll drink it here.

1030
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:05,440
Are you taking things out on Sangnam?

1031
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,040
Excuse me?

1032
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:10,440
When I scold you, do you take it out on him?

1033
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,480
I heard women do that.

1034
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,440
When I say something,

1035
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:16,350
you take it out on him?

1036
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,480
You better not be doing that.

1037
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:22,350
I never liked you from the beginning,

1038
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:25,420
but I accepted you because you begged me.

1039
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:29,690
But I don't like how you do things.

1040
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,220
Trying to manipulate Sangnam behind my back.

1041
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,790
And driving a wedge between Sangnam and me.

1042
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,940
Is that how your mother raised you?

1043
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:43,750
Don't complain to Sangnam. Do better.

1044
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,020
If you do anything I don't like again,

1045
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:49,210
I'm going to take extreme measures. Oh.

1046
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,250
Oh, no.

1047
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:55,520
Father!

1048
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,780
I'll get it.

1049
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,650
Father, you eat a new one.

1050
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,750
I'll eat this.

1051
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,620
Why did you have to scream?

1052
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,210
Yes, Mr. Kim.

1053
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,480
Really?

1054
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,520
I'll be right there. Okay.

1055
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,820
Cancel the jujube tea.

1056
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,320
And don't forget what I told you.

1057
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,190
Have a nice day, father!

1058
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,080
You can come out, mom.

1059
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,890
Oh, my heart.

1060
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,420
Oh, this is how you live?

1061
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:40,150
This is awful.

1062
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,590
Mom, let's leave.

1063
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:43,280
I can't take this anymore.

1064
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,080
We'll talk later. Let's go.

1065
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:53,890
Oh...

1066
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,820
Oh, boy.

1067
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,080
Goodbye!

1068
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:04,850
Mom!

1069
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:18,390
Oh, I'm still shaking.

1070
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,580
It's like I was caught stealing.

1071
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,310
I can't believe we got caught.

1072
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,980
I can't handle stealing or hiding.

1073
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:27,480
Who in the world can handle that?

1074
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:29,310
Oh, poor Gwangbak!

1075
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:33,040
Her father in law seems awful.

1076
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,240
Why did you ask me to go there?

1077
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,520
But you wanted to go!

1078
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,890
You always complain about everything.

1079
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,080
Don't blame me.
It was your decision to go.

1080
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:43,980
Where are you going?

1081
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:45,390
My boss wants me.

1082
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,190
Huh?

1083
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,520
Minjung! Min...

1084
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,520
Minjung.

1085
00:59:58,550 --> 00:59:59,620
Oh...

1086
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:58,690
I'm home.

1087
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,950
Aren't you cold?

1088
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:00,940
I'm fine.

1089
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:04,940
Sleeping in a warm room keeps me warm all day long.

1090
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:06,410
These are for you.

1091
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,520
How nice.

1092
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,910
It smells good.

1093
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:15,520
I got beer too. Just one glass.

1094
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,720
Nice.

1095
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,710
This feels like a different place.

1096
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,680
The plant looks pretty.

1097
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,420
But you're prettier.

1098
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:30,690
Don't be so happy, remember?

1099
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,690
I know. Only believe half of what men say.

1100
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,450
Look where believing it all got me.

1102
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:20,140
Sunjeong, I think of you

1103
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,120
whenever something good happens.

1104
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:24,620
Minjung, I better go. Something's up at home.

1105
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:25,690
Yeongdal, come out.

1106
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,650
She's not your daughter in law. She's mine.

1107
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,020
End it.

1108
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:32,390
This won't win me back.

1109
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,040
You and I are over.

1110
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,980
I don't want to hear that from you.

1111
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,210
Aren't you going to move away?

1112
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:37,980
What?

1113
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:40,620
I hate running into you.

1114
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:41,920
What's the extreme measure?

1115
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:43,320
What are you going to do?

1116
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,210
Honey, what was that?

1117
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,040
Where is the deed to the house?
