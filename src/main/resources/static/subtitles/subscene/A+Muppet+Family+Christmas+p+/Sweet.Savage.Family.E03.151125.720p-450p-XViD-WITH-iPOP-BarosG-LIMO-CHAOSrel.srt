<i>The chairman likes to do things big.</i>

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,590
<i>He deposited three billion
dollars right away.</i>

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,220
<i>Is it Tae Soo or the movie
that you're investing in?</i>

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,680
<i>He's been edgy since he
invested in the movie.</i>

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,520
<i>Did they run away?</i>

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,600
<i>Didn't the chairman deposit
three billion won?</i>

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,860
<i>Get out and find him.</i>

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,120

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,420
<i>Do it right.</i>

17
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,010
<i>I want to see how big his smile can get.</i>

18
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,570
<i>I'm doing this because I trust you.</i>

19
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,660
<i>It can change our lives!</i>

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,710
<i>Where is that bastard now?</i>

21
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,010
<i>Did you do that?</i>

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,620
<i>Then why is his dead body in your trunk?</i>

23
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,390
<i>Ouch!</i>

24
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,140

<i>[Episode 3]</i>

27
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,430
Excuse me. I need to inspect your car.

28
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,950
Ah...

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,870
Oh, you are working hard.

30
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,050
Is something going on?

31
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,600
An armed soldier deserted
the base nearby.

32
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,570
Oh... Geez.

33
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,680
We got grocery at the market.

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,920
Right.

35
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,420
<i>Please open the trunk.</i>

36
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,520
<i>Please open the trunk.</i>

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,930
Honey...

38
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,900
What are you doing now?

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,060
Excuse me.

40
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,590
Can I see you for a second?

41
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,530
Just for a moment... Yeah.

42
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,350
Well, here.

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,390
I asked you to open
the trunk, but what is this?

44
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,790
Well, it's okay. Please get
yourself something to eat.

45
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,220
Look carefully.

46
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,170
It's not a 5,000 won bill.

47
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,960
Keep up the good work.

48
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,980
Over here.

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Please come over here.

50
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,520
Honey.

51
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,860
Honey!

52
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,280
What was that?

53
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,400
What the heck is going on? Huh?

54
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,260
Huh? What is this sound?

55
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,230
Honey!

56
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,620
Huh? What the heck!

57
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,860
I'm scared!

58
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,190
- What...
- I'm scared?

59
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,960
- What the heck is going on?
- I'm scared!

60
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,170
What the heck?

61
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,140
Oh my goodness!

62
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,390
Please chase that vehicle!

63
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,580
What?

64
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,500
We don't know what will
happen if we don't stop him!

65
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,540
Hurry!

66
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,680
Why do you ask me that?

67
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,860
Get out now.

68
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,550
It'll take a few minutes until
the special team gets here.

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,640
It's not my business.

70
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,070
Go to the Ace Department Store.

71
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,510
His ex-girlfriend works there.

72
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,860
- That's close to Soo Min's school!
- What?

73
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,210
He even has a rifle and grenades.

74
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,610
Grenades?

75
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,680
Yes.

76
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,030
If he holds someone hostage
it can get really serious.

77
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,560
Sir, I am begging you.

78
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Many people's lives are depending on you.

79
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,250
Gosh, I'm going to die from running.

80
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,460
My goodness!

81
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,110
What's happening here!

82
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,650
Gosh!

83
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,110
I can't believe this.

84
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,540
Oh, it's that vehicle!

85
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,100
Oh? Yeah!

86
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,490
Ah! Honey!

87
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,880
Oh my goodness!

88
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,490
Oh, gosh!

89
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,130
Honey, get off right up there.

90
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,250
Why?

91
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,060
There's a short cut. I know it
because I take Soo Min to school.

92
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,730
Right now!

93
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,040
Okay, I got it.

94
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,350
Hold tight!

95
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,880
I said hold tight!

96
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,550
We got ahead of him.
Get close and stop the vehicle.

97
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,450
What? You can't do that!

98
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,050
We are buckled up.
We won't get hurt.

99
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,870
In the worst case, the trunk
might suffer some damages.

100
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,370
Not the trunk!

101
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,220
Don't worry. You'll get compensated.

102
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,290
Ah!

103
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,340
What are you doing?
He might get ahead of you!

104
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,240
Be quiet!

105
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,580
Honey!

106
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,480
Duck and cover!

107
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,330
Oh, man. What just happened?

108
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,550
Are you okay?

109
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,060
My neck!

110
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,600
What the heck?

111
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,110
What on earth just happened? Huh?
Gosh!

112
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,150
<i>Around 11 AM today</i>

113
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,690
<i>an armed solider deserted the base nearby
with a grenade and 30 bullets.</i>

114
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,720
<i>He was arrested around 1 PM right here.</i>

115
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,130
<i>The officials said that he was headed
toward a department store in Daejeon</i>

116
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,530
<i>where his ex-girlfriend who
had left him was working.</i>

117
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,130
<i>According to the military and
police joint investigation</i>

118
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,000
his arrest was made possible
thanks to one brave citizen.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,180
Right here, we have the hero who risked
his life and saved many people's lives.

120
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,470
Hello.

121
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,400
Oh, hello.

122
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,920
You did an amazing thing today.
Aren't you hurt?

123
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,400
Well, my neck is a bit... but I'm fine.

124
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,680
I see.

125
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,170
Judging from the damages in your car

126
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,890
I can imagine how serious
the situation was. How was it?

127
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,310
I just did what I was supposed to do.

128
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,390
It would've been bad if he
had held a hostage downtown.

129
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,960
My daughter’s school is really
close to that department store.

130
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,160
Oh, I see. Well...

131
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,500
I heard it was almost like in a movie.

132
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,590
Interestingly, you are making
a movie now.

133
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,130
Oh, yes...

134
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,060
It's a movie about gangsters in Daejeon.

135
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,220
- Gangster movie?
- Yes.

136
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,290
Wow. I wish you good luck on your movie!

137
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,380
Ah!

138
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,300
Oh! Are you okay?

139
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,330
Are you okay?

140
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,360
The police department decided to give the
Brave Citizen Award to Mr. Yoon Tae Soo

141
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,720
for his courageous action, which
helped resolve the situation.

142
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,960
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

143
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,570
- Don't touch me.
- I got it.

144
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,070
<i>This afternoon, an armed deserter
was arrested after a long car chase</i>

145
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,780
<i>thanks to a brave citizen who
risked his life to save others.</i>

146
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,230
<i>This citizen is making
a movie based on Daejeon</i>

147
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,710
<i>which became an instant top news.</i>

148
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,460
<i>Now from Reporter Ma Bong Choon.</i>

149
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,160
<i>The military and police
joint investigation team...</i>

150
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,350
What the heck!

151
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,150
Grandma, Dad is on TV!

152
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,220
- <i>Hello.</i>
- <i>Oh... well...</i>

153
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,580
<i>Hello.</i>

154
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,430
<i>You did an amazing thing today.</i>

155
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,990
<i>Aren't you hurt?</i>

156
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,110
<i>Well, my neck is a bit... but I'm fine.</i>

157
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,150
I was on TV just now.

158
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,870
If I turned myself in,
it should've been then.

159
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,110
It's too late now.

160
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,800
We can't delay it any longer.

161
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,730
If we told them there's
a corpse in my trunk

162
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,860
would they thank us for telling them?

163
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,070
They would suspect us and
wouldn't let us go home.

164
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,600
And what about the kids?

165
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,850
Really?

166
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,650
Ms. Kim Eun Ok?

167
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,540
It's you, right?

168
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,230
From the Neighborhood Watch Team?

169
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,330
Oh! Sir!

170
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,910
How have you been?

171
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,730
- Have you been well?
- Of course.

172
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,040
Aren't you the man who
got the deserter, Mr. Yoon Tae Soo?

173
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,560
Oh... Yes.

174
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,020
This is my husband.

175
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,940
Wow, it's nice to meet you.

176
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,770
Oh, yes.

177
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,680
You are an exemplary couple.

178
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,630
We are planning to hold
a ceremony next week

179
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,210
to give you a Brave Citizen
award medal and a plate.

180
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,670
Will you be able to attend?

181
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,400
Oh... sure.

182
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,050
By the way, what brought
you to the police station?

183
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,430
Well...

184
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,280
That is...

185
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,760
We were just wondering

186
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,550
if we should give them more
details about the incident today.

187
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,000
Wow, you are such law-abiding citizens!

188
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,170
If everyone were like you

189
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,360
our country would be
a much better place to live!

190
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,550
Oh...

191
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,790
Oh, thank you.

192
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,370
Dig deep!

193
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,990
Do it faster!

194
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,700
Geez, I'm working on it.

195
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,660
Oh, man! There are so many rocks!

196
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,020
Geez!

197
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,230
Geez!

198
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,840
Why does she keep calling me?

199
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,900
Hi, Kyung Mee!

200
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,160
Congratulate me?
Please don't say that.

201
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,590
Right now?

202
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,950
Thanks a lot.

203
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,600
Of course, we are having a good time.

204
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,300
Okay, talk to you later!

205
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,950
Gosh.

206
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,940
What are you doing?
Waiting for snacks?

207
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,590
Do it faster. I'm scared
to death right now.

208
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,700
You know I hurt my back earlier.
It must be bad.

209
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,310
My goodness.

210
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,710
Give me that. Step aside.

211
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,370
You dug this spot forever!

212
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,330
Oh my back.

213
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,700
- It's killing me.
- Get out.

214
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,380
Okay. What am I going to do?

215
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,430
Is there anything you do right?

216
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,370
You can't do well at night.
You can't dig.

217
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,110
How could your back give out already?

218
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,220
Gosh, your back is useless!

219
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,560
Gosh!

220
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,780
Oh, my!

221
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,810
What do we do now?

222
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,070
I'm scared.

223
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,950
Gosh.

224
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,510
Shut your mouth!

225
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,550
Put.... put him away.

226
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,710
You do it. I'm scared.

227
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,630
My goodness.

228
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,760
Mr. Son!

229
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,660
Your feet must hurt. Stop!

230
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,510
Hey, Mr. Son!

231
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,400
You will hurt your feet!

232
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,370
Hey!

233
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,740
Geez! Geez!

234
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,140
You are a rat!

235
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,760
Bastard! Wake up!

236
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,110
Huh? Hey?

237
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,940
Wake up!

238
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,890
Wake up, bastard...

239
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,680
No!

240
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,300
Shit.

241
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,760
Should we call 911?

242
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,240
Are you crazy?

243
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,020
Then what should we do?

244
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,740
Give me a minute.

245
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,770
I need to think.

246
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,900
I'm sorry. We are closed--

247
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,510
I don't like how you
show up without notice.

248
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,820
Stop doing that.

249
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,380
You hate seeing me that much?

250
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,050
What a strange question.
We are already divorced.

251
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,860
Get to the point. I need to go home.

252
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,600
Hyun Jee...

253
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,970
I wondered if I could see her.

254
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,930
Do you mean it
or are you just saying that?

255
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,970
It's better to keep it the way it is
if you're going to only hurt her.

256
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,330
You said she missed me.

257
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,440
I'm curious too.

258
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,940
I will ask Hyun Jee then.

259
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,030
What did you talk about with Tae Soo?

260
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,580
It seemed nice.

261
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,310
I didn't want to believe it.

262
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,500
But you were really spying on me?

263
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,650
And you came here to ask me that?

264
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,700
Just answer me.

265
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,510
I don't know why I have to answer that.

266
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,770
But it is as you saw.

267
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,410
If I was smiling, it means
I was happy to see him.

268
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,540
If I looked upset just like now
I was probably angry.

269
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,220
Need more explanation?

270
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,860
Are you defending Tae Soo too?

271
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,270
A movie-maker? Heroic citizen?
He must look amazing.

272
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,090
But he's nothing.

273
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,050
It's going to be over for him soon!

274
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,090
Why are we here...?

275
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,050
Well, what about it?

276
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,200
How can you think of that
in this kind of situation?

277
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,100
What the heck are you thinking about?

278
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,840
You're covered with dirt.

279
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,850
Should I wash first?

280
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,810
Yes, you wash first.

281
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,650
'Should I wash first?'

282
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,110
'You go first.'

283
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,830
Who would say those words
in this kind of context?

284
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,300
Why do you say that?

285
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,190
What's going to happen to us?

286
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,290
I looked it up online.

287
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,210
You get seven years for
throwing away a dead body.

288
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,880
How are we going to send
Sung Min to college?

289
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,720
Soo Min is so sensitive.
She could go astray.

290
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,930
What's going to happen to our kids?

291
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,780
Eun Ok.

292
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,220
Having a gangster father wasn't enough.

293
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,990
Now both of their parents are criminals.

294
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,650
Listen to me.

295
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,020
Please listen to me.

296
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,360
You know nothing about this.

297
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,950
You didn't see anything.
You didn't do anything.

298
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,390
You eat and send the kids
like you always did.

299
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,930
Wipe this from your memory!

300
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,750
Does it solve anything?

301
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,330
There's no secret in this world.

302
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,960
Someday everything will be revealed.
What if we get the blame?

303
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,750
Honey...

304
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,980
Let's go tell the police.

305
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,560
You didn't kill him.

306
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,160
We buried his body because
we were out of our minds.

307
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,990
If we tell them the truth, they'll
take that into consideration.

308
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,180
Honey, please?

309
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,840
Please? Honey...

310
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,220
Please... let's do that.

311
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,920
Let's do that.

312
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,080
You!

313
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,170
- What are you doing?
- You!

314
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,480
You, bastard!

315
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,940
As a gangster wife, I couldn't
sleep well for 18 years!

316
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,540
How could you do this to me?

317
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,030
Did I ask you to make me rich?

318
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,170
Did I ask you to serve me like queen?

319
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,640
How could you do this to me?

320
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,430
I want my life back!

321
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,230
Bring my life back, you bastard!

322
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,840
Asshole!

323
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,660
Asshole!

324
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,740
You are a bastard!

325
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,250
Bastard! Bastard!

326
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,280
You are a bastard!

327
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,610
Bastard.

328
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,200
You are bad! Bad!

329
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,630
Oh, man!

330
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,760
The heroic citizen, Yoon Tae Soo is home!

331
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,350
You look different!

332
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,920
My son, I'm so proud of you!

333
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,450
I am still alive because
I had to see this!

334
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,660
Mom, you were on TV too.

335
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,710
That's right!

336
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,410
What's wrong with her on this joyful day?

337
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,170
Just leave her alone. She must be tired
because it was pretty traumatic.

338
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,410
Dad, what happened to your face?

339
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,000
Huh?

340
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,390
Oh, no!

341
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,870
What happened to your face, my child?

342
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,780
It must have happened during the chase.
It's nothing.

343
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,210
Glorious bruises!

344
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,710
Look here and tell me more details.

345
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,100
Let's do it another time. I'm tired too.

346
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,710
Do it now. I promised to
send a video to my friends.

347
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,360
Just do it.

348
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,550
You are strong enough to
catch an armed soldier.

349
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,870
Then show only this side.

350
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,400
All right!

351
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,720
Go, go!

352
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,550
I hurt my back.

How hard did you work your back
that it's already giving out?

00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,830
<i>[Tree-planting ceremony for
righteous Yoon Tae Soo]</i>

355
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,400
- It's a good day!
- Yes, it is.

356
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,420
This is big!

357
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,130
Congratulations!

358
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,920
This is a righteous tree!
It's going to bring blessings!

359
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,670
Plant it well.

360
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,340
To Yoon Tae Soo!

361
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,950
Toast!

362
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,720
What if that deserter had thrown
a grenade at the department store?

363
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,050
It would have been bad!

364
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,600
Tae Soo saved hundreds of lives!

365
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,080
Yes, he did!

366
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,530
Mr. Yoon Tae Soo did an amazing thing!

367
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,220
Please don't say that.

368
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,000
It's not enough that
I'm buying him a drink.

369
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,670
He should get a purple
medal at the Blue House!

370
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,340
The movie, and now the medal...
You hit many home runs.

371
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,740
You'll hit a grand slam home run soon.

372
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,560
Something big is going to happen.

373
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,140
Gosh, what are you talking about?

374
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,950
Sir, did you hear that?

375
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,140
What he did was worth one billion
won in advertising for the movie.

376
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,540
Wow, is that so?

377
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,960
Congratulations, Chairman Baek.

378
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:36,320
Gosh, Mr. Son is missing again
on this joyful day.

379
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,680
I told the assemblyman I would
bring Mr. Son this weekend.

380
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,940
What? You mean Mr. Son?

381
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,660
Yes, he has something
important to talk about.

382
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,990
Make sure to bring Mr. Son tomorrow.

383
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,740
We have to make sure we are
on the same page, okay?

384
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,620
Well... sure.

385
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,290
The movie is finally getting made!

386
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,730
Wait and see.

387
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,830
You will make it big! Okay?

388
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,950
Hey, why did you want to see me here?

389
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,690
Gi Bum, I need your help.

390
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,390
Did something happen?

391
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,150
You know the chairman told me
to bring Mr. Son tomorrow.

392
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,740
Then you should do that.

393
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,950
I can't. He's dead.

394
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,840
What? Are you crazy?

395
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,430
It wasn't me.

396
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,310
Someone killed him and put
his body in my trunk.

397
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,210
Who did that?

398
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,410
Anyone who might have done that?

399
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,520
I don't know. I have no clue.

400
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,790
This is bad.

401
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,210
If Dad finds out, he'll be really upset.

402
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,340
Gi Bum, you are the only
person I can depend on.

403
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,840
I'm standing on the edge
of a cliff right now.

404
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,500
I'm in total darkness.

405
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,740
Okay, what should I do then?

406
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,380
Can you hold off the chairman
for a while?

407
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,840
I need to find out who did it.

408
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,580
I don't want to disappoint the chairman.

409
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,150
Would I be your friend
if I couldn't do that much?

410
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,110
Thank you, Gi Bum.

411
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,410
Mr. Son...?

412
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:25,060
How could you and your wife do that...

413
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,970
Are you out of your mind?

414
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,240
What matters is now.

415
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,240
I need to find out who killed Mr. Son.

416
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,430
Wait.

417
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,050
Isn't it strange?

418
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,840
That person is trying to frame you.

419
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,120
But why is he not doing anything?

420
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:50,290
Since you were on TV just now
this is a perfect time to hit you.

421
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
The chairman wants to see Mr. Son.
That's the real problem.

422
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,870
What kind of women is our One
Heart trying to produce?

423
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,360
Kim Eun Ok...

424
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,350
I am sorry.

425
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,270
Our team leader, Kim Eun Ok
was the example.

426
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,470
I want you to learn from her.

427
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,990
That's why I invited all of you here.

428
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,710
One Heart!

429
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,970
You didn't have to do this.

430
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,810
I have done nothing.

431
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,020
Did you see that?

432
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,880
She's humble.

433
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,620
That is the beginning of
being a good wife.

434
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,080
Eun Ok, your husband is
doing really well.

435
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,860
Mine doesn't catch a deserter,
but only gets traffic tickets.

436
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,170
Young Jae's dad is doing well too.

437
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,700
Are you serious?

438
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,040
He came home drunk last night, saying
he wants to quit and run away.

439
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,810
I'm so sick of him! He's like a ghost!

440
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:53,730
The members of One Heart don't
speak ill of their husbands.

441
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,710
I am sorry, Madam.

442
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,110
Oh, wow!

443
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,120
What's all this?

444
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,410
I can't just do nothing when
something good happened to my friend.

445
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,470
Congrats, Eun Ok.

446
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,340
You don't have to do this.

447
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,220
I was so happy to see Tae Soo on TV.

448
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,850
When he came here last time
we couldn't talk much.

449
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,560
Tae Soo came here?

450
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,270
You didn't know that?

451
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,600
What? Did the two of you
already saw each other?

452
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,300
You guys were first loves to each other.
How long has it been?

453
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,980
How was it, huh?

454
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,340
Please.

455
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,700
What? I was just joking.

456
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,370
Kyung Mee is right.

457
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,020
There's nothing. That's why
I'm joking around too.

458
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,770
You aren't upset, right?

459
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,440
Well... of course not.

460
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,210
That's right.

461
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,240
A relationship between a man and
a woman isn't always about romance.

462
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:59,340
We need to be gracious about
others' past romantic relationships.

463
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,590
That's the first step to
become a mature person.

464
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,980
Madam, you and I are like-minded people.

465
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,360
Is that so?

466
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,280
This weekend the chairman
is meeting an assemblyman

467
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,860
with Mr. Son.
You know that right?

468
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,760
With Mr. Son?

469
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,260
Of course, because it's about
investing in the movie.

470
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,370
That's great! Now you have
a politician on board!

471
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,140
Mr. Yoon's movie will
have a lot of support!

472
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,830
Yeah, right.

473
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,010
Wow! Wow!

474
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,090
That's Chungcheong-do's famous kimchi!

475
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,220
You love our herb kimchi, Mr. Chairman.

476
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,180
I tried to be here right
before your dinner time.

477
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,070
You haven't eaten yet, right?

478
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,550
Nope. I can finish a bowl
of rice quickly with this.

479
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,140
- Well, Mr. Chairman.
- Yeah?

480
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:02,010
Gosh, did you forget your doctor
ordered a low-sodium diet?

481
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,070
Please think about your blood pressure.

482
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,430
Yeah, right.

483
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,820
Of course!

484
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,050
Being healthy is the most important.

485
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,300
Please have a small bite when
you don't have an appetite.

486
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,450
I'll let your housemaid know.

487
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,890
Tell me now.

488
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,990
Pardon?

489
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,410
I know the kimchi is just an excuse.
Now get to the point.

490
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,710
Well... it's not quite like that.

491
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,010
I heard you are going to see
an assemblyman this weekend.

492
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,160
And?

493
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,090
Of course it's great to have a powerful
support like that for the movie.

494
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,540
However, I wonder if it's
giving you too much burden.

495
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,570
Not only Tae Soo...

496
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,460
But also Mr. Son and everyone else
should show how they do it on their own!

497
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,870
I think that's the right thing.

498
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,420
You're saying...

499
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,360
I should let them do it on their own
without others' help?

500
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,800
Is that it?

501
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,210
It's rude to turn it down
when the elders want to help.

502
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,430
Pardon?

503
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,700
Well, Mr. Chairman made that arrangement
because he had a plan.

504
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,230
Also, it's good to help out
one another in the local community.

505
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,690
Isn't that right, Mr. Chairman?

506
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,660
Of course it's right.

507
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,590
Madam Oh is right about that.

508
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,680
I want to show Tae Soo and Mr. Son

509
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,960
how I get Assemblyman Kim
on board for the movie!

510
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,640
This is why I adore you, Eun Ok.

511
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,540
Others are busy bribing.

512
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,080
But you worry that your husband
might lose his independence.

513
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,000
She knows how to support her husband.

514
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,530
That's why she's the leader of One Heart.

515
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,600
I know that.

516
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,730
Tae Soo is so lucky!

517
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,360
He's blessed with you and
good people around him!

518
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,280
He's one lucky guy!

519
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,770
What will you do?

520
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,370
The chairman told you to
bring Mr. Son tomorrow.

521
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,630
Don't worry.

522
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,740
I have known him for years.

523
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,550
I will take care of it.

524
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,820
You just take care of the kids.

525
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,970
Are you sure?

526
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,790
You are sure nothing will happen?

527
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,120
Geez, don't you worry!

528
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,430
Come here.

529
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:44,010
It's been a while. Should
I put you to bed tonight?

530
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,380
Geez! Just sleep!

531
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,450
Geez! What timing!

532
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,660
- Gosh, you're dense.
- Why do you always hit me?

533
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,220
My goodness!

534
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,910
He couldn't come again?

535
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,450
I'm sorry.

536
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,120
Did I ask him to come play with me?

537
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,370
I'm trying to get a golden
badge on board for the movie!

538
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,900
He didn't even come to the
blessing ceremony. What's wrong?

539
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,270
I gave you a new arena.
So you should do better.

540
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,150
Do you want to go back to the clubs?

541
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,240
No, it's not that.

542
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,610
Then what is it?

543
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,570
Why are you acting so timidly
like a different person?

544
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,580
Did something happen?

545
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,990
I'm just being concerned.

546
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,710
I know you will do well, Tae Soo.

547
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,040
But make sure to bring Mr. Son when
I see the assemblyman this weekend.

548
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,640
Yes, Sir.

549
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,150
Okay. You can leave now.

550
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,800
Yes, Sir.

551
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,370
Did you want to see me?

552
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,010
You are here. Sit down.

553
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,180
How are things? Are you busy?

554
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,580
I could have been busy. You know.

555
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,220
Did you hear anything about
the movie from Tae Soo?

556
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,850
No. Why?

557
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:20,610
Nothing. I was just curious.

558
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,600
Where the heck is Mr. Son?

559
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,790
Ask Tae Soo.

560
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,930
You should find out.

561
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,300
Don't say anything to Tae Soo.

562
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,590
Did something happen?

563
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,190
Sir, I brought him.

564
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,870
Director, I'm sorry for asking
you to come, when you are busy.

565
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,360
Don't worry.

566
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,830
You must be disappointed
I didn't pay much attention.

567
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,860
No, Sir. I am not disappointed at all.

568
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,330
By the way, why did you want to see me?

569
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,510
Let's just talk.

570
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,290
When was the last time you saw Mr. Son?

571
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:19,420
The day we had a ceremony
for your investment.

572
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,350
I haven't seen him since then.

573
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,160
You mean he disappeared the
day after he got the money.

574
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,920
Did Mr. Son say anything?

575
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,110
He told me to stay in Seoul because
it could be dangerous here.

576
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,500
He said he'd contact me.

577
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,260
You mean he felt in danger, right?

578
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,180
In danger...? I mean...

579
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,770
Your investment...

580
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,560
You mean he was threatened
by someone, right?

581
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,290
- That's not it...
- Be quiet.

582
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,440
Go on.

583
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:57,350
Mr. Yoon took me and
Producer Lee to a lake...

584
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,650
And he would put me in the water...

585
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,670
He told us to make a movie that's worth
three billion won for only one billion.

586
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,710
A low-budget high-quality movie...
he said I should make that...

587
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,540
What?

588
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,370
He's saying... someone
took two billion won.

589
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,590
What happened to Mr. Son?

590
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,350
I don't know that much.

591
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,560
If you don't, who does?

592
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:26,690
I think there's only one
person who would know that.

593
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,430
The one who stole the two billion won.

594
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:33,340
Who took Director Bong?

595
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,120
The secretary of Choong Shin
Construction was here.

596
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,410
When?

597
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,890
It's been a few hours.

598
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,370
You should have told me!

599
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,520
I didn't know it would take this long.

600
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,580
I have a bad feeling about this.

601
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,980
Director Bong!

602
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,140
Yeah.

603
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,490
Are you okay?

604
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,320
I am fine.

605
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,780
Where were you?

606
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,140
I went to see the chairman.

607
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,420
What?

608
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,700
What did he say?

609
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,580
He asked where Mr. Son was.

610
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,730
And what?

611
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:15,150
I told him he disappeared.

612
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,940
I'm sorry.

613
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,090
I felt my life was in danger.

614
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,350
The chairman found out then!

615
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,550
<i>[Dad, bring ice cream
when you come home!]</i>

616
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,450
Dad!

617
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,140
My ice cream!

618
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,410
Thank you!

619
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,880
- You're home.
- Thanks!

620
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,120
I'm home.

621
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,930
The people at the senior center are
demanding that I should treat them!

622
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,450
Are you busy tomorrow?

623
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,610
Mom... let's do it another time.

624
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,510
Another time? When?

625
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,580
Mom... Do I have to do that?

626
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,880
Dad, when are they giving you the medal?

627
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,360
They'll do that when it's time.

628
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,830
I became a star at school because of you!

629
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,310
That's nice, but the teachers
always make me do things now.

630
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,450
Gosh!

631
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:56,070
Stop talking about that.

632
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,890
Is something going?

633
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,860
No.

634
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,320
Then don't make that face.

635
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,010
You are someone who will
do great things. Smile.

636
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,940
Your facial expressions
can change your fate.

637
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,490
I got it.

638
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,440
Tae Soo, speaking of
facial expressions...

639
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,910
The man with good facial expressions...
why is he siding with Gi Bum?

640
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,730
What do you mean?

641
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,570
You know the man.

642
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,410
You showed him on the phone when
you tried to catch the swindler.

643
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,770
He thanked me for saying he'd succeed.

644
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,000
<i>Things will go well for you, Sir.</i>

645
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,190
Thank you, Ma'am.

646
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,850
You mean, he was with Gi Bum?

647
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,630
When? Where?

648
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,450
When was that?

649
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:02,310
I had seafood stew with
a friend at a restaurant.

650
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,770
I saw the man talking with Gi Bum.

651
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,970
Gi Bum went to Pyungchang that day?

652
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,000
I got it.

653
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,790
Could it be the casino in Gwangwon-do?

654
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:22,920
<i>Fraud, gambling, violations of
Foreign Currency Control Law...</i>

655
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,130
<i>He goes to Las Vegas and
Macao as if he lives there.</i>

656
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,580
I said let go!

657
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,790
I just need to see who came here.

658
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,090
Let go!

659
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,680
We have no choice, Sir.

660
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,880
Hey!

661
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,480
Geez.

662
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,280
Gosh.

663
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,660
Oh.

664
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,600
It's me.

665
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,600
Really?

666
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,170
Okay. I'll be there within two hours.

667
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,800
- Is it here?
- Yes, Boss.

668
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Gi Bum tortures guys here.

669
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,630
He probably worked on Mr. Son here

670
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,020
and put him in your trunk when he died.

671
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,440
Gi Bum wouldn't do that.

672
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,770
Boss, look at this.

673
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,370
What's this?

674
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,550
His hands were probably
tied up with that.

675
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,140
Looks like he used all of
his strength to escape.

676
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,360
Why, you can't still believe it?

677
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,400
Gi Bum is the one who killed Mr. Son!

678
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,430
You're being too quick to say that.

679
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,700
Gosh, Gi Bum has a real good friend here.

680
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,260
Bub Gyu may fess up if we beat him.

681
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,920
If that's not enough, just get Gi Bum!

682
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,190
You can't do that.

683
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,070
Is there anything we
can't do at this point?

684
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,610
Be quiet.

685
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,630
I'll take care of it.

686
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,360
You better seal your mouth.

687
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,410
Say something.

688
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,060
I heard you wanted to see me.

689
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,450
I almost couldn't recognize you.

690
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,160
Why? Because I became too pretty?

691
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,550
Because you look like a grown-up.

692
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,860
True. I saw you at the
zoo for the last time.

693
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:13,860
It's been 9 years and 3 months.

694
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,040
Why did you come here?
You were an actress in training.

695
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,960
I quit. It was boring.

696
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,550
Why suddenly?

697
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,210
You were about to debut.
You worked hard.

698
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,530
Why did you age so much?

699
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,160
Do you have a girlfriend?

700
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,250
I heard Grandpa set you up
for blind dates.

701
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,690
Who said that? Your mom?

702
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,590
I guess it's true.
You are embarrassed.

703
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:52,750
Anyway, I'll be disappointed
if you meet just anyone.

704
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,360
She better be prettier, cooler...

705
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,780
and better than Mom.

706
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,550
I'm not sure such woman really exists.

707
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,770
Hyun Jee.

708
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,320
I am really sorry.

709
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,630
- About what?
- Huh?

710
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,200
About everything... everything.

711
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,670
Next time when you come, write
down what you're going to say.

712
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,300
Or record it and just play it.

713
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,790
I don't want to see you
babbling like that.

714
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,620
Bye.

715
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,930
What's up?
What is it this time?

716
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,200
Gi Bum.

717
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,380
Back in high school...

718
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,420
We got caught smoking by the chairman.

719
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,550
We were scolded big time.
Do you remember?

720
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,710
Of course I do. Only I got beaten up.

721
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,110
Actually I was jealous of you.

722
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,230
You have a father who could beat you up.

723
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,850
What the heck are you trying to say?

724
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,070
Now that I think about it, we
had the most fun back then.

725
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,600
We had no worries.

726
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,590
Every day was fun and exciting.

727
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:56,440
But now... My wife, mom, and kids...

728
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,630
I feel such a burden on my shoulders.

729
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:04,060
It's hard to make it every day.

730
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,030
But that's what I guess I live for.

731
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,290
Tae Soo...

732
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,490
- I wouldn't have been alive without you.
- What?

733
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,820
Gi Bum.

734
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,460
We aren't just friends.

735
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,720
Aren't we like brothers?

736
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,430
Was it fun to watch me
suffering all this time?

737
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,570
Your prank was over the line.

738
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,430
You spill soup and I get messy.

739
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,830
It happens all the time
so I'm fine by that.

740
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,160
But if it involves my family
it's a different story!

741
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,850
You should have cleaned that up
even though you were in a hurry.

742
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:05,300
What if someone else found it?

743
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:33,990
Explain it well to the chairman.

744
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:38,230
You know I consider him my own father.

745
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,860
I may not get his love
but I don't want him to hate me.

746
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,370
Oh, man. I'm tired.

747
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,930
Mr. Chairman.

748
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,110
Say something.

749
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,640
It's true that Mr. Son is dead.

750
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:45,990
He was in my trunk, and I buried him.

751
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,250
Is it because of the money?

752
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,630
Do you really doubt me?

753
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:02,190
Oh, Tae Soo.

754
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,720
Just tell him the truth.

755
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,110
You know my dad hates lies.

756
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,230
I was shocked to see the pictures.

757
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,490
Gi Bum... Why are you doing this?

758
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:22,220
I've done enough. You should
do as much for me too.

759
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,630
Isn't spilling soup enough? Now
you want to turn over the table?

760
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:29,180
What are you talking about?

761
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,040
Mr. Chairman. It's me, Tae Soo.

762
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,990
You don't trust me?

763
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,530
Then who did it?

764
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,180
The one who killed him should know.

765
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,200
Dad, the game is over.
It's pointless to ask him.

766
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,640
Be quiet!

767
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:57,860
Tell me who did it.

768
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,320
Sir...

769
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,060
Just say it.
If it's not you, who did it?

770
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,930
Who did it?

771
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,940
That is...

772
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,080
Enough!

773
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,280
What are you doing between friends?

774
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:27,890
You guys, is this all you are?

775
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,960
- Sir...
- Stop!

776
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,430
Get out.

777
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:24,840
Why did you do that?

778
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,170
Why did you let Tae Soo go like that?

779
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,550
He wouldn't do that.

780
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,890
There's evidence. What else do you need?

781
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:34,590
If so, is it right to doubt him first?

782
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,980
Was your relationship trivial like that?

783
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,420
Gosh, I'm dying here.

784
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,330
Are you Tae Soo's lawyer or something?

785
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,840
Mr. Son died and
three billion won disappeared.

786
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,670
You can't just let it slide!

787
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,500
You prescribe medicine
without a diagnosis?

788
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,950
There's an order of
business for everything.

789
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,690
I'll take care of it. You just stay put.

790
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,760
Can I believe what you just said?

791
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,500
Tae Soo has nothing to do with it?

792
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,980
Yes, Sir.

793
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,570
Your name is Young Il?

794
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,390
Yes, Song Young Il.

795
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,880
How long have you been under Tae Soo?

796
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,200
It's been five years.

797
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,030
Did you do a sport?

798
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:20,490
I did Taekwondo.

799
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:23,690
I made the national team, but
I quit due to an injury.

800
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,670
Did you enter college as a special scout?

801
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,890
No, I studied hard.

802
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,770
Wow.

803
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,540
You were smart and athletic.

804
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,590
I didn't know I had such
a talented guy on the team.

805
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,890
Let go. Let go!

806
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:46,050
Guys, stay outside.

807
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,640
Is it you or Gi Bum?

808
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,360
What are you talking about?

809
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:57,500
Fess up while I'm nice.
Who killed Mr. Son?

810
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:59,280
What?

811
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,370
You don't remember because I'm too nice?

812
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:07,720
I need to go escort Boss.
Stop talking nonsense!

813
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,390
What nonsense?

814
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:13,220
I asked you a question, asshole!

815
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,780
Fess up.

816
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,910
Do you want to end up being like Mr. Son?

817
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,620
I said I don't know.

818
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,260
Bastard!

819
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:31,960
Boss, I feel so wronged!

820
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,390
How dare he do this to me!

821
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:39,180
Bub Gyu, I mean, Assistant Manager Chang.

822
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,480
As of tomorrow, you are Manager Chang.

823
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,540
What?

824
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,030
Even though you are upset
you better watch your mouth.

825
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:53,550
Only the two of us know
what happened until we die.

826
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:55,300
Understand?

827
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,370
This is upsetting.

828
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,160
Kyung Mee, you must have been shocked.

829
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:08,270
Of course I was. He's just a driver
and came home like that.

830
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:09,930
Watch the tone of your voice.

831
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,370
What? Am I wrong?

832
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,790
Rest. I'll call you.

833
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,220
Bye.

834
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,360
Well...

835
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,310
How could you talk to him like that?

836
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,080
What?

837
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,540
Want me to repeat it?

838
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:33,050
Tae Soo sent his guys to beat up my guys!

839
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,530
They threatened that they
should say I killed Mr. Son.

840
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,040
You don't get it?

841
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,840
If we don't do anything
Tae Soo will hit us too!

842
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,650
You... really don't know
who Tae Soo is.

843
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,900
Dad...

844
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,330
Dummy!

845
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,570
Idiot!

846
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,380
What are you talking about?

847
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,080
I'll take care of it.

848
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,560
Don't do anything hasty.
Just stay put.

849
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,740
Honey... Eun Ok.

850
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:53,500
I'm home. Go sleep in the bed.

851
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,850
Honey.

852
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,630
Are you really okay?

853
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:03,030
Of course. Don't worry.

854
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,360
Everything will be okay.

855
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:09,750
What about dinner?

856
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,530
I already ate.

857
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,460
Go to sleep.

858
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,910
You only have a few hours to sleep before
you have to send the kids to school.

859
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,180
Okay, I'll go to sleep then.

860
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,360
Yeah.

861
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,350
<i>[Keep us safe today.]</i>

862
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,890
Have a good day. And be careful.

863
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,500
Okay. Go in.

864
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:00,940
Mr. Yoon, the chairman wants to see you.

865
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:09,180
He could just summon me.
How nice he sent a car for me!

866
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,630
Honey.

867
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,540
Don't worry. Just go in.

868
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,360
Sit down.

869
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,720
Have some tea.

870
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:07,260
Yes, Sir.

871
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,640
It's been over 20 years since
you first got on my boat.

872
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,340
Yes.

873
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,750
No matter what, I trust you, Tae Soo.

874
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:27,410
It's not important how
Mr. Son disappeared.

875
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,620
As for me, I have nothing to
worry about, because I have you.

876
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,290
You are reliable.

877
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:38,200
I trust you and I'm grateful to you.

878
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,470
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

879
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:44,260
As for me...

880
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:49,340
Trust is the most important thing
in life.

881
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,700
I know that very well.

882
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,030
You know...

883
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,010
I invested three billion won
because I trusted you.

884
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,460
Pardon?

885
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,680
Didn't I say that?

886
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,110
I invested in the movie
trusting you, not Mr. Son.

887
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,370
What?

888
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:11,970
Mr. Chairman!

889
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:41,900
<i>[IOU]</i>

890
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,160

00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,940
What is this?

892
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:53,110
Mr. Son is dead, and we
have things to sort out.

893
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,350
Sir...

894
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,410
I didn't even see this money.

895
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:02,530
What the heck are you talking about now?

896
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:06,880
Just get this done quickly and move on.

897
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:11,400
Tae Soo, Dad is being nice
because it's you, Tae Soo.

898
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:14,970
You know well what could have
happened if it had been someone else.

Well... Sir!

900
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,740
You said this before.
