00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,040
Oh, my! 

3
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,060
Excuse me. 

4
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,250
Where am I? 

5
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,380
Excuse me... 

6
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,340
I don't know how we got here, 

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,440
but can we pretend this never happened? 

8
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,460
I think I got drunk and made a mistake. 

9
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,960
I'm not this kind of woman. 

10
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,300
But I'm not saying I don't like you 

11
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,970
or regretting what happened last night, 

12
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,300
but I feel rather awkward and embarrassed. 

13
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,690
I'll leave first. 

14
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,980
Keep your eyes closed until you hear the door. 

15
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,340
I'll call you later. 

16
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,860
What? What are you doing? You can't do this! 

17
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,760
What do you mean by that? 

18
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,620
Mom, how did you find me? 

19
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,360
I came to beat the crap out of you. 

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,710
Mom, I'm sorry. 

21
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,260
Are you really? 

22
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,380
Mom, he's done nothing wrong. 

23
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,960
It's all because I got drunk. 

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,660
Are you still drunk? 

25
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,280
- Huh?
- What are you talking about? 

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,070
He? Who? 

27
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,330
Huh? What? Why am I here? 

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,610
Quit drinking so much! 

29
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,630
How can you drink every night? 

30
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,800
And why did you bother your brother instead of going to bed in your own room? 

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,130
And why did you try to kiss him? 

32
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,380
Me? 

33
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,100
You said something about a matchmaker and tried to kiss him. 

34
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,540
You know what he did? 

35
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,380
He slept in my room. 

36
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,070
Thank god your dad's on a business trip. 

37
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,780
He would have kicked you out! 

38
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,940
What did you mean about the matchmaker? 

39
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,840
I don't know. I blacked out. 

40
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,140
Nice going! 

41
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,540
Ouch, that hurts. 

42
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,710
I can't believe you quit your teaching job. 

43
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,960
Help around the house, at least. 

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,930
Ugh, you wreak of alcohol! 

45
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,240
Don't you feel embarrassed? 

46
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,800
Daebak said you had sewer breath. 

47
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,060
What? I don't have sewer breath! 

48
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,490
You do! I can smell it from here! 

49
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,200
Go and brush your teeth. 

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,280
Ugh! I washed this two days ago. 

51
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,560
What if people start talking about you? 

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,040
Who cares about what people say? 

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,490
What? 

54
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,570
I'm just having a bad year, okay? 

55
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,120
Why that little... 

56
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,480
Ugh! 

57
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,830
I'm leaving. 

58
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,310
There isn't much time left.
Study hard. 

59
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,650
You don't need to tell Haebak that. 

60
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,670
Are you okay? 

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,000
- I'm dying.
- Don't come to my room! 

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,470
You jerk! 

63
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,930
I'm not going to fetch you soup. 

64
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,830
Go get it yourself. 

65
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,460
Remember what Bong said? 

66
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,310
It's better to go wild when you're young. 

67
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,840
The law of the total amount of wildness. 

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,830
Look after Jungji today. 

69
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,720
She kept me up all night.
Come home earlier and make the dog noise. 

70
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,230
Uncle, can you do it? 

71
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,310
When I do it, she starts crying. 

72
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,320
I'd cry, too. 

73
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,400
Why don't you have Subak take care of them? 

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,850
She can't do that now. 

75
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,350
Why not? They're her kids. 

76
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:15,320
I raised my kids and took care of my in laws during the war. 

77
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,630
People can't understand the mother in laws 

78
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,920
who talk about the old days and nag their daughter in laws. 

79
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,020
Ask anybody on the street if you want. 

80
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,680
Why would I ask people on the street? 

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,030
They'll get upset if I stopped them. 

82
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,820
I'm going to watch how good you are to Daebak's wife. 

83
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,630
Leave me out.
I won't put my wife through it. 

84
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,990
I know how it feels. 

85
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,870
You haven't sent it yet? 

86
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,760
But I've been waiting for it. 

87
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,760
Okay. 

88
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,350
Sunjeong, I'm sorry. 

89
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,990
It'll arrive some time tomorrow. 

90
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,210
Receive it, but don't open it. 

91
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,480
What is it?
Why are you so concerned? 

92
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,890
It's a secret. 

93
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,930
Oh, no... 

94
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,790
Aren't you writing?
You said you would! 

95
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,520
I will! I will! 

96
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,940
Hello. 

97
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,610
This is my table. 

98
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,080
I always sit here whenever I come here. 

99
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
How did you know? 

100
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,250
It beckoned me. 

101
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,920
Careful, your mouth will split! 

102
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,280
Where are you coming from? 

103
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,970
I was looking for a job. 

104
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,620
Goof-off got a job without me. 

105
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,880
How about you? 

106
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,580
I couldn't take mom's nagging anymore. 

107
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,770
I have to move out if I don't get published this year. 

108
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,120
Get a two bedroom so I can tag along. 

109
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,200
Ugh! 

110
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,120
Gwangbak, buy me some skewered chicken. 

111
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,030
Oh, really?
That sounds like a lot of fun. 

112
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,650
Tell me more. 

113
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,090
I don't think it's all that interesting,
but I'm grateful you think so. 

114
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,330
Do you still see those friends? 

115
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,680
Yes. We drink soju every now and then. 

116
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh, soju! 

117
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,000
But I'm not much of a drinker. 

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,950
But that's no fun. 

119
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,980
That's how you learn about life. 

120
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,200
I'm not saying I can't drink at all. 

121
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,040
I take sips. 

122
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,240
Excuse me. 

123
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,080
I'd love to have a drink, but I have plans. 

124
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,380
That's too bad. I'd like to, too. 

125
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,090
I wanted to continue this at a bar. 

126
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,070
Oh, I love bars, too. 

127
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,190
Just a second. 

128
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,200
Stay still. 

129
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,390
Look what I found. 

130
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,740
Good for you, Hobak. 

131
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,820
Good job. 

132
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,020
You've worked so hard, 

133
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,020
and you finally bought your own place. 

134
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,260
Yes, father. 

135
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,020
I finally bought my own house. 

136
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,770
But Sedal doesn't know yet. 

137
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,770
I'm telling you first. 

138
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,520
I'm proud of you. 

139
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,300
I remember the first place you lived in. 

140
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,360
It was your first visit after I had Sintong. 

141
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,700
It was such an awful place that I didn't even have a housewarming party. 

142
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,160
I walked into the basement floor,  

143
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,170
1 bedroom apartment with no windows, 

144
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,740
and you were lying there in the dark, all swollen right after giving birth... 

145
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,500
It's as if it was yesterday. 

146
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,170
That was the first time I ever saw you cry. 

147
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,910
You didn't make a sound, 

148
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,520
but I still remember 

149
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,140
how your shoulders shook. 

150
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,660
I couldn't even pay for your college tuition, 

151
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:17,910
and I couldn't even give you a decent wedding because of Subak and Don. 

152
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,840
Whenever I think of you, 

153
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,980
it hurts right here. 

154
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,400
It's okay, father. 

155
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,940
I'm rich now. 

156
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,830
It's a 3 bedroom and 2 bathroom apartment. 

157
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,810
I didn't finish college, but I'm a general manager, 

158
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,540
so I'm doing pretty well. 

159
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,000
Owning an apartment in Seoul is a big deal. 

160
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,350
Father, I did well, didn't I? 

161
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,530
Of course, of course. 

162
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,530
I'm very proud of you. 

163
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,980
But I can't tell mom. 

164
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,740
I feel like I've done something wrong. 

165
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,220
Don't think that. Be proud of yourself. 

166
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,440
I will. 

167
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,700
I'll tell mom and Subak later. 

168
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,180
You do that. 

169
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh... 

170
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,750
I feel so relieved now. 

171
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,940
You finally did it. 

172
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,580
Thank you. 

173
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,850
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. 

174
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,970
Okay. 

175
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,240
Subak. 

176
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,540
What are you doing here? 

177
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,540
No reason. 

178
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,080
Did you go grocery shopping? 

179
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,490
Are you buying furniture? 

180
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,230
I was just looking around. 

181
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,630
In case my boys need something later. 

182
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,020
Are you hiding something from me? 

183
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,690
Of course not. 

184
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,420
I have to get back to work. 

185
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,210
It's my lunch break. 

186
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,170
I'll drop by to clean your bathroom. 

187
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,340
Bye, Subak. 

188
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,640
No way. 

189
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,730
I'm sure!
She bought an apartment. 

190
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,030
Father. 

191
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,240
Why are you here? 

192
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,070
Why are you here so late? Huh? 

193
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,750
Why are you telling at her? 

194
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,840
She came to see her girls. 

195
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,720
I thought I made it clear. 

196
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,930
Don't let her come here. 

197
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,680
You were here all day, weren't you? 

198
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,120
She came just now. 

199
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,650
Mother, when did she come? 

200
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,450
I don't know. 

201
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,460
She never says hi or goodbye. 

202
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,790
Maybe she's been here since morning or yesterday, but I didn't see. 

203
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,100
You saw her come just now! 

204
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,480
What do you mean, yesterday? 

205
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,480
I said I didn't see her come in. 

206
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,550
- Did you see?
- No. 

207
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,520
Take your girls and go home. 

208
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,810
Why aren't you taking care of your girls? 

209
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,250
You can't raise kids there. 

210
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,200
There's no sunlight,
and it's infested with roaches. 

211
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,260
You don't know what you're talking about. 

212
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,830
Kill them. 

213
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,410
Look at Hobak. 

214
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,760
She's raising her boys, 

215
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,420
killing all roaches and mice. 

216
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,540
Learn from your little sister. 

217
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,510
She couldn't finish college because of you, 

218
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,220
but she worked really hard and now she's bought... 

219
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,640
Don't tell them, father. 

220
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,220
She bought an apartment, didn't she? 

221
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,220
I'm not saying she did. 

222
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,580
I'm saying she's working hard to buy one. 

223
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,170
Hobak's not relying on her parents. 

224
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,460
Haven't you learned anything from her? 

225
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,600
Go home and stop coming here! 

226
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,180
What's wrong with you! 

227
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,620
Why would you tell at our poor daughter? 

228
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,440
What he said was right. 

229
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,500
Burying coal won't turn it into a diamond. 

230
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,760
I can't believe my ears. 

231
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,300
Subak's coal and Hobak's a diamond? 

232
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,000
She's been suffering from depression! 

233
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,670
How could you yell at her? 

234
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,760
In front of everyone? 

235
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,870
You shouldn't have talked about coal. 

236
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,690
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo. 

237
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,370
Come out. 

238
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,450
Don't keep shaking your head like that. 

239
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,330
You might hurt yourself. 

240
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,560
Oh, how disrespectful! 

241
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,340
You're treating me differently now that I'm working. 

242
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,720
I actually felt like having some beer. 

243
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,620
Pour your husband a glass. 

244
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,620
How dare you! I'm older. 

245
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,710
Me first. 

246
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,220
I don't believe this! 

247
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,680
This can only mean one thing. 

248
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,650
Sintong! Bangtong! 

249
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,010
You'll wake them up! 

250
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,590
I'm exhausted. 

251
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,520
I won't touch you. 

252
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,000
I can't believe you're thinking about that. 

253
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,850
Pour me some beer. 

254
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,500
Yes, older woman. 

255
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,340
Congratulate me. 

256
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,640
Congratulate you? 

257
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,080
Don't ask any questions. 

258
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,830
Just say, "Congratulations." 

259
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,740
I'm going nuts. 

260
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,290
Why? 

261
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,680
You have a knack for such things. 

262
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,730
What? What do I have a knack for? 

263
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,420
You got pregnant with Sintong on your own, 

264
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,070
and you had Bangtong without talking to me. 

265
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,880
And now you're pregnant with a third baby? 

266
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,970
Don't get ahead of yourself. 

267
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,660
It's not a baby. 

268
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,650
You're not pregnant? 

269
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,520
Oh! Thank god. 

270
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,370
Don't even think about it. 

271
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,540
Look at the boys names. 

272
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,270
Sintong and Bangtong. 

273
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,870
What could we name the third child? 

274
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,590
All I can think of is Ddongtong. 

275
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,260
There are plenty of choices. 

276
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,120
Kobrangtong. Sintong, Bangtong, Kobrangtong. 

277
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,200
It's perfect. 

278
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,810
We can't use Kobrangtong! Kobrangtong. 

279
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,090
Actually, it's not bad. 

280
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,390
Here. 

281
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,880
What is it? 

282
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,000
Open it. 

283
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,060
It can't be divorce papers. 

284
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,500
What's this? 

285
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,170
You bought an apartment? 

286
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,580
Yes. 

287
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,910
Are these really the deeds to a home? 

288
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,640
Yes. 

289
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,240
Like Don's sister in law says, 

290
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,490
I can't believe my eyes! 

291
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,870
This isn't fake, is it? 

292
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,930
It's real. 

293
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,450
So in other words, 

294
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,600
we are finally homeowners? 

295
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,330
I'm going nuts! 

296
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,050
Hey, hey! 

297
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,430
Hey! 

298
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,480
What do I do? 

299
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,260
Oh, what do I do? 

300
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,520
Are you seeing him again? 

301
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,880
Of course. 

302
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,910
I can't understand girls who don't get asked back out after blind dates. 

303
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,910
Good for you. 

304
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,860
Grab him. I heard he's rich. 

305
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,720
He's really handsome, too. 

306
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,510
Nice face, nice voice, muscular arms. 

307
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,260
Rich and from a good family. 

308
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,960
He has everything. 

309
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:52,130
If this works out, I can crush Anggeum. 

310
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,970
I get mad just thinking about what she's done to me. 

311
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,450
Maybe I should change my name. 

312
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,370
Park Salla. I hate my name. 

313
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,840
Just you wait, Mrs. Park Salla. 

314
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,450
Men don't escape from me. 

315
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,520
How scary! 

316
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,490
Goof-off. 

317
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,000
How can you get a job without me? 

318
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,170
Don't be such a loser, loser. 

319
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,680
My treat, so eat up. 

320
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,380
I don't need stamina food like this. 

321
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,220
It'll only give me insomnia. 

322
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,440
Your niece is dead. 

323
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,070
I'm going nuts! 

324
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,440
You're crazy. 

325
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,530
Say that after the fact. 

326
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,850
What happened? 

327
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,020
Don't ask. 

328
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,980
I'd love to, but I'm holding my tongue. 

329
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,420
Hobak told me not to say anything. 

330
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,640
What are they? 

331
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,210
How come he has three women? 

332
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,430
He's not more handsome than me. 

333
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,130
He's not darker nor have more bulgy eyes. 

334
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,310
This. 

335
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,650
He must be loaded. 

336
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,530
It's very obvious. 

337
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,010
Women these days only care about one thing. 

338
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,160
Only money. 

339
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,930
If I had money, I'd go to one of those bars  

340
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:17,450
where I can line up a dozen women and pick. 

341
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,410
Hey, you, get out. 

342
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,900
Why is an ugly girl like you here? 

343
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,040
Go home and wash the dishes. 

344
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,750
Hey, you, come over here. 

345
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,660
Ugh, just look at your face. 

346
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,800
Why did you come here for? 

347
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,990
I already have an ugly one at home. 

348
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,020
Attention, at ease, stand up, sit down. 

349
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,290
I'll show them who's boss. 

350
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,890
I know. 

351
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,030
Don, 

352
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,120
I can't stop myself. 

353
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,740
I finally bought an apartment. 

354
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,160
No way. 

355
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,230
Look. 

356
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,670
Incredible! 

357
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,250
I even made a copy for myself. 

358
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,960
I'm utterly happy. 

359
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,390
Finally, Heo Sedal has everything. 

360
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,200
You should be grateful for Hobak. 

361
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,720
You accused her of getting pregnant on purpose. 

362
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,460
I envy you. 

363
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,980
I'd love it if some pregnant woman appeared out of nowhere and said, 

364
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,320
"You're the father of my child." 

365
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,420
Where could she possibly be? 

366
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,580
- Who?
- My other half. 

367
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,100
She's growing up somewhere. 

368
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,050
She's getting old somewhere. 

369
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,650
Who cares. 

370
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,380
If she's rich, she could be a grandmother. 

371
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,740
I could be her dog. 

372
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,250
Let's go, if you're full. 

373
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,160
Ugh, I can't get up.
You go ahead. 

374
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,230
Already?
Eels are amazing. 

375
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,410
Your niece is dead. 

376
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,600
Finally, Heo Sedal has everything. 

377
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,380
I have a wife, kids, an apartment and a job. 

378
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,770
Everything. 

379
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,080
What do you have? 

380
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,790
Nothing. 

381
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,020
Have you thought about your dream? 

382
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,020
What? 

383
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,090
Old man living alone. Perfect. 

384
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,140
Mother. 

385
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,750
Why did you give birth to me? 

386
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:06,600
I'm always being picked on by that goof-off and mistreated by my own nephew. 

387
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:13,350
I went to school like others and finished my army service like others. 

388
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,280
I never did anything special, 

389
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,390
and now I'm already thirty-five. 

390
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,050
The eels didn't do a thing for me. 

391
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,450
I'm actually getting hungry. 

392
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,680
Should I make some instant noodles? 

393
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,050
Why? Instant noodles? 

394
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,520
Are you hungry? 

395
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,970
Wake Anggeum up. 

396
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,920
No, no. Mom, go back to sleep. 

397
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,920
I should. 

398
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,960
I must sleep to dream, dream to see my love, 

399
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,510
see my love to pick berries, pick berries... 

400
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,320
You'll stay up all night. 

401
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,810
Pick berries to make money to go see dad. 

402
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,650
Okay? 

403
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,260
Yes, yes. 

404
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,260
I must see your dad. 

405
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,260
You're so... 

406
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,230
What are you doing?
I said get ready. 

407
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,500
Get ready for what?
Just go to sleep. 

408
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,880
Let's make a baby! 

409
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,390
Let's do it for the country. 

410
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,140
Oh, I'm exhausted. 

411
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,670
This doesn't happen every day! 

412
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,620
I ate eels for dinner. 

413
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,410
Oh, no! Are you crazy? 

414
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,700
Why did you have eels? 

415
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,700
You get sick when you do! 

416
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,070
Right. 

417
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,740
Are you okay? 

418
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,770
Hey, hey! 

419
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,760
Pants, pants 

420
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,620
Two, three, pants, pants 

421
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,560
I'm afraid, pants, pants 

422
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,040
Mother, we're going. 

423
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,600
Are you going to the bath house? 

424
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,420
Yes. 

425
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,840
Have a good bath. 

426
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,160
We will. 

427
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,650
What's that song you're singing? 

428
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,940
Yongpil's song. 

429
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,280
Pants, pants 

430
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,020
I guess he's trying to sell underpants. 

431
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,790
Why don't you buy Anggeum some? 

432
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,930
She's always talking about them. 

433
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,980
I don't know that song. 

434
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,600
You're so good at keeping up with trends. 

435
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,540
Teach me when you learn the whole song. 

436
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,040
Okay. Have fun. 

437
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,610
- Okay.
- We'll be back. 

438
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,210
- Okay.
- See you later. 

439
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,570
Yes, Aeji, grandfather will be back soon. 

440
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,330
Bong, 

441
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,690
watch out for the cars. 

442
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,110
And don't run.
You might fall down. 

443
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,970
Yes, mother. I'll watch out. 

444
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,800
You do that. 

445
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,980
Turn around now. 

446
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,180
Is there anything you want to try out? 

447
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,090
Not really... 

448
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,480
Think about what you want to do. 

449
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,010
You should try it while I'm still working. 

450
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,540
Have a dream. 

451
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,720
Life expectancy of 100 is a long time. 

452
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,750
You have 65 years left,
and I have 85 years left. 

453
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,200
Goodbye. Please come back. 

454
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,820
Hello? 

455
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,240
We were on a blind date a few days ago. 

456
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,400
I'm Yeongdal, Heo Yeongdal. 

457
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,150
It's Heo Yeongdal. 

458
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,920
Yes, right. 

459
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:02,120
I had some business to take care of near your office. 

460
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,050
I'll be done in an hour, so buy me dinner. 

461
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,060
That was your reward. 

462
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,810
You brought a new woman again. 

463
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,490
You caught me. 

464
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,120
You brought other women here? 

465
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,920
I'm a regular here,
so every now and then. 

466
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,930
Let's eat. It's really good. 

467
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,940
Okay. 

468
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:08,190
Most women like fancy restaurants, 

469
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,050
but I love these hole in the wall places. 

470
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,380
Oh, no! Do you know how much this was? 

471
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,920
It was a present. 

472
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,840
I'm not vain or materialistic.
Not at all. 

473
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:27,350
I don't care if you're vain, materialistic or even a gold digger, 

474
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,970
as long as you're pretty. 

475
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,700
I'm working really hard right now. 

476
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,460
I'll try to meet the deadline. 

477
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,110
Gwangbak! 

478
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,480
Go do your homework. 

479
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,860
You can't get married if you nag too much. 

480
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,280
Wang Daebak! 

481
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,590
Sangnam had a blind date and it went well. 

482
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,420
Did I ask? 

483
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,870
Be honest. Are you interested in him? 

484
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,600
- No.
- You like him, don't you? 

485
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,980
Wang Daebak! 

486
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,550
Don't. You're not pretty. 

487
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,340
Wake up. You're so ugly. 

488
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,000
You're old and single. 

489
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,930
Stop it! 

490
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,270
Why are you crying? 

491
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,190
You must really like him. 

492
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,720
You! 

493
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,680
Gwangbak's driving me crazy. 

494
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,540
She's taking everything out on me. 

495
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,790
It's because she's a spinster. 

496
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,490
I know this guy and she has a crush on him. 

497
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,770
Who is he? 

498
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,300
Should we ask her to give her a chance? 

499
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,030
He won't do it. 

500
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,800
He likes pretty women. 

501
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,680
What can I do in a situation like this? 

502
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,820
To make it work, they must see each other often. 

503
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,210
He'll grow fond of her if they do. 

504
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,800
Can we make them run into each other? 

505
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,860
Run into each other? 

506
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,470
That was your reward. 

507
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,490
Mommy! Mom... 

508
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,540
- Oh, boy...
- Sangnam, what's up? 

509
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,650
It's nothing, Mr. Park. 

510
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,390
You look like you won the lottery. 

511
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,140
I'd actually pass out if I won the lottery. 

512
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,390
We fixed it but it keeps making noise. 

513
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,620
You take a look at it. 

514
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,580
Okay. 

515
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,350
You bought an apartment? 

516
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,530
Sedal and Hobak, congratulations. 

517
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,020
You swore you didn't have any money. 

518
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,020
I'm sorry. 

519
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,520
Why are you sorry? 

520
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,920
You bought an apartment. 

521
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,320
It's all uphill from now on for us. 

522
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,150
You bought an apartment, Sedal got a job,
and I'm getting married. 

523
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,750
You're getting married? 

524
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,450
You were seeing someone? 

525
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:56,550
I was always seeing someone.
I'm popular. 

526
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,430
Set some money aside for Yeongdal's wedding. 

527
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,790
We're going to set the date soon. 

528
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,620
She should pay for her own wedding. 

529
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,410
Her older brother should pay for it! 

530
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,480
Mom, don't ruin it for us. 

531
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,670
We're celebrating us buying an apartment. 

532
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,030
You're so weird. 

533
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,840
Whose name is the apartment under? 

534
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,310
We're co-owners. 

535
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,740
She put my name on it, too. 

536
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,030
Hobak, how did you decide to do that? 

537
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,780
He didn't contribute anything. 

538
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,440
Co-owners? 

539
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,500
It should be under the man's name. 

540
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,830
Sedal should be grateful. 

541
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,400
The money's not yours just because you made it. 

542
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,000
You were able to save it thanks to Sedal. 

543
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,190
I asked around and they all said Sedal was president material. 

544
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,630
President? 

545
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,360
That's a lie. 

546
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,340
He would've become president had he met a woman meant to be the first lady. 

547
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,890
I'm sorry he didn't.
It's my fault. 

548
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,180
You should be. 

549
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,850
This means we must give notice on our place. 

550
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,710
Why? Did you buy an apartment, too? 

551
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,070
We'll have to come with you. 

552
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,020
No. There are only three bedrooms. 

553
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,000
Three's enough.
One for you, one for us. 

554
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,990
Mother, I'm sorry, 

555
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:16,310
but the reason why I got a loan to buy this apartment was for the boys. 

556
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,150
I want them to have their own rooms. 

557
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,070
So you're leaving us behind? 

558
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:24,400
Fine! You go off and live on your own! 

559
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,820
Hobak, that's mean! 

560
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,710
We stuck together through difficulties,
and now you're leaving us behind? 

561
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:32,810
Mother, I'm sorry.
Later... 

562
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,030
Later when?
When I'm dead? 

563
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:40,610
You're not even sixty yet,
so living together won't be comfortable. 

564
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,170
You shouldn't be that way. 

565
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,960
You could at least ask us to come with you! 

566
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,250
Well, mother... 

567
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,510
Oh, boy... 

568
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,860
What do we do? 

569
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,160
I'll take care of it. 

570
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,190
Sedal! Mom wants you to come over! 

571
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,840
Ugh... You look disgustingly happy. 

572
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,480
Close your mouth! 

573
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,780
It's structurally impossible to close my mouth. 

574
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,190
And that's why I drool. 

575
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,350
You drool when you see women. 

576
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:17,020
Talk to your wife and take us with you. 

577
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,410
She won't listen to me. 

578
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,330
You should convince her. 

579
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,380
How can you leave your mom and sister here? 

580
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,740
Right. And move into a nice apartment. 

581
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,940
Sons are useless. 

582
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,750
Buying an apartment isn't great at all. 

583
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,370
I'll do my best. 

584
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,440
Please! 

585
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,280
You go and get married! 

586
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,510
Parcel service! 

587
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,390
Is anyone home? 

588
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,920
It's parcel service! 

589
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,010
Hello? 

590
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,560
Parcel service. 

591
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,260
Is anyone home? 

592
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,660
Sir! Sir! 

593
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,390
Hello? Is this 911? 

594
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,670
- Good job.
- Thank you. 

595
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,690
He's such a good person. 

596
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,750
Father. 

597
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,100
It's me, Minjung. 

598
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,530
How are you? 

599
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,200
I couldn't go see you during the holidays. 

600
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,410
I'm sorry, father. 

601
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,170
Everyone knows how busy parcel service people get around the holidays. 

602
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,040
Is everyone doing okay? 

603
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,590
You're not skipping meals, are you? 

604
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,350
Don't worry about me. 

605
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,620
I'm not working too hard. 

606
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,800
I work when I get bored. 

607
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,650
The fruits this year aren't very good. 

608
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,110
How are Subak and the girls? 

609
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,980
They're all good. 

610
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,630
Don't work too hard, father. 

611
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,880
And take good care of your health. 

612
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,050
If anything happens,
call me day or night. 

613
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,010
I'll drop by when things settle down. 

614
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,300
Goodbye, father. 

615
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,660
Parcel service.
Are you Mr. Park Jaesam? 

616
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,020
I'll be there in ten minutes. 

617
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,820
Okay. 

618
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,690
Welcome.
Are you checking in? 

619
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,690
This way... 

620
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,590
You must be happy. 

621
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,680
She asked for you.
Specifically. 

622
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,460
It's room service. 

623
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,910
Take it up. 

624
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,820
Room service. 

625
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,930
In here. 

626
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,850
Room service. 

627
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,800
What are you looking at? 

628
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,220
I'm not looking. 

629
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,890
It's okay. You can look. 

630
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,330
Bring me a glass. 

631
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,560
Yes, ma'am. 

632
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,650
Where should I put it? 

633
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,090
Over here. 

634
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,090
- Excuse me?
- Right here. 

635
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,280
Okay. 

636
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,760
Why do you always do that when I'm around? 

637
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,600
Are you doing this on purpose? 

638
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,390
You think I wait for you to do this? 

639
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,950
Unlike you, I'm a busy person. 

640
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,110
As you can see, I'm a professional. 

641
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,590
Ha! Professional my butt! 

642
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:02,120
You lost all your customers to that new beauty salon. 

643
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,200
What? 

644
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,320
If you were good, you wouldn't lose customers. 

645
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,090
What do you know about me? 

646
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:11,570
I had a salon in Myeongdong when I was younger. 

647
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:17,210
You wouldn't know because you were too busy cooking at home. 

648
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,710
Anyway, I'm doing much better than you 

649
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:23,290
who is busy raising your grandchildren. 

650
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:27,370
Ha! I can't believe my ears. 

651
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,080
I'm better off than you. 

652
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,750
Don't get mad. 

653
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,170
Anyway, congratulations. 

654
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,570
About what? 

655
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:39,200
Your second daughter's set for life. 

656
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,660
You should've been nicer to Hobak instead of focusing on Subak. 

657
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,660
Let's be honest here. 

658
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,050
What have you done for her? 

659
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,570
You're Mrs. Vice Principal, 

660
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:56,390
and you let your daughter get married without any dowry. 

661
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,800
Did you know that people talked behind your back about that? 

662
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,320
I let it go because I'm a nice person. 

663
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,700
Who said what? Who? 

664
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,980
Which one was it? 

665
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,180
Everyone talked about you. 

666
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,040
You can go and ask. 

667
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,380
Are you on drugs? 

668
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,020
You seem determined. 

669
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,610
You think I don't have anything to say? 

670
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:22,340
She was carrying a child, and that should've been enough of dowry! 

671
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:26,710
She gave birth to two healthy boys! 

672
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,080
But she should've brought dowry. 

673
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,500
You should be nicer when she moves this time. 

674
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,020
Buy her a fridge or a TV. 

675
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,120
I'm letting you know early. 

676
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,630
Stop. 

677
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,320
What are you talking about? 

678
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,570
You don't understand Korean? 

679
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,900
Your second daughter. 

680
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:51,270
When she moves to the new apartment, buy her a gift. 

681
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,990
Move? 

682
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,790
You didn't know? 

683
00:46:55,790 --> 00:47:00,220
She bought an apartment across the street, 
and they're moving there next week. 

684
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,340
You're her mother and you didn't know? 

685
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,230
Why are you scared?
Did you commit a crime? 

686
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:16,540
You bought it with the money you earned! 

687
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,710
Brag about it. 

688
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,900
Go to your mother's and brag about it. 

689
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,040
Why are you sorry? 

690
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,200
Is what happened to Subak your fault? 

691
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,480
Grandmother. 

692
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,480
Oh, hi. 

693
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,760
Did you bring something? 

694
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,080
Have a seat. 

695
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,340
What's that? 

696
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,610
Buns. They are for you and mom. 

697
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:49,720
You always came empty handed before. 

698
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,050
I can't believe you. 

699
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,160
I wouldn't get upset over buying a house. 

700
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,520
Why would you hide it?
How devious of you! 

701
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,180
You bought an apartment? 

702
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,240
Yes, grandmother. 

703
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,720
Oh, wow. 

704
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,460
How did you do that? Where? 

705
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,620
The apartment across the street. 

706
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,550
Oh, that place is expensive! 

707
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,610
Hey, hey, hey, hey! 

708
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,070
Hobak bought an apartment. Applaud! 

709
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,180
- Oh, my!
- Oh! 

710
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,410
Hobak, congratulations! 

711
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,420
Wang Hobak, good for you. 

712
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,250
Why do you look so sour? 

713
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,760
Aren't you happy? 

714
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:28,070
I'm too happy for words because I heard it from her mother in law. 

715
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,540
She picked the moving date and bought new furniture, 

716
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,260
but didn't say a word. 

717
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,700
How could you let me hear it from that beauty salon woman? 

718
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,400
I'm sorry, mom. 

719
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,920
When Subak saw you walking out from the realtor's office with a contract, 

720
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,440
you swore it wasn't true. 

721
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,090
Did you think I'd steal it from you? 

722
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,900
It wasn't that. I just felt bad. 

723
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,760
So you know you should feel bad? 

724
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,850
How could you do it at a time like this? 

725
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,940
It's about time she bought an apartment. 

726
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,150
I agree. 

727
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:05,540
We should congratulate her, not scold her, don't you think? 

728
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,560
You stay out of this. 

729
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,280
You don't know what you're talking about. 

730
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:12,940
I should've told you first. I'm sorry. 

731
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,730
Don't be mad, mom. 

732
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:16,490
I'm sorry. 

733
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:20,200
I brought your favorite buns. Have some. 

734
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,370
You eat them all! Crappy buns! 

735
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,650
Right? She bought an apartment, right? 

736
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,020
She's heartless. 

737
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,020
It's like she's rubbing it in. 

738
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,060
You really don't have any money? 

739
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,510
Of course, I don't! 

740
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,800
You don't have a secret stash put away? 

741
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,210
What's that? 

742
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:56,480
You've been married for long enough,
and you didn't secretly save any money? 

743
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,540
Why would I do that? 

744
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:04,230
That's how you help your mom out. 

745
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:09,240
You didn't save any money behind your husband's back? 

746
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,800
I don't have any such thing! 

747
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,850
I would've used it if I had. 

748
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,500
Why didn't you tell me this before? 

749
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,720
I didn't know I could stash money. 

750
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,990
And I never needed to do that. 

751
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:21,650
I used what Minjung brought me. 

752
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,620
Why would you hit me? 

753
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,560
I'm just so frustrated! 

754
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,550
You should've prepared for emergency. 

755
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,900
I thought you had something. 

756
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,760
I had no idea you'd be flat broke. 

757
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,460
I can't believe you. 

758
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,900
Talking to you is making me madder. 

759
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,010
I'm already upset.
Don't add to that. 

760
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,060
Give me back everything I gave you! 

761
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,290
What? 

762
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,100
Oh, boy... 

763
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,220
Go inside.
I don't want to see you. 

764
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,130
Ugh, I'm so frustrated. 

765
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,230
Subak! 

766
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,520
Oh, my! It is you! 

767
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
I didn't think it was you. 

768
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,920
So the rumors are true! 

769
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,830
Is this your place? 

770
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:19,710
No, I'm just visiting someone. 

771
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,540
Don't be like that, Subak. 

772
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:26,780
How could you live in a place like this? 

773
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,290
There must be roaches here, right? 

774
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:31,600
What are you doing here? 

775
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:36,010
Oh, I had to collect money near here. 

776
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,330
Uh, please keep this a secret. 

777
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,490
Don't tell any of our friends. 

778
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:41,850
Please. 

779
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:45,120
Of course. I won't tell anyone. 

780
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:51,020
Nobody would believe me if I told them that you're living in a place like this. 

781
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,390
Oh! There you are! 

782
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:57,200
You never answer your door! 

783
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,880
Me? 

784
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,030
You don't recognize me? 

785
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,030
I'm your landlord. 

786
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,800
I'm not good with faces. 

787
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,940
Whatever! 

788
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,870
Why aren't you cleaning the bathroom? 

789
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:14,520
Didn't I tell you we must take turns? 

790
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,070
But I don't use that bathroom. 

791
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,410
What do you mean you don't use it? 

792
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:21,070
Everyone must use the bathroom. 

793
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,590
If you don't, you'll die. 

794
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:25,590
I don't. I'm using a chamber pot. 

795
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:30,410
Oh, you're using a chamber pot? 

796
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,690
Oh, my... 

797
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:37,960
Excuse me, she can't do that.
Can you leave her out? 

798
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,620
She used to live in a huge apartment. 

799
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,240
She was in the Miss Korea pageant. 

800
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,250
Stop! 

801
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:47,150
Who hasn't been in the Miss Korea pageant? 

802
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,440
I was in it, too. 

803
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,280
But I didn't pass the preliminaries. 

804
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,640
Oh, she didn't either. 

805
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,090
Stop! 

806
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:58,420
You must follow the rules here. 

807
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,540
Come with me! 

808
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,260
Rub it clean! Clean! 

809
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,360
Rub the corners, too! 

810
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,020
You don't need to cover your nose! 

811
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,330
It all came out from people's bellies. 

812
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,330
Over here, rub here, too. 

813
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,680
Oh, the people are awful. 

814
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,770
Why can't they aim better? 

815
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,710
It's parcel service.
I'll get it. 

816
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:50,480
- I'll get it.
- Okay, Daese. 

817
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,970
Why did you come so late? 

818
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:58,290
I'm sorry. The traffic was really bad. 

819
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:00,080
Here it is. 

820
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,700
I stayed home because you were coming. 

821
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,950
And you're two hours late. 

822
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,170
This won't happen again. 

823
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:09,600
I'm very sorry. Goodbye. 

824
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,510
Let's see. 

825
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:43,890
Uh, Sunjeong. 

826
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,170
Come here. 

827
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:47,760
Tada! 

828
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,060
What do you think? 

829
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,200
Do you like it? 

830
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,480
It's pretty. 

831
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,970
Here, it's for you. 

832
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:56,390
Me? It's mine? 

833
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:59,520
I bought it off the internet for you. 

834
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,520
It's not my birthday... 

835
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,300
Thank you, Daese. 

836
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,640
I thought this would lift your spirits. 

837
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,580
You didn't have to. 

838
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,200
What? 

839
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,550
I wanted to see the girls. 

840
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,550
They went to bed. 

841
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:24,760
Can I see them sleeping? 

842
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,100
Why would you do that? 

843
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,540
Putting them to bed was hard. 

844
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,710
Don't wake them up. Just go. 

845
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,930
Seeing them asleep won't change anything. 

846
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:35,590
Aeji must be asking for me. 

847
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:36,820
She's not. 

848
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,410
Then please give these to... 

849
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:42,960
Leave them there. 

850
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:47,720
Do you know Subak has depression? 

851
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:54,080
Don't walk around carrying cookies. 

852
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,020
Try to make your wife feel better. 

853
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,920
Hello, Minjung. 

854
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,260
It's been a long time, Daebak. 

855
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,400
Share these with Aeji. 

856
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,460
Okay. 

857
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,580
Aeji said she misses you. 

858
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,130
She never said that! 

859
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,650
Go to your room and study. 

860
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,100
Go. 

861
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,360
Good night, then. 

862
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:18,510
So you want to see the girls? 

863
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,320
Dad! 

864
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,600
Yes, Aeji! 

865
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,800
Aeji, I woke you up! 

866
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,480
Dad, why didn't you come?
I missed you. 

867
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:34,050
I missed you so much, too. 

868
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:37,210
I will come every day to see you. 

869
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:38,980
You woke her up? 

870
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,520
Aeji, come here! 

871
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,260
Grandma, I hate you!
I want dad! 

872
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,370
What are you doing? Go! 

873
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:48,840
I will. 

874
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,370
Good night. 

875
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:55,270
Aeji, I'll see you tomorrow. 

876
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:56,970
I'll come back tomorrow. 

877
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:59,570
Dad! 

878
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,300
- Dad!
- No! 

879
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:04,460
- Dad!
- No, Aeji. 

880
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,290
- Dad!
- No! 

881
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,960
I'm home. 

882
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,080
We need to talk. 

883
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,240
Get up. 

884
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,470
What is it? I'm exhausted. 

885
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,550
You're not cooking? 

886
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:53,370
What? 

887
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:55,920
Are you buying the rice and side dishes? 

888
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,250
What's wrong with that?
They're delicious. 

889
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,500
We're not out on a picnic. 

890
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,150
How can you buy everything? 

891
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:03,940
We won't save any money this way. 

892
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,700
We should buy rice and make it ourselves. 

893
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,560
The rice cooker will cook it for you. 

894
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,660
How can you buy ready made food?

895
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,980
But I don't know how to do it! 

896
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,980
You can try. 

897
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,450
I want you to cook dinner for me. 

898
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,600
You're always talking about food! 

899
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,530
I'm all stressed out, and you're complaining about food? 

900
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,530
Who cares what we eat? 

901
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,400
Why does it have to be cooked by me? 

902
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,610
I'm not saying that. 

903
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:31,720
At this rate, we won't be able to move out of here in 3 years. 

904
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:34,770
You're saying it'll be my fault? 

905
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,240
Let's try to save every penny. 

906
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,100
Buying ready made food doesn't seem much, 

907
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,200
but it's a waste of money.
We must save... 

908
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,250
Don't tell me to save money!
You make more! 

909
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,850
Why are you picking on me? 

910
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,250
I'm already frustrated as I am! 

911
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,780
Do you know how I feel? 

912
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:56,890
I'm stuck in this room all day long! 

913
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:59,570
Then go out and do something. 

914
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,760
You're stressed out because you stay here. 

915
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,380
I don't have any money to go out. 

916
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,640
I was in the Miss Korea pageant. 

917
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,260
How can I go out without money? 

918
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,530
It takes money to go anywhere. 

919
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:13,530
Why do you need money? 

920
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:18,750
You can go to the park,
get fresh air and think about what to do. 

921
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,520
What do you mean by that? 

922
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,900
Do you want me to get a job? 

923
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,370
I'm not saying that. 

924
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,990
Be honest with me. 

925
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,990
You would like me to make money, don't you? 

926
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:31,990
Just say you want me to go out and get a job! 

927
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:33,500
Fine! 

928
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,120
Why can't you go and get a job? 

929
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:39,510
I'd be grateful if you got a job! 

930
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:43,360
That's what you really want, huh? 

931
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,360
Now it's my turn to make money? 

932
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,170
You're not getting what I'm saying! 

933
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:52,090
A problem shared is a problem halved. 

934
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:57,610
If you are frugal with money,
you'd be helping me out. 

935
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,500
Do you want to live like this forever? 

936
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:05,220
How much longer will you leave the kids with your mom? 

937
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,220
Bring them right now. 

938
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,550
No. 

939
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:09,590
No? 

940
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,140
How can I bring them at a time like this? 

941
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,700
What do you mean by that? 

942
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,510
You can't raise your own children? 

943
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,050
We should raise your own children. 

944
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,620
How can I raise them here? 

945
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:21,260
There are roaches and mice! 

946
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,600
How long will you keep them there? 

947
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,960
I don't know!
I don't! 

948
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,780
I don't want to hear anything. 

949
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:30,650
Don't you miss the girls? 

950
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,220
I don't miss them. 

951
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:33,350
I'm sick of them. 

952
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,350
You're sick of them? 

953
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:38,840
You're sick of your own children? 

954
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,030
I'm serious.
Bring them tomorrow. 

955
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,430
No! I can't take care of them. 

956
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:52,960
It's hard enough for me to stay sane. 

957
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,910
What? 

958
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:58,210
I can't take care of them.
I don't want to! 

959
01:01:58,210 --> 01:01:59,860
I regret it! 

960
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,140
What did you say? 

961
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,430
I said I regret it! Why? 

962
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,000
Say that again. 

963
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,620
What did you say? 

964
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:16,980
I regret marrying you,
and I regret having the kids. Satisfied? 

965
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:23,950
Why did you slap me? Why? 

966
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:26,260
What did I do wrong? 

967
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:54,870
Subtitles by KBS World 

968
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,740
Do you still think of me first thing when you wake up? 

969
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:01,240
No, not really. 

970
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,620
What? Your wife got this job for you. 

971
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,610
You can't fire me! I quit! 

972
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:07,170
Did you? 

973
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:10,150
Did you feel happy when I was struggling? 

974
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:11,800
Get out! 

975
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,070
I don't want to see you! 

976
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:14,500
You're horrible! 

977
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,900
Where's Subak? 

978
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,590
I won't ever forgive her for this! 

979
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:19,470
You won't forgive her? 

980
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,100
How dare you say that? 

981
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:25,210
Why do we have to tip toe around Subak and be accommodating to her? 

982
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,450
Was Hobak adopted or something?
