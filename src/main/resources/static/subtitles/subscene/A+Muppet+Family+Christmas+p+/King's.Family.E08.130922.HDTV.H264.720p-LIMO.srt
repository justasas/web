00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,750
I'm the one who's frustrated. 

3
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,670
Why do you think I said I'm sick of them? 

4
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,350
What's wrong with everyone today? 

5
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,610
I'm miserable as it is, 

6
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,630
and even mom got angry and hit me. 

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,310
Because I have no money...
She's never done that. 

8
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,310
Hobak's moving into her new apartment, 

9
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:11,190
but I had to clean the dirty bathroom with my hands, 

10
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,650
the one everyone's using! 

11
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:21,650
A woman with foam around her mouth humiliated me in front of my friend, 

12
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,500
saying she was in the Miss Korea pageant too! 

13
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,230
I have a secret. 

14
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,550
What is it? 

15
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,840
When a woman says this, it's nothing. 

16
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,310
I'm serious. 

17
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,990
We 

18
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,470
are moving. 

19
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,370
- Really?
- Really? To where? 

20
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,800
An apartment. 

21
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,670
Yay! This is nuts! 

22
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,620
Heo Bangtong! 

23
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,240
I won't, I won't. I won't copy dad! 

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,310
Is it big? Will I get my own room? 

25
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,910
What does it look like? 

26
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,080
Should we go and look? 

27
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,870
It's on the 5th floor. 

28
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,140
One, two, three, four, five. 

29
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,840
It's the fifth one with the lights on. 

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,660
Whoa. 

31
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,090
Let's go in, mom. 

32
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,640
We can't. Someone's still living there right now. 

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,600
The owner said that when you move in there, 

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,090
you'll become really smart. 

35
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,540
Really?
What does my room look like? 

36
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,880
What about mine? Mine? 

37
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,760
It looks like this. 

38
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,200
The apartment looks like this. 

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,150
This is the living room, the master bedroom, 

40
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,330
and this is Sintong's room. 

41
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,420
What about mine? 

42
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,990
Bangtong, your room is here. 

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,320
And there are two bathrooms. 

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,700
One in the master bedroom, one here. 

45
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,550
Yay! Yay! 

46
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,080
So Sintong and I have our own bathrooms? 

47
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,470
Stupid. Mom and Dad need one, too. 

48
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,580
Mom, a bed. All my friends have beds. 

49
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,420
Of course I'll buy you one! 

50
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,530
How about a desk? 

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,920
A desk? Should I buy you one? 

52
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,260
Please, please! 

53
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,750
I think I can study hard if I have one. 

54
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,790
The bad ones always blame their tools. 

55
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,760
Fine. I'll buy you a desk, too. 

56
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,380
Yay! Yes! 

57
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,900
- Shh!
- Shh! 

58
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,300
Be quiet.
People are sleeping. 

59
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,270
Mom, I feel like I'm on the clouds. 

60
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,710
I'm going to tell my friends. 

61
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,130
Can I bring my friends home? 

62
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,580
Of course. 

63
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,600
They can come. 

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,920
Bring the one who called you a beggar. 

65
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,470
I'll teach him a lesson. 

66
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,140
You're the best. 

67
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,890
Huh? 

68
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,900
Mom, are you crying? 

69
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,870
Let her be.
Mom sometimes cries. 

70
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,430
Oh... 

71
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,650
Gwangbak! Gwangbak! 

72
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,920
What is it?
I just fell asleep. 

73
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,070
Old man's orders. 

74
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,820
While I'm away,
exercise with your sister. 

75
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,000
I pass. 

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,410
Hah! 

77
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,860
Get up! 

78
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,280
Where are you going?
It's Sunday. 

79
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,860
I'm going to workout. 

80
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,230
Father, come with me. 

81
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,910
The mineral spring near here is really nice. 

82
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,580
Why are you going there? 

83
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,880
You can go to the gym. 

84
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,490
This kid I know wants to meet there. 

85
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,570
Come with me, father. 

86
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,610
No thanks. 

87
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,410
I heard lots of hot women go there. 

88
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,540
You go ahead.
Let me take a shower. 

89
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,260
You'll take a shower afterwards. Just come. 

90
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,640
I'm a gentleman. 

91
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,390
I should wash my face and brush my teeth. 

92
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,500
Hurry up, then.
I'll go first. 

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,200
Okay. 

94
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,740
Come on! 

95
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,170
I'm sleepy.
I'm really sleepy. 

96
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,660
You're too much... 

97
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,550
Can you do that in a pretty way? 

98
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,690
You'll never get married like that! 

99
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,370
What's this? Huh? 

100
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,010
What? What? What's wrong with this? 

101
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,970
You're so ugly. 

102
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,290
I said to do it pretty! 

103
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,260
What if someone sees you? 

104
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
Why are you making such a fuss? 

105
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,670
Who cares if anyone sees me? 

106
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,210
I'll exercise anyway I want. 

107
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,850
Who exercises in a pretty way? 

108
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,830
Look? It can't get any prettier than this. 

109
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,040
Don't do stuff like that. 

110
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,030
This is great for circulation. Stupid. 

111
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,430
Good morning. 

112
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,550
Sangnam! 

113
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,640
Good morning. 

114
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,050
It's not a good morning. 

115
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,380
You're an early bird.
You exercise? 

116
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,360
You're dead. 

117
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,000
Gwangbak! 

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,190
You should exercise. 

119
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,590
I'm done. 

120
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,760
She doesn't do that every day. 

121
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,490
Does your sister like baseball? 

122
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,840
Daebak, I can't believe... 

123
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:50,900
Huh? 

124
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,530
- What's this?
- I'm sorry. 

125
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,390
Hey! Hey! 

126
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,560
Me? 

127
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,840
- Don't you know me?
- Excuse me? 

128
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,380
How rude! 

129
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,800
You should say hello to the elderly! 

130
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,230
Uh, hello. 

131
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,720
What are you doing? Huh? 

132
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,580
I didn't see you. I'm sorry. 

133
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,190
Whatever! When are you going to pay me? 

134
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,530
Pay you for what? 

135
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,530
What do you mean? 

136
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,930
Pay me for the extra medical bill! 

137
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,590
What are you doing? Seriously! 

138
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,940
I don't know where or how you got treated, 

139
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,420
but how is that my responsibility? 

140
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,430
This is too early in the morning for this! 

141
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,370
Next time, I'm calling the police! 

142
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,140
Wait a minute. 

143
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,860
You don't brush your teeth? 

144
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,860
Excuse me? 

145
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,960
You should brush your teeth. 

146
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,350
Ugh, you smell rotten. 

147
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,200
Ugh... 

148
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,300
Ugh... 

149
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,350
Wow, the food tastes so good. 

150
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,910
I should go there every day. 

151
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,900
It's so much better than the gym. 

152
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,190
Right? 

153
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,080
You should exercise, too. 

154
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,690
I should. I'm getting a gut. 

155
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,830
For men, you're finished if you get a gut. 

156
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,050
This? This? 

157
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,930
Miho, would you like to join us? 

158
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,630
I prefer reading books. 

159
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,340
Mom, I'm done. 

160
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,220
Tell me about last night's drama. 

161
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,390
I missed it yesterday. 

162
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,550
Okay. 

163
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,540
She's reading all your books.
Is that okay? 

164
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,270
She's into dating books. 

165
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,960
It's good to read many books. 

166
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,440
But they're all about dating. 

167
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,630
Oh, who cares if they are? 

168
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,260
As long as they're not rated R. 

169
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,160
I learned Korean with comic books, aunt. 

170
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,310
There's nothing she shouldn't read. 

171
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,400
I'm sure there is! 

172
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,590
I read them all before I was 19 years old. 

173
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,980
Once she really discovers the joys of reading, 

174
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,060
we can steer her into another direction. 

175
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,550
That'd be nice. 

176
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,780
She's a regular dating expert. 

177
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,760
I wonder what she's going to become. 

178
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,630
She'll become successful, I'm sure. 

179
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,390
Let's go look at a bulldozer after coffee. 

180
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,080
It's used, but it's in good condition. 

181
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,960
Okay. 

182
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,040
Oh, why don't you come, too? 

183
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,370
Oh, right.
I saw that rude girl. 

184
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,010
Where? 

185
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,590
On the way to the mineral spring. 

186
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,700
She must be collecting trash. 

187
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,170
She was walking around in sweatpants.  

188
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,580
Why does she do that? 

189
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,980
How should I know? 

190
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,840
Go to that cafe when you have time. 

191
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,300
She didn't even brush her teeth! 

192
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,960
I told her to pay up but she said she'll call the police. 

193
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,900
Father, I think you should stop. 

194
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,520
I'm not serious about the money. 

195
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,760
I just want to teach her some manners. 

196
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,870
I have a feeling she's going to get you. 

197
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,500
No way! I'm getting that money! 

198
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,620
Just watch me. 

199
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,970
Daebak! 

200
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,970
I made them run into each other,
and she got mad at me. 

201
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,970
Where did you meet? 

202
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,680
At the mineral spring. 

203
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,080
Wearing dirty sweatpants? 

204
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
Yes. 

205
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,070
- She didn't wash her face?
- No. 

206
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,130
- She didn't brush her teeth?
- No. 

207
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,320
If I were you, I'd go mad. 

208
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,160
Why? You said it's nice to run into each other. 

209
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,100
A dog would understand me better than you. 

210
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,600
When will you ever grow up? 

211
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,650
Hello?
Is this the parcel service office? 

212
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,330
I have a question. 

213
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,220
This is Sangdo-dong, 

214
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,560
and who's in charge of this area? 

215
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,460
Sangdo-dong?
It's Mr. Ko Minjung. 

216
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,870
Mr. Ko Minjung? 

217
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,610
May I ask you why you're asking? 

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,480
Oh, he's here.
Should I put him on? 

219
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,050
Hello? 

220
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,250
How strange. 

221
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,740
What is it? 

222
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,270
Some woman asked for the man in charge of Sangdo-dong  

223
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,860
and hung up when I offered to put you on the phone. 

224
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,600
Was there a delivery accident? 

225
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,770
No. 

226
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,050
Welcome. 

227
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,130
To my room. 

228
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,610
Did you see? 

229
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,950
Only a little. 

230
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,400
Enjoy your stay. 

231
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,950
The black shopping bag.
That's yours. 

232
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,440
Excuse me? 

233
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,010
I'm sorry about what happened before. 

234
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,060
You look to be in good shape. 

235
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,440
Do you work out?
What do you do? 

236
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:12,140
I don't like to limit myself,
so I do a little bit of everything. 

237
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,310
That costs no money. 

238
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,110
You're pretty funny. 

239
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,540
I hear that often. 

240
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,610
They say I'm addictive. 

241
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,760
You don't seem very old,
so why are you so casual with me? 

242
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,690
Are you annoyed? 

243
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,660
If you are, be casual with me. 

244
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,490
Although I doubt you have the guts. 

245
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,110
Ugh! 

246
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,660
It's me.
What are you up to today? 

247
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,550
I have plans. 

248
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,380
Next week? 

249
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,340
I don't even know what'll happen tomorrow, 
so how can I know about next week? 

250
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,200
Can I make a reservation, then? 

251
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,970
You're full of confidence, aren't you? 

252
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,150
Do you like movies? 

253
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,440
I don't like the theaters. 

254
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,890
That's great. 

255
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,980
You will like it if you go with me. 

256
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,280
I'll buy the tickets. 

257
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,150
Don't make any plans that day. 

258
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,680
I'll see you then. 

259
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,430
Sangnam! 

260
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,110
Can you take this to your sister right now? 

261
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,810
What is it? 

262
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,040
You'll find out. 

263
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,900
- Gwangbak.
- Yes? 

264
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,560
Can you mend my sock? 

265
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,930
You do it. 

266
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,900
Don't you feel sorry for your uncle? 

267
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,910
Man! 

268
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,090
Explain in English under 3 minutes  

269
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,510
how feeling sorry for you and having a hole in 

270
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,230
your sock are related within the metaphysical and behavioral psychological scope. 

271
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,620
Incredible. 

272
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,220
I'll mend it. 

273
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,360
Why are you home so late? 

274
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,780
Didn't I tell you to come straight home? 

275
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,310
If you do badly at school,
I get yelled at. 

276
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,410
Uncle, don't you have any friends? 

277
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,050
Set her up with someone.
She's always after me! 

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,430
How dare you! 

279
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:49,640
I could get men line up at the front door if I wanted to meet one. 

280
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,040
Who do you think I am? 

281
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,320
You think I'm this way because I'm lonely? 

282
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,110
No respect at all! 

283
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,610
You get back down here! 

284
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,610
He wouldn't. 

285
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,480
You deserved that. 

286
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,870
Uncle! 

287
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,970
What are you doing? 

288
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,570
Can't you tell? I'm packing. 

289
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,700
Let's call the movers.
This is too much. 

290
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
You know how expensive they are? 

291
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,650
We don't have much stuff anyway. 

292
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,060
I'll pack a little every day. 

293
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,760
What's that? 

294
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,850
A present. 

295
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,140
Are you crazy?
How much was it? 

296
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,000
It's not for you.
It's for me. 

297
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,470
Who gave you that? 

298
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,790
A guest. 

299
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,890
Because I'm funny. 

300
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,120
Where are the boys? 

301
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,000
Asleep. 

302
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,740
They passed out after playing soccer. 

303
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,330
These are all junk! 

304
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,620
Why don't you throw this away? 

305
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,170
Man! Don't! 

306
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,540
Throw that out. 

307
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,780
That's just a pot.
Just dump it. 

308
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,380
We're making money to spend it. 

309
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,650
We don't have money to spend. 

310
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,360
We must be frugal to pay back the loan. 

311
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,830
We're being frugal to death. 

312
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,020
I can't throw this one away. 

313
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,560
This pot was my first love. 

314
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,840
You said I was your first love. 

315
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,100
Women always say "This is my first time." 

316
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,070
They are all liars. 

317
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,880
When we just got married,
we cooked instant noodles in this, 

318
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
made soybean paste stew in this, 

319
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,080
and made kimchi stew in this. 

320
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,390
We started out with two spoons and this pot. 

321
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,390
This is that pot? 

322
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,070
Hey, pot! Long time no see. 

323
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,510
Was it you who game me that big bump here? 

324
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:51,240
You're all dented because of crashing into me. 

325
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,510
You're happy to see me, too, aren't you? 

326
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,510
He says yes. 

327
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,880
It's been with us since the beginning,
so let's make this a family treasure. 

328
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,410
That's a bit too much... 

329
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,460
Knock! 

330
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,230
Why? 

331
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,100
What is it? 

332
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,690
Let's go to the baseball game tonight with the matchmaker. 

333
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,160
How can you give this to me now? 

334
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,240
What time is it? 

335
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,320
Hurry, hurry! 

336
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,430
Let's root for our respective teams and meet back up later right here. 

337
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,980
Who is it? 

338
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,110
It's me. 

339
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,940
Father. 

340
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,940
I dropped by on the way home. 

341
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,180
I bought you some meat and fruit. 

342
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,600
Come in. 

343
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,600
No, I should go home. 

344
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,060
Where is Minjung? 

345
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,060
He hasn't come home yet. 

346
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,430
Not yet? 

347
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,980
Minjung, are you in here? 

348
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,270
Father, what brings you by? 

349
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,400
Please have a seat. 

350
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,710
You're staying here? 

351
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,830
I heard you had a fight. 

352
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,640
I'm sorry. 

353
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,370
It was so much fun. 

354
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,820
When my team hit a home run at the end... 

355
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,610
The ball flew over Gwangbak's head, wow. 

356
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,620
Did you see that? 

357
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,000
That was amazing. 

358
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,260
What were you doing? 

359
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,210
Why didn't you jump and catch the ball? 

360
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,150
How could I jump that high? 

361
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,200
You can jump high enough when you're trying to beat me with your baseball bat. 

362
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,600
Really? 

363
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,860
Don't even get me started. 

364
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,800
Once she goes crazy,
she goes all the way. 

365
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,200
That's not true! 

366
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,600
Especially when she got dumped. 

367
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,050
I don't get dumped.
I dump. 

368
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,940
Getting dumped is actually better. 

369
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,620
The dumped can sleep fine at night,
but the one who does the dumping can't. 

370
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,460
I don't know because that never happened to me. 

371
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,790
Nobody here believes you. 

372
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,200
I'll send you the pictures you took with those women. 

373
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,490
Okay. 

374
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,000
You look nice with beautiful women. 

375
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,730
Hurry up and eat.
Don't you have homework? 

376
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,480
Sangnam, how did your blind date go? 

377
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,280
It's still going on. 

378
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,480
Is she pretty? 

379
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,480
I guess she is. 

380
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,860
You don't like ugly women, right? 

381
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,040
Right. 

382
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,340
Me neither. 

383
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,150
It's late.
Mom and dad must be waiting. 

384
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,300
Let me go to the bathroom. 

385
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,740
Do you still think of me first thing when you wake up? 

386
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,640
Excuse me? 

387
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,040
You said you think of me first. 

388
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,780
You think of someone when you wake up. 

389
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,640
That's a serious problem. 

390
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,490
No, it's not like that. 

391
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,500
It's not? 

392
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,280
I was really upset at the time, so that's why. 

393
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,830
Only because of that? 

394
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,180
Oh, I see. 

395
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,500
I thought you were being real. 

396
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,640
Let's forget it, then. 

397
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,700
What's wrong with you? 

398
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,010
What? 

399
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,630
I want to help, but you won't let me. 

400
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,090
What do you mean? 

401
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,410
Haven't you learned anything from other women? 

402
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,310
What are you wearing? 

403
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,330
Wear and mini skirt and show some cleavage. 

404
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,790
What? 

405
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,550
Men actually like stuff like that. 

406
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,650
Nothing stands out about you! 

407
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,880
You're all bland.
Who'd like that? 

408
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,410
I wouldn't! 

409
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,700
Mother. 

410
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,450
- Have a seat.
- There's no need. 

411
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,210
Are you happy staying here all alone? 

412
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,710
Why do we have to suffer because of you? 

413
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,620
I'm sorry. 

414
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,870
You're always apologizing. 

415
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,450
Why have you changed so much? 

416
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,660
I heard my husband dropped by. 

417
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,730
So why didn't you go home? 

418
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,350
I can't believe how stubborn you are. 

419
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,300
You're not worried about Subak at all? 

420
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,660
She's very frustrated. 

421
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,710
And how could you slap her? 

422
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,990
It's not like you did anything to help her. 

423
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,370
Go home and beg for forgiveness. 

424
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,950
I wouldn't have taken this if things were different. 

425
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,790
I'd tell her to get a divorce. 

426
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,090
My husband yelled at Subak. 

427
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,590
Go home tonight if you're really sorry. 

428
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,040
Understand? 

429
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,740
I'm so upset. 

430
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,200
How dare you do this after losing all your money? 

431
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,450
[Acacia Room Salon
1. Age: 20 to 25 (Female)
2. Inexperienced are welcomed] 

432
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,740
Hello? 

433
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,180
I'm Don. 

434
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,300
- What are you looking at?
- Oh, mom. 

435
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,770
Are you crazy? 

436
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
Is this what you were looking at when you go out? 

437
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,760
No, I don't. 

438
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,060
Mom, give me ten dollars. 

439
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,860
Ten dollars my butt. 

440
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,460
Pants, pants... Pounding pants... 

441
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,730
- What is it?
- Loser, 

442
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,730
would you like to make ten dollars? 

443
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,790
Ten dollars? 

444
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,230
Who is it? 

445
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,690
It's the new owner of this apartment. 

446
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,300
Oh, okay. 

447
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,390
Hello. 

448
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,840
- Hello.
- Yes. 

449
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,690
Here comes the C.E.O. 

450
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,020
Don't you have slippers? 

451
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,020
We don't. 

452
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,220
The C.E.O. wanted to take a look around. 

453
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,140
- Okay.
- Go ahead. 

454
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,390
Congratulations on moving in. 

455
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,410
He doesn't shake hands with just anyone. 

456
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,470
Oh, okay. 

457
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,830
We're packing, so it's messy here. 

458
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:21,480
The woman, I mean, your wife came alone and checked everything the last time. 

459
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,800
My wife? 

460
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,020
She's supposed to be in France, 
so when did she come here? 

461
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,550
- Don.
- Yes, sir. 

462
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,890
Don't let the help run wild. 

463
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,260
My deepest apologies. 

464
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,720
I think the housekeeper was here. 

465
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,760
Did she say she was my wife? 

466
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,270
She checked everything here after signing the contract, so I assumed... 

467
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,270
Hobak is meticulous... 

468
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,710
I'll talk to her. 

469
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,850
She sometimes does pretend to be your wife. 

470
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,100
Fire her tomorrow. 

471
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,450
May I? 

472
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,550
I'd love to, but I'll let that pass. 

473
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,430
Excuse me, but which company do you... 

474
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,650
This guy is... 

475
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,520
I mean, he is the C.E.O. of a big company. 

476
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,060
That's all you need to know. 

477
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,660
Or else I'll have to kill you. 

478
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,940
It's too small.
I'd feel claustrophobic. 

479
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,140
He rides a motorcycle inside his current home. 

480
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,510
Excuse me, but if you want to see better, 

481
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,490
you should take those sunglasses off. 

482
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,750
Don. 

483
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,750
He doesn't like to be talked to that way. 

484
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,250
This, this, this. 

485
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,610
Take all of these out. 

486
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:48,170
She said she's going to use them. 

487
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,770
That housekeeper woman. 

488
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,430
Don. 

489
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,300
Stop interfering while he's talking. 

490
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,790
This, this and this, take them out. 

491
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:03,220
And call Italy and get custom furniture. 

492
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,910
And the ceiling. 

493
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,360
Cry... The... Chan, chan... Hurry! 

494
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,650
Crystal chandelier. 

495
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,090
So you did major in English. 

496
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,760
Import that. 

497
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,290
And redo the floor with marble. 

498
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,020
Get a new toilet and bathroom sink. 

499
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,610
I'm sorry for interfering, 

500
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,440
but that'll cost 10 times more than the apartment. 

501
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,140
Maybe you should pick another apartment. 

502
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,900
Don. 

503
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,200
We won't interfere.
We won't. 

504
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,500
Especially the bathtub.
Make one with gold. 

505
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,960
And put diamonds all around the edge, okay? 

506
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,850
Okay. 

507
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,880
Did you see that? 

508
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,880
This is the power of money. 

509
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,660
You're totally nuts. 

510
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,140
Did you see how they were looking at you? 

511
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,780
They were looking at you like you're nuts. 

512
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,510
Who cares? 

513
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:15,670
Wow, I can feel how beautiful this world is deep down to my bones. 

514
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,100
I'm going nuts! 

515
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:25,760
If you had two apartments,
your bones would be burning up. 

516
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,420
You think I'm a joke? 

517
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,860
You're not a joke. 

518
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,680
Where are you coming from? 

519
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,840
Lunch... 

520
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,620
Just how many hours do you need for lunch? 

521
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,090
You think this is your playground? 

522
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,010
Just what are you doing here? 

523
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,310
I know, but... 

524
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,890
You do? 

525
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,620
I do, but you're too much. 

526
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,800
You're younger, but you don't respect me. 

527
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,630
It's not like I have to work here. 

528
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,680
I don't believe this. 

529
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,030
You still don't get it, do you? 

530
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,040
Stop being so rude. 

531
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,960
If you don't want to hear this, work hard! 

532
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,850
Listen carefully. 

533
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,530
If this happens again,
I'm going to fire you. 

534
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,120
Go! 

535
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,380
You only got this job because of your wife. 

536
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,780
You should be embarrassed. 

537
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,240
What are you looking at? 

538
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,440
What? Your wife got this job for you. 

539
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,870
You can't fire me!
I quit! 

540
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,230
Oh, man! 

541
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,020
I'm going nuts. 

542
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,530
Oh, I should just die.
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo. 

543
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,200
I heard you went to a wedding. 

544
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,580
You didn't bring any rice cakes? 

545
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,770
Rice cake my butt! 

546
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,040
What are you doing? 

547
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,490
I'm mending my sock. 

548
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,870
You look miserable. 

549
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,160
Don't look at me like that. 

550
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,050
I'm going to start working tomorrow. 

551
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,100
I can't believe you. 

552
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,950
Hey! 

553
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,080
Why didn't you mend your brother in law's sock? 

554
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,740
Why can't you introduce him to a woman? 

555
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,700
I want to, but I can't sell him. 

556
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,700
What? 

557
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,310
How can she say that? 

558
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,540
Stop. 

559
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,230
You never win. 

560
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,780
- How dare you!
- Oh, the needle. 

561
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,310
What are you doing?
Huh? 

562
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,730
You should've checked the inventory and made sure the stores are well stocked! 

563
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,600
You're all awful! 

564
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,910
Sis! 

565
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,660
Don't call me sis. 

566
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,530
When did you get here? 

567
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,800
Just now. I didn't come earlier. No way. 

568
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,840
What is it? 

569
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,320
I wanted to go home with you. 

570
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,510
I'm meeting Minjung, so join us. 

571
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,960
Let's have dinner. 

572
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,560
I heard about your apartment. 

573
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
Congratulations, Hobak. 

574
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,910
Thanks. 

575
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,530
I have to pay back the loan to actually own it, but I'm happy. 

576
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,120
Happy?
You're busy checking on others. 

577
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,780
What do you mean by that? 

578
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,210
She feels bad about Subak and you. 

579
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,020
It's like buying an apartment is a crime. 

580
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,470
It's not like she stole the money,
but she doesn't know what to do. 

581
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,830
You don't have to be. 

582
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,410
I know. 

583
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,040
Stop it. 

584
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,130
Minjung, enjoy. 

585
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,460
I'm buying to celebrate. 

586
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,470
I'll buy, to congratulate you. 

587
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,340
No, I'm buying. 

588
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,210
Whoever's buying, let's enjoy it. 

589
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,500
You too, Sedal. 

590
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,580
I will, of course. 

591
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,580
I'm not going to worry about others. 

592
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,630
Owning my own home feels great. 

593
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,820
You don't know, do you? 

594
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,270
Why wouldn't he know? 

595
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,150
He owned a really big one before. 

596
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,370
I had forgotten.
That was a long time ago. 

597
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:06,040
As for me, it feels really vivid. Vivid. 

598
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,170
Can I order one more portion of pork belly? 

599
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,870
What are you talking about? 

600
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,870
Don't make Hobak uncomfortable. 

601
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,600
We're us and they are them. 

602
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,890
She worked to get that place, 

603
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,390
so congratulate her from your heart. 

604
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,920
Did Hobak say I'm making her uncomfortable? 

605
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,360
She didn't say that. 

606
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,090
Whose side are you on? 

607
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,490
What do you mean by that?
I was just... 

608
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:38,840
You haven't been home for several days,
and all you can talk about is Hobak? 

609
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,110
Hobak's more important to you than me, huh? 

610
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,730
You've always been like this. 

611
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,260
You always took Hobak's side. 

612
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,140
You never paid attention to what I said. 

613
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,340
When were you ever on my side? 

614
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,920
Why don't you just go live with Hobak? 

615
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,610
Watch what you say. 

616
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,350
These are things you should never say. 

617
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,680
But I'm right! 

618
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,550
She knows better about what you like and don't like. 

619
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,100
That's because she worked at our house. 

620
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,480
That too. 

621
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,170
When she worked at our house,
you got upset about making her work. 

622
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,560
You told me to pay her more. 

623
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,800
And now you want me to suck up to her? 

624
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,840
She bought an apartment just to get on my nerves,
and now you're yelling at me? 

625
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,500
You don't care about my feelings, do you? 

626
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,850
Let's not do this. 

627
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,870
Not do what? 

628
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,890
I'm going crazy as I am,
so why are you so mean to me? 

629
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,050
What's all the noise? 

630
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,590
Please keep it down. 

631
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,330
You always fight and cry. 

632
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,690
I can't take this anymore. 

633
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,730
I'm sorry. 

634
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,120
You should be more considerate. 

635
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,710
If you keep this up,
I'm kicking you out! 

636
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,480
Ouch! Ouch, ouch... 

637
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,580
Ouch... I have to pack. 

638
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,710
I'll do it. 

639
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,710
I told you we should've hired movers. 

640
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,600
Did you do something wrong? 

641
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,910
Not at all. 

642
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,810
I just feel you've been working too hard. 

643
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,100
Are you on drugs? 

644
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,850
I can't afford any drugs. 

645
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,530
They say you change when you're about to die. 

646
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,300
You have me and the boys, so don't change. 

647
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,190
I won't. 

648
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:39,770
Honey, let's make a baby tonight. 

649
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,350
I said my back hurts. 

650
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,980
There, there! Right there. 

651
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,830
Here? Here? 

652
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,650
Oh, oh, that feels good. 

653
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,020
You didn't quit your job, did you? 

654
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,720
No way. 

655
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,260
Go ahead and try it. 

656
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,100
I'll kill you and kill myself. 

657
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,970
We have to save every penny we can to pay back the loan. 

658
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,470
I've been saving! 

659
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,660
Every penny. 

660
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:38,700
Wedding anniversary.
Black bean noodles. 

661
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,260
Thank you. 

662
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,820
Black bean noodles on our anniversary? 

663
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,760
If you don't want this, don't eat it. 

664
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,810
Oh, you're so stingy. 

665
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,010
Let's see how well you do, making your husband starve. 

666
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,310
I'm saving every penny until we buy a house. 

667
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,690
This is the last time we're eating out. 

668
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,350
Oh, it's delicious. 

669
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,880
I'm going nuts. 

670
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,000
Oh, man... 

671
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,420
I'm going nuts. 

672
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:40,950
Mom. 

673
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,300
What are you doing here? 

674
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,680
I came during my lunch break to see you. 

675
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,380
- I'll do it.
- Leave it. 

676
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,560
Mom, I'm sorry. 

677
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:01,290
Put yourself in other's shoes, as our family motto says. 

678
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,250
I asked because you had the money. 

679
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,250
You said no, though. 

680
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:12,390
And you go and buy yourself an apartment? 

681
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,030
How could you do it at a time like this? 

682
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,970
I know. 

683
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,650
I know the timing was really bad. 

684
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,420
But it just worked out that way. 

685
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,000
I didn't plan on it. 

686
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,150
You shouldn't have acted like that. 

687
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,150
She's suffering from depression. 

688
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,240
Go see Subak. 

689
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,960
I'm going to. 

690
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,760
Subak, you're home, aren't you? 

691
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,760
I'll drop by. 

692
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,090
Hello? 

693
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,030
Okay. I'll be right over. 

694
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,730
I can't get it? 

695
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,020
No. 

696
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,660
We can't loan you the amount you requested, 

697
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,660
but we can loan you half. 

698
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,230
That won't do. 

699
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,640
I must pay the balance on the apartment. 

700
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:14,070
You have good credit, so I tried. I'm sorry. 

701
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,130
Oh, how scary! 

702
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,150
Are you okay?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 

703
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,430
Hello. 

704
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,900
And you are? 

705
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,900
I've met you once before. 

706
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,310
I'm Heo Sedal's wife. Sedal is... 

707
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,810
I know why you're here, 

708
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,920
but this won't work... Oh! 

709
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,630
Oh... 

710
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,040
What's going on? 

711
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,080
Where are you? 

712
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,080
I'm at the hotel, of course. 

713
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,120
Where in the hotel? 

714
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,270
At the lobby. 

715
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,440
I'm at the lobby. 

716
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,410
Why? Why are you there? 

717
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,290
I came to see you but you're not here. 

718
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:36,520
I'm up at the office right now. 

719
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,930
I'm too busy to come down, so cut to the chase. 

720
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,790
The bank won't loan me the money. 

721
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,280
They won't? 

722
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,370
How can they reject us after all this time? 

723
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,660
How much are you short? 

724
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,010
$20,000. 

725
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,520
$20,000? 

726
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,740
You bought an apartment when you don't have the money? 

727
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,820
You sure are gutsy. 

728
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,990
No one buys a home with their own money. 

729
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,390
They all get loans. 

730
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,790
Are you eating something? 

731
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,330
I'm eating a bun. 

732
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,340
How can you eat during working hours? 

733
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,810
It's my break. 

734
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:18,340
They gave me some snacks. 

735
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,240
Don't take everything people give you. 

736
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,980
Wait, the manager said something weird. 

737
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,420
Something weird? 

738
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,650
You met the manager?
What did he say? 

739
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,850
Something like, "This won't work." 

740
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,650
Don't listen to him.
He's a bastard. 

741
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,340
You should go.
Don't hang around there. 

742
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:44,390
Don't do anything stupid and keep this job. 

743
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,010
Don't worry. Go! 

744
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,450
People will talk if they see you. 

745
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,390
It's all my fault. 

746
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,630
I'll do my best. 

747
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,530
I'll give you the respect you deserve. 

748
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,900
So please, please give me a chance. 

749
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,150
You'd be saving my life if you do. 

750
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,450
Subak. 

751
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,480
Are you sleeping? 

752
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,660
What is it? 

753
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,360
I got you some mangoes, your favorite. 

754
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,350
The first time I'd ever tried it was at your house. 
They were so good. 

755
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:10,880
You like mangoes. 

756
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,960
You're pretty funny. 

757
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:19,050
I'm sorry. 

758
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:23,360
I should've told you first,
but I couldn't because I felt so bad. 

759
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,360
Please understand. 

760
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,850
Do you cook? 

761
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:31,230
Oh, why don't you cook? 

762
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:33,800
There's nothing in the fridge. 

763
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,530
These instant foods are expensive and bad for you, too. 

764
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,530
These are for when you go camping. 

765
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:41,670
Stop. 

766
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:46,260
You just repeated what my husband said. 

767
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,310
Did you two have a secret meeting? 

768
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:50,170
What do you mean? 

769
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,170
What did you say to Minjung? 

770
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,170
I didn't say much. 

771
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:56,090
I just said I feel bad. 

772
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:58,090
You're funny. 

773
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:01,000
How can you meet him behind my back? 

774
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,200
I didn't want to say this, but you must be heartbroken 

775
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,500
because the man you love is in trouble. 

776
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,760
How could you say that? 

777
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,580
There are things you should never say. 

778
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,970
Shut up! How dare you talk to me that way? 

779
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,160
Are you mocking me? 

780
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,760
You're happy that I ended up here? 

781
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,080
Why did you come? 

782
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,610
To check to see if I'm dead? 

783
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:22,610
To brag about your new place? 

784
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,110
Fine! I am happy. 

785
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,290
I bought an apartment to make you mad. 

786
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,250
Are you satisfied? 

787
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,190
What? 

788
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,110
You're horrible! 

789
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:36,180
You think you can say anything? 

790
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,320
How can you just blurt things out? 

791
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,720
Did you? 

792
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,860
Did you feel happy when I was struggling? 

793
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,140
You think I'm like you? 

794
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,300
What? What did you say? 

795
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,810
How dare you! 

796
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,790
Why not? 

797
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,970
You say whatever's on your mind! Why can't I? 

798
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,970
You're the older sister.
So act like it! 

799
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,270
You! 

800
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,250
Take these back. 

801
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,160
What do you think you're doing? 

802
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,130
I won't eat what you buy.
They're disgusting. 

803
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,450
Disgusting? 

804
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:19,490
Yes! 

805
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,780
Get out! 

806
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,450
I don't want to see you! 

807
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:27,920
Fine. 

808
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,380
I'll give them to my boys. 

809
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,170
You might think these are nothing, 

810
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:42,080
but my boys have never even tried these. 

811
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,390
Did you know that? 

812
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,060
You're horrible! 

813
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:48,250
Horrible? 

814
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,370
How dare you! 

815
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:52,610
You! Horrible? 

816
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,430
Horrible! 

817
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:58,240
That's right! I'm horrible! 

818
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,380
Wait a minute. 

819
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,550
- Oh, no.
- Excuse me! 

820
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,650
What are you doing? 

821
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:18,950
I'm sorry. 

822
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,280
Mom. 

823
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,590
How dare you!
How could you! 

824
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,840
You grabbed Subak's hair? 

825
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,240
And you called her names? 

826
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:02,900
I didn't. She grabbed my hair. 

827
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,180
If your father finds out, he'll be furious. 

828
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,180
How could you grab your older sister's hair? 

829
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,320
How could you do that? 

830
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:15,150
How dare you treat Subak like that? 

831
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:18,310
You said you bought the place to rub it in her face? 

832
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:20,890
You said you were happy she's bankrupt? 

833
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:27,060
It's like you're having a barbecue while the next door people are starving to death. 

834
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,910
Are you trying to drive her mad? 

835
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,490
Mom. 

836
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:36,160
She's suffering from depression already! 

837
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,160
When I got the call,
I was so furious, so I came to see you. 

838
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,440
Let's go. 

839
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,620
Go and beg Subak to forgive you. 

840
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,550
No. 

841
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:49,630
What? 

842
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,420
I said no. 

843
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,090
I won't apologize. 

844
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:56,090
I didn't do anything wrong. 

845
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,290
Hey! 

846
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:03,390
You're not going to see Subak again? Huh? 

847
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:29,620
Hobak, mom wants you. 

848
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,120
What's that? 

849
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,620
It's for you. 

850
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,620
It's so pretty. 

851
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:44,970
I wanted it but she's giving it to you. 

852
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:47,450
Why are you... 

853
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,640
But you bought it for yourself. 

854
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:54,880
I bought it because it's so pretty,
but I think it'll look better on you. 

855
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,550
I have nowhere to wear this to. 

856
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,920
You wear it.
Or give it to Yeongdal. 

857
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,100
Oh, why would I give it to her? 

858
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,940
It's for my daughter in law. 

859
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:09,250
Wear pretty clothes and meet your friends. 

860
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,940
You're a homeowner now! 

861
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,760
I want you to do your hair, but you won't come. 

862
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,030
Say what you want to say. 

863
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:20,920
You're very sharp. 

864
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,840
I heard you were a good student. 

865
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,080
Please take me with you. 

866
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,180
I would be very useful. 

867
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,880
I'll take care of the boys,
and you can go meet your friends. 

868
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,080
Right. 

869
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,460
Mother. 

870
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,380
I'm not going to change my mind. 

871
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,460
I bought the apartment so the boys could have their own rooms, 

872
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:46,630
so I won't be able to take you until I move to a bigger place. 

873
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,550
You're heartless. 

874
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,020
Ask anyone. 

875
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,800
You're the worst daughter in law ever. 

876
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,820
Yes, I am bad. 

877
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,610
I'm already having a very hard time! 

878
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,900
Oh, I can't believe you said that. 

879
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,530
This is why your mother mistreats you. 

880
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,300
Now I understand. 

881
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,310
Your mom has a good reason to hate you! 

882
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:10,810
She hates you because you're mean! 

883
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,690
Please stop! 

884
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,200
Oh, my... 

885
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,950
Why are you yelling at my mom? 

886
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:18,010
Why are you doing this to me? 

887
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:20,010
You stay out of this! 

888
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,940
Just leave me alone, please! 

889
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,810
What's wrong with you? 

890
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:30,070
Please might think I hit you or something. 

891
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,200
I know. 

892
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,930
Sintong! Bangtong! 

893
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:18,160
Hobak! 

894
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,700
Come out! 

895
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,280
Where are you? 

896
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,430
Hobak! 

897
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,030
What are you doing? 

898
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,110
Come out. 

899
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,020
Come out. I have something to show you. 

900
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,610
I shouldn't have bought that apartment. 

901
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:51,500
Why? 

902
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,810
Did something happen? 

903
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,690
Is it because of the money? 

904
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,620
I took care of it through my company. 

905
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,110
Then what? 

906
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:06,570
Why is everyone getting on my case? 
So I bought a house. So what? 

907
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,130
Did Don's sister in law say something? 

908
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:18,840
She says I'm having a barbecue while Subak is starving to death. 

909
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:24,750
She was having an all out party while we were starving to death! 

910
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,680
Don't. Don't go. 

911
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,150
Let go! Let go of me! 

912
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,530
Hey! Honey, honey! 

913
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,190
Hey! No! Don't go! Don't go! 

914
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:48,630
No! Hey! Sedal! 

915
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:50,320
Don't go! 

916
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:52,320
Hey! 

917
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,320
Hey! Heo Sedal! Stop right there! 

918
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,260
Hey!  

919
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,520
Hey!  

920
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,560
Oh, no... 

921
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,330
Mother! 

922
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,110
Isn't that goof-off? 

923
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,510
Mother, come out. 

924
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:19,610
Mother, Subak, come out. 

925
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,300
And father, come out, too. 

926
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,840
We've been out for a while now. 

927
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,330
Are you crazy? What are you doing? 

928
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:28,890
Mother. 

929
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,170
What? I'm here. What do you want? 

930
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,850
If you have something to say, sit down. 

931
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,900
I'm sorry, father. 

932
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,520
I have something to say to mother. 

933
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,150
Okay. Let's hear it. 

934
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,660
Have you been drinking? 

935
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,030
Yes, I had a drink. 

936
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,940
You came here drunk? 

937
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,010
You have no manners whatsoever, do you? 

938
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,170
Don't you have any respect for me? 

939
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:02,250
Goof-off, let's go. 

940
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,740
Let me go! 

941
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,100
Let him go.
Let's hear him out. 

942
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,610
Go ahead. 

943
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,990
I have no bad feelings toward you, father. 

944
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,420
But mother, 

945
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,290
you shouldn't be like that. 

946
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,430
Why do you treat her that way? 

947
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,190
And what way is that? 

948
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,970
She deserves compassion. 

949
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,350
Where's Subak? 

950
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,070
I won't ever forgive her for this! 

951
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,550
You won't forgive her? 

952
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,070
How dare you say that? 

953
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,070
Be quiet! 

954
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,510
What did she do wrong? 

955
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,280
The apartment she bought, 

956
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,520
she bought it by living on a very tight budget, never wasting any money. 

957
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,800
It's her sweat and blood. 

958
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,920
Do you know how hard her life is? 

959
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,490
She lives on pain relieving patches. 

960
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:02,470
She works in a dusty warehouse,
doing things that are hard even for men. 

961
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:06,870
She never buys anything for herself, 

962
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:11,460
not even food, and she digs through clothes donation bins to get clothes for the boys. 

963
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,660
She wears my old underpants. 

964
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:20,890
That's how she bought that apartment,
so is that a crime? 

965
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:25,040
Why do we have to tip toe around Subak and be accommodating to her? 

966
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,440
Was Hobak adopted or something? 

967
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,990
The whole neighborhood knows that you only love Subak. 

968
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,940
Have you ever given my boys a hug? 

969
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,700
You take care of Subak's girls. 

970
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:50,750
But we had to leave our boys with strangers. 

971
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,920
Have you ever taken care of my boys? 

972
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:58,820
That was how she bought that apartment. 

973
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,780
So why do you make her cry? Why? 

974
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,020
- Stop it. Let's go.
- Let go! 

975
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:05,910
We should go. 

976
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,400
Let go! 

977
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,570
Mother, 

978
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:11,860
don't ever do that to Hobak. 

979
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,640
If you ever 

980
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,510
disrespect her 

981
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,740
or break her heart, 

982
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:25,720
I won't just sit and watch. 

983
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,220
She is 

984
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,090
my woman and my wife! 

985
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:35,600
Let's go.

987
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,160
Was yelling at his mother in law okay? 

988
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,800
What he said was right. 

989
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,420
Try living without your wife. 

990
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:19,190
I don't think I can handle this much longer. 

991
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:20,510
I can't stay with him. 

992
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,170
Father's really angry. 

993
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:25,240
I won't go back unless he changes. 

994
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,590
Make your husband get down on his knees in front of mom and apologize. 

995
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:29,610
Okay. 

996
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:31,610
I don't believe my eyes. 

997
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:33,390
You must be a very busy man. 

998
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:35,390
You're very feisty today. 

999
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,090
Let me know if you need anything. 

1000
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:39,020
I don't think I can come today. 

1001
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,680
What did you just say?
