1
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,131
Pretty nice up here,
isn't it?

2
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,641
- Kermit?
- Huh?

3
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,635
What if we drift out to sea?

4
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,972
What if we're never
heard from again?

5
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,727
What if there's a storm?

6
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,276
Or we get struck by lightning?

7
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,568
That'd be neat.

8
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,272
Listen, nothing's gonna happen.

9
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,652
This is just the opening credits.

10
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,904
Oh. Where are they?

11
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:09,945
Wow!

12
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,914
<i>"The Great Muppet Caper."</i>

13
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,662
Nice title.

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,786
Whoo-wee!

15
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,338
I'd like to try this
without the balloon.

16
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,793
- Try what? Plummeting?
- Yeah!

17
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,673
I suppose you could try it once.

18
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,339
- Kermit?
- Mmm?

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,848
How long are these opening credits?

20
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,344
Just about another minute or so.

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,313
My ears are popping.

22
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,730
I wonder how far you
could plummet before you blacked out.

23
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,610
Well, don't try it, Gonzo.
We need you for this movie.

24
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,281
Sure is tempting.

25
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,286
- Kermit?
- Huh?

26
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,911
What does "BSC" stand for?

27
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,371
I don't know.

28
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,424
Gee, a lot of people
worked on this movie.

29
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,627
Huh. This is nothing.

30
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,462
Wait till you see the end credits.

31
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,726
- Kermit?
- Mmm?

32
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,273
Are the credits over?

33
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,067
Uh, not quite.

34
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,822
Nobody reads those
names anyway, do they?

35
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,241
Sure.
They all have families.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,447
Ah.

37
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,824
That's it.
The sky is clear.

38
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:34,951
So, okay.

39
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,829
Well, now what do we do?
I mean, how does this movie start?

40
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,707
- Well, we just pull that rope.
- Yes, sir!

41
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,418
Ooh, we're going down!

42
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,546
Heads up, below!

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,944
What a fantastic beginning.

44
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:08,939
Wow!

45
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,401
<i>There'll be spectacle
There'll be fantasy</i>

46
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,781
<i>There'll be derring-do</i>

47
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,988
<i>And stuff like you would never see</i>

48
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,197
<i>Hey, a movie</i>

49
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,658
<i>Yeah, we're gonna be a movie</i>

50
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,745
<i>- Starring everybody
- And me</i>

51
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:26,253
<i>There'll be heroes bold
There'll be comedy</i>

52
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,756
<i>And a lot of fuss
That ends for us real happily</i>

53
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,212
<i>Hey, a movie</i>

54
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,547
<i>We can watch it all develop</i>

55
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,632
<i>Starring everybody</i>

56
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,808
<i>And me</i>

57
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,262
<i>We'll take the world
And set it on its ear</i>

58
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,441
<i>Come on, join in
We're gonna start right here</i>

59
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,697
It's okay.
I landed on my head.

60
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,649
Come on!

61
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,485
Oh. Here, chicken!

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,954
Hey! Why, you...

63
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,155
Whoa!

64
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,034
Hold it!

65
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:04,870
Go ahead, Kermit.

66
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,255
Thank you. See, in this film,

67
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,005
<i>me and Fozzie play crack investigative
reporters for The Daily Chronicle.</i>

68
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,338
And Gonzo, he's our photographer.
And it's gonna be terrific.

69
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,475
Boy, I wish I were you people,
seeing this for the first time.

70
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,390
<i>There'll be crooks and cops</i>

71
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,101
<i>There'll be villainy</i>

72
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,654
<i>But with us on call
We'll fix it all real easily</i>

73
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,606
<i>Hey, a movie</i>

74
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,487
<i>Wow, it's gonna be terrific</i>

75
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,239
<i>Starring everybody</i>

76
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,410
And me.

77
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,405
Argh!

78
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,867
Now, what we need, guys,
is an exciting photo story.

79
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,918
Right this way, young lady.

80
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,587
I'll take a picture of this chicken.

81
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,206
Beautiful.

82
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,418
- That's great, Gonzo.
- Yeah. Smile, chicky babe.

83
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,976
My jewels!

84
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,974
That man stole my jewels!

85
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,055
Help! My jewels!

86
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,946
Look up. Hey, do you wanna make
the front pages or not?

87
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,736
Kermit, I got a great picture
of the chicken.

88
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,821
Oh, good.

89
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,408
<i>There'll be mystery
and catastrophe</i>

90
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,337
<i>But it's all in fun
You paid the money, wait and see</i>

91
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,288
<i>Hey, a movie</i>

92
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,045
<i>ls there any way to stop it?</i>

93
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,296
<i>Starring everybody</i>

94
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,923
<i>Everybody</i>

95
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,424
<i>Everybody and...</i>

96
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,176
Oh...

97
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,598
<i>Me</i>

98
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,938
How could you miss a story like that?

99
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,777
it was right under your noses,

100
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,700
practically bit you
on the seat of the pants.

101
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,027
There's just no excuse.

102
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,489
I guess this would be the wrong time
to ask for a raise?

103
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,583
Raise? A raise?

104
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,249
I'll give you a raise!

105
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,624
Did you read these headlines? Huh?

106
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,172
"Jewel heist on Main Street."

107
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,924
And it's nice bold print,
isn't it?

108
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,381
- Yes, it's very easy to read.
- Mmm.

109
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,216
Shut up now.

110
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,300
Sorry.

111
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,637
<i>"Lady Holiday's Jewels Stolen,"
that's what it says in The Times.</i>

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,097
<i>And here's The Herald.</i>

113
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,062
"Fashion Queen of London Robbed."

114
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,269
And last but not least...

115
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,319
...here's our cute little banner story.

116
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,868
"Identical Twins
join The Chronicle staff."

117
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,537
Now, I ask you,
what paper would you buy?

118
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,491
I read the one that has "Dear Abby."

119
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,838
Gee, Mr. Tarkanian.

120
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,916
We thought identical twins
working on a newspaper

121
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,252
- would make an interesting story.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,678
Well, it doesn't.

123
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,472
Especially since you two guys
don't look anything alike.

124
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,264
Well, that's 'cause Fozzie's
not wearing his hat.

125
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,189
- Oh, Fozzie, put your hat back on.
- Oh. Yes, sir. See?

126
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,600
Oh, yeah.

127
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,980
I can see it now.

128
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,313
But that's still no excuse
for blowing a story.

129
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,272
Oh, we'll do better next time.

130
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,484
Next time? Next time?

131
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,694
What makes you think
there's gonna be a next time?

132
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,246
Well, if there isn't it's gonna
be a real short movie.

133
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,073
Look, the only reason
I hired you two jerks

134
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,329
was because your old man
was a friend of mine.

135
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,578
Dad spoke well of you, too.

136
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,585
Well, I'm as sentimental
as the next guy.

137
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,962
That's why I don't
want him to hear this.

138
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,167
You're fired.

139
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,341
Take that thing down off the ceiling.

140
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,297
Yeah, but, Mr. Tarkanian...

141
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,225
- Gonzo.
- Check. Whoo-wee!

142
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,727
Won't you listen to reason, sir?

143
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,022
I'm not listening to anything
and I'm not giving you your job back.

144
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,815
I don't want you to give us anything.

145
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,063
We just want to go to England
and talk to Lady Holiday

146
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,394
the woman who was robbed?

147
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,571
And we'll catch
those jewel thieves for you.

148
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,149
You see, all you have to do is
pay our way to London.

149
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,860
Oh! Is that all I have to do?

150
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,246
Well, we could use some
new luggage for the trip.

151
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,493
Luggage?

152
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,875
Now look, beat it.
I got a deadline to meet.

153
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,748
But how are we gonna get to London?

154
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,079
I'll tell you what, Fozzie,

155
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,381
since you're such an investigative
reporter, you figure it out.

156
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,129
I'm Fozzie.

157
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,461
Oh, yeah, yeah. The hat.

158
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,925
Stop the presses!

159
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,265
Why? What happened?

160
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,397
I don't know.
I've always wanted to say that.

161
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,940
Look, you guys...

162
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,449
Oh, boy.

163
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,125
It must be 50 below in here.

164
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,915
You're lucky, you have fur.

165
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,417
No, no, no.
You're the one with the fur.

166
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,123
Turn on your light
and see for yourself.

167
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,427
Oh, yeah!

168
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,175
I keep mixing us up.

169
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,387
I think I'll read for a while.

170
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,855
- Oh, I wish I had a book.
- Hey, Kermit?

171
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,899
Can you reach the hostess call button?
I'm hungry.

172
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,069
They don't serve food in ninth class.

173
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,318
What?
$12 and you don't even get a meal?

174
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,616
Hey,
could you guys keep it down?

175
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,614
I'm trying to watch the movie.

176
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,701
Hey, somebody's coming.

177
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,533
Oh, maybe they're bringing
hamburgers.

178
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,243
All out for England!

179
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,203
Oh, great, the plane is landing.

180
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,754
The plane?

181
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,503
Nah. The plane lands in Italy.

182
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,168
You land in England.

183
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,927
Whoa!

184
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,672
Kermit!

185
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,426
What's happening?

186
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,887
Whoopee!

187
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,734
Geronimo!

188
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,777
Glug!

189
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,783
For once the forecast was right.

190
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,615
It said it was going
to rain cats and dogs.

191
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,076
No, no. We're bears and frogs.

192
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,251
And Gonzos.

193
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,173
Whatever you are, whoever you are,
welcome to Great Britain.

194
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,797
Great Britain?
We're actually in Great Britain!

195
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,004
Oh, no, we'll never get to England now.

196
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,681
You are in England,
my furry friend.

197
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,431
This sceptered isle.
This jewel of the North Atlantic.

198
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,433
Oh, good.
Well, we're going to London

199
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,311
and we were wondering if you
could recommend a nice hotel.

200
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,234
- Actually, a cheap hotel.
- How cheap?

201
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,561
Free.

202
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,614
That narrows the field a bit.

203
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,736
Let's see.

204
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,319
"Places where you can park
your carcasses."

205
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,201
Bus terminals. River banks.

206
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,452
The Happiness Hotel.

207
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,875
Happiness Hotel? That sounds great.

208
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,918
What's wrong with bus terminals?

209
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,589
Well, thanks a lot for your help, sir.

210
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,183
Hey, guys, this is London.

211
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,011
Yeah, London! We made it!
Oh, boy!

212
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,222
- Is that the Eiffel Tower?
- Yeah!

213
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,273
- No.
- No, no.

214
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:24,980
- Hey, Kermit?
- Yeah?

215
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,029
- Are bears allowed in those fountains?
- What?

216
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,947
Are bears allowed in those fountains?

217
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,196
- No, I don't think so.
- I need a bath.

218
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,991
This is terrific.

219
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,742
Wow, look at the scenery.

220
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,373
It's very realistic.

221
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,285
- Hey, what's the name of this river?
- I don't know.

222
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,580
I think it's the English River.

223
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,834
Oh.

224
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,587
I'll take a picture of it.

225
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,004
Say cheese!

226
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,969
Oh, did I get
my elbow in the shot?

227
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,173
Don't worry.
it adds human interest.

228
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,381
But I'm a bear.

229
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,433
Anyone for the Happiness Hotel?

230
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,555
Huh?

231
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,637
- Oh, Happiness Hotel!
- That's us!

232
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,981
- Yes, we want the Happiness Hotel.
- Yeah.

233
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,360
Argh!

234
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:09,984
Wow.

235
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,450
Boy, another crash landing.
That was terrible.

236
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,994
Well, we'll just have to do it again.

237
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,664
Oh, look.
The Happiness Hotel.

238
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,412
What do you think, guys?

239
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,458
Wow.

240
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,251
If that's the Happiness Hotel,

241
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,206
I'd hate to see
what the sad one looks like.

242
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,103
Excuse me?

243
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,438
What?

244
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,141
We'd like a room.

245
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,355
Really?

246
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,695
Yeah, we'd like to check in.

247
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,652
Somebody's checking in!

248
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,160
Somebody's checking in?

249
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,453
<i>Oh, there's no fire in the fireplace</i>

250
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,250
<i>There's no carpet on the ﬂoor</i>

251
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,043
<i>Don't try to order dinner</i>

252
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,962
<i>There's no kitchen anymore</i>

253
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,835
<i>But if the road's been kinda bumpy</i>

254
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,257
<i>And you need to rest a spell</i>

255
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,711
<i>Well, welcome home
To the Happiness Hotel</i>

256
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,929
- Hey, how are you guys fixing to pay?
- What are our choices?

257
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,982
A, credit card. B, cash.

258
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,684
C, sneak out
in the middle of the night.

259
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,440
We'll take C.

260
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,321
Very popular choice.

261
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,535
<i>If you got luggage keep it handy</i>

262
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,203
<i>But you're running out of luck</i>

263
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,452
<i>'Cause the bellhops
Ain't too organized</i>

264
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,158
<i>And the elevator's stuck</i>

265
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,834
<i>Still if you don't mind friendly animals</i>

266
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,161
<i>And can learn to stand the smell</i>

267
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,748
<i>Well, welcome home
To the Happiness Hotel</i>

268
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,262
You know, I may be mistaken,
but the bellhops look like rats.

269
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,184
You should see the chambermaids.

270
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,736
<i>- Welcome home
- Welcome home</i>

271
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,442
<i>- Welcome home
- Welcome home</i>

272
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,198
<i>No matter where you wander</i>

273
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,120
<i>You will never do as well</i>

274
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,374
<i>Okay, the lobby's looking shabby</i>

275
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,545
<i>And it's got the wrong address</i>

276
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,249
<i>And the whole dang thing
Has been condemned</i>

277
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,754
<i>by American Express</i>

278
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,710
<i>Still the management is cheerful</i>

279
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,046
<i>Though the whole joint's gone to hell</i>

280
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,803
<i>Well, welcome home
To the Happiness Hotel</i>

281
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,061
- You guys live here?
- Yeah, but only between gigs.

282
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,891
So that means we've been here
this time, what, five years?

283
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,067
Oh, yeah, but, like,
okay, you know,

284
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,236
our agent, you know, like,
he says, I mean, like,

285
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,781
things are really going to break
as soon as we get our new glossies.

286
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,699
Argh!

287
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,907
What's wrong with the drummer?
He looks a little crazed.

288
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,488
Aw, he's just upset about missing

289
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,824
the Rembrandt exhibit
at the National Gallery.

290
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,117
Renoir!

291
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,582
<i>- Oh, there are bugs
- There are bugs</i>

292
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,456
<i>- And there are lice
- There are lice</i>

293
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,208
<i>Sure, we have our little problems</i>

294
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,130
<i>But you'll never beat the price</i>

295
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,627
<i>You got every kind of critter</i>

296
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,801
<i>You got every kind of pest</i>

297
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,878
<i>But we treat 'em all as equals</i>

298
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,838
<i>Just like any other guest</i>

299
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,639
<i>Though you're cleaner
than the others</i>

300
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,841
<i>Still, as far as we can tell</i>

301
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,474
<i>You'll fit right in to the
Happiness Hotel</i>

302
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,476
<i>We'll fit right in</i>

303
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,900
<i>To the Happiness Hotel</i>

304
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,976
Say cheese!

305
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,738
You are all weirdos.

306
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,278
Ugh.

307
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,616
Oh, that's just fine right there.

308
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,035
Thank you.

309
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,381
Hey, not bad.

310
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,883
Are you sure we can
afford this?

311
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,920
Hey, Kermit,
I'm getting hungry.

312
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,339
- Call room service.
- There's no phone.

313
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,220
That's okay.
There's no food either.

314
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,596
Come on, Rizzo.

315
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,554
Look, why don't we forget about food
and get a good night's sleep?

316
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,982
We have to get up early
to interview Lady Holiday.

317
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,354
Mmm.

318
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,310
Boy,
I sure could use something

319
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,771
from one or more
of the basic food groups.

320
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,481
We'll have breakfast
in the morning.

321
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,942
Right now, let's just be
thankful we're here.

322
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,829
Say, this is nice.

323
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,745
Can somebody
turn out the light?

324
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,414
Thank you.

325
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,248
This is Lady Holiday.

326
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,881
Milan speaking?
Then put him on.

327
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,383
Oh, yes, darling.
Yes, I'm fine.

328
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,932
I had quite a scare.
Thank God I wasn't hurt.

329
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,594
Of course my diamonds were valuable.

330
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,100
All my diamonds are valuable.

331
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,898
Now, darling, I want you to call
the United States and tell Vogue

332
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,693
they can't have the photographs
of the spring line until after the show.

333
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,862
I'm not too happy
with some of the designs.

334
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,360
Still have to make some changes.

335
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,411
Well, I'm looking
at three of the gowns now

336
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,663
and I can see horrendous mistakes.

337
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,086
Of course Paris should be notified.

338
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,415
Carla. The neckline on that gown
is too high, don't you think?

339
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,717
- I rather like the effect.
- Do you like looking like an ostrich?

340
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,170
- Of course not.
- And Marla.

341
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,925
Too many frills and furbelows.

342
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,600
I don't think we should strive
for the fantail pigeon look, do you?

343
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,348
And you, Darla.

344
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,395
That outfit's the pits.

345
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,598
Loose where it should be tight
and tight where it should be loose,

346
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,898
like the folds on a turkey's neck.

347
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,727
Why would I design such
atrocious-looking clothes?

348
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,982
Oh!

349
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,481
I must be getting senile.

350
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,357
<i>Yes, Lady Holiday?</i>

351
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,818
We have to make drastic changes

352
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,322
in the new line
before the show tomorrow.

353
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:35,032
All my girls are going around
looking like barnyard animals.

354
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,040
Good heavens. Who are you?

355
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,004
My name is Miss Piggy

356
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,587
and I would like to be
a high-fashion model.

357
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,677
Doesn't surprise me.

358
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,475
Seems to be the way we're heading.

359
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,521
I've always dreamed
of being a Holiday model.

360
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,519
<i>I have brought my je ne sais quoi</i>

361
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,272
and my portfolio
all the way here to London

362
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:07,276
to see you, the one and only
Lady Holiday.

363
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,284
- May I come in?
- Absolutely not.

364
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,324
- May I show you my portfolio?
- No.

365
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,495
Good. Here.

366
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,914
You may open it.

367
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,749
Ah. This is me reeking grandeur.

368
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,958
Being aloof.

369
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,749
Being demure.

370
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,214
Ah. Daring.

371
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,175
Interesting range of emotions.

372
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,676
Oh, you think so?

373
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,555
Well, as you can see
from this small sampling,

374
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,352
modeling is my life.

375
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,351
It is my destiny.
I shall accept nothing less.

376
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,273
I can offer you a job as a receptionist.

377
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,235
I'll take it! I'll take it!

378
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,483
Oh, thank you, thank you!
Thank you!

379
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,698
Oh! Oh! Oh!

380
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,401
You won't be sorry,
I promise. I can type,

381
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,283
I can take shorthand,
I can make coffee.

382
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,615
- Oh, I can do it all.
- Sit.

383
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,292
I can sit.
I'm very good at sitting.

384
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,290
Are you quite under control?

385
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,204
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm!

386
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,171
Now, I'll be lunching
with my brother Nicky.

387
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,675
He's second in command here
and he's an irresponsible parasite.

388
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,505
But I had to bring him into the business

389
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,556
because he squandered
his half of the inheritance

390
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,181
and he has categorically no prospects.

391
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,227
Not that he's grateful.

392
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,396
He still gambles and incurs bad debts,

393
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,394
uses my charge accounts, eats my food

394
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,976
and borrows my cars
without asking permission.

395
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,063
And certainly he's not to be trusted.

396
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,568
I wouldn't even put it past him

397
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,570
to try to steal my most valuable
and largest jewel,

398
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,902
the fabulous Baseball Diamond.

399
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,910
And I don't know why his bow ties
are always crooked.

400
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,538
Still, in all, he is my brother.

401
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,915
Why are you telling me all this?

402
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,122
It's plot exposition.
it has to go somewhere.

403
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,253
Anyway, I want you to answer
the telephone while I'm gone

404
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,426
and, um, straighten up the office.

405
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,674
Consider it done. Mmm. Oh.

406
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,508
- Everything's under control.
- Not to sweat.

407
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,511
Carry on.
I'll be back in an hour.

408
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,021
Whee!

409
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,270
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

410
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,149
Oh, lam going to be a famous model.
Oh, I'm so happy for me.

411
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:15,358
Miss Piggy, you are on your way.

412
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,243
Where does Lady Holiday get off
calling me an ostrich?

413
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,367
We'll get even
with Lady Holiday tonight

414
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,663
when we steal her necklace.

415
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,582
What are you going to wear
for the robbery?

416
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,625
Shh.

417
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,954
Hi.

418
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,254
Hi. Hello.

419
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,294
Hubba hubba!

420
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,089
Uh, excuse me,
where's Lady Holiday's office?

421
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,092
- Round the corner, to the left.
- Oh. Thank you.

422
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,640
- Did you just give directions to a frog?
- I guess I did.

423
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,841
Smile.

424
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,053
Is that a new photographer?

425
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,432
Ugh.

426
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,058
I think I'm stuck.

427
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,190
Gonzo? Gonzo!

428
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,775
Gonzo. Gonzo.

429
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,231
Pull.

430
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,861
Gonzo, are you okay?

431
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,367
Oh, sure. it was just my nose.

432
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,619
Hey, you guys stay here.
I'll find Lady Holiday.

433
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,699
Yes, sir.

434
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,538
Hey, Fozzie. Come on,
get your nose in here. It's really fun.

435
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:19,635
Mr. Holiday? Did you order
a gross of flowered socks?

436
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,183
Oh! What an honor.
You're all so wonderful.

437
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,980
Thank you for choosing moi
as model of the year.

438
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:31,184
Oh! I never dreamed
when I first began in this business

439
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,066
that I would reach such lofty heights.

440
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,067
Thank you! Thank you!

441
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,815
Uh, excuse me.

442
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,700
So, what do you think
about the drapes, hmm?

443
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,874
Personally,
I'd rather see shutters. Yes.

444
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,747
And on this wall here...

445
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,476
Lady Holiday?

446
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,187
Lady Holiday?

447
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,615
Gee, are you okay?

448
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:27,244
I don't think I'll ever be the same.

449
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,666
Pardon?

450
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,537
Oh. I mean,
I don't usually fall like that.

451
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,497
I thought it was a very nice fall.

452
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,207
It was quite graceful, actually.

453
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,011
Oh, thank you, whoever you are.

454
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,635
My name is Kermit the Frog
and I've come all the way from America

455
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,967
<i>to interview you for
The Daily Chronicle.</i>

456
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,928
Me? Why me?

457
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,934
Oh, because you're Lady Holiday.

458
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,436
Oh.

459
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,860
- Oh. Yeah, right.
- Reason enough.

460
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,479
Urn...

461
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,861
You wanna help me
out of this wastebasket?

462
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,283
- Oh, yeah.
- Now just pull.

463
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,827
Okay.

464
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,489
- Harder.
- Okay.

465
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,628
So, uh... Listen.

466
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,501
Can I ask you a couple
of questions now?

467
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,925
No, no. Um... Not here.

468
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,503
So busy.
So much to do.

469
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,802
Well, uh, perhaps
we could have dinner tonight?

470
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,976
Yes. Fine. Swell. See you then.

471
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,975
I'll pick you up at your house.
It must be beautiful.

472
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,148
- I'm sure it is.
- Hmm?

473
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,191
I mean, sure it is!

474
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,813
Yeah.

475
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,816
So, uh, where do you live?

476
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,649
Urn...

477
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,695
Guess!

478
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,325
Probably some
highbrow street somewhere.

479
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,998
Highbrow Street, absolutely right.

480
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,199
Highbrow Street.

481
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,284
How did you guess? Are you psychic?

482
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:57,121
But now, guess what number.

483
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,458
I don't know. Number 17?

484
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,669
Yes, all right. 17 Highbrow Street.

485
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,925
Okay.
I'll pick you up at, shall we say...

486
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,473
- Eight o'clock?
- 5:30 p.m.?

487
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,095
- 4:15 p.m.?
- 9:20 p.m.?

488
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,176
Seven o'clock.

489
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,308
- Okay. That was easy.
- Yes, easy.

490
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,482
- Okay, well, I'll see you later.
- Yes. 8:00.

491
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:17,934
Seven.

492
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,519
Seven, seven.

493
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:21,937
Well, um...

494
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,407
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

495
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,152
<i>Adios, mon chéri.</i>

496
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,035
Much obliged.

497
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,201
So, Kermit, tell me,
what about Lady Holiday?

498
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,252
- I mean, is she pretty?
- Oh, yeah.

499
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,954
- Mmm-hmm.
- Not at all what I expected.

500
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,040
- Ah.
- Nice eyes, sturdy legs.

501
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:45,128
And it might have been my imagination,
but, uh, I think she found me attractive.

502
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,179
Oh. Uh, taxi!

503
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,256
Well, of course
she found you attractive.

504
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,431
It runs in the family.

505
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,010
Taxi! Taxi!

506
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,888
I don't know why
the cabs won't stop.

507
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,474
Just leave it to me.

508
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,609
Taxi!

509
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,987
That's very effective.

510
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,077
Yeah, it's great when it works.

511
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,330
Did you want me to stop or what?

512
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,952
Thank you very much, sir.

513
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,251
Oh, you can call me Beauregard.

514
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:20,375
- Where are you guys going?
- Uh, the Happiness Hotel.

515
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,879
Oh, good, that's where I'm going.
How do you get there?

516
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,257
- Haven't you ever been there?
- Of course. I live there.

517
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,430
I just don't know how to get there.

518
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,261
- It's straight down this street.
- Okay.

519
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,013
Whoa!

520
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,599
Okay. Good.
Now just keep going straight.

521
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,183
Will do.

522
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,867
it takes a while to
get to know the town.

523
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,287
- How long have you lived in London?
- All my life.

524
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,660
How come you don't have
an English accent?

525
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,833
Hey, I'm lucky to have
a driver's license.

526
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,925
Hey, it's just up ahead
there on the right.

527
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,004
What is?

528
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,058
- The Happiness Hotel.
- Oh, yeah.

529
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,181
What's your room number?

530
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,979
I don't know.
We're on the second floor.

531
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,101
Oh, I'm sorry.

532
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,649
I can only take you as far as the lobby.

533
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,189
Whee!

534
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,746
You can never find a cab
when you need one.

535
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,966
Whoo-whee! Can we do that again?

536
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,918
Well, thank you very much,
Beauregard.

537
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,505
You're welcome.
Hey, how do I get out of here?

538
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,465
I suggest you make a U-turn.

539
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,596
Hmm, right.

540
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,264
He's headed for the kitchen!

541
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,103
Oh, no!

542
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,040
Well, looks like steering wheel souffle
for dinner.

543
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,492
Again?

544
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,412
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going out to dinner.

545
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,213
That's right.
Kermit's got a date with Lady Holiday.

546
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:31,044
- You don't have to tell everybody.
- Oh. Right.

547
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,595
Pops, don't tell anybody.
Kermit's got a date with Lady Holiday.

548
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,886
Kermit's got a date
with Lady Holiday?

549
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,310
Oh, wow.
Wait till I tell the guys in the band.

550
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,389
- Tell us what?
- Yeah, what's going down?

551
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,069
Kermit and Lady Holiday? All right!

552
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,239
Fozzie,
this is all very embarrassing.

553
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,572
Kermit, don't worry.
it won't go outside this room.

554
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,908
Here is a Muppet news flash.

555
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,711
Kermit the Frog to date Lady Holiday.
Details at 11:00.

556
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,425
Smile.

557
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,090
Local poultry.

558
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,390
Boy, it's a good thing
you didn't tell everybody

559
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,100
where Lady Holiday lives,

560
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,277
otherwise they'd all
be camped on her doorstep.

561
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:33,777
That is just for you
and me to know, brother.

562
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:37,280
We are going to have ourselves
a time tonight.

563
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,702
Wacka wacka.

564
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,245
"We"? What do you mean "we"?

565
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,822
The two of us. You missed a spot.

566
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,283
Anyway. When we get there tonight,
just act naturally.

567
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,040
Oh, no, no. Wait a second,
wait a second. It's when I get there.

568
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,962
This is my date with Lady Holiday.

569
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,291
I'm going alone.
So it's "me" not "we."

570
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:53,921
Oh.

571
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,754
I see. Fine.

572
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,969
Boy, I wish I had whiskers.

573
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,050
Of course, then I'd have to use a blade.

574
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,228
- Kermit? Turn around.
- Hmm?

575
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,683
Are you really going
to go without me tonight?

576
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:13,112
Well, Fozzie, I figure this is something
that I have to do alone.

577
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,990
- No problem.
- Oh, good.

578
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,614
- Just hand me my cuff links.
- Yes, sir.

579
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,787
<i>And straighten my tie</i>

580
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,115
<i>Just drench me in rich cologne</i>

581
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,786
<i>And don't ask me why</i>

582
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,206
<i>Go on and pluck me
a boutonniére</i>

583
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,584
<i>You're moving up and walking on air</i>

584
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:35,463
<i>Steppin' out with a star
And feeling high</i>

585
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,255
<i>Come polish my wing tips</i>

586
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,761
<i>- And call for the car</i>

587
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:46,770
<i>I'll sweep her right off
Her feet wherever we are</i>

588
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,856
<i>A satin collar and velvet vest</i>

589
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,525
<i>I never settle for second best</i>

590
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,946
<i>Steppin' out with a star
Sad times, bye-bye</i>

591
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,865
<i>Have I got style? Mmm!</i>

592
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,363
<i>Have I got taste? Mmm!</i>

593
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,871
<i>On someone else, I swear</i>

594
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,574
<i>This savoir-faire
Would be such a waste</i>

595
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,965
<i>Come toss me my top hat</i>

596
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,041
Yes, sir!

597
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,876
<i>I'm ready to ﬂy</i>

598
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,216
<i>Busting into the upper crust</i>

599
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,139
<i>As easy as pie</i>

600
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,975
<i>Just watch my dreams come true</i>

601
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,179
<i>This is something I was born to do</i>

602
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,107
<i>Steppin' out with a star
That star is you</i>

603
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,503
<i>- Have you got class?
- Have I got class?</i>

604
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,755
<i>- Have you got chic?
- Have I got chic?</i>

605
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,964
<i>To think that you and me were nobody</i>

606
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,673
<i>Why, only last week</i>

607
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,803
Hey, guys!

608
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,524
<i>I'm ready to ﬂy</i>

609
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,526
- Kermit!
- At least I can try.

610
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,653
<i>Just watch my dreams come true</i>

611
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,076
<i>This is something I was born to do</i>

612
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,701
<i>Steppin' out with a star
Bye, bad times</i>

613
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,157
<i>Steppin' out with a star
Hey, good times</i>

614
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,464
<i>Steppin' out with a star
And feeling high</i>

615
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,211
Yeah!

616
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,840
Well, how do I look?

617
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,296
Which one are you?

618
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,928
- I'm the one on the right.
- Oh.

619
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,557
Well, you look like you're gonna
have a terrific time.

620
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,558
Without me.

621
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,733
- Fozzie?
- What?

622
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,602
You can come.

623
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,730
- You mean it?
- Mmm-hmm.

624
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,065
Oh, boy!

625
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,489
Great news, gang. We can go!

626
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,208
Awfully disappointing weather today.

627
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,701
Hmm?

628
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,665
The weather.
Awfully disappointing today.

629
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,873
Is it, is it?

630
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,382
Yes. Mmm, yes, yes.
I know what you mean.

631
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,891
It was rather disappointing yesterday.

632
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,473
And the day before.

633
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,774
What is it, Neville?

634
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,329
Urn...

635
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,658
Pig, um...

636
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,166
Climbing up the outside
of the house, dear.

637
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:41,997
Oh.

638
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,265
Next time they want stunts,
they get a double.

639
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,184
The day before that
was awfully disappointing, too.

640
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,436
Mmm.

641
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,526
And of course the weekend
was perfectly frightful.

642
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,186
Never stopped raining.

643
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,953
- Neville?
- Hmm?

644
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,912
- Am I boring you?
- What, dear?

645
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:25,545
- I said, "Am I boring you"?
- Boring me?

646
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:26,967
Oh, that's a good one.

647
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,010
I'm having the time of my life, dear.

648
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,971
Neville, did you say

649
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,301
a pig was climbing up
the outside of the house?

650
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,722
Yes. Yes. Yes, I believe I did, yes.

651
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,102
I thought so.

652
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,981
Oh, you'd have to look
a long way to find a chap

653
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,903
who was more, urn...

654
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,439
Stimulated than I am, yes.

655
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,399
Oh, dear me, no, no, no.

656
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:58,537
The last time I was bored,
and never by you, my little armada...

657
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,913
- What was that?
- Just making a point, dear.

658
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,996
I mean, if I was bored I'd go out
and buy something, wouldn't I?

659
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,832
Like cheese or quails' eggs.

660
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:10,260
- Hmm, something like that.
- Yes, I suppose you would.

661
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,508
Yes, of course I would, dear.

662
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,306
That's the sort of spur-of-the-moment
fellow I am.

663
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:16,679
What?

664
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,849
Uh, what, dear?

665
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,273
What would you buy if you were bored?

666
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,609
Ah! Uh...

667
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,277
A jar of calf's-foot jelly?

668
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,246
I'd like to come with you
and help you pick one out.

669
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,164
Oh, that isn't necessary, Dorcas.

670
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,583
There's no need
for you to leave the house.

671
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,001
I wouldn't mind.

672
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,329
Haven't been outside for 12 years.

673
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,040
Well, the weather's been
most disappointing.

674
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,876
Still, there's no reason for me to stay
here all the time.

675
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,428
The children are gone,
the pets are dead,

676
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,881
the butler's been discharged,
no one ever visits us.

677
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,522
That was the doorbell, Neville.

678
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:17,744
So it was.
And the butler's dead?

679
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,242
No, no, no.

680
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,871
The pets are dead.
The butler's been discharged.

681
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,709
Ah.

682
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,332
I think one of us should answer it,
Neville.

683
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,088
Oh, do you?

684
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,966
Or we could both answer it.

685
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,423
Come, dear, I hardly think it's
necessary for both of us to...

686
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,224
I'll answer it!

687
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,395
I thought you said the pets were dead.

688
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,775
- Hello.
- Uh...

689
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,401
This is for you.

690
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,109
Oh, thank you.

691
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,115
Shall we go?

692
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:03,165
You know, I've never been inside
a real ritzy English house before.

693
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,662
- Aren't you hungry?
- Sure, but we've got a few minutes.

694
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,044
Okay, let's take a few minutes.

695
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,969
Say, nice place you got here.

696
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,342
Yes. I practically stole it.

697
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:22,476
Um, let me show you around.

698
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,143
Who was that guy back there?

699
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,642
- Just some sort of servant.
- Mmm-hmm.

700
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,769
Um, this, of course,
is the drawing room.

701
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,896
Mmm-hmm.
Did you decorate this place yourself?

702
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,772
I'll just close the door.
It's very drafty.

703
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,032
Uh, there's a chair and some walls.

704
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,033
- A whirlwind tour, huh?
- Yes.

705
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:47,083
- This is the bedroom and, uh... Bath.
- Mmm-hmm.

706
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,750
We have
hot and cold running water.

707
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,708
There's probably a bathtub
and everything.

708
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,053
Oh, here.
I want to show you something.

709
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,426
This is the closet.

710
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,218
Nice. Dark but nice.

711
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,731
Ah. Sorry.

712
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:20,784
Uh, don't think me rude, but is there,
in fact, anything I can do for you at all?

713
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,160
Urn...

714
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,039
Yes. Yes, yes. Ahem.

715
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:33,338
You may suggest a nice restaurant.

716
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,916
Ah. Well,
there's the Dubonnet Club.

717
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,878
Actually that's not so much a
restaurant, more a supper club.

718
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,759
Ah. Thank you, Jeeves.

719
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,966
No time for cocktails.

720
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,425
Evening.

721
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,401
Why are you staring
into the closet, Neville?

722
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,900
Ah, you recall that pig I mentioned?

723
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,572
The one that was climbing up the side
of the house?

724
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,320
That's the chap.
That's the chap.

725
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,742
Yes, I seem to recall that.

726
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,194
Well, he was in there just now,

727
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,154
along with a... A lizard.

728
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,956
I see. And what did they want?

729
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,785
Name of a good restaurant.
I told them the Dubonnet Club.

730
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,087
That's more of a supper club
than a restaurant.

731
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,381
Yes, well, I tried to tell them that.

732
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,799
Don't blame yourself.

733
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,844
No. No.

734
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,428
Hey! There they are!

735
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,507
Whee!

736
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,060
Kermit and his new flame.

737
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,887
- Hubba hubba.
- Ding ding!

738
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,359
You'll have to jump in the front seat.

739
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,937
The back seat's been quarantined.

740
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,280
Let's hit the road.
How about a little traveling music?

741
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,111
For sure. A love song.

742
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,117
Love song, love song.

743
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,322
Hit it!

744
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,880
<i>Give me my good friends</i>

745
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,458
<i>And play me my music</i>

746
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:03,295
<i>Yeah, give me my night life</i>

747
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,302
<i>Talk me that guitar
And roll me that boogie</i>

748
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,554
<i>Yeah, give me my night life</i>

749
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,641
Are these your friends?

750
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,347
Just the ones on the fenders.

751
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:23,239
<i>Sing me the good times
'Cause I need the feeling</i>

752
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,692
<i>Yeah, give me that night life</i>

753
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,296
<i>Give me my nightlife</i>

754
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,005
<i>Whoo, yeah!</i>

755
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,508
<i>Give me my nightlife</i>

756
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,020
They don't have to play this loud.

757
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,223
Oh, that's okay. They don't mind.

758
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,690
<i>Sing me the good times
'Cause I need the feeling</i>

759
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,648
<i>Give me my nightlife</i>

760
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,448
<i>Give me my nightlife</i>

761
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,648
Boy, a classy place like this,

762
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,350
you'd think they'd have
pretzels on the table.

763
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,113
Well, what a delightful menu.

764
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,907
What?

765
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,327
Nothing. It's just sort of amusing

766
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,155
that the roast beef
is the same price as an Oldsmobile.

767
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,126
You come here often, Lady Holiday?

768
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:01,080
Oh, only on special occasions.

769
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,460
And this is very special,
Kermie.

770
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,217
Waiter! Champagne, caviar.

771
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,967
Hey, hey, Kermit.
How are we gonna pay for this?

772
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,389
You got about 1,600 bucks on you?

773
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,809
Hey, relax, Kermit.
I'll take care of it.

774
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:23,397
Say cheese!

775
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,820
There you go, folks.
Souvenir photograph.

776
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,648
Just gimme your name and address
and ten bucks.

777
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,453
Good evening, Lady Holiday.

778
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,830
- Such a pleasure to see you.
- Thank you, Stanley.

779
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,628
Why, what a lovely diamond necklace.

780
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,460
It is rather breathtaking, isn't it?

781
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,463
I thought it
a little outré,

782
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,715
but my brother Nicky insisted
that I wear it.

783
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,133
Your table, Lady Holiday.

784
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,715
Thank you, Stanley.
Give Stanley a tip, Nicky.

785
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,766
For complimenting you
on your necklace?

786
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,515
No, because it is customary.

787
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,312
- I don't have any change.
- Then give him something bigger.

788
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,480
Bigger?

789
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,149
I left my wallet at home.

790
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,318
You left your wallet in college.

791
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:06,360
How about you, folks?

792
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,563
- Souvenir photograph?
- No thanks. No picture.

793
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:11,657
Aw, come on. It'll be a great memento
for you and your wife.

794
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,985
My wife isn't feeling very well.

795
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,571
Oh, that's too bad.
Maybe she should be at home.

796
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,156
My wife is at home.

797
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,667
Yes. Next table!

798
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,378
That caviar was yummy.

799
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,139
Mwah!
Love those fish eggs!

800
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,637
- Uh, Lady Holiday?
- Oh. Yes?

801
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,189
Uh, can we talk about
the jewel robbery now?

802
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,687
Oh, Kermit.
Let us not talk business.

803
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:49,020
Music is in the air,
the night is young,

804
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,776
and I'm so beautiful.

805
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,407
What jewel robbery?

806
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,110
Uh, your jewels.
The ones that were stolen.

807
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:59,289
You know, you have lovely eyes.

808
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:14,133
You know, if you put enough sugar in this
stuff, it tastes just like ginger ale.

809
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,259
Catch you later, Stanley.

810
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,468
Aren't you happy we're here?

811
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:24,397
I have grave doubts about
wearing these jewels.

812
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,645
I feel as if thieves were
breathing down my neck.

813
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,442
Thieves aren't
breathing down your neck.

814
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,064
- I want to put them in a safe.
- No.

815
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,521
- Yes.
- Yes, I meant yes.

816
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,652
Why would I say no when I meant yes?

817
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,449
- Go and see Stanley.
- Go and see Stanley?

818
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,276
Go and see Stanley immediately.

819
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,737
All right.
If that's what you want.

820
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,906
And don't forget to tip him.

821
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,957
Tip. Tip.

822
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:58,734
<i>The first time you see her</i>

823
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,320
<i>No bolt from the blue</i>

824
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:05,782
<i>Just something so quiet</i>

825
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:09,915
<i>Yet waiting for you</i>

826
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,544
<i>With no one to tell you</i>

827
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,922
<i>That you've got to go</i>

828
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:21,632
<i>The first time it happens, you know</i>

829
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:28,096
<i>The first time you see her</i>

830
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,774
<i>No magical change</i>

831
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,353
<i>No angels appearing</i>

832
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:39,566
<i>No dreams to arrange</i>

833
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,868
<i>Just warmer and colder</i>

834
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:46,538
<i>Than springtime or snow</i>

835
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:51,245
<i>The first time it happens, you know</i>

836
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:57,417
<i>And so you fall</i>

837
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,470
<i>And how complete it is</i>

838
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:05,050
<i>And for each moment that it lasts</i>

839
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,386
<i>How sweet it is</i>

840
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:12,099
<i>The first time together</i>

841
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:15,731
<i>How simple, how rare</i>

842
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,108
<i>And just when you thought</i>

843
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:22,818
<i>You'd forgot how to care</i>

844
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,784
<i>And though you feel much more</i>

845
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:30,492
<i>Than you dare to show</i>

846
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:36,377
<i>The first time it happens, you know</i>

847
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,512
Wow. She's fantastic.

848
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,429
<i>The first time you see her</i>

849
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,937
<i>No magical change</i>

850
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,110
<i>No angels appearing</i>

851
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,564
<i>No dreams to arrange</i>

852
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,943
<i>Just warmer and colder</i>

853
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,199
<i>Than springtime or snow</i>

854
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:12,625
<i>The first time it happens, you know</i>

855
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,122
What a great number!

856
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:21,709
Nicky?

857
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,295
That's my new receptionist
dancing out there.

858
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,721
- Which one?
- The pig.

859
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,178
She's sensational.

860
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,764
Forty-five words a minute.
About average.

861
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,746
<i>And just when you thought</i>

862
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,325
<i>You'd forgot how to care</i>

863
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,831
<i>For the first time</i>

864
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,630
<i>For the first time</i>

865
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,298
A-ha!

866
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,822
<i>The first time it happens</i>

867
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:27,946
<i>The moment it happens</i>

868
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:31,245
<i>Then suddenly
There's a whole new world</i>

869
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,119
<i>The first time it happens</i>

870
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,247
<i>The first time it happens</i>

871
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:43,629
<i>The first time it happens</i>

872
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,428
<i>You know</i>

873
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,724
Bravo!

874
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:01,809
Bravo!

875
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:09,700
Aieee!

876
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,745
Lady Holiday! What's happened?

877
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,118
Was it you that screamed,
"Aieee"?

878
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,575
- She screamed right into my ear.
- Of course I screamed.

879
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,251
Somebody's just stolen my necklace.

880
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,875
I told you this would happen.
That necklace was worth a fortune.

881
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,752
- Do something.
- What do you want me to do?

882
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,050
I spilled ketchup
all over my cummerbund.

883
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,136
For God's sake.
Straighten that tie.

884
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:32,090
It's Lady Holiday, her necklace,
it's been stolen.

885
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,430
"Lady Holiday"? But I thought...

886
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,013
Kermit. I think I've got
a picture of the thief.

887
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,307
- Oh, great.
- Yeah!

888
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,564
But...

889
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,851
This is great, Gonzo.

890
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:21,351
You popped the flash just before
the soup landed on his tie.

891
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,524
Yeah, well, photography's an art.

892
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,146
You gotta have the right film,

893
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,818
you gotta have the right exposure,

894
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,738
and you gotta scream just before
they get the food to their mouth.

895
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,612
What's going on in there?

896
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,240
Lot of folks out here
want to use the rest room.

897
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:38,198
Well, we're developing these pictures.
We'll be out as soon as we finish.

898
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,578
- Ah, we're trying to catch a jewel thief.
- A jewel thief.

899
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,456
Well, catch him in another room.

900
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:45,629
People are dancing up and down
on one leg out here.

901
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,128
Hurry, Gonzo. There's gotta
be a picture of somebody

902
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,834
taking Lady Holiday's necklace.

903
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:53,797
Well, I don't know.
I still think that pig took it.

904
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,678
- Oh, she wouldn't steal.
- Why not? She lied.

905
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:57,974
That's two different things.

906
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,597
Besides, she couldn't
have stolen the necklace

907
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,850
because she was dancing.

908
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,977
That's right.
There's that old adage,

909
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:06,775
you can't dance and steal
at the same time.

910
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,854
No, that's, "You can't walk
and chew gum at the same time."

911
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:12,156
Oh, no. I think it's,
"You can't pat your head

912
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,858
"and rub your stomach
at the same time."

913
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,943
What's the difference?
She didn't steal the necklace.

914
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,528
- I bet you I can do it.
- Do what?

915
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,989
Pat my head and rub my stomach
at the same time.

916
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,370
Big deal,
anybody can do that.

917
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,420
Would you guys out it out?
We're wasting time.

918
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,678
- Hey, here it is.
- What? What? What? What?

919
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,881
Oh, look at that. It's that guy
sitting next to Lady Holiday

920
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,466
and those girls
standing in the back.

921
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:41,393
It's probably the same gang
that pulled that first job.

922
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,061
- Wow!
- Yes, and we got them

923
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,389
with their hands in the cookie jar.

924
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,854
What's going on?

925
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,481
What is this, anyway?

926
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,233
Aw.

927
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,900
The cookie jar just busted.

928
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,872
Look, Dad. There's a bear.

929
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,004
No, Christine, that's a frog.

930
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,211
Bears wear hats.

931
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,011
- How you doing, young fella?
- Oh...

932
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,267
Okay, I guess.

933
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,815
Penny for your thoughts.

934
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:32,145
Well, it's a long story.

935
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,857
- But a familiar one, I bet.
- Mmm.

936
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,775
Older than the hills.

937
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,280
I've been there, my friend.

938
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,987
- I've been there and back.
- Mmm.

939
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,540
You know, I see the way
you're sitting here

940
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,960
and I see the way you've
got your hand around that little shoe,

941
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:50,288
and that's all I need.
I know your whole story.

942
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,088
Mmm, you do?

943
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:53,791
Absolutely.

944
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:55,842
I know exactly what happened to you.

945
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,094
What?

946
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,638
Well, I tell you, friend.

947
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:03,343
What happened was you
and your brother-in-law Bernie,

948
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,803
you cashed in your stock certificates

949
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,479
and your insurance policy

950
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,433
and you went out and bought
a dry-cleaning establishment.

951
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,517
Mmm?

952
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,819
Now, another place
opens up down the street

953
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,817
and it's charging less.

954
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,775
And they're getting the stuff out faster
because they got more help.

955
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,076
- It's not your fault. Right?
- Mmm.

956
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:24,496
<i>All right. So Bernie
comes to you, he says,</i>

957
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,164
"I want you to buy me out."

958
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,617
He says he's fed up.

959
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,078
Well, your kids are growing up,
you never see 'em,

960
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,960
and all of a sudden they're turning into
juvenile delinquents,

961
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,131
and your wife is saying to you,

962
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:37,335
"Listen, you care more
about this lousy business

963
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,010
"than you care about me."

964
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,054
And the equipment breaks down

965
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,676
and your sister moves in with you

966
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,305
because that jerk Bernie,
he went and joined the circus.

967
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:47,853
Well, you had it up to here, right?

968
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,226
You didn't know what to do.

969
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,852
So what did you do?

970
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,355
- You did the only thing you could do.
- Mmm.

971
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,357
You dumped the business
for a song.

972
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,438
- And who did you sell it to?
- Who?

973
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,695
You sold it to that
jerk down the street,

974
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,277
that slob that had been
burying you for a year.

975
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,738
Then you took whatever
money you had left

976
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:09,041
<i>and you sunk it into
the glass slipper business.</i>

977
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,118
That's your story, my friend.

978
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,544
Not a happy one, is it?

979
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,455
Mmm-mmm.

980
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:19,134
You know, it's amazing.
You are 100% wrong.

981
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,382
I mean, nothing you've
said has been right.

982
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,382
Oh, yeah?

983
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,097
Well, how about this...

984
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:32,147
I hate to be rude, but, uh,
we're trying to do a movie here.

985
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,224
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

986
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,312
Oh, I didn't know that.
Gee, I'm sorry.

987
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:40,523
Listen, one thing, son.

988
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:44,076
Would you like to buy a watch?

989
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:46,153
No.

990
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,000
Movie stars.

991
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,538
Get your filthy hands off me!

992
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,383
I beg your pardon, young lady!

993
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,053
Just keep your hands
to yourself, turkey.

994
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,721
Hey, you.

995
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:09,263
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the fake Lady Holiday.

996
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,559
Hello.

997
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:16,268
"Hello"? Last night you
never even said goodbye.

998
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,900
Oh, Kermit, that was just silliness.

999
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,106
But you lied to me. You used me.

1000
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,986
Oh, Kermit, please,
let me explain. Kermit.

1001
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:30,619
- My name is Miss Piggy. I am a model.
- Yeah.

1002
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:34,247
I only lied because
I wanted to be with you.

1003
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:37,250
Yeah, well, I saw the way you were
dancing with that guy last night.

1004
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,878
- Oh, Kermit.
- Well, lemme tell you something.

1005
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:42,005
Your dancing partner
happens to be a jewel thief.

1006
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,176
What do you think of that?

1007
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,932
- You're jealous.
- I am not.

1008
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,307
You are. You are,
you are, you are, you are.

1009
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,432
Oh, Kermit, I'm sorry.
Oh, please don't go, Kermit. Please.

1010
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,062
- Mmm.
- Please don't go. Kermit, please.

1011
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,518
Oh, please, I'm sorry. Please.

1012
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,478
- Piggy. Piggy, hold it.
- Please, please, please.

1013
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,656
- Piggy. Piggy?
- Please, please, please.

1014
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,779
- You're overacting.
- What?

1015
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,327
You're overacting.
You're hamming it up.

1016
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,906
I am not. I am trying
to save this movie.

1017
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,162
Oh, yeah? Well, save your
performance instead.

1018
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,494
I am playing 800 different emotions.

1019
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,998
Well, try to play one of them right.

1020
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,501
Oh, oh! I have a career of my own.

1021
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,127
I know all about your career, Pig.

1022
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,504
I don't need this lousy duck pond here.

1023
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,005
Sure you don't need a lousy duck pond.

1024
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:27,258
- I'll just walk.
- Okay, sure. Go ahead, walk. Okay?

1025
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,260
- Should I walk? Then I'll walk.
- Walk! Go ahead and walk.

1026
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:33,514
Oh, Piggy.

1027
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,064
- Listen.
- I'm doing my best.

1028
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,019
I know you are.

1029
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:45,356
Piggy, I'm sorry.
We gotta get back to the movie though.

1030
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,157
All right.
All right, all right, all right.

1031
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:53,121
Kermit, I'm sorry I left you
last night at the nightclub.

1032
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:57,042
Oh, well, that's okay, Piggy.

1033
00:58:57,117 --> 00:59:00,792
- Oh, Kermie.
- Oh, Piggy.

1034
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,731
<i>Pretty day, sunny sky</i>

1035
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:23,481
<i>Lovely pictures dance in your eye</i>

1036
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:27,857
<i>It all seems so right</i>

1037
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,818
<i>It all feels so rare</i>

1038
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:36,741
<i>Summer soft sudden breeze</i>

1039
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:40,873
<i>Watch the wind play tag in the trees</i>

1040
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:44,582
<i>The world is so bright</i>

1041
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:48,635
<i>So perfectly fair</i>

1042
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,845
<i>Lovers sing, children dance</i>

1043
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:57,474
<i>For a minute we've got a chance</i>

1044
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:01,314
<i>Why couldn't we fly?</i>

1045
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:06,111
<i>I know we'd get by</i>

1046
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,026
<i>Couldn't we fly?</i>

1047
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,449
<i>Sunny sky, pretty day</i>

1048
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:22,082
<i>Just a push and we're on the way</i>

1049
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:26,461
<i>Yes, couldn't we ride</i>

1050
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,716
<i>Side by side?</i>

1051
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,887
Whoa!

1052
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,353
Whoa!

1053
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,103
"Look, Ma, no brains."

1054
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,781
Hup. Whoo!

1055
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:53,404
Miss Piggy. Whoa.

1056
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,239
Wah! Oof!

1057
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:23,142
<i>Why couldn't we fly?</i>

1058
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:27,442
<i>I know we'd get by</i>

1059
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:32,065
<i>- Sunny sky
- Pretty day</i>

1060
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:36,197
<i>Just a push and we're on the way</i>

1061
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:39,496
<i>Yes, couldn't we ride</i>

1062
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,993
<i>Side by side?</i>

1063
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:47,625
<i>Couldn't we ride?</i>

1064
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:09,230
Gangway! Watch it. Coming through.

1065
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,607
She's wonderful. She's so wonderful.

1066
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,485
She certainly seems to know
where she's going. It's time.

1067
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:19,198
All right, everybody.
Keep it moving. Don't linger.

1068
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,655
We just want to give them
a hint, a taste, a soupcon.

1069
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,365
Appetizers not four-course meals.

1070
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,701
Marie. I don't think
we should chew gum.

1071
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,750
Stephanie, those false eyelashes
are coming unglued.

1072
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,376
Those shoes are scuffed.

1073
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,925
- I know where they are. I'll get them...
- Sorry.

1074
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,345
Watch it, buster.
Oh. Mr. Holiday, I'm sorry.

1075
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,263
Hello.

1076
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:40,716
- Miss...
- Piggy.

1077
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:41,971
- Miss Piggy?
- Right.

1078
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,302
Of course.

1079
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:47,272
Have dinner with me tonight.

1080
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,770
Mr. Holiday, really, I'm very busy.

1081
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,819
- Could we meet just for a moment?
- Underwear, underwear, underwear.

1082
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,488
Just one brief moment, Miss Piggy.
Miss...

1083
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:59,238
- Hmm?
- Miss Piggy.

1084
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:02,537
You're a very different-looking woman.

1085
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:06,037
I'm so tired of the same type.
Those tall, thin creatures

1086
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:09,620
with the long legs, the aquiline noses,

1087
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:13,173
the teeth like pearls, soft skin.

1088
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:16,969
Yeah, well, I can see why that might
make you sick to your stomach.

1089
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,886
- Please now... Please...
- Miss Piggy.

1090
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,215
No! Please! No. Please, please.

1091
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,722
Don't put a door between us.

1092
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,892
- Hi.
- Oh, Kermit.

1093
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:32,317
I was looking for
the men's room.

1094
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:35,692
Kermit, I just want you to meet
someone. This is Nicky Holiday.

1095
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:38,740
Mr. Holiday, this is Kermit,
my special friend.

1096
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,696
Oh.

1097
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,571
Nice to meet you.

1098
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,907
Well, excuse me.

1099
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:48,374
Hmm.

1100
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,579
- Need I say more?
- He's a frog, isn't he?

1101
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,464
Yes.

1102
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,299
Miss Piggy.

1103
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:04,216
We could've had something
very, very special.

1104
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,263
Now, I can't be responsible
for what might happen.

1105
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:14,226
<i>Yeah, well, uh,
c'est la vie.</i>

1106
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,734
I don't know why you
love her like you do.

1107
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,781
I don't know why.
I just do.

1108
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,403
Well, you'd better snap
out of it, and fast.

1109
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:27,035
We've got to plant the goods
on her to take the heat off us.

1110
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,332
I know the plan.
I just wish there was another way.

1111
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,502
It's the only way. Especially now
the cops are starting to ask questions.

1112
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:36,252
Okay, I'll do my job.
When I give the signal, you do yours.

1113
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,550
Forgive me, Miss Piggy.

1114
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,551
Am I dressed right for this?

1115
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,473
- You look fine, Fozzie.
- Thank you.

1116
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,555
And now,

1117
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,854
without further ado,

1118
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:54,058
roses, hyacinths,

1119
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,110
lilacs and bluebells

1120
01:04:57,185 --> 01:05:01,315
- make up our first fashion bouquet.
- Ooh!

1121
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,570
Pretty nice lines, huh?

1122
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,278
Yes and the dresses
aren't bad either.

1123
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:09,114
Here's capricious Carla,

1124
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:12,542
a dream in hyacinth-blue chiffon

1125
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:16,997
with the classic allure
of the white pleated collar and cuffs.

1126
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,754
The skirt,
a flutter of godets,

1127
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:23,258
all complemented
by the cloudy folds of blue

1128
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:26,886
forming the perfect
flower-framing hat.

1129
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:30,223
<i>Fantastique.
And thank you, Carla.</i>

1130
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,427
Pretty good-looking duds.

1131
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,105
I found the white pleated
collar alluring,

1132
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:38,230
but I was rather taken aback
by the flutter of godets.

1133
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,606
Mmm-hmm.

1134
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:44,362
And now here's
delicious Darla

1135
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,489
in a swirl of apricot silk

1136
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:50,698
above a tight bodice
with a cleverly draped décolletage.

1137
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:52,953
Finishing with roses

1138
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:56,787
to match the confection of flowers
and silk on her head,

1139
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,623
forming a teeny-weeny hat.

1140
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,556
Oh. Ow! My knee.
I think I've twisted it.

1141
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,305
You all right? You've got to get up!
You've got to go on!

1142
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,182
I can't go on!

1143
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:16,060
Oh! You poor thing.

1144
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:19,939
Oh, don't worry, Marla.
I'll stay right here with you.

1145
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:23,443
You can't.
You've got to go on in her place.

1146
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:29,615
And now, the Lady Holiday
swimwear collection.

1147
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:34,624
Hey, Waldorf, wake up.
Here come the bikinis.

1148
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,623
Oh, boy. We'd better
synchronize our pacemakers.

1149
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:42,333
A cloud of lavender starburst pleating
surrounds our next model.

1150
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,214
Oh, I say!

1151
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:48,065
<i>A miracle of spring</i>

1152
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,071
<i>A miracle of beauty</i>

1153
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:57,658
<i>Be dazzled by the magic of one smile</i>

1154
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,789
<i>A vision of loveliness</i>

1155
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,962
<i>A universe of charms</i>

1156
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:08,009
<i>We'll never rest until you're in our arms</i>

1157
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,939
<i>Daffodils, Miss Piggy</i>

1158
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:24,359
<i>Whippoorwills, Miss Piggy</i>

1159
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:31,113
<i>Everything that's lovely
Warm and spring, Miss Piggy</i>

1160
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:34,785
<i>Fantasy, Miss Piggy</i>

1161
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:38,206
<i>Ecstasy, Miss Piggy</i>

1162
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:41,581
<i>All that's fair or fine or wonderful</i>

1163
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,754
<i>Or anything, Miss Piggy</i>

1164
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:50,882
<i>Where does the rapture
Begin and grow?</i>

1165
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:57,138
<i>Where does
Devotion and passion go?</i>

1166
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:01,471
<i>Happiness, Miss Piggy</i>

1167
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:04,933
<i>One caress, Miss Piggy</i>

1168
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:09,396
<i>All the world's ever wanted was you</i>

1169
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,153
<i>A dream come true</i>

1170
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:16,611
<i>Oh, Miss Piggy, it's you</i>

1171
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:38,426
<i>Where does the rapture
Begin and grow?</i>

1172
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:45,517
<i>Where does
Devotion and passion go?</i>

1173
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:49,027
<i>Happiness, Miss Piggy</i>

1174
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:52,231
<i>One caress, Miss Piggy</i>

1175
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:56,864
<i>All the world's ever wanted was you</i>

1176
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,446
<i>A dream come true</i>

1177
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:14,507
<i>Oh, Miss Piggy, it's you</i>

1178
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,462
<i>It's you</i>

1179
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:19,174
<i>It's you</i>

1180
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:38,576
Oh, Miss Piggy, are you okay?

1181
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:43,031
Yeah, sure. I was just looking
for my contact lens.

1182
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,758
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1183
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,586
Oh, dear. Oh, you poor thing.

1184
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:59,388
Excuse me. Here, put this on.

1185
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:01,558
- You'll get a chill.
- Thank you very much.

1186
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:03,054
- You all right'?
- I don't know what happened.

1187
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:04,886
I must've tripped.

1188
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,846
Wait a minute. What's this?

1189
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,691
I don't think these belong to me.

1190
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,645
Do you recognize this?

1191
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:17,949
That was my necklace.
But where are the diamonds?

1192
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,745
- Where are the diamonds?
- Miss Piggy stole my necklace.

1193
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,864
- No.
- Miss Piggy, how could you?

1194
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,915
No! No! I don't know anything about it!

1195
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:30,461
Somebody must've put it... You!

1196
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:33,255
- It was you! Kermit was right.
- Oh, no, no, no!

1197
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:36,175
You're a phony! Yes, you are.

1198
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,297
And you know what?

1199
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:40,380
You can't even sing!
Your voice was dubbed.

1200
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,557
Watch out, guys. Kermit!

1201
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:45,430
Don't worry, Miss Piggy.
We'll get you out of this.

1202
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:49,014
It just goes to show
you can't trust anybody.

1203
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:50,939
Excuse me, Lady Holiday,
will you be hiring any more pigs?

1204
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:54,019
Well, I shall certainly
think twice about it.

1205
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:57,731
Kermit, find out if they'll
let me keep the costumes.

1206
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,657
What about your most
famous piece of jewelry,

1207
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:00,824
the fabulous Baseball Diamond?

1208
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,574
As from Monday,
the fabulous Baseball Diamond

1209
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:06,372
will go on permanent display
at the Mallory Gallery.

1210
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,870
I shall never have it
either on my person

1211
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,952
or in my possession again.

1212
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:12,833
That's right.
It'll be in our possession.

1213
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:15,006
Tuesday at midnight
we'll go to the Mallory Gallery.

1214
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,049
The Baseball Diamond will be ours.

1215
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:23,138
<i>So there I was,
backstage under a table.</i>

1216
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:27,177
<i>I was doing a little
photographic essay on kneecaps,</i>

1217
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,558
and I heard 'em planning
to steal the Baseball Diamond.

1218
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:31,855
Bummer.

1219
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,650
- So what's the plan, man?
- I already told you.

1220
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,978
Tuesday, midnight,
at the Mallory Gallery.

1221
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:38,688
That's all I know.

1222
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,648
You mean they're really gonna
try to steal the diamond?

1223
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,166
Quiet!

1224
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:53,920
"Look, Mother,
it's my life, okay?

1225
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:56,839
"So if I want to live on a beach
and walk around naked..."

1226
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:58,958
Oh.

1227
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,965
Now, if we wanna get
Miss Piggy out of jail,

1228
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,172
we're gonna have to catch
those thieves red-handed.

1229
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,847
Yes, Beau?

1230
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,592
What color are their hands now?

1231
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,764
Now, we're about to embark
on a potentially dangerous mission.

1232
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:16,351
There could be physical violence,
there could be gunplay,

1233
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,903
and there's a slightest chance
that somebody might even get killed.

1234
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:21,606
So if anybody wants out,
now is the time to say it.

1235
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,279
- I'm out.
- Me, too.

1236
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:25,655
- Ditto.
- Meep.

1237
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,573
Don't we have a gig around here,
or something or somewhere?

1238
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,783
Yeah, sorry.
I got a dental appointment.

1239
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:34,289
- It's like this, Kermit.
- I have to go to work all day.

1240
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,590
Hold it!

1241
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,054
Shame on you.

1242
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,717
I thought we were
in this thing together.

1243
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:54,140
I'm just as scared as you are,
but this has to be done.

1244
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:58,230
We don't want the bad guys to win.

1245
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:02,902
We've got to do
this for justice.

1246
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,482
For freedom.

1247
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,488
For honesty.

1248
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:11,114
Boy, do I feel ashamed.

1249
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:14,041
Me, too. I feel like two cents.

1250
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,295
- I'm back in.
- You can count on me.

1251
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:20,294
Oh, hey, I was only joking.

1252
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:23,798
Yeah, it'll be a lot of fun
to go out there and risk our lives.

1253
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:25,966
- Yeah!
- All for one and one for all.

1254
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,297
Yeah!

1255
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,930
At times like this
I am proud to be an American.

1256
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,055
Hmm.

1257
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:36,223
Thank you. I knew I could count
on each and every one of you.

1258
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,812
Fozzie, are you okay?

1259
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:42,023
That took a lot out of me.

1260
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:45,698
Okay. Now we don't have any time
to waste, so everybody gather 'round.

1261
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:48,572
And the first thing we have
to do is make our plans.

1262
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:50,741
- Right.
- Whoa!

1263
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:54,247
Or we could get some sleep.

1264
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,850
Miss Piggy?

1265
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:13,926
What?

1266
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,266
Your lawyer is here to see you.

1267
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:19,182
Lawyer?
I don't have a lawyer.

1268
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:22,269
Ah, sure you do. Little green guy.

1269
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:26,402
Kermie! Oh! No wonder
he hasn't come by to see me.

1270
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,232
He had to finish law school.

1271
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,162
Oh, Kermit! Oh!

1272
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:43,043
Two minutes, pig.

1273
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,800
Oh, Kermie.
Oh, I've missed you so.

1274
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,253
Please.
The name is Rosenthal.

1275
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:52,257
I'm your attorney. That's the only way
they'd let me in here.

1276
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,300
Oh, right.

1277
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:59,139
Oh, I've missed you so... Rosenthal.
It's been an eternity.

1278
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:01,437
It's been 45 minutes.

1279
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:04,189
Time goes slow in the cooler.

1280
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,737
Well, I just want you to know
that we're gonna get you out of here,

1281
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:09,031
'cause we're gonna catch
those thieves red-handed.

1282
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:11,234
What color are their hands now?

1283
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:14,912
I don't think this is the time
for that type of humor.

1284
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,405
When you're in stir

1285
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:19,163
you take the laughs
when you can get 'em, Rosenthal.

1286
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:21,790
Yeah, well, anyway,
just stay put

1287
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:24,713
because we've got a plan
and we're gonna prove you're innocent.

1288
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:28,259
You see, tomorrow night,
precisely at midnight,

1289
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:31,588
those thieves are gonna try to steal
Lady Holiday's Baseball Diamond

1290
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:32,887
from the Mallory Gallery.

1291
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:36,183
- And we're gonna stop 'em.
- Oh, Kermit, be careful.

1292
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:38,686
Don't worry because
I've got Gonzo and Fozzie

1293
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,230
and all our friends from
the Happiness Hotel to help.

1294
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,024
- Those clowns?
- Mmm-hmm.

1295
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:46,519
Great. I'll be stuck
in the big house for life.

1296
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,780
"Big house"?
Is that prison talk?

1297
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:53,117
Yeah, "big house,"
"squealer," "slammer."

1298
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:55,536
That's the lingo
we use here in the joint.

1299
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:59,370
Yeah. Well, you may
talk tough, Miss Piggy,

1300
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,201
but underneath I know
you're still the same beautiful,

1301
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:05,128
sensitive, vulnerable woman
I was out with the other night.

1302
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,836
The one who scarfed down
all that caviar.

1303
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,211
You have such a
way with words.

1304
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,763
I love you, Rosenthal.

1305
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,571
You're wearing my mustache.

1306
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:37,494
Yeah, well, you have
mesh marks on your face.

1307
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,504
- Glass cutter?
- Check.

1308
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:53,052
- Nylon rope?
- Check.

1309
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:55,676
- Computer deprogrammer?
- Check.

1310
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:57,756
- Stopwatch?
- Check.

1311
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,013
- Pocket laser?
- Check.

1312
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,686
- Infrared reflex?
- Check.

1313
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,263
- Portable detonator?
- Check.

1314
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:08,025
- Whoopee cushion?
- I think it's in the bus.

1315
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,320
- Rubber raft?
- it's got holes in it.

1316
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,527
Bag of chickens?

1317
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,197
- Fake vomit?
- it's on order.

1318
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:20,572
- Frisbee?
- Oh, uh, lost.

1319
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,664
- Pneumatic drill?
- Check.

1320
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,663
- Computer printout?
- Check.

1321
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:26,790
- Radar gun?
- Check.

1322
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:28,246
- Walkie-talkies?
- Check.

1323
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:45,931
- Wax lips?
- Man, I just had 'em.

1324
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:47,481
Did you leave them
in your other pants?

1325
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,400
I don't have no other pants.

1326
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,774
- Yoyo?
- For sure.

1327
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,030
- Harpoon gun?
- That's you.

1328
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:57,904
Check.

1329
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,281
All right, team.

1330
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,079
Let's go for it.

1331
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,699
- Peanut butter?
- Animal ate it.

1332
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:07,831
Sorry.

1333
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:11,835
Well, Kermit, I guess that's it.

1334
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,084
All right, everybody.

1335
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,919
Let's go for it.

1336
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:36,443
Go for it!

1337
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:52,268
Beauregard.

1338
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:53,770
Back it up here.

1339
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:57,979
Shh. Shh.

1340
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,780
- Okay. Quiet.
- Shh!

1341
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:03,609
Okay. You guys
all got your disguises in place?

1342
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:05,281
Shh.

1343
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:08,243
Wow.

1344
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,786
Oh!

1345
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,064
- Wow!
- Shh.

1346
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,688
- I'm taking a picture.
- Shh.

1347
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:38,610
Rowlf, hand me the blowtorch.

1348
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:40,904
Blowtorch?
Who said anything about a blowtorch?

1349
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:42,902
I got some paper towels.

1350
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:45,029
How are we supposed
to cut through the bars

1351
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:46,361
if nobody brought stuff to cut with?

1352
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:49,822
I brought some hot mustard.
Maybe that'll eat through the bars.

1353
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,498
Eat through the bars!

1354
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,450
- Animal?
- What?

1355
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:56,663
Hey. Why don't you see if you can
eat through these iron bars.

1356
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,624
Eat through bars.

1357
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,394
Goggy!

1358
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,016
The cops!

1359
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:22,063
Do you know where Lady Holiday's
Baseball Diamond is being kept?

1360
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:25,863
Funnily enough, I do.
It's at the Mallory Gallery,

1361
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,285
a virtually impregnable fortress,

1362
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,613
- many miles from here.
- Oh.

1363
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,573
I only have a half
an hour to get there.

1364
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:34,658
On foot? You'll never make it.

1365
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,748
I know. How about a ride?

1366
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,628
You can read, I presume?

1367
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:44,719
Oh, couldn't you
make an exception for little old moi?

1368
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:47,721
Not even for little old vous.

1369
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,134
- Pretty please?
- No!

1370
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,139
I've tried to be nice.

1371
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:56,013
- Huh?
- Hi-yah!

1372
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,403
Hey.

1373
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,397
What's all the racket?

1374
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:07,449
What are you doing here?

1375
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:09,151
A very brief cameo.

1376
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:11,574
Me, too.

1377
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:42,727
Breaker one, this is Hamhock.
Do you read me'?

1378
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:44,277
<i>Loud and clear, Hamhock.</i>

1379
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:47,027
<i>This is Dirty Bird.
What's your 20, over?</i>

1380
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:49,608
Well, good buddy,
we're westbound out of Highgate.

1381
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:51,864
Any smokies between me
and Blimeytown?

1382
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:54,823
<i>Negatory, Hamhock.
You're free and clear.</i>

1383
01:23:54,905 --> 01:23:56,953
Ten-four, Dirty Bird. Much obliged.

1384
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:59,455
We got the hammer down
and we gone.

1385
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:04,214
I never ordered no pepperoni.

1386
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:07,213
It's right here on the slip.
Medium pepperoni with double cheese.

1387
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:09,090
That'sa right.
We don'ta make them,

1388
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:10,716
- we justa deliver them.
- Mmm-hmm.

1389
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:13,219
Somebody here called
Pizza Twins, and that's us.

1390
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,304
What's the name on that slip?

1391
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:18,478
Uh...

1392
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:22,433
- What's your name?
- Henderson.

1393
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:25,978
- That's it! That's the name on the slip.
- Ah.

1394
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:27,479
Uh...

1395
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:31,233
- But I hate pepperoni.
- I'll eat it.

1396
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,490
- Stand by, guys.
- Right!

1397
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:38,665
Ooh.

1398
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,003
'Ere. Just one moment.

1399
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:46,749
Can I see that slip?

1400
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:47,966
Uh...

1401
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,260
Uh, Well...

1402
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,429
Actually, this is the wrong slip.

1403
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:55,223
That slip, sir,
you said it had my name on it.

1404
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:57,176
Oh, thata slip.

1405
01:24:57,259 --> 01:24:59,762
Uh, uh, uh, thata slip we left at home.

1406
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:02,394
But we gota the pepperoni.

1407
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:04,770
- But I hate pepperoni.
- Hate pepperoni. Right.

1408
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,319
How about you could
feed it to the dogs?

1409
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:09,362
Oh, yes. That'sa right.
Here, sir.

1410
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,406
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.

1411
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:12,482
Thank you very much, sir.

1412
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,591
What am I?
A glutton for punishment?

1413
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,142
- Hey, Fozzie...
- Shh!

1414
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:45,223
Fozzie,
how do we get in?

1415
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:47,685
Why don't we just ring the doorbell?

1416
01:25:47,768 --> 01:25:49,770
No, no, no. There's
got to be another way.

1417
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:51,480
Well, you'd better
think of it pretty quick.

1418
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:53,565
Those dogs have nearly
finished the pizza.

1419
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:55,905
I know. The roof.

1420
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:59,322
Oh, man.
No way we'll ever get up there.

1421
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:33,529
Phew.

1422
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:36,279
So far I'm not having any fun.

1423
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:37,860
Let me talk to 'em.

1424
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,112
Woof woof.
Woof woof.

1425
01:26:45,409 --> 01:26:47,036
it helps to know
a second language.

1426
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,252
It's nearly midnight.

1427
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:52,628
What am I going to do?

1428
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,053
Hey! Hey, you! Hey!

1429
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,899
What an unbelievable coincidence.

1430
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,538
Now, this window probably
has an alarm system on it.

1431
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,169
Ah, my assistant Beaker
will check it out.

1432
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,000
Go on, Beaker.

1433
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:54,190
Very good, Beaker.
Now it's perfectly safe.

1434
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:57,193
Oh, good.
Animal, do your stuff.

1435
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:06,703
Sorry.

1436
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,632
There it is.
The fabulous Baseball Diamond.

1437
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:24,265
How are we
gonna get down there?

1438
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:26,139
I suggest we jump.

1439
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:28,687
Are you crazy?
That's about a hundred feet.

1440
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:31,185
I didn't say it was
a good suggestion.

1441
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:33,562
Maybe we could jump partway.

1442
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,526
Oh, boy, what do we do now?

1443
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:45,738
We're just gonna have to go down there
and catch those thieves red-handed.

1444
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:48,074
What color are their hands now?

1445
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:01,504
We'll just have to improvise.

1446
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,680
We'll make a ladder out of
whatever will hold us.

1447
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:06,850
Good idea. Here's the paper towels.

1448
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:11,931
I'm coming, Kermie!

1449
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:20,447
Well, you wanted excitement.

1450
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:17,287
Excuse me, I don't think
that belongs to you.

1451
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:24,003
Say cheese!

1452
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,675
Woman!

1453
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:31,226
Hey, nice catch, Animal.

1454
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:35,021
- Heads up, Lew.
- Over here, Rowlf! Yeah, got it!

1455
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:37,019
Hot potato! Keep away.
Here we go.

1456
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:42,612
I got it. Thank you.
Be careful, guys.

1457
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,360
Catch it. Get him!

1458
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,278
Still got a good eye.

1459
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:52,615
Welcome to the wild world
of Muppet sports.

1460
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:55,120
This is Louis Kazagger
with a play-by-play

1461
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,372
- of the game.
- Woman!

1462
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:59,330
And it looks like ladies' night
here at the gallery.

1463
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:02,211
- Peekaboo.
- Hey! Ba-ba-do-be-bop.

1464
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,551
Okay. Here she comes, boy!

1465
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:16,354
Hey, way to chuck,
way to look, way to move!

1466
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:19,399
Popcorn, popcorn.
Get your red-hot popcorn.

1467
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:28,282
Popcorn, chicken?

1468
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:31,282
Woman!

1469
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:34,414
Woman!

1470
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:36,499
Okay, okay.

1471
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:38,918
Lew Zealand leads off the order
as we join the game.

1472
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:40,078
Whoa!

1473
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:43,081
Chuck it to me, Beakie baby.

1474
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:44,507
Pitchy witchy, Beaker.

1475
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:47,301
Pitcher, you couldn't hit
the broad side of a barn!

1476
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,429
Picture of the pitcher.

1477
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:51,256
Wait for what you want, Lew, baby.

1478
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:53,308
Rah, rah, rah!

1479
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:55,098
Beaker goes into the windup.

1480
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:57,520
It's the pitch.

1481
01:31:57,929 --> 01:32:00,478
It's a high fly ball to Kermit the Frog.

1482
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:03,936
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1483
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:06,734
Hey, gimme that diamond,
you crook.

1484
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:10,157
Come on, guys. Get him.

1485
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:12,110
- All right. Back off!
- Ooh!

1486
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:15,363
But, Nicky, why are you doing this?

1487
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,576
Why am I doing this? Because
I'm a villain. It's pure and simple.

1488
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:22,333
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Holiday, sir.
Would you let Kermit go?

1489
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:24,631
If you hold him too long
he'll just give you warts.

1490
01:32:24,748 --> 01:32:26,341
Oh, no. He's coming with us.

1491
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:28,089
Come on, girls. Let's get out of here.

1492
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:50,739
Hi-yah!

1493
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,117
Hi-yah!

1494
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:01,121
- Hi-yah!
- Ow!

1495
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,332
Watch out!

1496
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:04,583
Miss Piggy!

1497
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,505
Yeah! Way to go!

1498
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:10,092
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1499
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,193
Bye-bye.

1500
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:33,359
- You were magnificent, Miss Piggy.
- I did it all for you.

1501
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:34,818
- Could I have just a moment?
- Oh, thank you.

1502
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:36,278
<i>Por nada.</i>

1503
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:38,325
Oh.

1504
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:42,041
- I really did care for you, you know.
- I know.

1505
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:44,620
We could've had the world
on a silver platter.

1506
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:47,752
That silver's turned to iron bars,
Nicky.

1507
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:49,674
Don't hate me,
Miss Piggy.

1508
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:53,504
Oh, I don't. It's just that
somehow along the road

1509
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:55,884
I found out the difference
between wrong and right.

1510
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:58,345
You're wrong...

1511
01:33:58,424 --> 01:33:59,892
He's right.

1512
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:06,608
Huh.
Would you believe it, Statler?

1513
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:09,648
They're heroes.
Now they're gonna be obnoxious.

1514
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:12,697
So what else is new?

1515
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:15,150
Well, I say all's well that ends well.

1516
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:17,486
<i>It doesn't matter to me
as long as it ends.</i>

1517
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:28,045
it was nice of The Chronicle
to pay for our flight home.

1518
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:31,625
Yeah, but a man should be
treated better than his luggage.

1519
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:34,336
Yeah, well, my luggage
was sucked out the door.

1520
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:36,421
Luckily my radio's frozen to my wrist.

1521
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:41,055
Okay, guys.
Everybody out for the USA.

1522
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:43,353
Oh, boy. How close are we?

1523
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:45,726
Oh, about 30,000 feet.

1524
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:47,432
- You mean...
- Yup.

1525
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:49,984
Happy landing!

1526
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:52,649
Whoa!

1527
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:55,524
Come on, carrot top.

1528
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:11,164
<i>- We've had comedy

1532
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:25,433

1534

1535
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:30,725
Oh, Kermie!

1536
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:32,276

<i>The first time it happens, you know</i>

1554
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:46,969
<i>And so you fall</i>

1555
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:50,476
<i>And how complete it is</i>

1556
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:55,106
<i>And for each moment that it lasts</i>

1557
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:58,529
<i>How sweet it is</i>

1558
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:41,948
Wait a minute!
Wait! Hold it right there.

1559
01:37:42,065 --> 01:37:43,942
Don't go home yet.

1560
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:45,947
Say cheese.

1561
01:37:48,237 --> 01:37:49,534
<i>I'll send you each a copy.</i>
