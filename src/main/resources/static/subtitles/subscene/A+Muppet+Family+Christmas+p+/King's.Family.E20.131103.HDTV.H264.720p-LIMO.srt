2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,950
I think I've seen him before.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,025
Where?

4
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:09,550
I can't remember.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,125
Stop staring at him like that.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,700
Let me introduce my family.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,300
Gwangbak, I'll do it. I know how it's done.

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,700
This is the eldest member of the family

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,000
and my best buddy's mother, Mrs. Angyesim.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,975
She fled to the south during the Korean War,

11
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:33,675
and whenever something happens, she goes,

12
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:37,225
"The Korean War was nothing compared to this."

13
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:38,825
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

14
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,575
Let's here from the original. Mom?

15
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:45,125
Why you little!

16
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,800
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,850
I should just die.
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

18
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,950
Next is the center of this family, father.

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,750
He says "What?" all the time and gets on

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,050
mother's nerves, but he always puts himself

21
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,725
in other's shoes, and he's a well respected

22
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:08,375
member of this community!

23
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:10,500
What is he doing?

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,500
It's funny.

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,775
She says she's never seen son in laws like us and keeps teasing us.

26
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,150
Such a tease!

27
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,100
What?

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,900
They say that in a comedy show.

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,050
The one who's always nagging on us, mother!

30
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,700
And she doesn't have any dollar undies.

31
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,075
I can't believe my ears!

32
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:37,850
Okay! Next is

33
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,675
the man who used to live in a huge apartment

34
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,575
but is now living with his in laws, Mr. Ko!

35
00:01:46,575 --> 00:01:49,275
As you can see, our eyes are,

36
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:53,850
the son in laws here have bulging eyes,

37
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,275
so you have a long way to go.

38
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:02,225
You should keep smacking the back of your head.

39
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,450
I'll try my best.

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,400
The eldest daughter of this family.

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,150
I was in the Miss Korea pageant.

42
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,725
And she hasn't forgotten that experience.

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,400
Next is the second son in law,

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,350
and that's me.

45
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,225
You're not next.

46
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,300
I know.

47
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,500
Hello?

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,200
Can you deliver the next person in line?

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,300
Yes! The man just arrived!

50
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,775
My best friend since middle school.

51
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:38,775
No way.

52
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:42,850
"I know" is what this man says most often,

53
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,850
and he's the kangaroo of this family.

54
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,350
A penniless loser, Wang Don!

55
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:51,975
And you're a goof-off!

56
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:55,500
This is nutty, nutty, nuts!

57
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,700
The 7th person of this family, not me,

58
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,300
because I'm younger than Ms. Wang Hobak.

59
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,350
Ms. Scrooge.

60
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,600
A self made woman.

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,000
She has no special charms.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,200
She does.

63
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,225
I'm sorry, but I'll ignore that.

64
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:24,200
And the third daughter of this family!

65
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,525
The woman of the night, Wang Gwangbak!

66
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,125
She was a teacher until recently, but she quit in order to achieve her dream

67
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:38,175
which led to endless nagging by mother

68
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:43,850
and has turned her into a kangaroo, Gwangbak!

69
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,275
Yes, yes, yes.

70
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:49,175
Even the applause sounds different as she is the woman of the hour.

71
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,775
Next is Wang Haebak who needs no description.

72
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:56,350
She's at the top of her entire student body.

73
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,725
What do you want to become?

74
00:03:57,725 --> 00:04:01,750
Yes, she's going to become a judge.

75
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,725
Oh! The college entrance exam is near.

76
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:06,450
Is everything going okay?

77
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,975
Keep up the good work.

78
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:10,875
I want a professional in the family.

79
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:15,175
Let me introduce myself.

80
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:16,625
What about me?

81
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,725
Oh! How could you forget him?

82
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:25,875
Where are you?
 Why aren't you replying?

83
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,875
Oh, my mistake.

84
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,275
No explanation is necessary.

85
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:33,875
Father and mother had him on an impulse.

86
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,500
This family's youngest child, Wang Daebak.

87
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,275
Incredible.

88
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:43,600
And finally, I might be

89
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,400
dark skinned and have bulging eyes,

90
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,900
but I'm the rising sun

91
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,150
because I just got a new set of wings

92
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,500
and is about to soar.

93
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,950
I went from just Sedal to "my Sedal,"

94
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,950
a Cinderella of all son in laws,

95
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,150
Heo Sedal.

96
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:14,150
I told you I'm at my in laws house.

97
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,475
It's not like I wanted to come.

98
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:19,675
I didn't want to cause any trouble.

99
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:20,600
Baby,

100
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,525
I'm here, but in spirit, I'm with you.

101
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,700
Yes.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,300
Thank you so much for welcoming me.

103
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
I never met you before,

104
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,725
but I feel like I'm already a member.

105
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:40,125
It's a big family, so the introduction ran long.

106
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,125
What do you do?

107
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,875
I'm a heavy equipment operator.

108
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,000
Things like excavators and bulldozers.

109
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,525
Heavy equipment operator?

110
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:51,150
He owns his own company.

111
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,150
You're so young!

112
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,075
I know.

113
00:05:54,075 --> 00:05:56,050
I didn't build the company.

114
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,375
My father built it and I expanded it.

115
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,500
And my father built his own fortune.

116
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,925
How much do you make a year?

117
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:07,100
It's different every year, so I can't...

118
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,675
But I make a decent earning.

119
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:11,675
That's not enough.

120
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:14,700
You should travel and buy expensive bags.

121
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,575
I make enough money for that.

122
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,125
You do?

123
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,100
You're lucky, Gwangbak.

124
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,025
Where would you live after you're married?

125
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:28,200
Will you buy an apartment?

126
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
He runs his own company, so of course.

127
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,150
Well...

128
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,775
We'll be living with his father.

129
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:38,425
There's no other family, and his house is big, so we can use the second floor.

130
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,725
Where's your mother, then?

131
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:43,225
It's just my father.

132
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:45,325
What kind of car do you drive?

133
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:46,350
I drive a truck.

134
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,125
He has a sports car, too.

135
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,950
What kind of sports car?

136
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,375
Everyone has a car, so we need to know.

137
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,125
It's not a very expensive one.

138
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,925
I used to have a luxury car, too.

139
00:06:58,925 --> 00:07:02,450
But it's all in the past.

140
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,750
What did you like about Gwangbak?

141
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,550
I never told her this before,

142
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,675
but I fell in love with her at first sight.

143
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:14,500
Incredible.

144
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,625
No way.

145
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,550
How romantic.

146
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,175
After meeting her a few times,

147
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:21,100
I loved everything about her.

148
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,350
Those are some really colorful words.

149
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,925
You should be honest.

150
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:28,175
Can I have one of those?

151
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,400
Has your mother passed away?

152
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:35,200
My parents are divorced.

153
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,725
They are? When?

154
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:40,150
When I was in third grade.

155
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,100
Your father never remarried?

156
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,475
No.

157
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:49,975
They struggled a lot, but now they're like friends.

158
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,475
And his aunt has been running the house.

159
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:56,350
That's one thing I don't like.

160
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,900
People get divorced all the time.

161
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,650
Like marriage, divorce is a choice.

162
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,650
That's so irresponsible!

163
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,575
It's better than being unhappily married.

164
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:08,075
But divorce shouldn't be taken lightly.

165
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,375
But it was his parents.

166
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,375
Why did they divorce?

167
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,450
Did your father have an affair?

168
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,500
No, he didn't.

169
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,550
I heard it was because of financial difficulties.

170
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:23,600
Where did you go to school?

171
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,150
Excuse me?

172
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,900
I'm hungry. Can we have dinner?

173
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,850
Yes, I'm starving.

174
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,475
Let's get dinner ready.

175
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,300
Did you study abroad?

176
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,375
Actually,

177
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:44,900
I didn't go to college.

178
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,850
You didn't go to college?

179
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,700
No.

180
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,225
I dropped out of high school.

181
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:03,050
So you only have a middle school diploma?

182
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,725
You promised you wouldn't say.

183
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:25,725
I couldn't help it.

184
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:28,375
And I didn't want to lie.

185
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,225
What should we do?

186
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:35,375
They all looked really surprised.

187
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:39,075
Even my underclothes are soaked.

188
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,075
I've never been so scared and nervous before.

189
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,800
They'll say no, right?

190
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,100
If

191
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:55,225
they say no,

192
00:09:56,575 --> 00:10:01,050
we couldn't marry, could we?

193
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,450
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

194
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,075
A middle school graduate?

195
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:13,175
She has no taste in men!

196
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,475
I don't like that his parents are divorced.

197
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:18,725
I know.

198
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:20,925
He said it was from financial reasons,

199
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:23,550
but who knows what really happened?

200
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,900
Maybe his father was caught cheating, 
or maybe his mom was into gambling.

201
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,625
Getting divorced isn't a big deal now.

202
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:37,775
If that's true, why do unhappy women stay married until their children are married?

203
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,850
You have to consider the family, too.

204
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,500
I think that's important, too.

205
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,975
But he seemed pretty rich.

206
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:48,975
But money isn't everything.

207
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:50,650
Bong, what do you think?

208
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,750
I'm sure he feels the same way.

209
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:58,225
I don't know about the other things,

210
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,400
but his education is a problem.

211
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,375
Education based social system is a problem,

212
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,950
but middle school? How do you communicate?

213
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,175
That's not true.

214
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:10,025
I never felt any educational gap.

215
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:12,575
And he finished his junior year in high school.

216
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,250
He dropped out during summer vacation.

217
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,050
But everyone goes to college these days.
Why did he drop out?

218
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,350
Number 1, he was a bad student.

219
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,025
Number 2, he was a trouble maker.

220
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:26,925
Number 3...

221
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,475
He bought an excavator with college tuition and started working really early.

222
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,050
And that's how he built his company up.

223
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:39,625
It's much better than being unemployed even with a college degree.

224
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,600
Did you say that to us?

225
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,700
Us?

226
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,775
Don't drag me into it.

227
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:46,950
I don't believe you!

228
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,525
- I'll have to kill you.
- Mom! Mom.

229
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:52,750
How could you bring a man like that home?

230
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,450
All my efforts went down the drain!

231
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,600
You saved yourself all these years to meet a man like him?

232
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,550
A middle school graduate excavator operator?

233
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,575
How could you disappoint me like this?

234
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:11,150
How could you bring someone like that?

235
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,425
Are you out of your mind?

236
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:16,775
I had high hopes for you!

237
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:19,150
I wanted you to meet a doctor or a judge!

238
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,750
How could you meet someone like him?

239
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,975
Get out of my house!

240
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,400
I know what you're worried about,

241
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,375
but I love him as he is.

242
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,575
Despite his parents, he's a good man,

243
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:42,775
and I never thought about his education because he's smart and wise.

244
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,950
In my opinion, he's a great man.

245
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,750
I hope you'll respect my decision.

246
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,625
Why are you so quiet?

247
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,225
Does this even make sense?

248
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:19,350
Don't even think about saying yes.

249
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,375
Come down to the kitchen.

250
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,950
I'm sorry, father.

251
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,175
You don't have to be.

252
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,500
And there's no sense in dragging this on.

253
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:50,600
Before it becomes too serious,

254
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,100
I thought I'd tell you how I feel.

255
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,825
Father.

256
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:58,975
The final decision is yours, of course,

257
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:01,875
and to be frank, you two could get married.

258
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,500
It's not like it's against the law.

259
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:06,375
But as your father,

260
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:09,550
I can't say yes to this marriage.

261
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:13,900
You're getting a life partner.

262
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
A marriage isn't something

263
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,650
that's based on sparks between two people.

264
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:22,625
It's a major event in a person's life,

265
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,250
so you must look at everything.

266
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:32,025
What if he suffered some sort of trauma after his parents divorce?

267
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,275
And,

268
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:36,950
I'm not comfortable with his education.

269
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,200
Having skills is a good thing,

270
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:44,450
and I have a friend who's in that field.

271
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,600
It's a good job for a man,

272
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,850
and you don't have to worry about retiring.

273
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:53,225
But education is another matter.

274
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,400
I didn't know before he told me, father.

275
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,075
I never had trouble talking to him.

276
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:04,075
I actually learned a lot from him.

277
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:07,425
He read lots of books to overcome it,

278
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:12,600
and he grew up to be a really decent guy.

279
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,850
Father, what college he attended isn't important compared to how he's lived.

280
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,025
The size of his house isn't important compared to how great his character is.

281
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,875
Those things are more important to me.

282
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:29,175
Not having a college degree isn't a problem.

283
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,775
I'm not talking about the degree.

284
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,700
They don't just teach knowledge at school.

285
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,775
Why do you think people attend 16 years of school?

286
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,200
If it's just for the knowledge,

287
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,900
everyone can study alone and take exams.

288
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,425
Why would you bother to go to school?

289
00:15:53,425 --> 00:15:55,600
Including knowledge,

290
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,850
you learn about life.

291
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,975
School gives you various experiences.

292
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:06,975
It may not be a problem now,

293
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:09,525
but later on, it could become one.

294
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,300
I wish

295
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,975
you would change your mind.

296
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,825
Before it's too late.

297
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,375
Can we talk?

298
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,500
You're still up?

299
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:01,850
I'm not sleepy at all.

300
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,900
It's like I'm waiting for my scores after a test.

301
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,200
What happened?
What did your parents say?

302
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,500
I bet there was a debate after I left.

303
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,100
Be honest with me.

304
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
What score did I get?

305
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,350
You flunked, of course.

306
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,250
I flunked?

307
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,675
I didn't pass?

308
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:29,650
We have to break up now?

309
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,375
Well...

310
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,025
Be honest with me.

311
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:36,325
Is that it?

312
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,625
No.

313
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,925
I was just kidding.

314
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:43,850
Passed!

315
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,225
You passed.

316
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:46,550
Really?

317
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,225
I really passed?

318
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,850
Really?

319
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,700
I passed!

320
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:00,850
Aunt!

321
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:04,450
Aunt!

322
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:08,750
She said I passed.

323
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,950
Really?

324
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,425
Can you whip something up?
Let's celebrate.

325
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:17,950
Why did you wake me up?

326
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,200
Have a seat, Daese.

327
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,375
Sangnam has something to tell you.

328
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,375
Okay. Go ahead.

329
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:27,225
Congratulations, father.

330
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:29,600
You're getting a daughter in law.

331
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,350
What?

332
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,900
You're awake now, aren't you?

333
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,150
I am!

334
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,675
Who is it? Bring her right now! Right now!

335
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:38,675
Wait until tomorrow.

336
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,325
I actually met her.

337
00:18:41,325 --> 00:18:43,500
What? Without tell me?

338
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,175
It was like a pre-interview.

339
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:48,475
They do that before the main interview.

340
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:50,600
So? How was she?

341
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,375
She's perfect for Sangnam.

342
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,400
Sangnam told her he's poor, he dropped out

343
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,950
of school and has to live with his father,

344
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,325
and she still said yes.

345
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:03,400
She's a good woman.

346
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,425
Just the type I was looking for.

347
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,100
When did you meet her?

348
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,625
Uh, that's the odd part.

349
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,975
You know her, too.

350
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:15,125
The freelance reporter who interviewed me.

351
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,525
I thought she wasn't your type.

352
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:19,175
But I knew it.

353
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:21,450
I knew it from the way you drank that night.

354
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,025
I want to meet her parents.

355
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:27,100
You should meet her first.

356
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,775
Should I bring her this weekend?

357
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:29,925
This weekend?

358
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:31,525
Okay.

359
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:33,775
If you like her and if you like her,

360
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:35,775
I'm okay with her.

361
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:42,125
I can't understand the parents who oppose their children's marriage.

362
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,775
Can you get me a grandchild first?

363
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:48,500
Father!

364
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,875
Okay!

365
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,950
For my future daughter in law!

366
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,075
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

367
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,625
Subak!

368
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,900
You got here in a cab?

369
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,100
You could've taken the subway.

370
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,350
I can't do that on my first day.

371
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,700
That would look bad.

372
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,200
Where's your CEO?

373
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,025
The CEO?

374
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:32,600
I should say hello.

375
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
You don't need to do that yet.

376
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,450
Where's the shop?
I hope it's in downtown.

377
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,400
I don't deal with just anyone.

378
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,850
I want to go to Cheongdam or Apgujeong.

379
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,850
I was in the Miss Korea pageant, you know.

380
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,600
You need to be trained first.

381
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,050
I hate stuff like that.

382
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,300
I hate studying or training.

383
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,750
I couldn't stand studying, even as a student.

384
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,575
You already know that!

385
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:55,575
Can I just skip training?

386
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:59,425
If you don't want any training...

387
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,700
Follow me.

388
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,225
But your outfit is...

389
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:05,750
What?

390
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,450
That looks uncomfortable.

391
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,825
I was in the Miss Korea pageant.

392
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:11,825
I have class.

393
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:22,850
You can work here for today.

394
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,575
What am I supposed to do here?

395
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,250
They're all experienced, so learn from them.

396
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:31,025
She's new, so please work with her.

397
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:32,875
- Okay, manager.
- Yes, director.

398
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,875
Hey, Hobak!

399
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,875
Lady!

400
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,850
Me?

401
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,575
Is there anyone else standing there?

402
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:45,300
How do you expect to work in that?

403
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,125
We have to sort these and clean this room.

404
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,800
- Put this on. 
- Oh, my!

405
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,725
I'm not putting that on.

406
00:21:55,725 --> 00:21:59,000
Move all of these over there.

407
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:08,800
She's getting the same pay as us.

408
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,575
Where did they find her?

409
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:13,125
It's her first day, so go easy on her.

410
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,375
Give it to me.

411
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,800
Oh, my! Oh, my!
What are you doing?

412
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,600
Oh, my! Oh, my!

413
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,950
Are you okay?

414
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:26,150
Oh, man! I don't...

415
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:30,325
Move to a shop?

416
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:32,900
Yes, you've been here for a long time.

417
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,975
Thank you for all your hard work.

418
00:22:35,675 --> 00:22:38,525
The position is the same but with more pay.

419
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,650
Thank you, director.

420
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,025
I love money.

421
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:44,700
Who doesn't?

422
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,425
I'm more extreme.

423
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:48,400
I think I'm addicted to money.

424
00:22:50,975 --> 00:22:53,500
You'll be in charge of the biggest shop

425
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,275
and a few smaller ones, too.

426
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:59,625
Your work hours will be more flexible.

427
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,325
You have kids, right?

428
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:02,825
Really?

429
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:05,800
Thank you so much!

430
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,850
You have a driver's license, don't you?

431
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,700
You'll need a car.

432
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,675
I can't afford one yet.

433
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:14,350
The company will pitch in.

434
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,525
You need mobility to manage the shops.

435
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:19,025
Thank you, director.

436
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,525
Thank you so much.

437
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,850
Mom, are we going somewhere?

438
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,975
No.

439
00:23:34,975 --> 00:23:36,925
I want to take a picture of you.

440
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:38,250
What for?

441
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,025
So I can look at it whenever I want.

442
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:43,100
Miho,

443
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,425
give me a big smile.

444
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,275
Oh, Miho, you're so pretty.

445
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:51,900
Look over there.

446
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,850
Can we stop? I think that's enough.

447
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,850
Stay still.

448
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,300
Now for a video.

449
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:07,150
Let's go eat.

450
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,400
Hey,

451
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,775
pretty lady.

452
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:11,350
Come with us.

453
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,825
We need to get pork rinds to wipe the dust off.

454
00:24:15,825 --> 00:24:17,300
Pork rinds?

455
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,650
Of course.

456
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,050
Pork rinds and a shot of soju.

457
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,675
I can't eat stuff like that.

458
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:26,425
You look like you can eat anything.

459
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:29,125
Let's just leave her here. I'm starving.

460
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,850
Come with us, okay?

461
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:34,250
Oh, my!

462
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,400
I don't believe this!

463
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:40,175
Oh!

464
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:09,325
Hey, Subak.

465
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:10,850
Where are you?

466
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,250
How could you leave me here all alone?

467
00:25:14,325 --> 00:25:16,000
Why are you alone?

468
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,825
Okay. I'll be right over.

469
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:24,775
How could you do this to me?

470
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:26,125
How dare you!

471
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:29,275
How could you get me a job like this?

472
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:30,600
I thought it was at a shop!

473
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,975
I was in the Miss Korea pageant!

474
00:25:32,975 --> 00:25:35,125
You said you didn't want to train.

475
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,650
You need training to work at the shop.

476
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,200
But you're a manager!

477
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,425
Why can't you use your influence?

478
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:43,425
Did you do this to me on purpose?

479
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:48,000
Some man was trying to hit on me.

480
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:50,275
He did?

481
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,400
Whenever he saw me, he winked at me.

482
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,425
How could you put me through that?

483
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,075
He twitches.

484
00:26:02,075 --> 00:26:06,175
He does that.

485
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:09,375
He does?

486
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:14,500
You said you wanted to see our daughter.

487
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
You have pictures?

488
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,050
I have a few.

489
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,450
Look.

490
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,300
She's our daughter.

491
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:36,350
She's pretty.

492
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,925
She looks just like you.

493
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:43,100
You think she's pretty?

494
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,350
Yes.

495
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,825
She is.

496
00:27:08,775 --> 00:27:10,000
Good sho...

497
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,550
What's wrong with that ball?

498
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,225
It won't go where it's supposed to.

499
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:18,450
You should teach that ball a lesson, and me.

500
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,200
Baby, I'm sorry.

501
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,375
What are you up to these days?

502
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,475
I'm in a difficult situation.

503
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:29,875
It's hard to keep my in laws away from you.

504
00:27:31,575 --> 00:27:33,375
Should we go on a trip?

505
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,725
A trip?

506
00:27:35,475 --> 00:27:36,350
Where?

507
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,675
Wherever.

508
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:40,375
Somewhere nobody can reach us.

509
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:41,700
I'm concerned.

510
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:45,225
You went to work today? How was it?

511
00:27:45,225 --> 00:27:48,125
She quit right away.

512
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,400
What?

513
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,100
She took me to a warehouse

514
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,675
and told me to clean it.

515
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,450
The men were all hitting on me,

516
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,125
and women teased me.

517
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,250
I tried really hard to stay, but...

518
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,225
She knows you can't work there!

519
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,575
You should work at a shop! 
You'd attract a crowd!

520
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,975
Hobak did it to piss you off.

521
00:28:11,975 --> 00:28:14,975
Don't say stuff like that.

522
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,650
It's me.

523
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,675
Speak of the devil.

524
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,125
- You're here!
- Yes.

525
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,775
- Dinner?
- I ate.

526
00:28:20,775 --> 00:28:22,025
If you haven't, have some.

527
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:23,500
No, I already ate.

528
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,250
I thought you're a manager, so how could you do that to your sister?

529
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,350
She said she didn't want any training.

530
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,350
What training? I can just do it!

531
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,500
That's not how it goes!

532
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,100
Everyone needs some kind of training.

533
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,425
You should be grateful.

534
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:42,100
Then come to my school and work.

535
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,300
School?

536
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,625
Subak would be a great teacher.

537
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:49,500
You need a teaching license for that.

538
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,050
You can clean the restrooms.

539
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,575
What?

540
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:56,550
This is why Hobak looks down on her.

541
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,325
Subak can't do anything.

542
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:01,650
Was she a good student?

543
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,600
Did she ever have a job?

544
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,475
Cleaning the restrooms is perfect for her.

545
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:07,300
It is perfect for her.

546
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,325
Don't be too picky.

547
00:29:09,325 --> 00:29:12,150
You have to make money when you can.

548
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,350
I know.

549
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,275
Uncle, you stay out of this!

550
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:18,075
You go clean the restrooms!

551
00:29:18,075 --> 00:29:19,825
Why you little,

552
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:22,250
have you forgotten? Respect your uncle!

553
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,650
How dare you talk back at your uncle?

554
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,600
I can't believe you, grandmother!

555
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,525
Subak.

556
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:40,000
Quiet!

557
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:46,200
This is your pay.

558
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,200
How much is it?

559
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,750
I put in a full day's pay.

560
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,050
Of course, you should.

561
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,175
I spent a lot of money on the cab.

562
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,900
What?

563
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:01,600
Subak, I'm sorry.

564
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,525
You said you didn't want training.

565
00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:05,775
There's only manual work without training.

566
00:30:05,775 --> 00:30:08,400
If you wanted to, you could've!

567
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,425
I'm trying, but we just can't be friends.

568
00:30:11,425 --> 00:30:15,000
Why can't a manager get me a job?

569
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,225
Okay, Subak.

570
00:30:16,225 --> 00:30:18,125
I'll talk to the director and...

571
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,050
It's okay. Just go.

572
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,525
You really love me, don't you?

573
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:39,050
Yes.

574
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,775
What were you doing?

575
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:42,500
Thinking about you.

576
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,350
Meeting the boy made me love you more.

577
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:50,750
That was when your mom left you?

578
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,275
Some parts were just heartbreaking.

579
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:57,625
But you grew up to be such a warm man.

580
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:00,025
I'm very proud of you.

581
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,725
Thank you for that.

582
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:05,725
But yours is filled with stuff about food.

583
00:31:05,725 --> 00:31:07,475
I ate this today,

584
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:10,925
I ate this with this person today. Oh, boy.

585
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:14,175
How come you didn't grow taller?

586
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:16,150
Oh, instead, your eyes grew bigger.

587
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:22,325
Good night. Sweet dreams.

588
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:24,575
Kiss.

589
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:27,900
This won't do.

590
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,700
I'm coming over. Wait for me.

591
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,425
No, don't come.

592
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:34,725
Why? You don't miss me?

593
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,075
I look awful right now.

594
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:39,750
But you always look awful.

595
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,425
No teasing.

596
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,050
Okay.

597
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:46,525
I won't come tonight then.

598
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:50,075
I should hang up. Good night.

599
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,075
Good night.

600
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,325
I wish you would change your mind.

601
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:02,125
Before it's too late.

602
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,725
I'm going home.

603
00:32:09,725 --> 00:32:11,000
Okay.

604
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,875
Sunjeong.

605
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,125
The market?

606
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,075
Okay.

607
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:23,250
You're like her husband.

608
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,400
I'm like her brother in law.

609
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,675
She wants me to get chicken.

610
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:29,300
Would you like to come over?

611
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,600
It's okay.

612
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,425
Oh, don't make any plans for this weekend.

613
00:32:34,925 --> 00:32:36,400
Why?

614
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,875
It's a secret. But don't make any plans.

615
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,825
It's mine.

616
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:09,550
What? I got it first!

617
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,475
No, I was first!

618
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:13,250
Why don't you pay my doctor's bill?

619
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,250
Why do you keep doing this to me?

620
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,425
Nothing could be more awful than this.

621
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:18,675
Look who's talking?

622
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:20,425
I said I never want to see you again!

623
00:33:20,425 --> 00:33:22,575
Why don't you move?

624
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:24,175
It's you who should move.

625
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:26,700
I was born and raised here!

626
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,175
I should move?

627
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:30,825
I can't believe how rude you are!

628
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,475
- What?
- What's going on here?

629
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,225
- Actually...
- I wanted to buy this...

630
00:33:35,225 --> 00:33:38,050
- I grabbed this first...
- He took it...

631
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:41,850
- I asked why...
- He's saying he had it first!

632
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,350
Excuse me?

633
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,125
This chicken is mine.

634
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,425
It's mine.

635
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,775
Who picked it up first?

636
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,325
- Me.
- It was me.

637
00:33:49,325 --> 00:33:50,925
One of you should give it up.

638
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:52,350
I can't!

639
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,175
Me neither.

640
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:56,325
Fine. Let's check the video.

641
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,000
What?

642
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,125
You must have a surveillance camera, right?

643
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:03,300
In sports games, when the referee isn't sure, they check the video.

644
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,425
I'm at the grocery store. Come quickly.

645
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:11,150
I'm scared, so come right now.

646
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,850
Hurry up and come.

647
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,975
I can't beat her alone.

648
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,150
She's really good with words.

649
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,200
I think she's calling all her family.

650
00:34:23,925 --> 00:34:27,050
Bring your aunt and Miho.

651
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,000
Oh!

652
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,650
Wait for me!

653
00:34:31,275 --> 00:34:34,825
Oh, this is really hard!

654
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:37,250
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

655
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,950
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

656
00:34:42,175 --> 00:34:44,900
I think you reached for it at the same time.

657
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,425
Let me watch it again.

658
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:48,300
I think I was first.

659
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,300
We watched it dozens of times.

660
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,950
Do you want to report this to the police?

661
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,825
We don't need any police here!

662
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,675
What's going on?

663
00:34:58,675 --> 00:35:00,700
- Uncle.
- Yes?

664
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,675
I came to buy chicken for father,

665
00:35:03,675 --> 00:35:07,700
and I'm sure I picked it up first, but he...

666
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:12,925
It sounds like it's your fault.

667
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:14,975
Why would a gentleman like you do this?

668
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:16,975
Why would you fight over chicken?

669
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:21,350
But it's age before beauty,

670
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,700
and we did reach for it at the same time,

671
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,375
but I asked her if I could have it...

672
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,700
Let's give this to her.

673
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,425
What's going on?

674
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:33,450
Let's go, mom.

675
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,775
Is it over?

676
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,850
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

677
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,375
I'm sorry, but let's never meet like this.

678
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,625
Oh, what happened here?

679
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:58,200
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

680
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,375
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

681
00:36:13,575 --> 00:36:15,550
How can anyone be that rude?

682
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,175
She didn't let you have it?

683
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:21,925
I'm making tofu stew, so hold on.

684
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:25,175
I hope she gets food poisoning.

685
00:36:25,175 --> 00:36:26,825
Father!

686
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:28,350
Are all girls like that these days?

687
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,350
Not all of them.

688
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,300
The girl Sangnam picked is so nice.

689
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,100
She's not like other girls.

690
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,900
She's polite and genuine.

691
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,075
I did pretty well, didn't I?

692
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:42,975
I lost because she had more people.

693
00:36:42,975 --> 00:36:46,900
When you get married, have lots of kids.

694
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,900
Can I have a dozen?

695
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,475
I want to stand out.
I know how it's done.

696
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,550
You do?

697
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:22,950
Mom, can you open the door for me?

698
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,700
Where did all the chicken go?

699
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:44,725
This isn't going to do any good.

700
00:37:44,725 --> 00:37:46,000
Break up with him.

701
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Mom.

702
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,800
Father, please say yes.

703
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,100
I know we'll be happy.

704
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,925
I want to follow my heart.

705
00:37:56,925 --> 00:37:58,150
Follow who?

706
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,575
Her heart.

707
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:01,850
I never met anyone like him before.

708
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,650
When I'm with him, I feel so happy.

709
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,425
Everyone feels like that at the beginning.

710
00:38:08,425 --> 00:38:10,850
Your father and I were happy, too!

711
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,375
We smiled every day.

712
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:17,250
We think the same way, have the same values.

713
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,875
We're a good match.

714
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:21,625
A good resume doesn't make a good husband.

715
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,200
It's the man who's a good match for me.

716
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,700
I learned a lot watching Hobak and Subak.

717
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,175
You need love to protect your marriage.

718
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,175
Stop talking nonsense!

719
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:35,600
You quit your job to become a writer,

720
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,850
but you were dating that man?

721
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,675
What's wrong with you?

722
00:38:39,675 --> 00:38:41,950
How dare you bring such a man?

723
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,325
Mom.

724
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:45,825
Shut up! That's enough.

725
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:46,800
Father.

726
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
I said that's enough!

727
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,850
Why are we even talking about marriage?

728
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:57,625
At the beginning, things are all so sweet, but don't think that's going to last.

729
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,025
I just can't believe my eyes.

730
00:39:01,025 --> 00:39:04,625
I told you what I wanted from you.

731
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,150
Father.

732
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:26,400
What are you thinking?

733
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,475
It's nothing.

734
00:39:27,475 --> 00:39:28,675
Huh?

735
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:30,250
You weren't thinking about me?

736
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,450
I was.

737
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:36,450
I heard women get worries before the wedding.

738
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,450
It's not that.

739
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,900
Actually...

740
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,200
Yes?

741
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:46,375
Do you need something?
Just tell me.

742
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:48,050
Well...

743
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,075
Yes!

744
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,575
I asked your brother in laws to meet me,

745
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,570
and Minjung already said yes,

746
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,570
and this is from Sedal.

747
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:04,350
I should go.

748
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,025
Now?

749
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:09,225
Oh, what did you want to tell me?

750
00:40:09,225 --> 00:40:12,250
Later. It's nothing.

751
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,400
Go home. I'll call you later.

752
00:40:14,975 --> 00:40:16,725
- You're going alone?
- Of course.

753
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:19,125
Don't worry. I can do it.

754
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,825
You trust me, don't you?

755
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:25,275
I told you about my brother in laws, right?

756
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,800
Good luck.

757
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,150
Okay. I'll get them all.

758
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:44,850
- You're here?
- Yes.

759
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,175
I was busy.

760
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:47,700
Thank you for coming.

761
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,975
I wanted to buy you a drink and get advice.

762
00:40:50,975 --> 00:40:52,450
I'm glad you asked.

763
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,975
Welcome.

764
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:57,025
Yes.

765
00:40:57,025 --> 00:40:59,675
The man of the night always arrives late.

766
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:01,625
But you're not the man of the night.

767
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,850
You didn't have to point that out.

768
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:07,375
Shouldn't we be ganging up on him?

769
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:11,600
We need to break him in.

770
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,500
Right.

771
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:21,900
What are you doing? It's cold.

772
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,400
Why aren't you in bed?

773
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,975
I'm upset because you're upset.

774
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,875
I can't control my own kids,

775
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:36,250
the married ones and the single ones.

776
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,750
I thought feeding, clothing and teaching them would be the end of it.

777
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,150
They worry you until you die.

778
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,850
That's what children are.

779
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,250
I know.

780
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:51,100
There's no correct answer in life, right?

781
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:55,350
So don't worry too much about it.

782
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,450
- I'm home.
- Why you little!

783
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,475
See how your father can't sleep?

784
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:03,425
Do you think he wants you to suffer?

785
00:42:03,425 --> 00:42:05,175
You're so immature.

786
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:08,775
He's speaking from experience. Can't you see?

787
00:42:08,775 --> 00:42:10,425
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

788
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,875
What should I do?

789
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:23,750
He's a proud man, so if he finds out, he'll break up with me right away.

790
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,925
Does he have an inferiority complex?

791
00:42:25,925 --> 00:42:27,475
No, he doesn't.

792
00:42:27,475 --> 00:42:29,250
I dropped out of college,

793
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:33,475
so I used to think I was being discriminated whenever someone with

794
00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:37,525
a college degree got better treatment than me at work.

795
00:42:37,525 --> 00:42:40,025
That was from my inferiority complex.

796
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:42,275
I don't know what to do.

797
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:45,350
What will you do?

798
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:49,025
I have to tell him, but I can't.

799
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:52,025
I can't break up with him.

800
00:42:52,025 --> 00:42:53,825
I never felt this way before.

801
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:56,775
I wish I could run away with him.

802
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:58,325
What?

803
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,725
But I love him so much.

804
00:43:00,725 --> 00:43:03,775
You need to change mom and father's minds.

805
00:43:03,775 --> 00:43:07,400
I wont forgive you if just do what you want.

806
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,325
Golf is so much fun.

807
00:43:20,325 --> 00:43:21,975
Did you play your first round?

808
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,450
I will soon.

809
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,450
Do you play golf?

810
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,650
I used to in the past.

811
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:33,750
Did you hit a hole in one at the Yeongnam Country Club?

812
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,900
Yes.

813
00:43:36,725 --> 00:43:38,150
Do you play golf, too?

814
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,400
I'm not very good. I can play bogey.

815
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,300
I'll take you golfing sometime.

816
00:43:46,675 --> 00:43:49,450
What were you talking about before?

817
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:54,400
Oh, there's a handicap 1 par 3 hole.

818
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,500
It's real hard but he hit a hole in one.

819
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,575
They planted a tree to commemorate it.

820
00:44:00,575 --> 00:44:02,750
And I remembered seeing his name on it.

821
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,750
A tree?

822
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,275
They planted a tree?

823
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:10,100
When you hit a hole in one, they do.

824
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,400
It's when you hit from the tee box and make the ball go into the hole at once.

825
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,350
I know that. All in one.

826
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,225
Not all in one. Hole in one.

827
00:44:23,225 --> 00:44:25,950
You hit it once, and it goes in the hole.

828
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,575
I said I know.

829
00:44:28,575 --> 00:44:30,800
Hole in one.

830
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,625
I'm a bit drunk.

831
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:36,800
You're only a middle school graduate.

832
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,350
Are you drunk?

833
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,075
I'm not.

834
00:44:40,425 --> 00:44:41,825
My speech is a bit slurred.

835
00:44:43,675 --> 00:44:46,875
Did my in laws really say yes?

836
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:50,425
I doubt they'd welcome such an uneducated person.

837
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,250
Education isn't important.

838
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,400
Your skills are more important.

839
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,750
Of course it's important.

840
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,400
When you meet anyone,

841
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,525
they ask you which college you went to.

842
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:04,000
Drink.

843
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
You might have guessed already,

844
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,025
but my influence with my in laws is big.

845
00:45:09,025 --> 00:45:11,900
I got married before Minjung.

846
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:16,425
I'm climbing up, rising sun.

847
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:20,600
He's climbing down, setting sun.

848
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,825
I got wings, he lost his.

849
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:29,675
He went from "my Minjung" to "your Minjung."

850
00:45:29,675 --> 00:45:31,325
He hit a bogey.

851
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:37,875
I went from "your Sedal" to "my Sedal."

852
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:40,925
I hit a birdie.

853
00:45:40,925 --> 00:45:43,700
Or is it an albatross?

854
00:45:53,475 --> 00:45:57,950
Minjung, you're really something.

855
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:01,950
I couldn't have moved in with my in laws.

856
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:07,000
No real man should live with his in laws,

857
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,550
and I couldn't live with a mother in law like ours.

858
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,975
I'd rather kill myself.

859
00:46:15,975 --> 00:46:23,250
You have to worry about where you'll be delivering tomorrow,

860
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:31,700
how to deal with mother's nagging, and how to console Subak.

861
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,550
I really feel sad for you.

862
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:41,875
Number 1, you're extremely mild tempered.

863
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:45,875
Number 2, you have no self esteem.

864
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:47,875
Number 3.

865
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,700
Sedal!

866
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,525
Can you walk home from here?

867
00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:18,500
Yes. It's really close.

868
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,925
Minjung,

869
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,975
forget what Sedal said before.

870
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:27,350
I'm sorry I acted like that.

871
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,375
I must have had too much to drink.

872
00:47:30,025 --> 00:47:32,775
He can be thoughtless with words,

873
00:47:32,775 --> 00:47:34,950
but he's not a bad man.

874
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:38,025
I know.

875
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:41,825
The family evolves around the daughters,

876
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,825
so things can get difficult for us.

877
00:47:44,825 --> 00:47:47,400
I know what I'm getting into.

878
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:53,100
You and Gwangbak look good together.

879
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,650
Thank you.

880
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:58,300
Good night, Minjung.
I'll call you.

881
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,600
Okay. Good night.

882
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,800
Okay.

883
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,675
What the...

884
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:18,700
Oh, my!

885
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:20,975
How...

886
00:48:20,975 --> 00:48:22,650
Oh, man.

887
00:48:24,225 --> 00:48:25,550
I'm sorry.

888
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,450
Just how much did he drink?

889
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,800
Thanks. You should go.

890
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,125
Yes. Good night.

891
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:34,300
Yes. Goodbye.

892
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,100
Oh, careful, careful.

893
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,325
Did everything go well?

894
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,375
Sangnam!

895
00:48:48,275 --> 00:48:50,150
Don't.

896
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:52,625
Yeah, right!

897
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,525
What are you doing?

898
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:56,875
What am I doing?

899
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,675
You think you're a virgin?

900
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,150
What are you doing?

901
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:17,475
Why aren't you calling me?

902
00:49:41,675 --> 00:49:44,300
I'm sleeping with my wife.

903
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,650
That's enough. You didn't get any sleep.

904
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:17,700
If you didn't know this would happen, you're dumber than I thought.

905
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,725
I don't need this from you!

906
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,725
Don't get mad.

907
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:25,000
Life is short.

908
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,100
You should do what you want to do.

909
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:32,775
Right.

910
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:40,950
What happened last night?

911
00:50:41,775 --> 00:50:43,875
The three of us had a lot to drink.

912
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,175
He's a good guy.

913
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,000
Isn't he?

914
00:50:48,975 --> 00:50:50,900
When you get him drunk, you know.

915
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,550
He drank a lot, but he didn't show it.

916
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,875
He watched his manners until the end.

917
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:59,400
He even took us home.

918
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,200
He probably passed out when he got home.

919
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,025
That's the kind of man you're going to marry.

920
00:51:06,425 --> 00:51:07,375
Good morning.

921
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:09,150
I should go and exercise.

922
00:51:19,575 --> 00:51:21,225
Water.

923
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,650
Give me water.

924
00:51:37,075 --> 00:51:38,225
Huh?

925
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,700
Oh, man!

926
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:51,550
What did you do to me last night?

927
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,125
Get dressed before the boys get up.

928
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:55,175
You'll ruin their appetite.

929
00:51:55,175 --> 00:51:56,300
You...

930
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,150
Tell me the truth.

931
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:02,575
Did we... Did we do it?

932
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:05,975
Why are you stuttering?

933
00:52:05,975 --> 00:52:08,600
So did we?

934
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,375
We're married.
What's wrong with doing it?

935
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:13,875
Why are you acting so strange?

936
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:17,000
So you were singing out of joy?

937
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,250
Yes! It was great! I thought you had some snake stew for stamina.

938
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:25,150
This is nutty, nutty, nuts!

939
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,050
You'll wake the boys up.
Lower your voice.

940
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,625
Sintong! Bangtong!

941
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:30,550
Your mom violated...

942
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,150
What are you doing?

943
00:52:33,075 --> 00:52:35,125
I'm never going to drink again.

944
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:37,125
The same thing happened 10 years ago,

945
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:39,700
and look where it got me.

946
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:42,525
Who delivered me here?

947
00:52:42,975 --> 00:52:44,425
Don't you remember?

948
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,275
How dare he!

949
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:49,175
Why did he deliver me here?

950
00:52:49,175 --> 00:52:52,625
This was a delivery accident.

951
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,525
Did you punch me?

952
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,975
I had no time to punch you.

953
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:03,525
Why am I sore all over?

954
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,475
My chin hurts and my butt hurts.

955
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,475
This is nuts!

956
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:11,700
Cosmetics shop?

957
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,125
Yes.

958
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:16,725
My friend worked there, and the business was really good.

959
00:53:16,725 --> 00:53:17,675
Then why is it out in the market?

960
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,775
The owner has to move to the States.

961
00:53:20,775 --> 00:53:23,600
And they really don't want to sell.

962
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,025
Mom, we should buy that.

963
00:53:26,025 --> 00:53:27,225
Us?

964
00:53:27,225 --> 00:53:31,400
Women still buy makeup even when they don't have money.

965
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,750
All women wear makeup.

966
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,025
Right.

967
00:53:37,025 --> 00:53:40,350
My beauty salon has been in trouble,

968
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,150
but the problem is money.

969
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:46,525
If I had money, I would buy that cosmetics shop right now.

970
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,800
Can you sell your beauty salon and get a loan?

971
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,625
Mom, let's go and check the place out.

972
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:55,250
We can decide after that.

973
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:02,725
Hello.

974
00:54:02,725 --> 00:54:04,875
- Who is it?
- It's me.

975
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:06,475
Don.

976
00:54:06,475 --> 00:54:08,925
Oh, Loser, it's you.

977
00:54:09,675 --> 00:54:12,650
I didn't recognize you in that helmet.

978
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:15,475
I feel so sorry for you.

979
00:54:15,475 --> 00:54:20,000
When will you save enough money to buy a house and get married?

980
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,825
You're not seeing anyone, are you?

981
00:54:22,775 --> 00:54:24,175
No.

982
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:27,350
I should go.

983
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:28,550
Goodbye.

984
00:54:32,475 --> 00:54:34,825
I feel bad for him.

985
00:54:34,825 --> 00:54:36,625
Why didn't you say hello to him?

986
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:39,400
You played with him when you were little.

987
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,150
Are you mad?

988
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:43,975
Right. Don't ever associate with him.

989
00:54:43,975 --> 00:54:45,575
It's degrading.

990
00:54:45,575 --> 00:54:46,675
Let's go.

991
00:54:58,975 --> 00:55:01,975
The location is nice and there's lots of customers.

992
00:55:01,975 --> 00:55:04,200
We have to buy this shop.

993
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,125
Mom, let's buy it.

994
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:08,475
You're the president and I'm the vice president.

995
00:55:09,475 --> 00:55:12,725
If I had money, I would buy it right now.

996
00:55:14,475 --> 00:55:17,325
I'll hit a hole in one.

997
00:55:17,325 --> 00:55:20,525
Minjung did it, so I can do it.

998
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,325
This is nuts.

999
00:55:26,325 --> 00:55:27,775
What's this?

1000
00:55:30,325 --> 00:55:35,000
I'm sleeping with my wife? What's this?

1001
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,275
I'm asking you.

1002
00:55:36,275 --> 00:55:38,950
You sent me that last night.

1003
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:40,750
I didn't send this to you.

1004
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:44,000
I don't know why this keeps happening.

1005
00:55:45,325 --> 00:55:46,875
If this keeps happening,

1006
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:49,175
I'm going to take extreme measures.

1007
00:55:49,175 --> 00:55:51,750
Stop saying stuff like that.

1008
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,550
Have you ever hit a hole in one?

1009
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,225
No.

1010
00:55:55,225 --> 00:55:58,175
Hitting a hole in one will be my goal.

1011
00:55:58,175 --> 00:56:02,350
I'm going to get a tree with my name on it.

1012
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,675
Hold on.

1013
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:07,325
Yes.

1014
00:56:07,325 --> 00:56:11,000
Do you have time for lunch?

1015
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,950
Yes, sir.

1016
00:56:16,575 --> 00:56:18,550
It must have been hard for you.

1017
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:23,325
I know Hobak can be difficult to handle.
She probably gave you a lot of stress.

1018
00:56:24,425 --> 00:56:27,750
She was frugal from the start,

1019
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:32,300
and she never wasted a single penny.

1020
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,125
I heard you got $3 a day.

1021
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:39,575
That's just too harsh.

1022
00:56:39,575 --> 00:56:42,650
Even Daebak spends more than $3.

1023
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,250
You know exactly how I feel!

1024
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,000
Let me write it down.

1025
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,500
I tend to forget things like this.

1026
00:56:51,925 --> 00:56:55,175
I'm a man, too, so I know.

1027
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:57,275
Things happen.

1028
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,625
After being married for 10 years,

1029
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,675
you could get ideas.

1030
00:57:02,675 --> 00:57:04,800
Ideas...

1031
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,225
But you must think of your family.

1032
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,875
Hobak has made mistakes, but she did well, too.

1033
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:15,950
She's a hard worker and she's frugal.

1034
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:17,950
Even her mom complains about how she

1035
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:20,675
never even bought her dollar undies.

1036
00:57:20,675 --> 00:57:22,725
Dollar undies...

1037
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:24,150
But thanks to that,

1038
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,950
you bought an apartment, don't you agree?

1039
00:57:27,425 --> 00:57:28,575
Yes.

1040
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:32,800
I'm sure she's learned a lesson.

1041
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,275
Be a man and be kind to her.

1042
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,675
Women are all the same.

1043
00:57:40,675 --> 00:57:43,825
A man's word can melt everything away.

1044
00:57:43,825 --> 00:57:45,625
Do you understand what I mean?

1045
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,650
Yes.

1046
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:51,525
I took notes and it helped.

1047
00:57:52,025 --> 00:57:54,100
Thank you for understanding.

1048
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,775
- Let's eat.
- Yes.

1049
00:57:56,525 --> 00:57:58,325
Please eat.

1050
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:06,583
[Wedding anniversary]

1051
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:16,975
What is it?

1052
00:58:16,975 --> 00:58:19,850
Send Sintong and Bangtong to mom's house.

1053
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:23,275
And make yourself pretty and wait for me.

1054
00:58:23,275 --> 00:58:25,500
Really?

1055
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,800
Okay.

1056
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:32,242
Sintong! Bangtong!

1057
00:58:40,575 --> 00:58:42,350
Mom, come out.

1058
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,700
Oh, my.

1059
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,250
What's all that?

1060
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,700
Who sent them?

1061
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,375
Beef, fish, abalone, fruits.

1062
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:55,600
There's even mangoes.

1063
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,100
There's a card here.

1064
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,875
Was it Sedal?

1065
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,900
I'm Choi Sangnam, your future son in law.

1066
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,500
Mother, I hope you like them.

1067
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,543
I told her to break up with him!

1068
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,350
Welcome.

1069
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,150
This place is too expensive.

1070
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,800
Let's go somewhere else.

1071
00:59:19,225 --> 00:59:23,325
I want to buy you a beautiful ring so you can show off to your friends.

1072
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,600
I'm not making money to eat 12 meals a day.

1073
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,475
I'm making it to spend on you.

1074
00:59:28,175 --> 00:59:30,665
You always know what to say.

1075
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:44,400
Mom, I can't bark now.

1076
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,000
Where are you?

1077
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,125
You're with him, aren't you?

1078
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:50,775
No, I'm meeting a friend.

1079
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,525
You didn't tell that dropout?

1080
00:59:52,525 --> 00:59:55,175
You didn't tell him we don't want him?

1081
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:57,475
How can you call him "dropout"?

1082
00:59:57,475 --> 00:59:58,492
He has a name, you know?

1083
00:59:58,492 --> 01:00:00,625
Future son in law my butt.

1084
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:01,525
How dare he?

1085
01:00:01,525 --> 01:00:03,200
Don't get mad at him.

1086
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,075
You should get mad at Gwangbak.

1087
01:00:05,075 --> 01:00:08,000
She's encouraging those bums.

1088
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,650
Tell him to come and take these back!

1089
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:11,875
And I'll talk to you when you come home!

1090
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,550
He sent them, so just eat them.

1091
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:15,075
You like free food.

1092
01:00:15,075 --> 01:00:16,400
Bye.

1093
01:00:26,425 --> 01:00:28,550
Did you send something to my house?

1094
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:30,450
My mom really loves them.

1095
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:32,325
You earned lots of points.

1096
01:00:32,325 --> 01:00:35,275
I'm glad she liked them.

1097
01:00:35,275 --> 01:00:37,663
But I think I'm making a mistake.

1098
01:00:38,525 --> 01:00:39,625
What do you mean?

1099
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:43,475
You have so many sisters and I'm scared.

1100
01:00:43,475 --> 01:00:44,925
Oh, just thinking about it is...

1101
01:00:44,925 --> 01:00:46,125
Horrific?

1102
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:49,725
Your father, mother and sisters are all tough,

1103
01:00:49,725 --> 01:00:52,500
and I heard the son in laws have troubles, too.

1104
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,175
Like how daughter in laws do.

1105
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:56,100
I'm starting to get worried.

1106
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,550
Especially about Sedal.

1107
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:59,200
I heard about it.

1108
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,850
I passed out.

1109
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:02,225
But we became friends.

1110
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,900
Oh, come to my house this weekend.

1111
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,625
My father wants to meet you.

1112
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:06,950
You told him about me?

1113
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,200
My father already okayed you.

1114
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,650
Without even meeting me?

1115
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,225
He's always on my side.

1116
01:01:12,225 --> 01:01:14,725
And my aunt helped too.

1117
01:01:14,725 --> 01:01:16,000
Let's pick one.

1118
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:22,225
What do we do?

1119
01:01:23,325 --> 01:01:24,875
We must return them.

1120
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:33,375
Those!

1121
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,550
Are these expensive?

1122
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:45,300
Do you like them?

1123
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,597
I do, but...

1124
01:01:49,675 --> 01:01:50,800
Shh!

1125
01:01:51,325 --> 01:01:53,125
Give me your hand.

1126
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:56,072
I'd be happy with a cheap ring, too.

1127
01:02:02,825 --> 01:02:04,125
Does it fit?

1128
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,050
Like it was made for me.

1129
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:08,850
It's so pretty.

1130
01:02:22,025 --> 01:02:24,400
How you feel is important,

1131
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,775
but sometimes you need to show it.

1132
01:02:29,175 --> 01:02:31,500
This shows how we feel for each other.

1133
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,825
You're mine,

1134
01:02:33,825 --> 01:02:35,825
and I'm yours.

1135
01:02:37,475 --> 01:02:40,125
It's expensive, so don't lose it.

1136
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:42,550
Don't ever remove it from your finger.

1137
01:02:43,475 --> 01:02:47,600
We'll never sell them, even if we were desperate.

1139
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,600
Do you know what today is?

1140
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,175
This is the day we're getting a divorce.

1141
01:03:15,175 --> 01:03:17,175
You don't feel sorry at all?

1142
01:03:17,175 --> 01:03:18,650
Let's not wait until next year.

1143
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:21,500
After you meet my father, let's set a date.

1144
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,075
Break up before your parents find out.

1145
01:03:24,075 --> 01:03:25,650
You two got rings?

1146
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:26,625
No.

1147
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:28,275
Don't even dream about it.

1148
01:03:28,275 --> 01:03:29,575
I'd rather both of us die.

1149
01:03:29,575 --> 01:03:31,600
Father, your daughter in law is here!

1150
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,875
We have to flee.

1151
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:33,900
Me too?

1152
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,075
You're coming with me, aren't you?

1153
01:03:35,075 --> 01:03:38,375
I won't be responsible for anything that happens.
