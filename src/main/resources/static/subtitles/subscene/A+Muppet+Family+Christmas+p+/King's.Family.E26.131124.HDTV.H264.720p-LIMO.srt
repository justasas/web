Episode 26

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,060
Who's she?

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,490
Hello, madam.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,790
I'm the caregiver.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,230
You're the caregiver?

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,940
Yes.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,030
I'd better get going.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,140
She looks like a good caregiver.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,340
Her husband must be unemployed.

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,670
She's not flirting with you, is she?

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,540
You're a pretty handsome man.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,270
At least you used to be.

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,760
Nonsense.

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,090
What are you doing here?

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,970
It's for the caregiver.

17
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,930
I kept my promise.

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,170
Not everyone can take care of sick people.

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,170
Trying to pay for a caregiver is just as hard.

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,640
I should go.

21
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,760
You're not going to say hello to father?

22
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,170
Oh, when did you get home?

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,700
Just now.

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,540
I must be making things hard for you.

25
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,800
No, you're not.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,030
I always eat out.

27
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,440
It's Miho who has it hard.

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,030
Anyway, where do you go every day?

29
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,100
I'll tell you later.

30
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,200
You're glowing.

31
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,170
Are you seeing someone?

32
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,570
If I were, I'd tell you.

33
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,170
Sangnam should be fine, right?

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,470
Since he's not home yet, he must be.

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,770
I hope she's a nice girl.

36
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,260
Someone you and Sangnam will like.

37
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,440
I hope she is.

38
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,640
- How did it go?
- I'm home.

39
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,940
Did you like her?

40
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,140
Here, here. Sit down, sit down.

41
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,290
Come over here.

42
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,870
Yes.

43
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:10,670
She knows about me, but she doesn't care.

44
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,390
About my family and education.

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,890
Of course she doesn't.

46
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,760
Her father was a teacher, too.

47
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,930
And she's a college graduate.

48
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,100
Are you going to see her again?

49
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,260
Yes.

50
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,960
Good. What did you talk about?

51
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,570
We didn't talk much. We just met.

52
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,790
What did you do then?
It's pretty late.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,490
Were you just staring at her?

54
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,770
Yes.

55
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,070
You must be hungry.
I'll get you something.

56
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,200
It's okay, aunt.

57
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,330
I ate lunch late so I'm not hungry.

58
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,560
I'm going to go up to my room.

59
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,040
What is it?

60
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,370
I'm curious.

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,230
About what? I told you everything.

62
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,760
Did you like her?

63
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,760
She's someone I could marry.

64
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,930
But you're not attracted to her?

65
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,600
It's hard to meet people like that.

66
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,860
But that's what you look for in a woman.

67
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,370
Tell father I'll do what he wants.

68
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,990
Aunt, I want to go to bed.

69
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm tired because I was nervous.

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,740
What is it?

71
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,360
Nothing. Take a shower first.

72
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,060
It's here, right here.

73
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,240
It's from over there to over there.

74
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,490
This whole area will be developed with a country club and a resort.

75
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,800
A resort and a country club?

76
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,070
Yes, with a 36 hole golf course and a resort at the center.

77
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,200
Sunjeong, I'll be right there.

78
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,590
Don't worry. Take your time.

79
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,070
And drive carefully.

80
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,540
Okay. Thanks.

81
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,740
Why is Aeji sleeping here?

82
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,760
Subak's not home yet?

83
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,790
She's sleeping because she's tired.

84
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,330
No matter how tired she is,

85
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,400
she should sleep with her child.

86
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,470
Leave her alone. Don't wake her up.

87
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,490
She's going somewhere early tomorrow.

88
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,690
Is her job going okay?

89
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,470
I think so.
She's been giving me money.

90
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,460
How much?

91
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,300
She'll give me more after her first paycheck.

92
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,540
She gave Minjung money to hire a caregiver,

93
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,300
so it must be going well.

94
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,490
Subak looks happier since she started working.

95
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,690
She's less mean to Minjung.

96
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,800
Right. Everyone should work.

97
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,540
Put him down.

98
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,770
He starts crying when I do.

99
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,360
Why don't you bark for him?

100
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,170
But it makes him cry.

101
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,640
Gwangbak's not home yet?

102
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,030
She goes out every day to write,

103
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,540
but who knows where she goes?

104
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,270
I don't think she's been writing.

105
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,560
And she hurt her arm somewhere.

106
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,590
I was frustrated so I said something,

107
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,540
and she started yelling out of the blue.

108
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,060
Oh, it was crazy.

109
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,540
She must be miserable.

110
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,340
Don't push her. Just leave her be.

111
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,470
That's all you say, just leave them be.

112
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,340
When she quit her job,

113
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,140
we should've made her go back!

114
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,590
When I think about that, I get mad at you.

115
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,430
You're mad at everyone in the family.

116
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:02,270
Go to sleep, go to sleep.

117
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,530
Go to sleep, go to...

118
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,330
Go to sleep, go to sleep...

119
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,600
Hey, honey.

120
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,400
Huh? What is it?

121
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,340
Do you need something?

122
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,940
I don't. You should lie down.

123
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,370
He started crying when I put him down.

124
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,260
You're going to get sick.

125
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,060
What else can I do?

126
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,990
Give him to me.

127
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:54,690
Go to sleep now...

128
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,670
Father.

129
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,260
Take your medicine.

130
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,470
You can't even sleep because of me.

131
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,060
I'm sorry I caught a cold.

132
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,760
Oh...

133
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,540
Oh, you're home?

134
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,790
Yes, I need to change before going to work.

135
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,990
You're going exercising?

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,570
Yes.

137
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,740
How is your father?

138
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,990
He caught a cold.

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,530
Oh, no.

140
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,690
I feel badly about your father,

141
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,990
but I'm worried about you.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,660
You're not getting any sleep.

143
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,630
I'm okay. I'll see you later.

144
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,530
Okay.

145
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,800
Oh, father.

146
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,570
Yes?

147
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,940
It's not an appropriate topic for now,

148
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,740
but about Gwangbak,

149
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,100
she's really miserable.

150
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,890
Love sickness...

151
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,600
I met the guy,

152
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,970
and you may not be happy with him,

153
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,800
but he is a great guy.

154
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,990
Father,

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,440
can you reconsider him?

156
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,300
Gwangbak's not eating or sleeping.

157
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,390
She's like a walking corpse.

158
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,990
He's a great guy.

159
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,470
Why did you bring it up?

160
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,490
Mother.

161
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,590
When did you get home?

162
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,360
Just now.

163
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,390
Subak didn't come home last night?

164
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,240
She did. But she went to work.

165
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,630
Already?

166
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,030
You talked to her on the phone last night.

167
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,290
She had to go to the countryside early.

168
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,160
But there was no trace of her.

169
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,100
How do you know that?

170
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,100
People leave traces when they come home?

171
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,360
What are you doing home at this hour?

172
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,360
You're coming home now?

173
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,630
Huh?

174
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,390
Yes, I had to go outside of Seoul.

175
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,440
Do you know what time it is?
It's morning now.

176
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,400
How could you come home now?

177
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,790
Who cares if it's morning?

178
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,630
I had to go somewhere with investors.

179
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,790
But this, this can't happen.

180
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,330
Your mother said you went to work early,

181
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,600
but you're coming home now.

182
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,200
Unless you're hiding something, why lie?

183
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,770
Mom made a mistake.

184
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,840
I'm exhausted.
Why are you bugging me?

185
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,070
You think I'm cheating on you?

186
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,140
What?

187
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,630
Think about it.

188
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,740
I had to work all night, but you're mad.

189
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,840
I can't believe you're doing this to me.

190
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,260
I'm making money, too.

191
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,470
I'm making money you can't, okay?

192
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,100
Unbelievable.

193
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,260
Did you tell him I came home?

194
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,060
What's wrong with you?

195
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,300
What do yo want to say?

196
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,360
You think Subak is cheating on you?

197
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,340
It's not that.

198
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,200
Then what is it?

199
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:31,890
She goes all over the country, looking for real estate properties.

200
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,530
If I were you, I'd worship her.

201
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,700
She's making money to pay for babysitting and for your father's caregiver.

202
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,800
Didn't you get money from her?

203
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,860
I did, $200.

204
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,990
She works her butt off all day,

205
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,360
and you interrogate her like this?

206
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,840
You came home late when you ran a company.

207
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:04,130
You know how it is in business.

208
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,530
I didn't want to worry you, so I lied,

209
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,290
and you can't understand that?

210
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,630
You're not making enough money,

211
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,530
and you're making your wife work,

212
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,830
so why are you being so difficult?

213
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,340
You should be grateful instead.

214
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,240
Put yourself in her shoes.

215
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,940
When you're out working your butt off,

216
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,700
would you like to hear your wife nagging?

217
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,160
When you ran a company,

218
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,930
you often didn't come home.

219
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,040
I always came home.

220
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,160
Coming home after midnight doesn't count.

221
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,090
That's like coming home the next day.

222
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,390
Right.

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,790
You're coming today, right?

224
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,200
Of course.

225
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,700
I'm going to be there for your presentation.

226
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,100
And dad? I'd like him to come, too.

227
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,240
He's away on business.

228
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,990
I'll be watching for two people.

229
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,860
That's okay, right?

230
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,200
Oh, I'm bored.

231
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,840
Why? Should I entertain you?

232
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,290
Shopping is boring.

233
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,940
Let's play golf.

234
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,270
It's too cold.

235
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,190
Golf is no fun either.

236
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,240
But it's starting to get fun for me.

237
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,360
I even play it in my sleep.

238
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,400
Good shot!

239
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,260
It's suffocating.

240
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,890
I want to travel around the world.

241
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,830
Travel around the world?

242
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,700
The whole world?
Not just a few countries?

243
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,030
Go sailing on a yacht and go on a cruise.

244
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,960
And fly on a private jet.

245
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,060
This is nuts.

246
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,300
Let's go. Why not?

247
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,260
It could take several months.

248
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,790
Several months?

249
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,290
You can't go.

250
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,760
Have you played golf by the sea?

251
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,470
Me? By the sea?

252
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,260
It's nuts.

253
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,860
Bring them to my room.

254
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,660
Okay.

255
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,040
Today?

256
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,290
I thought it was next week.

257
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,740
Director, I have an important engagement.

258
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,990
Okay.

259
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,430
Anna, I have to attend an exhibition.

260
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,900
- Right now?
- Yes.

261
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,240
Sign it.

262
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,890
What?

263
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,930
Open it.

264
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,390
Sign it.

265
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,160
I'm begging you.

266
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,760
Let me breathe, okay?

267
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,790
You're suffocating me.

268
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,390
Why are you so stubborn? 
You're older!

269
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,190
I hate older women.

270
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,740
It's exciting to be with younger women.

271
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,360
You have no idea.

272
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,940
Whenever I hear "oppa," it drives me crazy.

273
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,540
I can't travel the world because of you!

274
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,390
It's different from those package tours or going backpacking.

275
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,570
Sailing across the Atlantic Ocean and hitting a gold ball into the ocean!

276
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,340
It's totally nuts...

277
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,990
Where are you staying?

278
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,460
You don't need to know.

279
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,170
Sintong's giving a presentation at school.

280
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,630
You should go and watch him.

281
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,440
He's not a politician.

282
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:41,500
Parents shouldn't run to school whenever their children are doing something.

283
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,340
Anna, I'll see you later.

284
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,560
See you later, manager.

285
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,130
Hey! You have to sign this!

286
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,870
You... What are you doing?

287
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,940
- Please throw this out.
- I will.

288
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,030
Hey!

289
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,170
Ugh...

290
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,100
Man...

291
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,260
Hello, I want to be a magician

292
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,260
because I can make people happy

293
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,590
by doing magic for them.

294
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,360
I think about that when I learn magic tricks and I feel happy.

295
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,400
This was voted the best item of the season,

296
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,970
and we think we should name it "Hug."

297
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,700
Hug?

298
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,100
Yes, it shows the strength of the jacket

299
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,630
and adds stylish and trendy feelings to it.

300
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,240
And by using it as the ad concept, it will increase the sales.

301
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,830
Mice like dark places and run when they see people.

302
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,790
But the mouse robot I made...

303
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,600
likes people and gets along with them.

304
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,890
You don't have to do a thing

305
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,990
I'll do it all for you

306
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,940
Is it reality or no? Is it truth or no...

307
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,200
What is it?

308
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,390
So?

309
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,540
Okay.

310
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,030
We'll talk again with a lawyer.

311
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,930
Is it reality or no? Is it truth or no...

312
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,440
Don't hesitate

313
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,790
That's boring.

314
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,400
Oppa,

315
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,340
good job.

316
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,530
That's the end of the exhibition.

317
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,940
Sintong!

318
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm so sorry.

319
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,590
Sintong, I'm really sorry.

320
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,660
It's all my fault.

321
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,740
Oh, please forgive me.

322
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,700
I was extremely busy.

323
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,900
There was an emergency meeting.

324
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,270
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

325
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,900
Should I quit my job?

326
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,290
You're not going to look at me?

327
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,200
I'm begging you, please forgive me.

328
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,290
Sintong!

329
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,440
Ugh. You won't even talk. I should go.

330
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,260
Bye.

331
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,970
Other moms all came.

332
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,590
Even their dads came.

333
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,530
I was the only one without a mom and a dad.

334
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,890
I waited, but you never came.

335
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,760
And I did a good job today.

336
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,300
They all clapped for me.

337
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,600
Here.

338
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,540
Pizza!

339
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,100
Pizza! Pizza! It's pizza!

340
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,460
What's going on? Miss Scrooge.

341
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,470
Not in front of the boys.

342
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,670
They know their mom is a Scrooge.

343
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,440
- You know, right?
- Yes.

344
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,700
Enjoy. Don't pay for it. It's my treat.

345
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,140
No! I didn't come here for that. Just kidding.

346
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,760
Thanks, uncle. Join us.

347
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,560
I have to deliver this.

348
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,490
Sintong, I'm really proud of you.

349
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,240
You gave a presentation without me or dad.

350
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,670
I'm really sorry.

351
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,900
This won't ever happen again.

352
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,100
Promise.

353
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,700
Be a man.

354
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,340
Oh, my darling son!

355
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,060
What about me?

356
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,970
Bangtong, you're my darling son, too.

357
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,940
It would have been nice if dad came at least.

358
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,440
Dad went on a business trip.

359
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,760
Let's eat.

360
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,640
Here.

361
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,330
Where did my side dishes go?

362
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,660
I threw them out.

363
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,140
Ms. Eun hates anything that smells.

364
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,100
Why didn't you ask me first?

365
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,490
Those were for me.

366
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,090
This is nuts.

367
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,940
Let's eat!

368
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,170
It looks delicious.

369
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,600
I'm going to eat first!

370
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,760
If dad doesn't come back,

371
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,440
could just the three of us live together?

372
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,700
Why wouldn't dad come back?

373
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,170
His business trip might take longer.

374
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,260
Why would it take longer?

375
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,090
This is a maybe.

376
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,530
If dad comes back a year later,

377
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,490
we could live without him for a while.

378
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,590
No, no.

379
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,240
Our family is dad, you, Sintong and me.

380
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,060
The four of us!

381
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,890
Tell dad to hurry back, okay?

382
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,090
Sintong, how about you?

383
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,430
If you're happy, I'm okay.

384
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,840
You don't miss dad?

385
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,470
I don't think dad's our family.

386
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,560
Since he got the "oppa" text messages.

387
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,990
My friend's parents divorced, too.

388
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,200
Father.

389
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,490
Yes.

390
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,790
Welcome.

391
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,430
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Baek Jihwa.

392
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,470
What would you like?

393
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,990
The side dishes are really good.

394
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,490
My aunt is a great cook.

395
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,240
I should learn from you.

396
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,260
There isn't much to learn.

397
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,830
If your parents are okay with it,

398
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,740
I'd like to meet them this weekend.

399
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,030
My parents said yes.

400
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,100
You're really going to marry Sangnam?

401
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,690
Yes.

402
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,530
She's just upset about him getting married.

403
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,990
She thinks she's losing him.

404
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,940
She's my rival, then.

405
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,700
If the wedding's going to happen this year,

406
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,740
you'll be really busy.

407
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,900
Sangnam, show her your room.

408
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,290
Later.

409
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,640
Hey!

410
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,900
Did you drink?

411
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,940
Man...

412
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,690
Drink this. It'll help you sober up.

413
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,470
I drank to get drunk.

414
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,140
Drink this, girl!

415
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,590
Or you'll ruin your stomach.

416
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,560
You're driving me crazy!

417
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,900
Why would you go drinking so late?

418
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,340
Where did you drink?

419
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,130
At a club.

420
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,060
A club?

421
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,030
Don't go dancing there. You look cheap.

422
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,190
Are you kidding me?

423
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,560
It's none of your business.

424
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,360
I'm your brother's friend.

425
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,470
I'm your niece's friend, Gwangbak's uncle.

426
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,400
Come with me.

427
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,370
I can't sleep even with medicine.

428
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,740
You're in a hard place, too, right?

429
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,140
I'm trying to forget,

430
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,440
but it's not working.

431
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,170
I'm dying for him to call.

432
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,840
Like Subak said, if I get plastic surgery

433
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,630
and stay home with my face all swollen,

434
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,700
will I forget everything?

435
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,990
How about exercising?

436
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,470
When you work out, you forget.

437
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,940
I forget when I'm working.

438
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,740
And I can't exercise like this.

439
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,940
You lost a lot of weight, Gwangbak.

440
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,990
So sad...

441
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,940
He is so cruel.

442
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,090
He didn't even drunk dial me.

443
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,530
How could he not call once?

444
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,660
Others do it all the time after breaking up,

445
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,490
but he's so cold.

446
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,270
He thinks he's the one who got dumped.

447
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,330
Love is so...

448
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,090
It doesn't feed you,

449
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,030
it doesn't buy you a house.

450
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,870
I thought

451
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,330
only rich people fall in love.

452
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,940
I thought it's something

453
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,700
that's nice

454
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,740
but could live without.

455
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,060
But why do we always learn

456
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,670
the importance of something after losing it?

457
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,470
I should've been nicer to him

458
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,370
so he wouldn't fall for anyone else.

459
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:23,470
What's the use of driving myself mad every night after everything is done?

460
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,360
I didn't know it then.

461
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,840
I thought he'd be there forever.

462
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,530
Eating kimchi stew from one pot

463
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,490
with everyone in the family,

464
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,960
laughing at the boys doing funny dance moves.

465
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,700
I didn't know I was happy back then.

466
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,970
Him being there was enough for me.

467
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,940
Even if he didn't do anything,

468
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,490
just having him around was comfort enough.

469
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,930
I learned that after he left.

470
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,790
Hobak...

471
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,740
Sedal will come back.

472
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,060
You have kids.

473
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,640
I don't want him to come back for that.

474
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,600
I won't be happy if he came back just because of our kids.

475
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,900
But I envy you.

476
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,970
You can at least see him.

477
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,560
I can't

478
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,700
see him, even if I wanted to.

479
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,790
You have the kids,

480
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,260
but we have nothing to connect us.

481
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,490
He doesn't even miss me,

482
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,090
while I'm going crazy here.

483
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,990
What is it?

484
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,160
[Sedal. Divorce! Divorce! Divorce!]

485
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,740
This is what he sent you?

486
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,630
He sends me that all day long.

487
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,760
What are you going to do?

488
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,060
Yes, Minsuk.

489
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,760
Thank you.

490
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,290
There's nothing to do because of Sunjeong.

491
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,560
She even shampooed father's hair yesterday.

492
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,160
He was so happy.

493
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,570
He thinks Sunjeong is a real caregiver.

494
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,990
Don't tell him anything.

495
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,090
If he finds out, he'll be upset.

496
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,240
I know.

497
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,590
Father went down for an exam.

498
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,060
I'll be with him today, so take your time.

499
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,560
Okay, thanks.

500
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,490
Hey, ugly girl, where are you going?

501
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,470
Who wants to know? Ugly man!

502
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,890
Get in before I change my mind.

503
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,330
Hey! Get in.

504
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,800
I don't get into the car with just any man.

505
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,240
I don't ask just any woman into my truck.

506
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,040
You went to the market?

507
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:10,840
Yes.

508
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,600
I'll take you home. I'm going that way.

509
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,170
Can I tag along with you today?

510
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,990
You want to?

511
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,970
I smell roasted sweet potatoes.

512
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,560
You have a sharp nose.

513
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,200
Miho loves roasted sweet potatoes.

514
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,330
Me too.

515
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,790
Right.

516
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,330
You do, too.

517
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,240
It's hot. Be careful.

518
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,370
Mmm... It's good.

519
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:52,330
You used to peel them for me before.

520
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,000
That night, your wife didn't say anything?

521
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,100
She said we looked good together.

522
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,790
She did?

523
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,470
I was worried that she might have felt something

524
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,970
and put you in a difficult situation.

525
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,830
She's not that interested in me.

526
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,240
Parcel service.

527
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,540
Yes, I'm on my way.

528
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,900
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

529
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,200
Minjung, let me help.

530
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,160
Where does this one go?

531
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,560
Number 404.

532
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,170
Parcel service.

533
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,600
Yes!

534
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,940
Is Mr. Kim Dohun here?

535
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,490
Huh? You're new?

536
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,200
No.

537
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,200
I'm just helping him today.

538
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,430
Oh, you're his wife!

539
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,970
Excuse me?

540
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,860
Yes.

541
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,160
Daebak,

542
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,170
I'm sorry.

543
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,490
About what?

544
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,370
Sangnam's getting married.

545
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,400
He is?

546
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,030
The woman came to the house.

547
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,970
Their parents are going to meet.

548
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,790
Don't tell my sister that.

549
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,100
I can't even bring myself to face her.

550
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,740
How could this happen to them?

551
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,500
Wang Daebak.

552
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,640
It's been a long time.

553
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,930
You won't shake my hand?

554
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,340
Are you mad?

555
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,100
You're you, and Gwangbak's Gwangbak.

556
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,260
Anyway, I'm sorry.

557
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,260
Daebak, I'll be waiting,

558
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,970
so come see me anytime.

559
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,160
When you get over this.

560
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:11,760
You could still see me.

561
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,500
I met you before meeting your sister.

562
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,540
Congratulations on your wedding.

563
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,160
So that's what love is?

564
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,430
If love is that easy,

565
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,240
I'm never going to fall in love.

566
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,900
[You are my sucker]

567
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,290
[File the number under spam?]

568
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,830
[Save]

569
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,040
You're coming from the market?

570
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,660
Teach your daughter some manners.

571
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,990
She won't even say hello to me.

572
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,900
Hello.

573
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,990
You go everywhere together, like twins.

574
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,640
Did you attend kindergarten together, too?

575
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,240
We work at the same place. That's why.

576
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,770
It's nice to work with my daughter.

577
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,540
You have lots of daughters. Are you jealous?

578
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,990
If you are, you could go to the cafe down

579
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,900
the street and serve coffee with Gwangbak.

580
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,290
What?

581
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,970
You didn't know?

582
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,470
I forgot to tell you at the funeral,

583
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,200
but everyone's talking about Gwangbak

584
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,640
serving coffee after she quit teaching.

585
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,870
You didn't know that?

586
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,940
How many people in your family work part time now?

587
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,660
Your brother in law, Gwangbak,

588
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,060
even Subak's working part time,

589
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,970
and you're a part time babysitter.

590
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,890
The whole family works part time.

591
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,440
You!

592
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,740
Mom...

593
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,870
When we marry,

594
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,700
I'll be faithful to you.

595
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,200
I can promise you that.

596
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,540
But..

597
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:21,040
If you catch me staring far away,

598
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,970
don't ask me what's wrong.

599
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,160
Other than that, I'll be faithful to you.

600
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,830
I know what you're talking about.

601
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,970
Everyone has memories.

602
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,100
Did you just propose to me?

603
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,600
I'm not one to make it into a big event.

604
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,400
And I'm not good at giving gifts.

605
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,790
My proposal was really boring,

606
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,700
but I hope you would understand.

607
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,140
It'll be like this after we're married, too.

608
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,560
I'm not the type of person who gets overly excited about special events.

609
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,300
It's the thought that counts.

610
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,430
We're very much alike.

611
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,830
What's wrong with you?

612
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,560
Are you out of your mind?

613
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,700
Tell me, what's wrong?

614
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,290
You quit teaching to become a writer,

615
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,640
so why are you serving coffee there?

616
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,000
Are you on something?

617
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,300
Even Yeongdal looks all glamorous,

618
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,700
running a make up shop with her mom,

619
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,330
and look at you right now!

620
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,990
You want me to have a stroke?

621
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:45,370
You want me to have a stroke and die?

622
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,560
Will you understand how furious I am then?

623
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,000
Gwangbak!

624
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,570
I don't believe her!

625
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,140
Ugh...

626
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,370
Mom, I'm home.

627
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,570
Can you come in here?

628
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,890
What is it, mom?

629
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,240
I saw something weird today.

630
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,930
Something weird?

631
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,430
Some woman go into Minjung's truck,

632
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,970
carrying a grocery bag.

633
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,040
I saw it on my way to the market.

634
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,440
She must be someone he knows.

635
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,970
She looked pretty young.

636
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,430
Maybe around your age?

637
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,060
She must be a customer.

638
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,030
He could give a ride to his customers.

639
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,700
Just forget it.
I'm not interested.

640
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,240
Even if he's cheating on me, I wouldn't care.

641
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,500
Mom, forget about it.
You'll get wrinkles.

642
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,030
How is this one?

643
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,370
Isn't it pretty?

644
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,290
Yes, yes. I got it.

645
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,470
I'll see you then.

646
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,830
- I'm home.
- Oh!

647
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,760
You're home.

648
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,140
How was it?

649
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,170
What do you mean?

650
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,630
How did you two get along?

651
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,540
Don't ask him too many questions.

652
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,830
You and I are nagging him so much that Sangnam won't ever date again.

653
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,430
He wouldn't have to. 
He's getting married.

654
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,530
I talked to her father just now,

655
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:29,000
and he wants to set the date right away.

656
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,400
She must have said nice things about you.

657
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,700
We don't have a lot of time.

658
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,330
Is it okay with you?

659
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,990
Do whatever you want.

660
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,100
Sangnam.

661
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,000
What is it, aunt?

662
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,840
Are you really okay with this?

663
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,700
What do you mean?

664
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,640
Meeting her parents means you're really getting married soon.

665
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:01,770
I know.

666
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,630
You'll be walking down the aisle in no time.

667
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,290
Are you sure you won't regret this?

668
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,440
I've made my decision, aunt.

669
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,470
She's a nice person.

670
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,500
She said yes to a man like me.

671
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,240
You shouldn't base your decision on that.

672
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,040
There's nothing wrong with you.

673
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,070
You can't marry someone because of that.

674
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:25,760
To be honest, I don't have feelings for her.

675
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,170
But she'll be nice to me,

676
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,130
she'll understand my situation,

677
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,440
and she'll be a decent wife.

678
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,440
Aunt, don't worry about me. Get some rest.

679
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,660
I want to go to bed early.

680
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,500
But you don't really love her.

681
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:44,040
I think you're being pushed into this.

682
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,700
You're in love with someone else.

683
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,540
Aunt,

684
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,400
please leave.

685
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,490
I want to take a shower.

686
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,040
It's me.

687
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,740
Talk to me, Sangnam.

688
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:22,440
It's me.

689
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,760
This will probably be

690
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,700
our last phone call.

691
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,870
Let's meet. Let's talk face to face.

692
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,970
There's no need for that.

693
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,370
I miss you.

694
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,990
I miss you so, so much.

695
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,130
Let's talk face to face, okay?

696
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:54,060
Where are you?
I'll come to you.

697
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:58,330
We should do this in person, okay?

698
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,270
I don't want to see you.

699
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,370
Not at all.

700
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,330
I told you. I'm a player.

701
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,200
I never date

702
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,330
anyone for more than a month.

703
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:26,040
You saw me earlier.

704
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,500
I'm seeing another woman,

705
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:35,130
so stop crying

706
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,240
and get over me.

707
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,670
You're skin and bones.

708
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,100
You should eat well,

709
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,470
sleep well,

710
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,470
don't trip and fall down,

711
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:59,370
and never look back.

712
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:05,370
And in the future,

713
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,430
if you run into me,

714
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,900
you should just slap me

715
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:20,330
and move on.

716
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,330
Goodbye.

717
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,160
Don't do stuff like that.

718
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,740
Go wash your face!

719
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,330
But I'm not going anywhere.

720
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,890
Did you brush your teeth?

721
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,440
I'll brush them after breakfast.

722
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,900
Excuse me,

723
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,860
do you have anything different?

724
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,900
Like what?

725
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,930
Something that brings the appetite back.

726
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,900
You can't have kimchi.

727
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,640
I'm not saying it has to be kimchi,

728
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:09,440
but I've been having indigestion lately.

729
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,200
Yes.

730
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,470
I'm having breakfast right now.

731
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,290
Today?

732
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,470
Okay.

733
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,800
I'm going out today. I'll be back late.

734
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,870
Sedal.

735
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,600
Where are you right now?

736
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:56,070
Don't ask me where I am.

737
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:59,470
I wish I could fart as much as I want.

738
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,160
What? Someone told you not to fart?

739
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,200
Something like that.

740
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:08,100
Mom, do you have kimchi?

741
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:10,540
Everyone has kimchi.

742
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:16,440
I would love to have some

743
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,630
kimchi and pork stew

744
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:22,870
with a bowl of rice.

745
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,640
Mom, can you come here?

746
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,000
What are you doing with that kimchi?

747
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,400
It's none of your business.

748
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,240
I'm sorry.

749
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,370
Ugh...

750
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:00,290
Oh, darn it!

751
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,030
Hello? Hey!

752
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:08,670
Thief! Robber! Robber!

753
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:13,000
Who was that? He's a robber?

754
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:15,970
No, he owes me money.

755
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,330
Friend!

756
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:21,340
Hello. You went to the bathhouse?

757
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,260
Yes.

758
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,740
Oh, he was filthy,

759
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:28,740
so I dragged him to the public bathhouse.

760
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:31,870
Where are you going?

761
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,330
There's somewhere we have to be.

762
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,890
Why, you're all grown up!

763
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:42,090
How come you don't come and visit anymore?

764
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:45,290
Both Gwangbak and Yeongdal are busy.

765
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,240
You're not getting married?

766
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,030
Mom, we should go.

767
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:51,940
Oh, okay. I'll see you again.

768
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,130
- Okay. 
- Goodbye.

769
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,030
What do you think about her?

770
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:10,100
What do you mean?

771
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,200
Oh, you're so dense!

772
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,890
You shouldn't even have to ask.

773
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,990
How is Yeongdal as your wife?

774
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,670
She was all smiling with her eyes.

775
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:22,260
Men must fall for her all the time.

776
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,700
She looks like she can have lots of kids,

777
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,330
and she looks like she could nurse an army!

778
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,260
That's how a wife should look, understand?

779
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,100
I don't.

780
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:32,470
Why you little...

781
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,890
Dream on! She likes rich men.

782
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,290
But do you like her?

783
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,490
What I think isn't important.

784
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,940
She only wants someone rich.

785
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,760
Like how I like rich women.

786
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:47,770
So we're like two parallel lines, mom.

787
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,300
Parallel lines?

788
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,470
Like railroad tracks.

789
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,100
They never meet together.

790
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:55,540
Why you little...

791
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:58,400
Loser hooked up with Hobak,

792
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,130
so why couldn't you hook up with his sister?

793
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,830
You're so dense! 
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo...

794
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,040
Oh...

795
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,660
You got a package.

796
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,740
Take a day off. You'll die this way.

797
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,890
I'm getting married.

798
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,560
Sunjeong.

799
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:08,700
Sangnam!

800
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,500
How do I look?

801
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:11,740
I don't even have to ask, right?

802
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,740
Right.

803
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:18,390
Are you ready?

804
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:23,500
Let's go.

805
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:27,070
Sangnam.

806
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:31,830
This is wrong. And you know it.

807
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,930
This isn't how you marry someone.

808
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:37,290
Living with another woman in your heart is hell.

809
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,970
Sangnam, let's cancel this.

810
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,930
She likes me and that's enough.

811
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,030
But you should like her, too.

812
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:52,140
You don't smile at all.

813
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,390
I haven't seen you smile at all lately.

814
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,430
You didn't smile once when she came here.

815
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:01,870
You used to smile even when you were alone.

816
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,200
When you were dating Gwangbak,

817
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,140
you laughed all the time.

818
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,700
You even whistled.

819
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:08,770
You were like this crazy man.

820
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:10,870
That's how it should be.

821
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,600
That's how love is.

822
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,090
Aunt.

823
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,600
It's over between us.

824
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,270
So don't talk about her.

825
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:29,100
Aunt.

826
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:34,030
Aunt!

827
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:38,270
What's wrong? Sunjeong!

828
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,700
Hello.

829
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:59,000
Let me ask you one thing.

830
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,290
What's going on with you and Sangnam?

831
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:06,040
We broke up.

832
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,500
For good?

833
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,790
Yes.

834
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,000
He sent me his ring back.

835
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,140
Sangnam met a woman.

836
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,990
I know.

837
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,370
We're meeting her parents today.

838
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,000
And we're going to set the date.

839
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,800
And it will be over for you two.

840
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,370
Is that really okay?

841
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:39,270
I think you two are still in love,

842
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,000
and you don't want to break up.

843
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:44,340
Am I wrong?

844
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,670
Tell him I wish him happiness.

845
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:57,790
And thank you for coming to see me. 

846
