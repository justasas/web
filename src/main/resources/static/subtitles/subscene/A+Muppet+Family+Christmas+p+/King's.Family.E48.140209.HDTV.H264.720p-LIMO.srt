00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,970
I'm begging you.

3
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,940
Please forgive my idiot daughter.

4
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,340
Do it for me, please.

5
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,390
Minjung.

6
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,590
Why did you come out?
You weren't asleep?

7
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,240
I woke up.

8
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,860
You weren't there.

9
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,470
What is it?

10
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,500
It's nothing.

11
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,730
Is something bothering you?

12
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,940
It's work stuff.

13
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,090
Let's go inside.

14
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,470
- Honey, honey.
- Yes, yes.

15
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,240
What is it?
You want water?

16
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,370
I don't want anything.

17
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,840
Why do you moan every night?

18
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,240
I do?

19
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,340
Don't you sit at your desk all day?

20
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,340
I'm getting old.

21
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,440
- Can I have some water?
- Sure.

22
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,070
What happened to your hand?

23
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,130
Let me see it!
Why is your hand all rough?

24
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,260
I got hurt working at the school.

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,540
Your hands used to be softer than mine.

26
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,970
Men's hands aren't that soft.

27
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,370
Stop talking and go back to sleep.

28
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,890
I'm not sleepy.

29
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,970
I have too many worries to sleep.

30
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,160
What are we going to do about Subak?

31
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,630
Why do you open your mouth?

32
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,440
That's what I want to know, too.

33
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,660
Why do I open my mouth when I do this?

34
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,000
Watching you put on makeup is interesting.

35
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,160
I used to be famous for wearing makeup.

36
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,030
You're bluffing again?

37
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,690
Why you little!

38
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,900
Mother, I'm going to work.

39
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,970
Okay. Watch out for the cars.

40
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,370
I will.

41
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,590
I'll walk out with you.

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,260
I'm going to start working again.

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,840
But you're pregnant.
Are you sure?

44
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,700
It should be better than being stuck at home.

45
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,630
Father, have a nice day.

46
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,460
I'm going to work, too.

47
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,890
Do you need help before I go?

48
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,130
It's okay.

49
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,190
Huh? Are you going somewhere?

50
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,130
Yes, I'm meeting someone.

51
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,940
Watch the store.

52
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,260
How is Subak treating you?

53
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,500
I think her father was pretty hard on her.

54
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,830
She looked depressed.

55
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,440
She's a huge problem for them.

56
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,370
She ruined the family, literally.

57
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,240
I feel sorry for her.

58
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,060
No one respects her and she got dumped.

59
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,560
She deserved to be dumped.

60
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,390
I would never do what she did.

61
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,790
I'm going to love only Don.

62
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,900
Right, Wang Dal?

63
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,790
Oh, boy.

64
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,670
Mom.

65
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,840
It's like you're our enemy!

66
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,340
This is all your doing!

67
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,440
You said you didn't but who else is there?

68
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,960
Why won't you believe me?

69
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,030
Why didn't you make Subak stop?

70
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,370
I tried.

71
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,940
But she wouldn't listen to me.

72
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,190
Then why didn't you tell me?

73
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,760
Or you should've kept your mouth shut.

74
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,160
You got your sister divorced.

75
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,190
Whose side are you on?
Minjung or Subak?

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,170
I want to be on Minjung's side, but I couldn't. Subak is my sister.

77
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,670
I'm mad at Minjung, too.

78
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,900
But why can't I believe you?

79
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,660
When your mom's really sick,

80
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,270
you should take time off to take care of me.

81
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,030
Oh, how annoying!

82
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,140
Get out! I don't want to see you.

83
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,660
Why are you taking it out on me?

84
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,560
I'm not coming back, so good luck.

85
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,630
Why that!

86
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,940
Hey!

87
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,290
Excuse me. Excuse me, there!

88
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,270
Oh, I'm so out of breath.

89
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,060
Why won't he even answer me?

90
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,590
Hello? Can you please come out of there?

91
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,900
Can you step out from there?

92
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,890
Hello, Mr. Security Guard?

93
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,870
Can I take these boxes here?

94
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,300
Oh, he looks just like my son.

95
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,060
My son is the vice principal at that school.

96
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,370
Everyone in the neighborhood respects him.

97
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,330
Thank you.

98
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,060
Oh, boy.

99
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,470
Oh, boy.

100
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,660
Thank you, thank you.

101
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,470
Oh, I got so lucky.

102
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,560
What's wrong?

103
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,090
You can't tell a towel and rag apart?

104
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,640
Help me turn around.
I'll get bedsores.

105
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,670
How...

106
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,540
Help me turn and put the pillow on my back.

107
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,560
I got it.

108
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,830
Oh, no!

109
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,730
You're such an idiot!

110
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,760
Why can't you do anything right?

111
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,830
Can you do anything right?

112
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,830
This is crazy.

113
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,530
What am I going to do with you?

114
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,800
You lost the house and had an affair.

115
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,540
I'm so furious!
You're driving me crazy!

116
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,140
Ouch...

117
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,330
Can you do anything right?

118
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,140
You can't take care of your kids, let alone take care of me!

119
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,960
So what do you want?

120
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,190
Dealing with you isn't easy!

121
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,330
Stop this, please!

122
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,130
Stop saying that!

123
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,490
I'm going crazy here, too!

124
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,530
Ouch...

125
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,440
Ouch...

126
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,960
Oh...

127
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,300
Now she's beating me up.

128
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,770
Oh, I'm dying here.

129
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,940
Hobak, you don't have to go your mom's?

130
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,490
I don't.

131
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,790
But you got the afternoons off for her.

132
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,500
Did something go wrong?

133
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,690
They can do fine without me.

134
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,890
Don't lift anything heavy.

135
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,100
I got a call asking me to look after you.

136
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,900
Who? Was it from Sedal?

137
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,900
Yes. He said you must be careful.

138
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,240
What the...

139
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,500
Anna, I better go.

140
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,260
You should. Or you'll feel badly.

141
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,160
- Take this.
- Oh!

142
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,940
Mom, I brought sweet potatoes.

143
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,740
You wretch. Why did you come? Go.

144
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,690
I don't need anyone.

145
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,640
What happened here?

146
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,900
Where is Subak?

147
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,330
I yelled at her and she left,

148
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,890
leaving all this behind.

149
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,740
I want to die.

150
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,360
Oh, even the blanket's wet.

151
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,760
How can she leave it like this?

152
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,370
Oh, boy.

153
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,990
I know it must be hard to just lie there all day.

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,490
But what else could you do?

155
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,290
Getting angry will frustrate you even more.

156
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,300
So don't say anything to Subak.

157
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,140
What's done is done.

158
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,670
She's probably the most upset of all of us.

159
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,060
Mom, let me change your blankets.

160
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,590
Oh, that's cold.

161
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,690
What is it?

162
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,960
Where are you?

163
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:32,940
At my mom's.

164
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,060
Again?

165
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,800
If something goes wrong, you're dead!

166
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,940
Whatever. Bye.

167
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,400
Hello? Hobak!

168
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,190
Oh, this is nuts.

169
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,890
Oh. Ugh...

170
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,940
Hobak! Hobak!

171
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,440
Okay! I'm coming!

172
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,330
What is it?

173
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,840
What do I do?

174
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,860
It's my stomach.

175
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,760
I didn't mean to.

176
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,960
It's okay.

177
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,330
Don't feel badly about anything.

178
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,540
I'll boil some water.

179
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,460
Oh, man! Get up.

180
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,800
Why did you come?

181
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,060
I said get up.

182
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,640
Man! Keep it down!

183
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,540
Man!

184
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,240
Don't!

185
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,990
Tell her, okay? Tell...

186
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,490
Man!

187
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,760
What's wrong with you?

188
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,800
This isn't helping me.

189
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,140
How can you do this?

190
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,970
Your doctor told you to be careful!

191
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,130
He said I'm fine.

192
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,970
Where's Subak?
Is she gone?

193
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,730
She's taking time off?

194
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,230
She's not.

195
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,490
She had an argument with my mom.

196
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,990
Unbelievable.

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,790
Your mom will finally know who cares more.

198
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,770
Wait, who am I kidding?

199
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,970
Don't do this.

200
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,040
I need peace of mind.

201
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,870
Doing this makes me feel at ease.

202
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,760
I don't feel at ease when I'm lying down.

203
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,240
What's done is done, so let this pass.

204
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,290
It'll only be for 2 weeks.

205
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,500
I don't get your family.

206
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,190
Subak has nothing to do,

207
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,040
so why must you take time off from work

208
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,040
and come here to take care of your mom?

209
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,370
Just go home and make me something yummy.

210
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,630
Okay?

211
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,440
Oh, man...

212
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,940
This is nuts.

213
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,640
I was afraid of getting married before,

214
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,740
but after meeting you, I want to do it.

215
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,090
When should we do it?

216
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,990
Give me some time.

217
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,830
I have grown up children,

218
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,460
so I can't just do what I want to do.

219
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,060
Are they against it?

220
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,490
They wouldn't believe I've been seeing you.

221
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,030
I've never dated anyone until now,

222
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,040
and I've been living like a nun.

223
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,370
Hold on.

224
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,560
Are your hands warm?

225
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,190
Yes, they are.

226
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,900
I think you're a player.

227
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,490
But I don't do this for just anyone.

228
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,590
I'll only do it for you.

229
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,260
I'll keep your hands warm.

230
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,240
And when we get married,

231
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,600
your feet, too.

232
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,960
What is it?

233
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,170
I want to carry you on my back.

234
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,460
Your feet must be hurting, right?

235
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,190
I'm okay.

236
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,790
Here, get on my back.

237
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,870
Here.

238
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,990
Here.

239
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,670
Yes!

240
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,270
Yay!

241
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,560
Oh!

242
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,470
Woohoo!

243
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,940
Oh, I'm dizzy, I'm dizzy.

244
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,460
Oh, no...

245
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,590
Let me get off.

246
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,890
Huh?

247
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,560
Sedal! Sedal!

248
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,800
Oh...

249
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,640
Sal...

250
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,590
Son?

251
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,770
Let's talk.

252
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,040
I have nothing to say.

253
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,940
I told you not to fall for it again.

254
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,640
He's not like that.

255
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,340
He's a really good man.

256
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,230
You should meet him.

257
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,590
When did you first meet him?

258
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,040
About 2 months ago.

259
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,370
2 months?

260
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,590
How can you know if he's good in 2 months?

261
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,440
You should give him a chance.

262
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,140
I don't want to talk to you.

263
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,670
Sedal.

264
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,240
I'm old now.

265
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,360
Now that Yeongdal's married, I'm so lonely.

266
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,890
You have me.

267
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,270
So why do you feel lonely?

268
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,100
You need a man to not be lonely?

269
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,260
You have Yeongdal and grandchildren, too!

270
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,270
You're saying that because you're young.

271
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,270
When you're old, you need a partner.

272
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,870
Think about it.

273
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,660
How would you feel if you didn't have Hobak?

274
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,170
You've been doing great until now.

275
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,830
It only looked like I was doing great.

276
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,390
I was miserable inside, but I laughed it off.

277
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,070
When people around me told me to remarry,

278
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,700
I didn't, because of you and Yeongdal.

279
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,870
Now you're all married, and I'm done,

280
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,040
so why can't I meet a man?

281
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,440
I don't want to be a burden for you.

282
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,760
Mom,

283
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,690
I haven't forgotten it.

284
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,690
It's still clear.

285
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,290
What is?

286
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,830
When you had a hair salon in Myeongdong,

287
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,740
you lost it all because of that bastard.

288
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:10,730
I was so scared about you running away.

289
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,290
I slept every night, holding on tightly to you.

290
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,560
I was scared you'd abandon me and Yeongdal.

291
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,600
I was only 9 years old.

292
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,970
You knew about that?

293
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,940
He left you in huge debt.

294
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,690
Don't you remember how you lost your

295
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,640
hair salon and how we ended up here?

296
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,640
Mom, snap out of it.

297
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,940
You can trust anyone!

298
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,100
They're all trying to take advantage of you.

299
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,670
You're running a makeup shop,

300
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,570
so he wants to swindle money from you.

301
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,260
He's not like that.

302
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,440
I didn't know you remembered that.

303
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,530
Oh, my...

304
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,260
But I never thought about abandoning you.

305
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,030
He told you to abandon us.

306
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,330
He did that every day.

307
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,470
I heard it all.

308
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,440
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

309
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,400
You were scared I might run away?

310
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,260
You thought I'd abandon you?

311
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,090
You're so thoughtful.

312
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:46,400
How could you bottle that up all these years?

313
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,800
Oh, I thought you were an immature boy.

314
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,440
I had no idea.

315
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,790
I won't run away. I can't.

316
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,630
How could I leave you behind?

317
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,130
- Mom.
- Sedal.

318
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,260
Mother, I'm home.

319
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,400
You're home?

320
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,400
Did you have dinner?

321
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,870
I didn't have much of an appetite.

322
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,230
With Anggeum lying on her back,

323
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,330
I lost my appetite and will to live.

324
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,470
Just give her a little time.

325
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,900
Bong,

326
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,140
I saw someone who looked just like you today.

327
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,770
You did?

328
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,760
Many people look alike.

329
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,130
But the similarity was only in appearance.

330
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,440
He was a security guard.

331
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,730
I see.

332
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,140
Mother said she saw a security guard who looks like you.

333
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,140
Who says we look alike?

334
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,170
We don't look alike at all.

335
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,490
It's raining outside.

336
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,760
- It is?
- Yes.

337
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,440
Where's Mr. Ko?

338
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,830
Should we call him?

339
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,060
Hey.

340
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,940
When are you coming home?

341
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,790
Oh, I meant to call you.

342
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,530
I have to work overtime.

343
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,790
So you're not coming home?

344
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,570
Okay. Be careful.

345
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,070
He has to work until morning.

346
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,440
He must be hungry, then.

347
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,030
He must be.

348
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,690
Should I make something for him?

349
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,370
Yes. He'll love it.

350
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,170
Let's see.

351
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,440
What should I make?

352
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,500
What are you doing?

353
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,830
Just wait.

354
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,270
I don't want to see you. Go home.

355
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,140
Minjung.

356
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,800
Please, please forgive me.

357
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,530
I'm sorry.

358
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,860
I know what I did was wrong.

359
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,270
I deceived you when I married you.

360
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:45,290
On top of that, I cheated on you.

361
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,660
You probably want to beat me to death,

362
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,070
but take pity on me and give me a chance.

363
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:00,100
Give me a chance to make it up to you.

364
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,940
I never cooked for you

365
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,640
or even washed your clothes.

366
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:16,670
I never cared for you when you were tired from delivering parcels.

367
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,370
I'm pathetic...

368
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,870
But please take pity on me.

369
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,170
I'll make it up to you. I will.

370
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,460
Just give me a chance.

371
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,640
Have you been drinking?

372
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,240
Don't do this. Go home.

373
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,490
I can't let another woman raise our kids.

374
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,530
I want to raise them with you.

375
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,730
They're our kids.

376
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,460
Please...

377
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,460
Forgive me.

378
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,190
Don't do this.

379
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,760
It's over between us.

380
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:21,400
I don't hate you or blame you anymore.

381
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:26,490
There's nothing left between us.

382
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,240
Please, please...

383
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,470
Subak,

384
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,060
you should go home.

385
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,440
I can't.

386
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,230
I won't unless you forgive me.

387
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,330
Stop this, please!

388
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,990
You're suffocating me.

389
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,060
You think this is easy for me?

390
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,140
You think I'm fine?

391
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:18,260
When I divorced you, my heart shattered for Jungji's sake.

392
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,490
So how can you do this now?

393
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,440
Please let me go!

394
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,540
Taxi!

395
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,260
I appreciate everyone working so late.

396
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:30,060
Can you reserve a restaurant for us?

397
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,400
I will, Mr. Ko.

398
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,400
Hello?

399
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,690
Dad!

400
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,230
Yes, Aeji.

401
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,030
There's a talent show at my kindergarten.

402
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,560
Are you coming?

403
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,170
I'm sorry, but I can't.

404
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,640
Go with mom.

405
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,540
But mom's sick!

406
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,640
Don't cry, Aeji. Dad will be there.\

407
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,590
Mommy.

408
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,690
Jungji.

409
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,800
You're here.

410
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,670
I heard you were sick.

411
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,690
But I had to come.

412
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,440
Thank you for coming.

413
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,230
Mom.

414
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,490
You're home early.

415
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,940
I think I'm catching a cold.

416
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,590
We should go see a doctor.

417
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,800
Mom, I saw Mr. Ko.

418
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,130
Where?

419
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,990
At Aeji's kindergarten.

420
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,190
He went to the talent show with Subak.

421
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,990
Mr. Ko is weird.

422
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,230
Why is he still seeing her?

423
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,100
It's because of Aeji and Jungji.

424
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:09,940
They still have to meet because of them.

425
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,260
But still.

426
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,170
It feels weird.

427
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,600
Come in.

428
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,640
What brought you here?

429
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,770
Have a seat.

430
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,400
I brought you some fruits.

431
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,570
I was feeling a bit hungry.

432
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,530
Let's eat together.

433
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,760
You eat.

434
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,990
It's good.

435
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,560
Why didn't you come home?

436
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,170
You said you'd come afterwards.

437
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,460
It ended in the morning.

438
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,490
I didn't call thinking you were asleep.

439
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,060
And I went to the sauna right after that.

440
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,390
I didn't know you could lie.

441
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,990
You promised to tell me how things were going.

442
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,530
You've been distant lately.

443
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:27,330
I saw you two on my way to bring you food.

444
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,300
Last night, in the rain...

445
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,690
I wasn't trying to hide it.

446
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,140
I didn't want to worry you.

447
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,690
They have nothing to do with me.

448
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,460
I'm completely over Subak.

449
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,230
Is that really possible?

450
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,400
- Trust me.
- Minjung,

451
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,230
let's really think about it.

452
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,230
Can you really sever all ties with her?

453
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,590
When her whole family wants you back,

454
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:56,740
can you really turn your back on them?

455
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,170
Let's say we raise the kids.

456
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,800
She'll keep calling you because of them,

457
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,660
and I won't feel comfortable watching that.

458
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,570
And you'll start lying "for my sake,"

459
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,240
and I'll start being suspicious.

460
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,760
And that will continue to happen.

461
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,440
- Sunjeong.
- Let me finish.

462
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,790
Only you can resolve this.

463
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,590
You didn't draw a line,

464
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,440
and that's why they keep coming back.

465
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,570
You need to be decisive on things like this.

466
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,370
How much more decisive must I be?

467
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,170
What else do you want me to do?

468
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,100
I should go?

469
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,570
I don't want to fight.

470
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,690
Can't you just wait for me?

471
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,940
Will I break my promise?

472
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,900
I promised to come to you.

473
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,870
So trust me and wait.

474
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,190
I can wait.

475
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,940
But why did you let Subak hug you?

476
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,100
Why couldn't you push her off?

477
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,690
That's who you are.

478
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,340
I don't need anything else, so be honest.

479
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,870
I don't want you to come out of promise.

480
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,000
I want you to truly want me.

481
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,030
If you want me, walk straight toward me.

482
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,590
Why should you falter on the way?

483
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,840
That's too sad.

484
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,730
It's not like that.

485
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,790
I'm not faltering.

486
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,170
I'm coming to you.

487
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,840
I've been coming to you.

488
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:36,140
It's hard for me, too, Sunjeong.

489
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,900
Why can't you give me a break?

490
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,570
She's my kids mom.

491
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,490
We had two kids together,

492
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,290
so how could I turn my back on her

493
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,760
whens he came to me drunk and

494
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,730
got down on her knees in the rain?

495
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,560
I got a cab for her and sent her home.

496
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,970
Was I supposed to step all over her and slap her face?

497
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,290
Is that what you want?

498
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,400
I don't know.

499
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,760
I don't know what either of us want.

500
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,460
Sunjeong,

501
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,670
I can't live without you.

502
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,300
You're the only woman who makes me laugh.

503
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

504
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,300
Mother.

505
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,140
What are you doing here?
You didn't go home?

506
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,300
I came back.

507
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,690
I ended things with him.

508
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,940
He beat me up because I didn't bring  money.

509
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,760
Can you give me some food?

510
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,900
Oh, that hit the spot.

511
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,690
How have you been?

512
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,690
That was quick.

513
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,900
When you're starving, nothing else matters.

514
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,840
Everyone who's full can think of others.

515
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,800
I didn't come here to ask for anything.

516
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,140
I came to see Sangnam one last time.

517
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,900
Are you going somewhere?

518
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,630
Yes, Dokdo Island.

519
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,960
Dokdo Island? Why?

520
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,540
To open a tea house.

521
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,670
What?

522
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,800
I want to run a tea house in Dokdo Island.

523
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,490
Can you do that?

524
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,860
You won't have any guests.

525
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,830
It's Korea, so why can't I open a tea house?

526
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,740
Japanese claim it's their land,

527
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,370
so I've decided to go there and protect it.

528
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,260
I'll go to Ulleungdo Island first.

529
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,130
If I can't, I'll open one in there.

530
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,690
When I open it, it'll be a huge success.

531
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,440
I'm going to quit chewing gum now.

532
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,970
It makes me look cheap.

533
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,440
Mother, this isn't much.

534
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,840
If you can't open a tea house, call me.

535
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,990
I'll talk to Sangnam for you.

536
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,990
Thanks, Gwangbak.

537
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,290
Visit me in Dokdo Island.

538
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:57,170
Sangnam is lucky to have you.

539
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:01,940
I'll buy you a brand name handbag after I get rich.

540
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:02,970
Okay.

541
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,270
Get on the bus, mother.

542
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,730
Come in.

543
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,560
Miho is already sleeping?

544
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,670
She has a cold, so she took some medicine.

545
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,360
Living here must be hard on her.

546
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,590
It's my fault.

547
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,260
Don't say that.

548
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,590
You shouldn't even think that.

549
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,190
Aunt, I'm going to China on business soon.

550
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,670
If anything happens, call me right away.

551
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,670
I'll drop everything and come back.

552
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,360
Take care of yourself.

553
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:01,460
But what about your wife and your father?

554
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,840
I know.

555
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,600
They'll fight again.

556
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,030
I'm sorry, Sangnam.

557
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,530
I feel badly for everyone.
You, your father,

558
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,170
and your wife, especially her.

559
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,590
Don't be, aunt.

560
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,730
You can't force love.

561
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,740
And you didn't do this on purpose.

562
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,500
Are you catching a cold, too?

563
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,940
You don't look so great.

564
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,590
Is something wrong?

565
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,300
No.

566
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,070
Aunt.

567
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,630
I don't know what to pack.

568
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,690
I'll pack.

569
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,670
How long will it take?

570
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,340
I don't know yet.

571
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,990
You haven't called aunt, have you?

572
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,440
I can't.

573
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,590
No, I don't want to.

574
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,130
She was worrying about you.

575
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,260
About you and father being left alone.

576
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,730
I know how good she was to me.

577
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,640
That's why it's even harder.

578
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,400
I can't hate her, so it's that much harder.

579
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,970
But Subak's my sister.

580
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,440
Aunt left the house for you.

581
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,300
Miho caught a cold.

582
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,490
You don't feel badly about that?

583
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,360
Put yourself in my shoes.

584
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,790
What if you had a brother and this happened?

585
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,240
I still can't understand you.

586
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,400
She's my aunt.

587
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,970
You'll have to see her since we're married.

588
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,500
What about my sister, then?

589
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,670
But this is neither of their faults.

590
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,490
Things just happened.

591
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,800
It's Subak and Minjung's issue, to be frank.

592
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,760
So why are you blaming my aunt?

593
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:07,830
Aunt didn't make this happen, but it was her who caused Minjung to make that decision.

594
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,300
We're repeating ourselves. Let's stop.

595
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,500
We must finish.

596
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,760
You can't leave things like this.

597
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,630
There's still time until your flight.

598
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,490
I have to do something at the airport

599
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,340
and keeping this up will lead to a fight.

600
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,670
We're already fighting.

601
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,030
We should finish it.

602
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,090
Finish what?

603
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,130
It'll be the same!

604
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,730
How can you do this?

605
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,440
You don't want to live with me anymore?

606
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,560
You're home, father.

607
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,840
How about dinner?

608
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,170
I already ate.
Where are you going?

609
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,170
To the supermarket.

610
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,470
What's that?

611
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,040
Huh? It's trash.

612
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,230
Are you...

613
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,840
Am I...

614
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:26,840
Sneaking things to my parents?

615
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,370
What?

616
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,970
Look.

617
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,300
You can check.

618
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,470
It's all trash.

619
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:43,670
I packed the trash to take to my parents.

620
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,440
What are you doing?

621
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,530
You were suspecting me of something.

622
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,960
When did I do that?

623
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,540
Father,

624
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,230
you've been disrespecting my parents.

625
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,200
I'm so disappointed in you.

626
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,840
My parents didn't raise me like that.

627
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,400
They didn't raise me as a thief.

628
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,170
This is my home, so why would I take anything?

629
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,940
Since you suspected me of stealing,

630
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,860
I'll take these to my parents.

631
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,770
Hey!

632
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,360
Please don't call me "hey."
I have a name.

633
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,490
I'm Wang Gwangbak.

634
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,840
Why that...

635
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,440
What are you doing?

636
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,830
Who cares what I'm doing...

637
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,530
Father.

638
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,170
What are you doing?

639
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,460
I'm drinking.

640
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,540
It's so nice to run into you here.

641
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,030
Remember this place?

642
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,700
When we were enemies,

643
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,640
we ran into each other here!

644
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,340
Father, have a drink with me.

645
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,440
This is embarrassing.

646
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,670
Let's go home.

647
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,790
But I have to finish this.

648
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:26,470
Father, I feel so happy.

649
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:34,740
I took the trash to my parents,

650
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,670
and they loved it, saying I've become a good girl.

651
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,990
They want me to bring it every day.

652
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,260
I have to collect all the trash now.

653
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,090
So I can take them to my parents.

654
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,440
Father, can I do that?

655
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:58,030
- Let's go home.
- Yes, let's.

656
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,230
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go.

657
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,440
Let's collect trash!

658
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,900
Oh!

659
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,490
Gwangbak.

660
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,070
Don't wobble when you walk!

661
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,400
Walk.

662
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,440
How embarrassing...

663
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,090
I can't believe this.

664
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,290
Oh!

665
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,700
Drink. Drink and snap out of it.

666
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:23,540
What? Your parents loved the trash?

667
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,690
You're trying to make me mad?

668
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,270
You were being suspicious of me.

669
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,940
Don't disrespect my family.

670
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,170
I'm not a beggar.

671
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,130
I wouldn't take side dishes to my parents.

672
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:44,370
If I were to steal, I wouldn't be so petty.

673
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:48,360
When did I do that?

674
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,990
When I said "Are you?" before,

675
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,490
I was going to ask if you were going out

676
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,860
now that Sangnam went on a business trip!

677
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,990
I'll talk to you when you're sober.

678
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,260
When Sangnam comes back, move out.

679
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,170
Ha! I'm not moving out.

680
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,800
Why? You want this house?

681
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,290
How did you know?

682
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,840
I can't move out of such a nice house.

683
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:17,340
I'm going to stay and inherit this house.

684
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:20,140
I've been counting the days.

685
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:24,170
Didn't you see the circles on my calendar?

686
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,590
Buying a house in Korea is really tough.

687
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,960
I'm not going to miss this chance.

688
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,940
Look at my parents.

689
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:36,240
Subak ruined them.

690
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,940
They're in complete ruins!

691
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:44,590
Father... My poor father...

692
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,670
Mom... Mom...

693
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,800
Is this a monologue?

694
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,100
Father,

695
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,960
please stop hating me.

696
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,700
I don't want to but I keep making mistakes.

697
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:05,040
And I keep saying the wrong things.

698
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,440
This is my first time being married,

699
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:13,360
so can you please be more understanding...

700
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,400
I have to take the trash...

701
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,590
Hey!

702
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,140
Are you dead? Huh?

703
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,990
Please check the rest and send them.

704
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,900
- Okay, I will.
- Yes.

705
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,940
I'm working late again.
Don't wait up for me.

706
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,260
Ouch!

707
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,340
I...

708
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,360
Father.

709
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,570
Father.

710
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,700
Father, I'm so sorry.

711
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:27,840
I can't believe I got drunk and did all that.

712
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:30,670
I deserve to be beaten to death.

713
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,940
I'll gladly take any punishment you give me.

714
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,970
If you want me to put my arms up, I will.

715
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,640
If you want to whip my calves, you can.

716
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:41,800
I must have been out of my mind.

717
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,870
Please forgive me.

718
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:46,490
I'm sorry, father.

719
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,570
Father.

720
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,300
Father?

721
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,070
I've made soup for you.

722
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,440
You embarrassed me in front of everyone when you got drunk.

723
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:29,670
Poor me. Why do I bother living?

724
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,300
I'm leaving the house for a while.

725
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,300
I'm going to school.

726
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,470
Daebak,

727
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,370
what does your father do at school?

728
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:57,290
Why has he been so busy?

729
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:59,070
But he's not at school.

730
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,140
What?

731
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,830
I mean, I haven't seen him.

732
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,340
Tell me what that was about.

733
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,570
Why isn't your father at school?

734
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,670
I don't know.

735
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,230
Daebak!

736
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,200
Why that little...

737
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,260
Mother! Mother!

738
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:20,030
She's summoning me from her room.

739
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,630
You should go before she gets angry.

740
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,070
You should humor her now and teach her a lesson when she's better.

741
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,600
I will.

742
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,290
Of course. Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

743
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,470
What do you want?

744
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,500
Please sit down.

745
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,000
I'm sitting down. So what?

746
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,170
Where was that building?

747
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,700
What building?

748
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:48,040
Where you saw the man who looks like Bong.

749
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,760
Being stuck here is really frustrating.

750
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,170
Can you go and meet that security guard?

751
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:58,200
You're not doing it right.

752
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,740
Put some elbow grease on it!
Elbow grease!

753
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,170
- There, right there.
- Oh, okay.

754
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,030
You have to wipe it clean.

755
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,940
Okay, I will.

756
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,670
Get some fresh water.

757
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,260
That water's too dirty.

758
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,360
Okay.

759
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,000
Bong.

760
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,300
Mother.

761
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,740
Don't tell Anggeum since she's sick.

762
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,300
Get up right now.

763
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,140
Your back isn't broken!

764
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,670
It is.

765
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,570
Anggeum, how can you do this!

766
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,840
Bong quit school and he is working as a security guard!

767
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,640
Wha...

768
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,730
What did you say?

769
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,500
Mom!

770
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,190
That security guard was Bong?

771
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,540
He was down on his knees,

772
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,440
wiping the stairs clean.

773
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,190
This is all your fault!

774
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,500
Grandmother, let's talk outside.

775
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,690
Let go of me!

776
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,540
Mom, what did you say about Bong?

777
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,400
What do we do?

778
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:31,070
I don't need any of you!

779
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,990
I don't need you or your daughters!

780
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,690
You're sucking the life out of my son!

781
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,240
Mom, come out.

782
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:46,170
Look what your daughter Subak did to us!

783
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,360
Look what you did to my son, Bong!

784
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:53,530
If it weren't for you, he'd be happily retired!

785
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,960
This is all your fault!
You did that to Bong!

786
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,970
Divorce him! Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo!

787
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,800
- Mom, mom.
- Let go of me!

788
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,490
Let go!

789
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,530
Let me have the phone.

790
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:13,870
Call him later, mom.

791
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,790
Father had his reasons.

792
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,440
Give it to me!

793
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,490
Hello?

794
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,960
Is this school?

795
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,600
Can I talk to the president?

796
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,400
Mom.

797
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:51,170
I'm vice principal Wang Bong's wife.

798
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:56,260
How could you fire him like that?

799
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:59,940
Why couldn't you tell him in advance?

800
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,440
He gave his whole life to teaching,

801
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,700
but you fired him just like that?

802
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,440
He worked so hard for your school!

803
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:16,030
To him, school was most important.

804
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,990
In his sleep, when he was awake,

805
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,990
when it snowed or rained,

806
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,230
he only thought about the school.

807
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:30,260
What?

808
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:32,300
What was that?

809
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,300
You stay right there!

810
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,670
I'm sorry.

811
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,700
My wife's a bit upset.

812
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,470
I'll drop by later.

813
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,840
What did you do?

814
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:52,600
They gave you until the end of the month?

815
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,900
But you resigned?

816
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:01,990
Why didn't you beg them to let you stay?

817
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,530
What do we do now?
We don't have anything!

818
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:11,070
How could you quit your job?

819
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,800
Mom, stop it.
It's hard for father, too.

820
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:18,490
Then why did he have to resign?

821
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,570
He should've sucked up!

822
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,490
Fine. I'm sorry.

823
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,340
I'm sorry for not sucking up.

824
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:29,760
Is being a teacher that great?

825
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:31,730
I guess I'm useless.

826
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,270
I'll go and kill myself!

827
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:37,200
Father.

828
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:38,270
Father!

829
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,970
Father!

830
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,900
Father, stop!

831
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,230
Father!

832
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,700
Father! Ouch...

833
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:00,530
Father...

834
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,740
You get out, too!

835
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,800
Why didn't you tell me?

836
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,860
It wouldn't have changed anything.

837
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:19,990
I could've gone to the school and begged.

838
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,260
You're really sly.

839
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:25,070
You broke up your sister's marriage

840
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,300
and didn't tell me about your father.

841
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:30,400
I don't know what you're thinking.

842
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,360
I can't love you. I just can't.

843
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,230
Get out! I don't want to see you.

844
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:25,090
Sedal, it's me. Doctor.

845
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,170
I need my doctor.

846
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,740
Okay. Wait for me.

847
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:39,990
Hobak didn't tell you?

848
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,340
I asked her about Subak, 

849
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,300
but she wouldn't say a word.

850
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:49,100
So don't blame Hobak.

851
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:52,590
Then how did you find out?

852
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:58,360
I overheard you talking.

853
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,490
What happened?

854
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,170
What happened to our baby?

855
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,940
I'm sorry.

856
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:15,360
She should've been more careful.

857
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,240
How about my wife?

858
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,570
She's fine.

859
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,730
Man...

860
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,170
Sedal, I'm sorry.

861
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,590
I'm sorry.

862
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,070
That wasn't just any baby.

863
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:05,440
It was a bridge that connected us again.

864
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,900
I thought of it as a chance from god.

865
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:16,530
A chance for me to make up for everything.

866
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:20,260
Using the baby as an excuse,

867
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,690
I wanted to pamper you like a queen.

868
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,590
I'm sorry.

869
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,760
I'm not letting them get away with this.

870
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,030
Sedal!

871
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,530
Sedal, no!

872
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,130
Don't!

873
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,060
Mother, I can't believe you.

874
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,600
She was pregnant, didn't you know?

875
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:04,630
What?

876
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,460
Hobak is pregnant?

877
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:08,560
She had a miscarriage.

878
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,990
She's at the hospital now.

879
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:16,240
Her doctor told her to be careful,

880
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:21,700
but she took care of you, changing your diapers.

881
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,970
She withstood all your complaining,

882
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,900
she let you take everything out on her.

883
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:31,670
She changed your diapers, for god's sake!

884
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,260
So how could you hate her so much?

885
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:38,030
You're horrible.

886
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,130
Subak, you're horrible, too!

887
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,470
Is Hobak the only one you can order around?

888
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,200
You have Subak and Haebak.

889
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:50,740
What have you ever done for her?

890
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:54,000
When she got pregnant, we were so happy.

891
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,940
I wanted to treat Hobak well.

892
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:02,740
We're not coming back here again.

893
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:05,070
If I don't look after her,

894
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,940
you'll work her to death.

895
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:10,300
Goodbye.

896
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,940
You're driving me crazy.

897
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:29,940
I can't even stay here because of you.

898
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,070
Are you out of your mind?

899
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,100
Don't yell at Sedal.

900
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,540
Father.

901
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:40,630
You should've told us.

902
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,860
You silly girl.

903
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:46,670
You're too tight lipped for your own good.

904
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,340
Hobak, I'm sorry...

905
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,990
I'm so sorry. 
I don't know what to say.

906
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,360
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

907
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:56,630
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

908
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,400
What about mom?

909
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:03,670
How could you leave her alone?

910
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,170
She fell down on her way here.

911
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,760
Really?

912
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,970
Subak is with her.

913
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,800
Your mom was crying.

914
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,690
Mom did?

915
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,240
Yes. She was sobbing.

916
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,340
She wants you to come over.

917
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,590
Father,

918
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,030
I want to see mom.

919
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,860
I'm coming right now.

920
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,600
Okay. Let's go.

921
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,470
Mom.

922
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,870
Mom.

923
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,900
If I could get up,

924
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:21,470
I get down on my knees.

925
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:29,970
I don't know why I was so mean to you.

926
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,740
Maybe it's because you were an easy target.

927
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:35,870
I made you change my diapers.

928
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:38,670
I took my anger out on you.

929
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,990
Who would be a better daughter than you?

930
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,990
I'm sorry.

931
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,900
I'm sorry, too.

932
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:53,240
I wasn't very sweet to you.

933
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,700
And I only cared about money.

934
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:59,100
I craved for your affections,

935
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,590
but I never did anything to deserve it.

936
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,130
Everyone deserves love.

937
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:09,030
All children deserve love.

938
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:15,140
I never even brushed your hair for you.

939
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:22,870
I'll be a good mother to you from now on.

940
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:25,630
I'll be good to you.

941
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:33,460
I love you.

942
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,340
I'm sorry and I love you.

943
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,290
Mom.

944
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:43,070
Oh, Hobak.

945
