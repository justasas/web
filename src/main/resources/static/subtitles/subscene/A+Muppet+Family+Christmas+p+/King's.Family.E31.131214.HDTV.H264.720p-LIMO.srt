2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,690
You look good. Good luck, okay?

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,890
Let's do this.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,350
Yeah!

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,520
I think I've seen his aunt from somewhere.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,210
I'm sure you did. 
We live in the same neighborhood.

7
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,820
We will now begin the presentation...

8
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,190
Of Choi Sangnam and Wang Gwangbak's...

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,480
Official wedding plans.

10
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,440
What was that?

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,920
Just hold on.

12
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,420
We will present the plans for our wedding.

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,090
And the plans for our future to all of you.

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,450
First, the wedding will be within this year.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,450
Can we get things ready?

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,920
I know.

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,820
There's not enough time.

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,850
There's nothing to get ready.

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,210
We're going to have a small wedding.

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,920
We're going to have it at a nice restaurant.

21
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,590
And not at a wedding hall?

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,210
We should have it at a hotel.

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,310
A restaurant is not...

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,620
It's going to be small but meaningful.

25
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,650
We're inviting 30 guests per family, making it 60 guests in total.

26
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,490
Thirty?

27
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,180
I have over 100 friends, and from business,

28
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,210
I can't even count!

29
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,510
You know how many friends I have?

30
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,450
Remember how big our family is?

31
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,350
Grandmother, uncle, you, me,

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,150
Subak's family, Hobak's family, and... What?

33
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,840
There are at least 300 outside the family.

34
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,250
We could fill a soccer field.

35
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,450
My husband has thousands of students.

36
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,290
Let's move on for now.

37
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,220
Second,

38
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,350
we won't buy any furniture or wedding gifts.

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,040
We're fine with these wedding bands.

40
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,040
Not buying any new furniture is good.

41
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,450
All kinds of problems arise because of that.

42
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,820
You did well there.

43
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,850
We should get what we're supposed to get!

44
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,290
Sunjeong, this is nonsense, right?

45
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,320
Let's hear them out first, Daese.

46
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,620
But you should give the bride her gifts.

47
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,010
She'll only get married once,

48
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,710
and that's all she'll get out of it.

49
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,720
Excuse me, but we're not finished yet.

50
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,020
Please let us finish the presentation.

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,350
Continue.

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,190
Gwangbak will move in with me.

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,620
You're not letting them move out?

54
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,610
My house is huge and he's my only son.

55
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,680
I never even considered it.

56
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,350
The size of your house doesn't matter!

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,980
You shouldn't live with your married son.

58
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,680
Who lives with a single father in law?

59
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,350
We renovated the second floor recently,

60
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,120
so it should be okay for newlyweds.

61
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,340
But taking care of a single father in law is hard.

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,420
I'm letting them live with me.

63
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,640
I don't have to rely on my son and his wife.

64
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,390
I can support myself.

65
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,140
So buy them a house and...

66
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,810
We'll live there for 3 years,

67
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,620
save enough money, and move out.

68
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,950
Gwangbak is handing out a report on my financial state and future goals.

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,220
My savings, salary and business plans.

70
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,690
Please read it.

71
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,010
I know this wasn't what you expected,

72
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,350
but we decided to tell you how we plan

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,890
on living our lives in the future.

74
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,690
The important thing is that we will always support each other's dreams.

75
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,690
And the biggest part of our married life

76
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,750
will be us, second will be our children,

77
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,850
and third will be each other's family.

78
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,220
Okay.

79
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,580
The vice principal's wife?

80
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,010
You call her.

81
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,190
Hey, hello?

82
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,710
They always ask me to run errands.

83
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,340
They know she and I aren't close.

84
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,240
What is it?

85
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,050
They switched the meeting dates and asked me to tell the vice principal's wife.

86
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,820
Should I go tell her?

87
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,250
Good boy.

88
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,720
Ugh.

89
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,190
Hello?

90
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,920
Hello?

91
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,810
Isn't anybody home?

92
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,120
Mom!

93
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,640
You, you, wha, what are you doing here?

94
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,340
You think I came to see you?

95
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,610
My mom sent me.

96
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,620
The meeting has been moved to tomorrow,

97
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,140
and if she doesn't show again, she'll pay a fine.

98
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,980
I blame the alcohol.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,490
I agree!

100
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,120
Goodbye.

101
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,620
This is crazy!

102
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,510
What do you mean by that?

103
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,010
They will visit their in laws in turns on holidays.

104
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,820
That's what people do these days.

105
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,420
But that's nonsense!

106
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,910
Why is that?

107
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,410
It took just as much efforts to raise my daughter!

108
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,390
They're not even married yet.

109
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,340
Let's leave it up to them.

110
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,040
And we can't give you any allowances.

111
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,850
No way! You have to!

112
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,080
I worked hard to raise you!

113
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,010
We'll do it on your birthdays and holidays.

114
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,490
We have to buy a house and raise children.

115
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,150
If we want to move out, we must save money.

116
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,710
But if you're in trouble, we'll help.

117
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,980
Oh, boy.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,950
By the way, why did you get a divorce?

119
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,480
Mom, we shouldn't talk about that...

120
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,250
Sons take after their fathers.

121
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,080
We have to sort this out for prevention.

122
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,450
Who knows if you cheated or were violent?

123
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,550
I understand why you'd be curious,

124
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,820
but my brother in law isn't like that.

125
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,690
It was because of financial reasons.

126
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,510
It had nothing to do with his character.

127
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,510
You keep butting in,

128
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,990
but you're only his aunt, not his mother.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,010
I'm not really sure why you're here.

130
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,320
Had I known, I would've brought my family, too.

131
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,290
She's not just his aunt.

132
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,710
To Sangnam, she's like his mom.

133
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,640
Then she'll continue to live with you?

134
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,340
Of course. We're family.

135
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm already upset they're not getting their own place,

136
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,620
and they have to live with her, too?

137
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,820
I'm upset about having my son get married

138
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,420
without getting proper gifts from your daughter.

139
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,140
I hope he's good to my family.

140
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,540
I have two son in laws, and they're great.

141
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,040
I hope he learns from them and be just as great.

142
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,590
You might have several son in laws, 

143
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,480
but I'll only have one daughter in law.

144
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,510
She'll be too busy being my daughter in law to pay attention to her family.

145
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,990
I said yes only because they're in love.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,350
Doctors and judges wanted to meet Gwangbak.

147
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,180
- She's joking.
 - I'm telling the truth.

148
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,620
She almost met that doctor the other time.

149
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,190
No, I wasn't going to meet him.

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,620
Why can't I say it?

151
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,620
It's the truth.

152
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,640
Everyone wanted her as their daughter in law.

153
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,220
I'm sure, but my son is just as desirable.

154
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,350
Women lined up to meet him.

155
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,990
Then why didn't you find someone else?

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,040
You think I'm happy about your daughter?

157
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,680
Then why did she take the audition?

158
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,620
Audition?

159
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,350
Audition?

160
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,850
What is he talking about?

161
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,120
Did you come here to work or goof around?

162
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,950
If you're weak, you shouldn't have come!

163
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,040
- I'm sorry.
- Man...

164
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,640
He won't even call.

165
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,310
What if he's starving himself?

166
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,390
And it's freezing outside.

167
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,350
He won't go starving.

168
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,690
He's too clever.

169
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,310
I'm sure he's getting food from somewhere.

170
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,750
Yeongdal, get the most popular gift set and all the samples there are.

171
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,010
For what?

172
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,620
Didn't you see?

173
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,220
Her mom is just like her.

174
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,350
Like mother, like daughter! Just think!

175
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,820
She has an attitude, don't you think?

176
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,680
She kept talking back to me.

177
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,580
I would never have said yes had I known.

178
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,990
How could she be so brazen?

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,280
Maybe I shouldn't have gone.

180
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,340
Forget it.

181
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,450
They have no right to say to stay or leave.

182
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,780
His father has an attitude problem.

183
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,210
Did you see how he was dressed?

184
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,950
How could he wear such a tight suit?

185
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,540
I was worried his pants might rip open.

186
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,640
If I had the body, I'd like  to wear that, too.

187
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,590
Really tight.

188
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,250
Gross.

189
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,250
Why do they want such a wedding?

190
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,120
People might think we're embarrassed about our son in law.

191
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,140
That's what decent people do these days.

192
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,280
We've experienced it with Subak and Hobak.

193
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,840
It was just crowded and complicated.

194
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,120
But I can't accept it.

195
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,250
I've spent a lot on the weddings of my friends kids!

196
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,540
Don't think like that.

197
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,180
All I have is one son.

198
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,910
No wedding gifts?
That's so inconsiderate.

199
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,180
How can he do that to me?

200
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,640
What if people ask me what I got from Gwangbak?

201
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:33,680
They'd think I didn't get anything because Sangnam wasn't good enough for her!

202
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,280
Then you'll have to give gifts to the bride.

203
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,210
What I want is to give and take.

204
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,290
I think the kids are being wise.

205
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,120
It's a huge waste of money.

206
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,640
I had a fancy wedding, but it was useless.

207
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,510
I was actually proud of them today.

208
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,010
They obviously gave it a lot of thought.

209
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,810
It's because you're only his aunt.

210
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,610
You'd feel different if you were his mom.

211
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,280
And didn't you hear?

212
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,280
They want him to be like their son.

213
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,010
Over my dead body!

214
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,910
A wedding isn't a joke.

215
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,580
No wedding gift?
You get only one wedding!

216
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,220
I can't blame anyone.
Gwangbak's so stupid.

217
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,850
I heard single father in laws are horrible.

218
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,510
I can see how miserable she'll be.

219
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,510
You embarrassed yourself at lunch.

220
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,120
Why? I asked what needed to be asked.

221
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,010
Why would you mention doctors and judges?

222
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,680
How could he hold an audition?

223
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,110
They're all the same!

224
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,780
Daughter in law audition? I'd never!

225
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,340
I couldn't believe my ears.

226
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,950
Oh, that's one down.

227
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,680
Now that our parents have met,

228
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,480
we can start planning for our wedding.

229
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,540
My husband.

230
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,440
You'll be my husband now.

231
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,540
But I'm worried about my mom.

232
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,080
I'm worried about my father.

233
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,720
I'll see your mother once in a while,

234
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,590
but you'll see my father every day.

235
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,490
Can you deal with that?

236
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,640
With the power of love, I shall endure!

237
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,010
Yes!

238
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,640
I won the daughter in law audition.

239
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,310
We won't let anything bother us.

240
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,340
You take your mother and I'll take my father.

241
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:32,510
And don't pass on any bad news.

242
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,990
Okay.

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,540
We can do it.

244
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,810
Sangnam.

245
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,680
I can't believe what you did!

246
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,440
Why would you enter an audition?

247
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,710
How can you be so man-crazy?

248
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,910
You danced with random girls and raced carrying a pillow?

249
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,250
You even did a triathlon?

250
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,950
Had I known, I wouldn't have said yes.

251
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,440
Is he a prince?
Is he a millionaire?

252
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,540
Have you no pride?

253
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,410
I can't believe you're doing this.

254
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,140
You auditioned to marry a high school dropout?

255
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,350
That audition thing was too much.

256
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,350
Why did you come?

257
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,280
What do you think?

258
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,910
It's because you're my son.

259
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,590
I wasn't there for you,

260
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,190
and I'm going to make it up starting now.

261
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,080
I don't know what your dad told you,

262
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,890
but that's not the truth.

263
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,940
You should hear my side, too.

264
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,080
I have so much to tell you.

265
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,420
But we'll do that later.

266
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,280
I couldn't help it.
I hope you understand.

267
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,820
I've always missed you, Sangnam.

268
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,180
The few years I have left in life,

269
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:37,610
I'd like to dedicate to you, beg for forgiveness.

270
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,990
I'm over him.
We're done for good.

271
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:49,640
I had to act like I wasn't happy to see you because of him. I had to.

272
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,720
You understand, right?

273
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,810
He's been beating me all this time.

274
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,510
Sangnam, I don't want anything else.

275
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,140
I just want to be able to see you.

276
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,220
Who's decision was it to skip gifts?

277
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,250
Was it that rude girl's idea?

278
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,410
No, it wasn't, father.

279
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,390
She didn't talk you into it?

280
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,350
She wouldn't, and I wouldn't fall for it.

281
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,550
You should know me better than that.

282
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,390
And stop calling her "that rude girl."

283
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,780
She'll be my wife.

284
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,810
She'll be your daughter in law.

285
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,890
We don't know that yet.

286
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,810
I won't let you do it like this.

287
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:54,390
How dare she try to skip buying furniture and wedding gifts for her in laws?

288
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,440
But we don't need any new furniture.

289
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,980
And wedding gifts are useless.

290
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,590
Think of this as you getting a daughter.

291
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,490
That's gift enough.

292
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,280
They're getting a son, too!

293
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,080
I want to do everything other people do.

294
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,640
Oh, you're not being yourself.

295
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:17,140
Father, please let us do what we want.

296
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,750
It they offer,

297
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,190
I would say, "Oh, there's no need."

298
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,580
That's how it should be done.

299
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,550
You can't just announce it like this.

300
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,140
I'm the one getting married here.

301
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,240
Making money isn't easy.

302
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,310
So I don't want to waste it on that.

303
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,990
I'd rather invest it in my company or put it towards buying a house.

304
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,240
Father, we're not losing anything here.

305
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,480
We're actually getting a family member.

306
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,010
They're losing a daughter.

307
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,820
If anything, they should be mad.

308
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,250
Don't you think so, father?

309
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,410
He's fallen completely for that rude girl!

310
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,980
And I was so good to him!

311
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,840
I feel like I'm losing my son.

312
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,910
All parents with sons feel that they're losing their sons to the wives.

313
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,740
Wait and see.

314
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,580
He'll act like their son and not mine.

315
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,410
That rude girl will make him.

316
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,410
Just look at her mom!

317
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,320
They'll partner up and make him miserable.

318
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,890
You're acting like an evil mother in law.

319
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,620
What is it?
Did father say something?

320
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,620
You should try to understand your father.

321
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,850
I was proud of you both,

322
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,050
but your father might feel disappointed.

323
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,190
He's different from other fathers.

324
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,980
He raised you alone all those years.

325
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,890
He's not only been a dad, but a mom, too.

326
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,350
Don't try to force him.
Give in a little.

327
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,680
That'll make things easier for Gwangbak.

328
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,820
We want to do this our way.

329
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,620
If we give an inch, he'll take a mile.

330
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,890
It's not just our family.

331
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,590
Gwangbak's family must want something, too.

332
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,680
And our plans will be ruined.

333
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,440
Then try talking to him nicely.

334
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,590
Or you'll make things hard for Gwangbak.

335
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,680
For some reason, you're being really harsh on your father about your marriage.

336
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,140
It's because I have to.

337
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,140
He deserves compassion.

338
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,980
You know it, too.

339
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,710
Being a single father isn't easy.

340
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,780
I'm raising Miho by myself,

341
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,950
but it is far from easy.

342
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,780
For men, it's even harder.

343
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,940
You should rest.

344
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,620
Aunt Sunjeong.

345
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,440
Yes?

346
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,810
It's nothing.

347
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,950
What is it?

348
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,740
Maybe later.

349
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,280
Okay.

350
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,390
Sangnam,

351
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,480
how many years do you think I have left?

352
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,940
I want to be there for you.

353
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,690
These are the most popular items.

354
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,320
Women just love them.

355
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,350
And these are some samples.

356
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,390
They are all the samples we have.

357
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,440
You like samples.

358
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,440
What's going on?

359
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,040
You didn't want to give me any before.

360
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,250
Anyway, thank you.

361
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,090
Hobak,

362
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,320
about Sedal...

363
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,390
Don't talk to me about him.

364
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:54,550
Can you take Sedal back?

365
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,940
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

366
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,350
Hobak.

367
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,320
Over my dead body.

368
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,640
Why? He wants to come back now?

369
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,820
Why wouldn't he?
He has his sons!

370
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,050
I can't even reach him, so please tell him

371
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,950
to meet me tomorrow noon at the courthouse.

372
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,390
I can't reach him.
I don't know where he is.

373
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,020
I don't believe you.

374
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,750
I know you're in touch with him.

375
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,640
I don't want these.

376
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,850
Please, take them.
I won't talk about him.

377
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,620
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

378
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,980
Get away from there.

379
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,440
That's my place!

380
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,450
It's first come first...

381
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,410
Okay.

382
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,910
I was trying to keep it warm for you.

383
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,420
Good night.

384
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,750
I'm going to work.

385
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,480
Oh, you should have breakfast.

386
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,180
I don't have time for it.

387
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,940
Wake the boys up and send them to school.

388
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,180
Sit down and have a bite.

389
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,540
You can't go to work on an empty stomach.

390
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,550
I made tofu stew, your favorite.

391
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,020
I'm not hungry.

392
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,850
And find a place to move out to.

393
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,710
Well, Hobak.

394
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,440
If we moved out, will you take Sedal back?

395
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,390
Don't try to negotiate with me.

396
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,020
Nothing you say will change my mind.

397
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,590
You're so mean!

398
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,520
You should give your husband a chance.

399
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,920
How can you be so selfish?

400
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,140
You should think of your sons.

401
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,290
Don't you feel feel sorry for them?
They miss their dad!

402
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,690
You want them to grow up fatherless?

403
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,350
They'll have to deal with it.

404
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,850
I can't help it.

405
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,910
Please find an apartment and move out.

406
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,440
Oh, Sedal's driving me crazy!

407
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,210
Why did you have him in the first place?

408
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,210
Don't say that.

409
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,550
My heart is breaking for him.

410
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,140
Just thinking of him makes me cry.

411
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,320
Where is he staying?

412
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,090
He was kicked out in his boxers.

413
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,290
I can't help but cry.

414
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,020
- Come back for more.
- Thank you.

415
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,190
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

416
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,140
I'm home.

417
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,890
Have you been to the hospital?

418
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,240
Hospital?

419
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,610
I'm not sick.

420
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,320
Where your father in law is!

421
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,350
He has a caregiver.
And I'm busy.

422
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,250
But you're his daughter in law.

423
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,910
You should visit.
He's being discharged soon.

424
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,720
Hello.

425
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,320
He just fell asleep.

426
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,020
Thanks for everything.

427
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,650
The bed sheet looks a bit...

428
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,680
Try to replace them often.

429
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,290
I changed it just now.

430
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,640
Just do as I say. 
Don't talk back to me.

431
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,510
Have you done this for a long time?

432
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,490
Excuse me?

433
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,040
Yes, a bit...

434
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,450
Other caregivers bring food from home.

435
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,690
Uh, what's that smell?

436
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,890
Did you give him a bath?

437
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,940
How can she give him a bath?

438
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,640
Why not?
She's a caregiver.

439
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,440
We're paying her!

440
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:05,350
She should keep him clean.

441
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,620
Thank you.
You should go home.

442
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,790
Okay.

443
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,410
Excuse me,

444
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,440
can you do something for me before you go?

445
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,640
What is it? It's late. Let her go home.

446
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,640
It's nothing difficult.

447
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,120
There's a juice place outside.

448
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,050
Get me some juice.

449
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,490
I came straight from work and I'm thirsty.

450
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,540
I'll go and get it.

451
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,450
It's okay. I'll get it.

452
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,910
Keep the change.

453
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,680
How can you ask her to do that?

454
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,510
Why not? We're paying her.

455
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,650
She's a caregiver for my father.

456
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,740
Making her get juice is too much.

457
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,610
What? You're overreacting.

458
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,680
She said yes.

459
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,320
I told her she could keep the change.

460
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,450
People might think you have feelings for her.

461
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,950
Oh, you're here.

462
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,620
Yes, father.

463
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,940
I'm here, too.

464
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,590
It's been a while.

465
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,640
No it hasn't.
It's only been a few days.

466
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,120
I've been visiting often.

467
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,640
Before it was just on holidays.

468
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,910
You look good.

469
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,820
No, I'm exhausted from working.

470
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,620
Father, would you like a different caregiver?

471
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,250
I heard you need a very good caregiver.

472
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,840
The one you have seems a bit slow.

473
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,940
She's not slow.

474
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,120
She's really good.

475
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,620
I'm so grateful because she's so caring.

476
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,410
Treat her to dinner and thank her.

477
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,010
Why would I do that?

478
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,820
You're being silly.

479
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,180
Dad!

480
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,850
Dad!

481
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,220
The class is over?

482
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,620
Bangtong isn't home yet.

483
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,090
Okay.

484
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,540
Hey! Heo Bangtong!

485
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,990
What took you so long?

486
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,040
You should come straight home!

487
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,290
Where were you?

488
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,320
Whatever!

489
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,550
What the...

490
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,490
Ugh...

491
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,280
I'm too scared to go home.

492
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,320
Me too.

493
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,350
I'm probably the only person who's

494
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,850
afraid to get kicked out by her daughter in law.

495
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,890
Mother!

496
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,290
Mother. Yeongdal.

497
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,140
Wake up.

498
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,740
Mother!

499
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,050
I know you're not asleep.

500
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,320
Get up. We need to talk.

501
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,990
Mother! Yeongdal!

502
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,440
Mother!

503
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,010
Yeongdal!

504
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,240
This won't solve anything.

505
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,210
I won't give up, you know?

506
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,510
If you keep this up, I'm going to take care of this my way.

507
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,250
Oh, I can't do this.

508
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,890
What do we do, mom?

509
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,350
I'm not trying to be presumptuous.

510
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,410
I hope you understand that.

511
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,780
I won't, Aunt Sunjeong.

512
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,410
You heard about Sangnam's childhood?

513
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:24,410
His father went through a lot trying to raise Sangnam.

514
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:33,820
It's not easy for a young man to not marry and raise a child alone.

515
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,140
It must be upsetting to see his precious son

516
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,290
get married and have nothing to show for.

517
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,640
I'd feel that way, too.

518
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:47,790
I like the idea of being down to earth, but...

519
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,350
I think I understand what you mean.

520
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,680
Nothing too extravagant, something simple.

521
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:00,210
Sangnam will say no, so don't tell him.

522
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,140
Do you understand what I mean?

523
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,310
What she said makes sense.

524
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,050
He only has his father and his aunt, right?

525
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,190
Proper wedding gifts are important.

526
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,280
That's how the Korean society is like.

527
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,350
Your way is great,

528
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,490
but get something for his father.

529
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,840
My mother in law treats me badly still for that.

530
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,590
That hurt me a lot.

531
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,820
You'll live with him after you're married,

532
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,490
so I think it's better to show respect.

533
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,310
Show your appreciation.

534
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,020
It's not about the gift.

535
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:37,650
It's the thought that counts.

536
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,640
Where's your daughter's wedding invitations?

537
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,680
Small weddings are popular, I heard.

538
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,350
We're keeping it simple.

539
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,490
We're not inviting any guests.

540
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:52,120
But it's a wedding! Don't keep it a secret.

541
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,640
My husband wants to keep it simple.

542
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,640
Where are you having it?

543
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,180
We're renting a restaurant.

544
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,710
Why is it so hush hush?

545
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,640
Is Gwangbak pregnant?

546
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,550
She's not pregnant!

547
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,250
Hobak got married because she got pregnant.

548
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,640
I remember how she was all upset.

549
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,090
Ugh...

550
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,550
What does he do?

551
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,990
He runs a company.

552
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,120
He's the president.

553
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,590
She won't have any money trouble.

554
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:21,680
Everyone these days is a CEO.

555
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,480
What kind of wedding gifts did you get?

556
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,480
He must have sent so much!

557
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,040
We got all sorts of things!

558
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,220
Diamonds, pearls, rubies, sapphires.

559
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,210
He covered the basics.

560
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,580
Isn't he a high school dropout?

561
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,640
He's a high school dropout?

562
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,940
Huh? I didn't say that.

563
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,520
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Oh my!

564
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,650
Okay, okay.

565
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,440
Okay, okay.

566
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,210
Mom, when are you coming?

567
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,390
This is crazy!
Hurry up and come home!

568
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,680
You take care of him today.

569
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,710
I haven't been out in so long.

570
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,510
He's your son so take care of him.

571
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,950
I'm hanging up.

572
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,740
Things are crazy in your family, too.

573
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,210
My daughter in law is babysitting for me.

574
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,310
Grandmothers aren't the nannies!

575
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,090
The government should do something.

576
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,140
Or we should get paid properly,

577
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,410
so we can plan for retirement.

578
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,590
But they won't really pay us.

579
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,140
They give whatever they can afford.

580
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,940
Yes, and I can't force them to pay me.

581
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,390
I know how hard it is for them.

582
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,550
But you can't let them take advantage of you.

583
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,390
Tell your children to pay you $1,000 a month.

584
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,120
The problem is that I'm getting sick.

585
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,050
And I'm worried that he'll get hurt.

586
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,590
What if he gets sick?

587
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,640
I feel like it's my fault. It's crazy.

588
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,510
Right. Who would understand that?

589
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,490
Unless you've experienced it, too.

590
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:11,080
I'm nervous my daughter in law might get mad.

591
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,320
But isn't it better if it's your daughter?

592
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,990
It's worse.

593
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,210
I feel shamed before my son in law!

594
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,910
My daughter's worse than ten daughter in laws.

595
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,510
She's worse than my husband.

596
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,950
Why would you raise your grandchildren?

597
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,280
You raised your own children, and that's enough.

598
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,350
My friend got arthritis from raising her grandkids.

599
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,210
I'm starting to feel it.

600
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,910
It hurts everywhere.

601
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,720
I told my kids I'm not doing it.

602
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,040
How do you keep yourself busy?

603
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,210
Raising my grandkid makes me happy.

604
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,080
Sure it's hard, but it brings so much joy.

605
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,390
It beats having a puppy.

606
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,440
He's so cute I can just eat him up.

607
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,250
Right, that's why I do it.

608
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,890
What about your life?

609
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,420
You worked hard all your life,

610
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,750
so why would you raise your grandkids?

611
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,020
If you have free time, find things to do.

612
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,050
Right, right.

613
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,240
Go singing and exercising.

614
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,090
Don't let your grandkid become your life.

615
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,350
Make your children pay you.

616
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,650
Will they take care of you if you get sick?

617
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,990
You can save the money for when you're old.

618
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,680
I should do that.

619
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,420
What are you doing?

620
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,750
Homework.

621
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,650
Do you want pizza?

622
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,950
Should I buy you pizza?

623
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,140
No, thanks.

624
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,520
You don't want pizza?

625
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,590
No.

626
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,980
I thought pizza was your favorite.

627
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,020
Not anymore.

628
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,190
Mom always gets it for us, so we got sick of it.

629
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,620
Sick of pizza?
Why you little...

630
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,290
Don't be ungrateful when I'm trying to be nice.

631
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,290
Do you want pizza or not?

632
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,890
You're weird!

633
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,850
You never bought us anything!

634
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,290
We don't want pizza.

635
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,710
It's okay, Bangtong. Let's eat it.

636
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,210
You should've said that earlier.

637
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,580
You always try to make me mad.

638
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,580
Hello? Is this the pizza place?

639
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,590
Where is he?
I called ages ago.

640
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,650
It's here!

641
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,120
You boys go to your room.

642
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,120
- Why?
- Hurry, hurry!

643
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,690
I thought you wanted to buy us pizza!

644
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,650
Here's your pizza.

645
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,950
You're the delivery boy?

646
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:39,520
No, the man paid me a dollar to deliver this.

647
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,820
Sintong! Bangtong! Come out and eat!

648
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,690
Wow! Oh!

649
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,250
What are you doing?

650
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,050
What do you mean?

651
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,620
Why won't you come to my house?

652
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,920
You're ignoring me?

653
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,650
Why did you make that boy deliver it?

654
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,820
Because I wanted to!

655
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,280
This is crazy.

656
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,650
On top of feeling horrible, I feel dirty!

657
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,890
Why are you acting this way?

658
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,440
What do you mean?

659
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,480
I'm furious because a loser like you is ignoring me!

660
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,080
I'm sorry.

661
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,890
I wasn't trying to,

662
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,750
but I don't want anything to do with you.

663
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,150
You must be upset, but I'm upset, too.

664
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,790
I've never made such a huge mistake before.

665
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,980
Let's just forget about the whole thing.

666
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,350
So you're just leaving like that?

667
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,520
You think I have nothing to say?

668
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,190
You had your say.

669
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,590
You said you feel dirty.

670
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,510
Go take a bath.

671
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,210
What are you doing, mom?

672
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,680
There's no room to put this in.

673
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,550
I should clean out the fridge or something.

674
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,440
You're putting the cutting board in the fridge?

675
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,580
Huh?

676
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,940
Mom, you're doing it again.

677
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,940
Why don't you put that in the wardrobe, then?

678
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,020
What's wrong with me?

679
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,590
I've been so absent minded.

680
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,310
This is all your fault!

681
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,310
I was humiliated when I met with friends.

682
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,710
I'll live happily ever after, mom.

683
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,020
I'll throw a party for all your friends.

684
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,690
Forget it.

685
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,120
You know the money you've been keeping for me?

686
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,650
Can I get it back?

687
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,820
What for?

688
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,410
I need to use some and I'm going to manage it.

689
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,520
You're not buying any furniture or gifts,

690
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,210
so why would you need your money now?

691
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:53,680
We're going to open our financial state and build a portfolio.

692
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,120
He's told me all about his.

693
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,150
You saw it at lunch.

694
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,450
You must be crazy.

695
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,750
Why would you tell him?
It's your money.

696
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,550
Why would you tell him about it?

697
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,410
He told me about his money.

698
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,790
We need to make plans for our future.

699
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,290
You idiot!

700
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,190
Why would you take money to him?

701
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,050
Did he ask you to?

702
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,480
No, I thought...

703
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,250
Leave your bank book with me.

704
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,290
You can come to me when you need money.

705
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,120
Can I just have it?

706
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,790
You're so dense.

707
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,710
I agree.

708
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,410
Kids never appreciate their parents efforts.

709
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,850
She thinks I'm going to keep her money.

710
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,440
I'll give it to you when it's time.

711
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,640
I'm sorry.

712
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,920
I didn't know it would upset you.

713
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,420
Since I'm getting married,

714
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,490
I thought I should manage it.

715
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,750
Ugh!

716
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,150
Oh, how could you be so inconsiderate?

717
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,850
You were a teacher for heaven's sake.

718
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,540
Give that money to mom.

719
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,040
Give it to mom?

720
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,680
Yes. You won't need it now.

721
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,490
Sangnam's rich, so why do you need it?

722
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,120
I envy you.

723
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:15,250
You must be full of love, marrying a rich man.

724
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,210
Marring a rich man fills you with love?

725
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,710
Of course.

726
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,540
That hormone or something?
What was that?

727
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,320
Dopamine, endorphin, oxytocin, phenyl ethylamine?

728
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,210
Oh, yes!
They come out when you see money.

729
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,290
They're released when you fall in love!

730
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,650
They come out when you see money.

731
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,190
When you see a rich man,

732
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,690
he looks so handsome,

733
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,920
and you miss him all day.

734
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,890
Aren't they the same hormones?

735
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,750
You're excited about money.
Material girl.

736
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,480
Who isn't material these days?

737
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,510
If a man came to you driving an imported car,

738
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,290
buys you a designer handbag,

739
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,980
takes you to an expensive French restaurant to wine and dine you, you'd fall for him.

740
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,910
Women who've never met men like that use phrases like "material girl."

741
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,120
Look at me.
My marriage went south when money disappeared.

742
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,810
When we had money, we never fought.

743
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,480
Now we fight whenever we see each other.

744
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,890
And there's no release of hormones at all!

745
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,020
- Hello.
- Oh, I remember you!

746
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,150
It's nice to meet you.

747
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,450
This place is very important for a ship.

748
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:53,410
For humans, it would be like the head, so to speak.

749
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,390
Where are you coming from?

750
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,540
Uh, I met a friend.

751
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,710
Become and judge so I can move out with you.

752
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,310
I hate them all.

753
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,140
I hate Subak and Gwangbak.

754
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,940
A captain?

755
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,120
You're going to become a captain?

756
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,150
Yes.

757
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,650
Didn't you want to become a judge?

758
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,020
I never said I wanted to become a judge.

759
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,390
It was mom and dad.

760
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,720
But they think you're going to law school.

761
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,790
How could you do this?

762
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,820
It's too late now.

763
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,820
I got into the Maritime University.

764
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,780
What am I going to do with you?

765
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,690
I thought you would understand me.

766
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,420
You quit teaching to become a writer.

767
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,690
I know!

768
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,190
That's why you should do what mom and dad want.

769
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,710
What did you do when you quit?

770
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,540
I talked to father about it.

771
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,120
How could you do this?

772
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,420
You should've at least talked to father.

773
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,520
I'm going to become a captain.

774
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,590
The best female captain in the world.

775
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:14,710
Fine. But keep it to yourself for now.

776
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,710
We'll tell them after things settle down.

777
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,640
Oh, this is insane.

778
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,020
Where's my father?

779
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,440
With a client.

780
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,890
Can you give me $5,000?

781
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,120
For what?

782
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,040
I need it for something.

783
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,980
But please don't tell my father.

784
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,710
How have you been, my darling son?

785
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,310
Have you eaten?

786
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,120
I lost my appetite.

787
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,790
How can I eat at a time like this?

788
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,020
I can't even live with you.

789
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,850
Would you like to go and eat?

790
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,920
No.

791
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,020
When I'm with you, I feel full.

792
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,090
Chewing gum helps me forget.

793
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,480
I didn't realize this before,

794
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:36,040
but being able to see you makes me happy.

795
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,650
Here.

796
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,120
- What is it?
- It's not much.

797
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,440
Don't stay in Seoul for me.

798
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,750
And you should work things out with him.

799
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,020
I'm not going back.

800
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,710
I'm sick and tired of him.

801
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,410
You're making me uncomfortable.

802
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:08,810
But I'm your mom! Silly.

803
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,390
Sangnam, let's be friends, okay?

804
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,790
You wanting it is enough for me.

805
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,280
I better get going.

806
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,710
Take care.

807
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,790
Come in.

808
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,920
It's clean.

809
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,990
How much is the rent?

810
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,350
How long are you planning to stay?

811
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,290
Who knows?

812
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,250
I could be a month or two months.

813
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,920
I want this place.

814
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,790
Sunjeong!

815
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,650
Yes?

816
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:05,250
Find out what people do about wedding gifts.

817
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,390
For what?

818
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,080
Just find out.

819
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,420
Ugh...

820
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:15,640
What's wrong?

821
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,090
You want to go ahead with this wedding?

822
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,620
We already met his family and everything.

823
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,920
I don't know how to make this work.

824
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:26,590
I even tried putting myself in their shoes.

825
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,040
Do we have to let her marry him?

826
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,510
What's wrong? What don't you like?

827
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,090
I hate everything. Everything.

828
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,240
She's not getting any jewelry,

829
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:40,190
and her wedding will be at a restaurant.

830
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,890
All my friends were asking me why I'm marrying my daughter off like that.

831
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,290
We got plenty of blessings for Subak and Hobak's weddings. Isn't that enough?

832
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,210
But I gave my friends lots of gift money!

833
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,390
It's all about giving and taking.

834
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,920
I'm mad I'm not getting a doctor son in law,

835
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:59,220
and Gwangbak's only getting a ring?

836
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,410
And she had to audition on top of everything?

837
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,090
I feel humiliated.

838
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,780
Don't you?

839
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,290
You're not happy, are you?

840
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:13,440
Why did Gwangbak have to audition?

841
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,440
Why do you think she went through with it?

842
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,290
She's in love.

843
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,120
That's why she did it.

844
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,980
We can't cancel the wedding.

845
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,250
Not after meeting his father.

846
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,790
We can if we really wanted to.

847
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,350
Don't say that.
It's bad luck to say that.

848
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,120
When you go over to their place tomorrow,

849
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,120
be polite.

850
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:40,020
Say we'll do everything they want.

851
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,190
And don't say anything else.

852
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,390
I'm furious.

853
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,850
She asked me for her bank book today.

854
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,580
You should give it to her.

855
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,180
Were you planning on keeping it?

856
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,390
- Han Taeju!
- Yes!

857
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,790
- Good job.
- Thank you.

858
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,890
- Ko Minho!
- Yes!

859
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,540
- Good job. I'm serious.
- Thank you.

860
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,410
Oh, Heo Sedal.

861
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,620
Yes, thank you.

862
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:08,920
Here.

863
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,490
- Ju Minsik.
- Let's hurry it up!

864
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,310
- Ju Minsuk.
- Oh, yes.

865
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:04,850
- Hobak.
- You're home? How was your day?

866
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,190
Hobak, isn't it cold outside?

867
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,120
I'm going to give you a facial.

868
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:11,080
I gave the boys a bath and put them to bed.

869
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,180
I checked their homework and got them school supplies.

870
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,690
Come lie down. 
We'll give you a facial.

871
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,710
No, thanks.

872
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,940
Give this to the boys.

873
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,050
If you don't sign that right now,

874
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,240
I'm taking you to court.

875
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,550
Meet me at the courthouse by noon tomorrow.

876
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:02,210
Sedal! Sedal!

877
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,440
Don't do this!

878
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,290
Don't go. Please talk to me.

879
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,710
Stop this, please!

880
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,850
I said I'm sorry.

881
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,290
Let me go!

882
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,550
Look. I have nothing.

883
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,940
Isn't this a great parting gift?

884
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:20,620
Nobody would ask for a divorce on their wedding anniversary except you.

885
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:25,980
Hey! I have nothing to do with this woman!

886
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:29,580
I don't care if she lives or dies!

887
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,950
What was that?

888
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:12,680
Sorry. Yeongdal broke that vacuuming.

889
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,790
I'm sorry. I was trying to help.

890
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,750
Why won't you let me sleep?

891
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,690
Clean that up before the boys get up.

892
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,890
Okay.

893
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:43,850
Hobak,

894
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,120
I shined your shoes.

895
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:49,710
Even your shoes are pretty, like you.

896
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:54,480
Hobak, I prepared breakfast.
Have some.

897
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:56,520
I'm not hungry.
I have an early meeting.

898
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,850
Just have a bite.
I made all your favorites.

899
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,350
Yes, Hobak.
Just have a bite, for mom.

900
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,190
I got up really early to cook these.

901
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,850
Have some.

902
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,190
You wasted your energy.

903
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:18,580
I'm not changing my mind, so stop trying.

904
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:22,940
Living together is uncomfortable for everyone.

905
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:24,810
I'm not uncomfortable.

906
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,440
We've been living like this forever.

907
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,910
I'm not uncomfortable either, Hobak.

908
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,850
I don't feel hurt when you yell at me.

909
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,710
Have some breakfast.

910
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,890
What more can I say so you'd understand?

911
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,540
I don't my ex's mother cooking for me.

912
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:43,940
I'll get indigestion.

913
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,350
Don't say that.

914
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,480
You're not legally divorced yet.

915
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,180
It's almost as if we are.

916
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,050
Legally, you're still married.

917
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,620
So you stop that.

918
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,440
Divorcing won't do you any good either,

919
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,910
unless you're seeing someone.

920
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,750
Mother.

921
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,540
You were happy about my divorce.

922
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,240
Did you forget that?

923
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,750
I just can't understand you.

924
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,620
Why won't you move out?

925
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:09,420
Hobak.

926
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,250
Move out as quickly as you can.

927
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,790
I'm divorcing Sedal no matter what.

928
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,820
I don't know why you're doing this to me.

929
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,910
Then give me money.

930
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:22,550
Excuse me?

931
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:26,280
This apartment is in Sedal's name, too.

932
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,650
I'm not leaving empty handed.

933
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,690
If you don't want to, take us to court.

934
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,680
Is that what you really want?

935
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,520
I have all the evidence, including the bank books.

936
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:41,210
I can prove Sedal didn't contribute anything.

937
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,650
Your son's law school years must have rubbed off on you.

938
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,050
Fine! Take us to court!

939
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,280
How could you be so mean?

940
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,980
I'm groveling like this!

941
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:51,940
The least you can do is let it slide.

942
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:54,810
How could you be so heartless/

943
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,120
Mom, stop it.

944
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:57,420
Hobak, I'm sorry.

945
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:00,420
She's just upset, so don't mind her.

946
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,690
Let's say it was all my son's fault.

947
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,050
But don't you know you gave him the reason?

948
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,080
You made him cheat on you!

949
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,480
You mistreated him, caring only about money.

950
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,940
How did your parents treat him?

951
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,850
They treated him like dirt!

952
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,920
They always yelled at him.

953
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:20,950
He left you because he couldn't take it anymore!

954
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,250
Mom.

955
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,590
A man could make a mistake.

956
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:31,120
How could you ask for a divorce over that?

957
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:33,190
God will punish you!

958
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,620
I'll receive the punishment gladly.

959
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,710
Whatever you say, I won't budge.

960
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,350
Move out right now!

961
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,090
Mom!

962
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,140
What do you think you're doing?

963
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,920
This is my house and these are my things!

964
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:59,090
You're so mean!

965
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:00,780
Am I your housekeeper?

966
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,980
How could you treat me like this?

967
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,790
Am I a beggar?

968
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,920
How can you tell me to move out?

969
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,120
I'm still your mother in law.

970
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,620
How could you act this way?

971
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:15,850
I'm begging for your forgiveness,

972
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,420
but you won't even listen!

973
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:24,090
Where can we go in the middle of winter?

974
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:27,890
You'd treat beggars better than me!

975
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,420
How could you be so inconsiderate?

976
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:37,020
Your mom hates you because you're like this!

977
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:41,350
You're heartless and mean!

978
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,210
Nobody knows how life will turn out.

979
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,410
You think your luck won't ever run out?

980
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:50,990
We'll see about that!

981
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:53,680
Have a great life!

982
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,040
Hurry up!

983
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,350
Oh, hold on, hold on.

984
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,310
I think you should just leave!

985
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,180
What do you think you're doing?

986
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,590
Oh, this is crazy.

987
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,850
Mom...

988
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,210
Excuse me...

989
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,850
Sedal...

990
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,210
Sedal!

991
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,520
Sedal!

992
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:22,290
Sedal! Sedal! It's me, your mom!

993
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,980
Sedal! A thief!

994
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:34,290
Mom...

995
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,520
Oh, my god...

996
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:39,890
What happened to you, Sedal!

997
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:45,480
- Mom...
- Oh, Sedal!

998
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:48,910
Oh, Sedal...

999
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,710
Bounce, bounce...

1000
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,410
Where are you going?

1001
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:00,020
To my in law's. But who knows if he'll really become my in law.

1002
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,440
Hey, watch what you say.

1003
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,250
Don't ruin this, okay?

1004
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,520
Mother...

1005
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:08,050
Bounce, bounce.

1006
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,940
Pounding, bounce.

1007
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,640
Come in.

1008
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,790
Daese.

1009
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,120
You're here.

1010
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,810
Yes.

1011
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,210
Have a seat.

1012
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,580
There's no need.
She me their room.

1013
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,190
Come this way.

1014
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,350
Sunjeong, wait.

1015
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,390
I'll take her.

1016
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,520
Follow me.

1017
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,820
They need a bed and a dresser, right?

1018
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,540
Don't just go anywhere.

1019
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:56,620
Here.

1020
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,250
We buy our furniture from here, so go here.

1021
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,790
Get the style that goes with what we have.

1022
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,480
I want antique style furniture.

1023
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,250
It's up to us.

1024
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,790
Why should we have to go here?

1025
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,850
The style has to go with what we have.

1026
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,940
Both the color and the size.

1027
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:18,390
Let's go down.

1028
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:35,480
The kids said no furniture or wedding gifts,

1029
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:38,540
but I think we should cover the basics.

1030
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,810
That way, I won't have to lie to my friends.

1031
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,640
He's my only son.

1032
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:48,580
I heard mother in laws get mink coats and designer handbags.

1033
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,350
Mink coats and designer handbags?

1034
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:56,440
I can't believe my ears.

1035
00:59:56,450 --> 01:00:00,810
It's not like your son's a doctor.

1036
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:03,280
He only graduated from middle school.

1037
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:06,080
What did you just say?

1038
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:08,680
I was just talking to myself.

1039
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,350
I'm being really accommodating.

1040
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:18,540
They'll take turns visiting during holidays and give allowance only on birthdays and holidays.

1041
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,890
There are two of you but only one of me.

1042
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,290
What does that have to do with anything?

1043
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,650
You're acting like a real cheapskate.

1044
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,620
Excuse me?

1045
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:29,810
Don't you think so?

1046
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:32,410
You're nit-picking about money.

1047
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:36,050
If that's what you want, let's do it formally.

1048
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:37,710
What will you get for my daughter?

1049
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,440
Excuse me, I don't feel comfortable butting in,

1050
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:42,790
but I think you should stop.

1051
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,890
This isn't what the kids want.

1052
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,190
You should work together, as their parents.

1053
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,720
Who cares what others think?

1054
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,540
You're not his mom, so don't butt in.

1055
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,180
I'm sorry.

1056
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:59,120
While we're at it, let me ask you something.

1057
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:02,020
Why do you hate my daughter so much?

1058
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,850
Can I be frank about it?

1059
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,390
Go ahead.

1060
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,750
She's just so rude!

1061
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,120
My daughter's rude?

1062
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,210
The best bride material in town is rude?

1063
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,710
Haven't you heard?

1064
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,680
Why do you think I had that audition?

1065
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,090
It was all because of your daughter.

1066
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:25,390
My son has a weird taste in women!

1067
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,580
I didn't say yes because I like her.

1068
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:31,310
What's so great about your son?

1069
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,480
He's a high school dropout heavy equipment operator!

1070
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:39,020
How dare you put my daughter through the humiliation of auditioning?

1071
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:42,690
Ask anyone if what you did was right!

1072
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,950
What? A high school dropout?

1073
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,790
How could you say that?

1074
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,210
Why can't I?

1075
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:54,040
Tell me what's so great about your son!

1076
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,980
Audition?

1077
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:59,350
My daughter was crazy for entering that,

1078
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,390
but you're not normal either.

1079
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,920
Sunjeong, water! With ice!

1080
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,710
I can't let my daughter marry into this family.

1081
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,250
Let's cancel the wedding!

1082
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,790
Cancel it?

1083
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,920
Fine.

1084
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:18,620
Let's cancel it.

1086
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:52,310
I told him we're canceling the wedding.

1087
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,120
You canceled the wedding?

1088
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:56,210
Gwangbak's not getting married?

1089
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,680
Cancel the wedding.

1090
01:02:58,700 --> 01:02:59,520
What?

1091
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:00,790
Stop this nonsense!

1092
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,440
Let's go home.

1093
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:02,640
I can't, not like this.

1094
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,090
I'll come home when I'm successful.

1095
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:07,740
It's weird. I can't help it. I just like him.

1096
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,320
What are you doing?

1097
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,620
You won't listen so I took action.

1098
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,690
You're just so mean!

1099
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,990
I'm mean?

1100
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:17,850
She dumped him, so he wants to come back?

1101
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,420
Don't even dream about it.

1102
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,450
I didn't imagine that, did I?

1103
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:24,180
Wasn't that the bastard?

1104
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,490
He doesn't deserve to be called that.
