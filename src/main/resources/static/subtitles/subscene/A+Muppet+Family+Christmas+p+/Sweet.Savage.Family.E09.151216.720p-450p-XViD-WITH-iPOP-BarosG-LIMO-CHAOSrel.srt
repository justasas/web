<i>I don't want Lee Do Kyung here.</i>

00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,110
I want her gone from Daejeon.

Tae Soo!

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,770
Tae Soo.

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,810
If you want to save this woman,
then you better kneel.

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,390
Kneel down, bastard!

What happened?

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,820
I did this, Gi Bum.

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,080
What?

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,890
He came for me.
But he saw her and took her hostage.

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,530

Oh my...

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,070
He's not breathing.

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,710
Could he be...

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,790
What have you done?

36
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,680
Move over.

37
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,730
What are you looking at?
We have to perform CPR!

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,080
Tae Soo! What are you doing?
Perform CPR!

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,690
What? Me?

40
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,870
Now!

41
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,460
Hurry up!

42
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,910
Geez! I'll do it!

43
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,460
Geez, Do Kyung! I'll do it.

He's breathing. He'll be okay, right?

46
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,590
We'll know once we get him examined.

47
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,020
How did this happen?

48
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,760
Why were you at the office, Do Kyung?

49
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,100
And why did Cho show up
at the tiger's den?

50
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,300
Now is not the time to get upset.

51
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,180
Let's save him first. Then we can talk.

52
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,830
Everything always turns to crap
because of this guy.

53
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,070
Hey, buddy, wake up!

54
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,480
Hey! Hey!

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,610
Ugh! Geez!

56
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,250
Geez!

57
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,430
You invited Do Kyung over
and she hit him so she could save you.

58
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,090
You're responsible for all of it!
Do you understand?

59
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,180
Shut up. Just find a nurse or a doctor!

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,180
We have a patient here!

61
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,540
This way, please.

62
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,950
Geez! What was that?

63
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,130
Geez!

64
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,750
What did the doctor say?

65
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,870
He said that he'll be fine.
He has a minor concussion.

66
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,120
They'll do more tests when he wakes up.

67
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,800
Don't worry.

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,480
His head is made of rock.
He'll survive anything.

69
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,960
Gi Bum and I will stay here.

70
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,940
The two of you should go home.

71
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,110
No, I can't just leave after what I did.

72
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,350
I'll stay until he wakes up.

73
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,550
I'll take care of it here.

74
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,260
You should go home and rest.

75
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,870
Hyun Jee must be waiting for you.

76
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,280
You should go too, honey.

77
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,200
The kids have school tomorrow.

78
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,110
Okay then.

79
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,720
- Go home.
- Go home.

80
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,500
Go home. Don't worry about this.

81
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,640
What was that?

82
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,680
I don't want to take
my dirt into the house.

83
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,970
I don't want to pass any bad luck
on to you or the kids.

84
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,050
Let's go in.

85
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,850
Really? He regained consciousness?

86
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,990
<i>Yes.</i>

87
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,140
He's awake. He eats.
He goes to the bathroom.

88
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,080
He doesn't have any brain damage, right?

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,680
That's right.

90
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,810
You should relax now.
Get yourself back to normal.

91
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,720
I'll take care of everything.
Don't worry yourself!

92
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,090
Okay?

93
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,720
Why did you say he woke up?

94
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,790
Should I tell her that we still
don't know when he'll wake up?

95
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,680
Plus, the doctor said there isn't any
brain damage, so he should be fine.

96
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,550
Still, you shouldn't have said that.

97
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,150
To be honest, I wish he would
just never wake up.

98
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,620
You feel the same way, right?

99
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,390
I'm not you! You're evil!

100
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,620
What the...

101
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,290
What?

102
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,840
What the hell is this?

103
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,050
He was here when
we went to see the doctor.

104
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,590
Oh, no... Did he wake up and run away?

105
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,710
He could have it out for us.

106
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,270
The police could get him too!

107
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,950
No way! We have to find him!

108
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,610
You're a writer?

109
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,380
But... Madam...

110
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,690
Shouldn't that be a decision for
the executive producer to make?

111
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,180
The chairman gave his okay.

112
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,390
And the director and producer
also gave their okay's.

113
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:03,290
Is there more to this
decision-making process?

114
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,400
Wow! Then from now on...

115
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,800
We should call you
Writer Oh, not Madam Oh.

116
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,090
I can tell this movie is going to be big!

117
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,370
At least ten million viewers!

118
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,840
Now that I have become one of the writers.

119
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,670
The movie, "The Man of Two Faces"
is going to be the pride of One Heart.

120
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,550
And everyone in the Choong Shim clan
should work on it.

121
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,080
Everyone, do we understand?

122
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,740
- Of course!
- Yes, we do.

123
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,080
Great.

124
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Oh, Do Kyung.

125
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,460
How is your character analysis going?

126
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,590
Pardon me?

127
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,200
Oh... that. Not yet.

128
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,160
Wait a little bit.

129
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,230
I'll inject some soul
into that character.

130
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,030
There's this character...

131
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,650
who will play opposite you.

132
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,490
It'll be a minor role but...

133
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,400
She's a powerful character who
is supposed to provoke you.

134
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,130
Using film terms, she's a scene-stealer.

135
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,060
That brings me to my point.
To freshen things up a bit

136
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,320
I want to pick one of you
for that character.

137
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,220
Are you saying you want to
cast someone from this group?

138
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,490
Bingo!

139
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,010
Everyone here seems to be interested.

140
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,960
Why don't we hold an audition tonight
instead of our regular book club meeting?

141
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,860
What do you think?

142
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,760
That sounds great!

143
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,970
That sounds like fun!

144
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,530
Great!

145
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,790
What? She's holding an audition?

146
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,100
Yes, that's what I said.

147
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,270
The ladies are super excited.

148
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,600
Are you going to let them do this?

149
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,670
A film is a director's work of art.

150
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,510
Yet, you have no power over it.

151
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,560
I'm not even a director. I'm a failure.

152
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,150
What are you talking about?

153
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,080
This is the time for you
to be strong and focused!

154
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,740
Honestly, in this gang's den...

155
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,070
You and I have been through
all of this hardship to get here.

156
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,360
Right, Director Bong?

157
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,090
In times like these, I really wish
we had Mr. Son. Don't you agree?

158
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,020
Why are you bringing up the man
who deserted us and ran away?

159
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,380
I wonder how he's doing.

160
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,570
I wonder if he's alive.

161
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,850
Stop talking about Mr. Son!

162
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,800
It makes me even more upset.

163
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,870
Geez!

164
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,300
You're so loud! I can't sleep!

165
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,910
Geez, where is Tae Soo anyway?

166
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,490
Is Mr. Yoon Tae Soo here?

167
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,450
What brings you here?

168
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,080
Hello.

169
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,110
I'm Kim Eun Sil,
Mr. Yoon's sister-in-law.

170
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,020
He's not here.

171
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,240
I know.

172
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,260
You're the director, right?

173
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,730
You look just like a movie director.

174
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,700
I have a good eye, you know.

175
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,640
I'm a producer.

176
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,650
He is the director.

177
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,020
Yes.

178
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,480
Oh, I knew it.
You look very educated.

179
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,300
I know. Anyway, how can I help you?

180
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,610
My brother-in-law said he needed
a female assistant for the office.

181
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,410
So I thought I could help.

182
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,150
No, thank you.

183
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,590
We aren't hiring any
female assistants. I'm sorry.

184
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,900
Geez, it's all men here!
The office needs cleaning.

185
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,580
Oh, my. Look at this dust.

186
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,840
Do you know where
the cleaning supplies are?

187
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,880
I think I saw them somewhere.

188
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,450
Wait!

189
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,840
Thank you.

190
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,730
- You're here!
- Geez!

191
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,900
What are you doing in my office?

192
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,820
I came to see you.
I was resting for a bit.

193
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,040
I don't want to die
from working too hard.

194
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,530
I swear...

195
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,830
Why are you here?

196
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,910
You know Cho Dong Choon.

197
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,380
Where do you think he's hiding?

198
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,530
Geez, why did you lose him?

199
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,020
If you had caught him,
nothing would have happened!

200
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,620
I'm sorry...

201
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,070
I have flat feet, so I can't run fast.

202
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,360
I got it, that's fine. So go catch him!

203
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,730
Wait, wait, wait!

204
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,520
Mr. Son contacted me.

205
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,250
So I went to see him.

206
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,890
What?

207
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,950
But he stood me up.

208
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,440
He didn't show up.

209
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,900
Bro!

210
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,100
I wonder if someone got to him first.

211
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,890
What is Baek Gi Bum up to these days?

212
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,450
I do not know!

213
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,240
Why don't you go ask him?

214
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,640
My advice is that you confess to
your sins in hopes of being freed!

215
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,300
Tae Soo, you should listen to me!

216
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,890
Since he's awake,
should I bring him some oatmeal?

217
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,340
No, don't do that.

218
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,390
Just in case, I'll say this.

219
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,640
Don't take the blame
like you did with Mr. Son.

220
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,540
Report it to the police, okay?

221
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,100
This isn't the same situation.

222
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,070
We're in an entirely
different predicament now.

223
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,910
Are you worried about Do Kyung?

224
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,540
Are you worried that your first love
will go to jail or something?

225
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,300
You're really talking nonsense.

226
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,070
Then, what is it?
Why are you being indecisive?

227
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,200
It happened because I asked her
to come to the office.

228
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,070
So, was anything even
resolved because of it?

229
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,090
In the end, the issue with the
house still hasn't been solved.

230
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,480
How does her being there
make it your fault?

231
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,680
Nothing ever works out
because of Do Kyung!

232
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,350
You fox!

233
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,450
Get out.

234
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,470
I told you to get out.

235
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,950
You fox.

236
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,900
You fox!

237
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,730
I'm sorry, Madam. I can't do it.

238
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,000
Next!

239
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,430
Okay.

240
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,140
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,180
Next.

242
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,230
Get out!

243
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,460
I said, get out!

244
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,730
You fox!

245
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,310
My life is in shambles because of you!

246
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,090
Grab her hair violently!

247
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,190
- Violently?
- That's right! Violently!

248
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,790
Grab her hair violently! Violently!

249
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,470
My life is a disaster!

250
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,690
Violently! Violently!

251
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,650
Is that really okay?
Director Baek would be furious.

252
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,390
I know. And she's a strong candidate
for the chairwoman position.

253
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,000
Violently! Violently!

254
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,360
My life is a disaster!

255
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,280
Are you going to do it or not?
Make up your mind!

256
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,220
My life is a disaster!

257
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,760
I am a disaster!
I can't do it.

258
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,960
I am both frustrated and disappointed.

259
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,460
My goodness.

260
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,120
Is there no one here who
can play this vibrant role?

261
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,850
Oh my God...

262
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,920
Eun Ok.

263
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,320
Do you want to give it a try?

264
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,880
Oh, no! I'm not interested in acting.

265
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,870
This is one effective way
to help your husband.

266
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,830
You are the wife of
the investor of the film!

267
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,250
Whether the role is
a grandmother or a traitor

268
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,900
you should be able to play it.

269
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,260
Try it. Try it!

270
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,170
You fox!

271
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,380
Because of you, my life is a disaster!

272
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,690
You are the nuclear bomb in my life!
You are a tsunami!

273
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,690
I will reveal all of your
most shameful secrets!

274
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,970
Ha!

275
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:41,330
I'll crush you before you get the chance!

276
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,770
- You!
- You!

277
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,210
That's it! Forcefully!

278
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,280
That's it! Great!

279
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,220
Okay! Oh my God! Wow!

280
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,950
That was soulful acting!

281
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,910
I did my best.

282
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,520
- She's good! Wonderful!
- Wonderful!

283
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,800
It looks pretty good.

284
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,780
The code progression is a bit too simple.

285
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,240
Change it here a bit.

286
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,610
It just needs reharmonization.

287
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,570
How is it?

288
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,420
I'm thinking of using
this piece in a movie.

289
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,920
In a movie?

290
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,420
Yes, I need to make a score for a movie.

291
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,000
So, let's say... you've proven
yourself with your solo work.

292
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,410
And your music composition is good.

293
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,610
You passed!

294
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,260
So...

295
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,460
Are you saying you want to
make film scores with me?

296
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,730
We might not make it big.

297
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,360
But it won't be as embarrassing
if we do together, right?

298
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,920
So you have to do with me, okay?

299
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,490
You think about how to arrange it. Okay?

300
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,870
Hey, I didn't say I would do it.

301
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,800
Oh! So good.

302
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,140
Oh, what brings you here, Dad?

303
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,800
Why do you come home so late?
I was worried, Hyun Jee.

304
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,530
I usually come home around this hour.
Why are you overreacting?

305
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,090
It's cold. Let's go inside.

306
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,710
What are you doing?

307
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,620
It's cold.

308
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,520
Why are you here?

309
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,350
Oh... I ran into her nearby,
so we came together.

310
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,950
It's so cold! My goodness.

311
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,150
People could think that we live together.

312
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,790
I know, he was so casual
that he caught me by surprise.

313
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,840
I'll go change.

314
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,510
Are you here to talk about that man?

315
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,810
Does he remember how I hit him?

316
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,090
He was wrong to begin with.
So there isn't much for him to say.

317
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,540
Well, nothing happened today, right?

318
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,010
Yes, something big happened today.

319
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,010
Huh?

320
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,440
I haven't even decided to be in the film.
But Madam Oh just created this new role.

321
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,200
It was quite a scene.

322
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,270
Geez, she was using so much strength
from her arms to grab my hair.

323
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,970
What do you mean?

324
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,250
Just go home.
It's stressful to talk about.

325
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,720
I heard that there have been a lot of
burglaries because it's the end of year.

326
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,470
I'm a bit concerned for your safety.

327
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,290
Can I sleep here tonight?

328
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,650
Mom, don't fall for that.

329
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,860
He's an expert in getting his way.
That's a classic example.

330
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,280
You heard what she said.

331
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,010
Good night, Do Kyung, Hyun Jee.

332
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,000
I will protect you.

333
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,540
Geez, why is it so cold?

334
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,450
Why did Cho run away?

335
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,970
When I catch you, you're finished.

336
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,620
Producer Lee, please go with me.

337
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,030
I told you, I'm busy.

338
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,430
I need to work on the budget,
and hire people. I have so much to do.

339
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,390
I can't believe it... Hey!

340
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,210
Attending a scene meeting is within
the responsibilities of the producer!

341
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,340
Director! What is really going on?

342
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,990
I'm scared to go to that house.

343
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,090
Huh?

344
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,820
The chairman adores you!
What's scary about going there?

345
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,270
Perhaps... is there some
problem with Madam Oh?

346
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,070
Are you crazy?
What the heck are you thinking?

347
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,350
I'm just irritated.

348
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,710
I already finished the script.
Why do we need a new writer?

349
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,700
Honestly, it's good to have her.
She's not just a writer.

350
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,890
She's the perfect model for this story.

351
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,660
She's a head gangster's woman.

352
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,280
I like the move because
she'll make the story feel more real!

353
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,240
Hey, what do you think death is?

354
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,270
Is a movie more important
than a person's life?

355
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,010
Stop saying strange things. Just go.

356
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,160
- Strange? Strange how?
- Just go!

357
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,130
Oh.

358
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,190
Welcome! Welcome, Director Bong!

359
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:56,270
- Where is the chairman?
- He went to a funeral, so relax.

360
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,320
Okay! Should we start writing then?

361
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,980
Come this way.

362
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,710
Why are you doing this?

363
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,960
This is about our script.
Napoleon went to see Beauharnais.

364
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,420
But he wasn't there, and he was
left alone with Josephine.

365
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,200
Just the two of them.

366
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,260
Imagine that.

367
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,870
Madam...

368
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,930
Madam, you shouldn't do this anymore.

369
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,810
I'm not inspired, but rather,
I'm terrified to death!

370
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,440
Fear is another source of creativity!

371
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,490
- Please, Madam!
- No...

372
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,160
Wait.

373
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,790
I just heard a noise.

374
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,360
"The only thing I can hear now
is the sound of your beating heart."

375
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,530
What movie is that line from?

376
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,380
Say what comes next.

377
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,340
"The only thing I can
see now is your lips."

378
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,070
What? What is it?

379
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,710
Over there!

380
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,200
Is it... the chairman?

381
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,230
Mr. Chairman!

382
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,000
Madam Oh! What's wrong?

383
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,490
Over there... over there.

384
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,700
The man over there.

385
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,070
Cho Dong Choon!

386
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,620
How dare you come into this house?

387
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,420
This feels nice.
Now my body feels relaxed.

388
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,460
Now, I feel much better.

389
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,470
Now is not the time for you
to be having fun like this.

390
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,160
Have fun?

391
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,220
I guarded Do Kyung's house
all night last night.

392
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,900
Where is that crazy guy hiding?

393
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,310
Hi, Dad.

394
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,800
What?

395
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,340
Tae Soo, hurry!

396
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,420
Dad!

397
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,910
Young Master!

398
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,010
What the heck are you trying to do?

399
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,900
Where's my dad? Huh?

400
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,660
What's wrong, Young Master?

401
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,030
Did I do something wrong?

402
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,790
Tae Soo, you came too. It's cold outside.

403
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,840
Father!

404
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,400
What's wrong with this guy?

405
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,400
You think he lost his memory?

406
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,250
Does that make sense?

407
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,570
How would I know?

408
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,650
He showed up, out of the blue,
holding an ax over his shoulder.

409
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,860
And he said, "Mr. Chairman!"

410
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,240
And then he bowed to me!
I almost had a heart attack!

411
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,890
You know what he said then?

412
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,740
He asked where the yard dog went.

413
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,070
The yard dog? The Jindo
we had twenty years ago?

414
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,520
Yes.

415
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,610
I don't know what's going on.

416
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,780
But he seems to think that
he's still the butler of the house.

417
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,670
Butler?

418
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,030
Maybe he hurt his brain, and he lost his
memory up until some point in the past.

419
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,610
Maybe up to the
happiest moment in his life.

420
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,280
Would feeding a dog
be your happiest memory?

421
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,020
I can't trust him.

422
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,690
He acted so loyal to Dad.

423
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,070
But then he stole the money
out of his safe and ran away.

424
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,290
What?

425
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,320
There's no reason to discuss that.

426
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,240
Do you know why he might
have lost his memory?

427
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,050
Call the police
so they can take him away.

428
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,950
The police?

429
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,630
For starters, he trespassed in my home.
They're sure to find even more than that.

430
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,590
He deserves jail time.

431
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,080
Well... the truth is...

432
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:25,490
He and I had an argument,
and it got physical.

433
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,570
He hit his head against a wall,
and got this way.

434
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,690
What?

435
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,280
It wasn't serious!
He didn't get hurt.

436
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,620
He probably just lost his memory.

437
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,360
I'll take care of him.
Don't worry.

438
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,060
Among all of the ladies that
I have served in this house...

439
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,740
You are the oldest.

440
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,540
It seems that the chairman's taste
in women changed while I wasn't around.

441
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,490
Please...

442
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,320
So you're saying... you didn't
see anything earlier, right?

443
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
Can I have more soup?

444
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,940
Sit down.

445
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,750
Thank you, Ma'am. Thank you.

446
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,760
Look here. Eat as much as you want.

447
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,270
Mr. Butler.

448
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,880
I came here for a meeting.
And nothing else happened.

449
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,290
I swear.

450
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,190
I didn't ask.

451
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,460
Geez.

452
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,690
What do they only eat peppers
and tomatoes here?

453
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,810
You know what a butler
is supposed to do, right?

454
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,270
Of course, Ma'am.

455
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,020
I know nothing. I saw nothing.

456
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,590
I...

457
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,850
I covered up...

458
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,170
for many ladies here.

459
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,870
What can we do?

460
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,590
He's like an innocent lamb now.
Just watch him.

461
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:02,380
If he isn't faking it, it's only a matter
of time before he gets his memory back.

462
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,490
Are you telling me
to watch a ticking time bomb?

463
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,120
You're doing this for Do Kyung.

464
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,760
What else can you do?

465
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,950
Tae Soo... can't you take him with you?

466
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,670
Drop the nonsense.

467
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,330
I'm leaving.

468
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,680
Tae Soo! Hey! Hey!

469
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,650
Geez.

470
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,420
What is this?

471
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,890
Why did you have all of
your stuff sent here?

472
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,310
Sister, please let it go this one time.

473
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,320
I'm not good at working at a big company.

474
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,150
If Tae Soo gives me
a small role in the movie

475
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,460
I'll give my very best...

476
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,630
What?

477
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,470
Are you trying to live off of us?

478
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,020
Tell me the truth.

479
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,570
Is this why you asked
Soo Min out for the concert?

480
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,650
Wow, I'm speechless.

482
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,440
You wench! Do you know what
has happened because of you?

483
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,030
I'll kill you right now! Come here!

484
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,090
- Come here!
- I'm sorry!

485
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,910
Hey! You!

486
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,700
Go back to Seoul!
You're a burden to everyone!

487
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,670
Oh, a war between two sisters!

488
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,700
I have no place to go.
I have no money.

489
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,190
What happened to your money?

490
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,660
What about your rent deposit?
Tae Soo took out a loan for that!

491
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,390
Oh, that... I paid off
my credit card with that.

492
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:24,430
What? You did what?

493
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,920
You wench! You!

494
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,450
What's wrong now?

495
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:32,880
Dad, she spent all of her money
and used me so she could live here.

496
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,230
She wants to be in your movie.

497
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,230
What?

498
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:39,050
You'll help me right? Even a small role...

499
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,880
You haven't learned a damn thing!

500
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,950
Calm down.

501
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,370
Geez.

502
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,060
Mom.

503
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,670
Did you come back from collecting
spring water? What's wrong?

504
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,070
Why are you all out here?

505
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,990
Ma'am, isn't that my mink coat?

506
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,620
Why are you wearing my coat?

507
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,530
What's wrong, Grandma?

508
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,260
Ah!

509
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,840
What's wrong?

510
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,760
Wow, you are awesome!

511
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,210
No!

512
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,760
Well...

513
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,260
Didn't you say that it cost you
12 million won?

514
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,150
And that you bought it
in 36 monthly installments?

515
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,920
Mom!

516
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,760
Why did you wear someone else's coat?

517
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,090
Hye Sook's mom wanted to buy me lunch!
But I had nothing to wear!

518
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,420
I don't have a coat.

519
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,370
I'm going to die from running.

520
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,090
Oh, Tae Soo...

521
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,770
Please buy her a new coat with the
money you would spend on my coffin.

522
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,850
Oh, Honey...

523
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,010
Please come get me.

524
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,490
You! Are you out of your mind?

525
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,980
How could you buy that
expensive mink coat?

526
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,750
My goodness!

527
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,690
She's done nothing wrong. Just beat me!

528
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,690
Just beat me.

529
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,180
Okay then.

530
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,050
Mr. Chairman.

531
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,130
Well, do you have anything
you would like me to do?

532
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,240
I don't... I don't.

533
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,170
Have a good night, Mr. Chairman.

534
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,330
Hey!

535
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,420
You scared me.

536
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,120
You really don't remember anything?

537
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,790
It's okay. Tell me the truth.

538
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,900
What do you mean?

539
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,420
Man... you're driving me nuts.

540
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,510
Have a good night, Young Master.

541
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,310
Have breakfast, everyone!

542
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,520
Come on! Sit down!

543
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,890
Eun Sil made breakfast!

544
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,410
Don't even try. Go back.
We have no room for you.

545
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,070
She's going to share her room with me.

546
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,340
They came to an agreement.

547
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,540
Grandma let her use her room
in exchange for the damaged coat.

548
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,770
Mother, why are you doing this?

549
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,940
That's not the only reason.

550
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,220
In this house, no one pays any
attention to me the way she does.

551
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:30,290
She'll have a place to stay.
And I won't be as lonely.

552
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,500
It's good for both of us.

553
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,390
Catch two birds with one stone.

554
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,220
- You!
- Stop, stop, stop.

555
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,830
Soo Min is still growing,
but her face looks pale.

556
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,640
Can I help you with anything?

557
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,100
Geez, everyone teases me for being short.

558
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,620
That's why you should listen to me.

559
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:55,190
You should take this every day.
It's good for you.

560
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,490
Here.

561
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,190
Okay. I'll grow to be tall
like Miss Korea!

562
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,410
You're the best!

563
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,150
What? One Heart does what?

564
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,960
It wasn't an official audition.

565
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,800
Madam Oh created a nemesis
for Lee Do Kyung's character.

566
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,620
It was just a trial audition
for that role.

567
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,320
Now it's Madam Oh too?

568
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,190
No one is helping me.

569
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,160
Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman!

570
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,110
This is serious!

571
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,120
What is it, that you can't breathe?

572
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,750
My safe is gone!

573
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,560
The gold ax you bought me,
and my cash, and my jewelry!

574
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,850
They are all gone! Oh my goodness!

575
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,370
- Find Cho Dong Choon!
- Yes, Sir.

576
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,600
Okay, I see.

577
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,520
What did they say?

578
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,080
He got on an airplane
to China one hour ago.

579
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,620
He didn't lose his memory at all.
He was pretending, for the money.

580
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,870
What a wretched piece of garbage!

581
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,970
He showed up again 20 years later
and played me the same exact way!

582
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,450
Is it true? Did he really run away?

583
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,200
What an idiot...

584
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,170
What are you?
Is there anything you do properly?

585
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,230
I'm sorry about him, but I'm doing
a good job with the movie.

586
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,420
Doing a good job?
Is making a film child's play?

587
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,520
Why are you involving your ex-wife?

588
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,120
Do Kyung used to be an actress.

589
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,970
There's no reason she can't succeed.
And she's perfect for this role.

590
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,020
You don't have other motives?

591
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,740
I heard that you take your kid
to a mental hospital.

592
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,720
Dad.

593
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,620
It's not a mental hospital.
It's a mental health clinic.

594
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,870
A mental health clinic!

595
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:56,490
You have no remorse for your sick
granddaughter who lives fatherless?

596
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,810
I know you have no affection for her.
But how can you say something like that?

597
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,470
Then see her, and only her.
Don't try to involve that fox!

598
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,860
And what if I can't?

599
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,390
Since it was brought up, I better say it.

600
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,750
I will get back together with Do Kyung.

601
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,250
What did you say?

602
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,520
I didn't expect you to approve it.
Just pretend you don't know.

603
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,420
I was an idiot who couldn't decide
on my own marriage, or remarriage.

604
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,850
I don't want to live like that anymore.

605
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,410
Can you handle the consequences?

606
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,320
Have you ever seen me consider
the consequences when taking action?

607
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,420
You!

608
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,450
What? The butler ran away?

609
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,070
He ran away with all of my money!

610
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:03,880
He won't show up here again.
So don't worry about that.

611
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,130
Are you sure that I don't need to worry?

612
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,110
Regardless, absurd things
like this keep happening.

613
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,810
My soul is stricken with fear!

614
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,090
I am disappointed.

615
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,920
I didn't think you were a weak man.

616
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,750
Look here, Madam.

617
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,560
If the chairman finds out
about us, we will both die!

618
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,560
Both you, and me!

619
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,540
I can't succumb to that death
before even making my movie!

620
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,480
Secretary Ma, what brings you
to the production office?

621
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,800
The chairman wants to see both of you.

622
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,070
For what?

623
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,460
I can't say it myself.

624
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,550
You will know when you get there.

625
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,060
Why did you want to see us, Mr. Chairman?

626
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,800
Are you busy these days?

627
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,040
Well...

628
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,300
Of course.

629
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:15,020
We're really busy trying to
bring the script to perfection.

630
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,080
You already know that.

631
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,200
Geez.

632
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,850
What's wrong? Are you sick?

633
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,730
Oh... well...

634
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,180
He's stressed out with the script.

635
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,340
Right.

636
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,640
It's not an easy thing
to create a work of art.

637
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,390
I am a bit upset with the two of you.

638
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,580
Mr. Chairman! I was in the wrong!

639
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,720
Please forgive me!

640
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,140
If you really think that you did wrong...

641
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,660
Then you should recast.

642
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,100
Pardon me?

643
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,860
Director Yoon is here.

644
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,020
Oh, Tae Soo!

645
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,600
The new captain of Choong Shim Pictures!

646
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,000
Pardon me?

647
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,520
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down and let's talk.

648
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,840
Okay.

649
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,750
I called the three of you here

650
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,200
because we are in an awful situation.

651
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,620
How could all of you
be played by that idiot?

652
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,820
What do you mean?

653
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,230
You had a good script
and everything was going well.

654
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,150
But why did you let Gi Bum
run the whole show

655
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,430
when he had his own vested interest?

656
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,740
Oh...

657
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,110
Recast, and this time,
keep things fair and square.

658
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:55,490
That's how you can save the movie
and that's what I want.

659
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,030
Do you understand what I'm saying?

660
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,030
Okay? Writer Oh? Director Bong?

661
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,160
And our new captain too!

662
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,310
Okay.

663
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,600
I see.

664
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,270
<i>[OPEN AUDITION]</i>

665
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,510
What's that?

666
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,640
What is this? An open audition?

667
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,880
Wow, it says anyone can apply!

668
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,740
Yes! Madam Jung is mine!

669
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,870
Brother, why are you smiling like that?

670
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,220
Smile?

671
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:37,430
I always smile!

672
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,470
I've never seen him smile like that.

673
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:46,320
Just like we said in the announcement

674
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,720
fairness is key, okay?

675
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,840
No favoritism, no nepotism, okay?

676
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,110
Finally, I feel like we can
make this movie the right way.

677
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,560
I'm so glad you came back
as our new captain.

678
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,210
What is that thing you posted outside?

679
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,820
Who said you could recast?

680
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,750
Mr. Yoon made the decision.

681
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,810
That's bullshit.
I'm the legal owner of this company!

682
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:15,640
The chairman ordered it himself.

683
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,660
Gi Bum, sit down. Let's talk.

684
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,320
You were sucking up to my father
about your house until a few days ago.

685
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,540
So this is what you got out of it?

686
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,520
Sucking up?

687
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,540
He got upset because
you practically cast anybody.

688
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,570
Do Kyung isn't just anyone!

689
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,560
Are you really going to be like this?

690
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,190
That's too bad, Do Kyung.

691
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,160
You won't be able to play that
cafe owner character, right?

692
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,280
It's too early to say that.

693
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,560
Do Kyung is the top candidate
for that role.

694
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,620
She'll just have to audition,
fair and square, like everybody else.

695
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:02,530
Still, you must feel like you lost
a fish you had already reeled in.

696
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,670
Well, I kind of feel that way.

697
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,940
But this is an opportunity
for me to show my true value.

698
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,020
I feel motivated.

699
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,880
That's great, Do Kyung.

700
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,990
Nothing is free in this world.

701
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,510
It's right to earn it with fair play.

702
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,970
Madam Oh, for the sake of
everyone at Choong Shim

703
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:30,930
I wholeheartedly welcome
the open audition.

704
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:34,530
Eun Ok, are you going to audition too?

705
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,820
You were totally into it when you
grabbed Do Kyung's hair last time.

706
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,910
You must have gained some
confidence in your acting, right?

707
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,750
I was just saying I support it.
I won't audition...

708
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:48,180
Okay, whether anyone
here auditions or not

709
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,200
this audition is very important
for our Choong Shim family.

710
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,820
So please encourage and
support one another. Okay?

711
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,820
Yes.

712
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,790
- Of course.
- Yes, Ma'am.

713
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:03,120
One Heart!

714
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,160
- Why did you...
- Madam Oh Sook Ja!

715
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,780
It's Oh Joo Ran!

716
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,490
You went as far as
becoming a screenwriter!

717
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,400
- Yet, you ruin everything.
- What?

718
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,070
I'm talking about Do Kyung.

719
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:26,640
I already cast her.
But what's with this open audition?

720
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,550
You know that it's the chairman
who wanted that.

721
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:32,860
You said he would listen to you.

722
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,660
That was the leverage you used
at the negotiating table.

723
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,430
Are you trying to destroy me,
rather than help me?

724
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,220
Of course not.

725
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:50,800
If you keep this up, you won't be able
to register your marriage to my father.

726
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,720
You know, give and take.

727
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:59,770
I really want that marriage registered
so I can call you Mother. Understood?

728
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:04,480
Please understand how I feel,
Madam Oh Sook Ja!

729
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,330
Oh, Writer Oh! Welcome home!

730
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:19,210
I ordered a new gold ax. A big one!

731
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,310
Why do you look so tired?

732
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,560
Because of you.

733
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,620
What?

734
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,440
The open audition.

735
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,480
The movie production company
is in chaos because of that.

736
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,020
Oh.

737
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:38,480
I'm trying to make a good movie
by discovering new talents!

738
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,470
Speaking of which,
I have something to show you.

739
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,590
What is it?

740
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,170
<i>You fox!</i>

741
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,590
<i>Because of you, my life is a disaster!</i>

742
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:03,490
<i>You are the nuclear bomb in my life!
You are a tsunami!</i>

743
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,000
What do you think?

744
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,470
They're pretty good!

745
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:10,320
She's definitely a former actress!

746
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,330
She seems solid,
and she looks good on screen.

747
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:18,660
As a screenwriter, I really like her!

748
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:24,460
There is no one who can play this role
as well as Lee Do Kyung.

749
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,480
What? You want me to act?

750
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,370
What are you talking about, Mr. Chairman?

751
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:38,450
I came here because
you wanted to eat my kimchi.

752
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:39,720
Wow.

753
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,640
I thought you were just a good cook.

754
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:47,070
But you're a hell of an actor too!

755
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,330
Pardon me?

756
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,790
You are much better than someone
I know who used to be an actress.

757
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,890
Oh...

758
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:59,020
I want you to play that role!

759
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,730
Even so, there's an open audition.

760
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,430
That's what I'm saying.

761
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:06,380
You should audition, and get that role!

762
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,680
Is it because you don't
want Do Kyung to do it?

763
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,220
I just want someone better to do it.

764
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,820
Someone that's good for the movie.

765
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,110
It's the movie Tae Soo is making.

766
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:24,170
That's why I shouldn't.

767
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:28,150
Enjoy the kimchi.
I'll bring you more next time.

768
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:33,860
There's someone who wants to
move into your house this month.

769
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,060
Excuse me?

770
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,500
Everyone heard that
the house was built very well.

771
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,170
Many people want to buy that house.

772
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,550
Some people want to pay
above market price.

773
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,250
Do you know how I feel now?

774
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,550
I feel like a dog, a dog whose owner
just strapped on my leash.

775
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:02,850
You'll just tighten my leash even more.

776
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:05,590
I guess I better listen to you now.

777
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:11,480
In return, please let us live in that
house until Sung Min goes to college.

778
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,230
Is that all you need?

779
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:20,000
If you win that role, I'll put your name
on the title of the house.

780
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,200
Do you mean it?

781
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:27,680
But you have to keep it a secret.

782
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:39,060
Sir, I am calling you because
I see many good candidates here.

783
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:43,640
We are having an open audition this time.

784
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,410
Why would you bringing gangsters?
This is a movie!

785
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:49,550
We are not recruiting gangsters.
We're recruiting actors!

786
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,990
Hang up!

787
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,630
We need top actors. Someone new! Yes.

788
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:59,070
Thank you, Eun Sil.

789
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:03,320
There may be bad actors,
but there aren't bad roles.

790
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,530
I want to be salt and light...

791
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,680
Excuse me. I don't want this.

792
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,230
Why? I like it.

793
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,400
This is a bribe!

794
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:15,780
Tae Soo!

795
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,010
Please tell Producer Lee not to hate me.

796
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:22,620
Now you're soliciting.

797
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,160
That's enough.

798
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,940
We called a lot of places.
You'll be hearing back soon.

799
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,960
Be ready for the audition, okay?

800
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,750
You fox! You are a disaster in my life!

801
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,150
You're a nuclear bomb in my life!
You're a tsunami!

802
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,610
I will reveal all of
your most shameful secrets!

803
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:41,570
I'll crush you before you get the chance!

804
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,520
Geez!

805
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,560
Why are you fighting again?

806
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,840
Dad, you ruined their acting practice!

807
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,560
Acting practice?

808
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,060
Yes, Mom and Auntie are auditioning.

809
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:56,850
What?

810
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,750
What do you mean?
You're going to audition?

811
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,230
Why? Can't I do that?

812
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:09,020
Are you crazy? Do you remember
what you said to your sister?

813
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:13,980
You told her that it wasn't a joke,
and that she shouldn't bother me!

814
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,760
Do you have to dance to her tune?

815
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,020
It's not that!

816
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,170
I just want to give it a try!

817
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:27,340
Your sister is giving me enough trouble.

818
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,640
If you do this, you're putting me
in an awkward position.

819
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,000
You shouldn't do this.

820
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,820
You know how I got this opportunity back.

821
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,450
Is a housekeeper all that I can be?

822
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:40,570
Back in school, I was a much
better actor than Do Kyung.

823
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,240
Let's go, everyone.

824
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,740
Please, give me my coat back.

825
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,240
I will sit here for just one more minute.

826
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,940
I feel like...

827
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:00,090
I don't remember at all

828
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,970
what the walls or the ceiling
in this house really look like.

829
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:06,460
That's why I keep looking at them.

830
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,820
I'm looking very eagerly.

831
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,770
I remember too.

832
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:13,480
It was when I was six years old,
at a church event.

833
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,910
I was sitting on this windowsill.

834
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:19,010
I saw my father walking down the street.

835
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:23,080
When we leave, there won't
be anyone left here.

836
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,070
Ha ha ha! It's going to be
like that until the spring.

837
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:34,350
Now... get in the wagon.

838
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:36,290
It's time.

839
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:41,620
My beautiful house,
those beautiful hills.

840
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,420
My life, my youth!

841
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,320
My happiness!

842
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,420
Goodbye, my house.

843
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,970
Goodbye, my old life.

844
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,400
God bless my new life!

845
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:56,180
Hooray!

846
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,730
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

847
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:07,040
Eun Ok! You are an amazing actress!

848
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,000
You have to be the protagonist!

849
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,190
Thank you, Teacher.

850
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,420
Do Kyung...

851
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,650
If anyone wanted to cast you for a movie

852
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,930
that person would be a swindler.

853
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:24,840
Pardon me?

854
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,960
Didn't I do pretty well today?

855
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,000
I thought I did well.

856
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,120
Well, you would be good at
playing a narcissistic role.

857
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:40,010
Eun Ok, don't you want to act?

858
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,940
Not at all.

859
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,770
I want to be a good wife.

860
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:48,950
I'll marry a civil servant, have lots of
children, and live with my mother-in-law.

861
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:51,970
Are you crazy? Why would you
want to live with your mother-in-law?

862
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,300
Be careful what you wish for!

863
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,950
I feel like I'll have
a nice mother-in-law.

864
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:00,330
She'll be someone warm and sophisticated.

865
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,800
Do I look prettier?

866
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,340
Ma'am, the mole on your nose is gone.

867
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,200
Oh, my.

868
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,870
I drew it. It's supposed to be pretty.

869
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:26,190
All beautiful women have
a mole on their noses.

870
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,260
It's right there.

871
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,980
Oh, don't tell the kids.

872
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,540
What's the matter?

873
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,520
Do we need a reason to drink?

874
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,930
Let me pour one for our new captain.

875
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,660
Geez, what are you talking about?

876
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,770
My dad said you were
the new captain of the movie.

877
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,630
That's how it should be.

878
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:03,580
An idiot like me can't make a movie.

879
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,980
Don't be pitiful. It doesn't suit you.

880
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,070
Tae Soo.

881
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,460
Please do a favor for this poor guy.

882
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,070
What is it?

883
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:19,420
Do Kyung... has to play that role.

884
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,500
You know that.

885
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,850
You know I'm not into making movies.

886
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,110
I'm doing this for Do Kyung.

887
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,500
Gi Bum...

888
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,810
I want to make her a lead actress,
and I want to get back together with her.

889
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:40,070
You are the only one who
can grant me this wish.

890
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,500
I'm a poor man.

891
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:51,790
Tae Soo.

892
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:58,420
I'm the poorest guy here!
You know my situation!

893
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,520
What about it?

894
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,390
I'm standing on the edge of a cliff!
There's no place for me to go!

895
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:07,220
And I'm begging a guy like that!
I'm the poor guy!

896
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,770
I envy your life!

897
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,490
I don't even have a wife!

898
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:12,990
I don't have a house to live in!

899
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:15,110
You are blessed to have a mother!

900
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:18,010
You are blessed to have a father!

901
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:19,130
Tae Soo, please!

902
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:22,070
Gi Bum, please!

903
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:25,720
- Ah! I got cramps! Cramps!
- Cramps, cramps.

904
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,610
- Cramps...
- Cramps...

905
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,170
What is this?

906
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,370
- Ouch!
- Ouch!

907
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:02,110
- Geez, I'm stuck!
- Geez, I'm stuck!

908
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,490
What are you doing?

909
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:10,860
My wife!

910
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,920
Ex.

911
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,130
My ex-wife!

912
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,050
What are you doing here?

913
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:18,280
Why did you call me?

914
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,590
Come on, sit down! Do Kyung too.

915
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:24,620
The four of us used to
hang out together all the time.

916
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,750
We remembered that, so we called you.

917
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,290
He missed those days.

918
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:31,080
Why do you miss that?

919
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:37,420
- How long ago was that?
- 25 years ago.

920
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:41,220
Wow, time flies!

921
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:53,030
Oh, right here!

922
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,540
I envy Do Kyung.

923
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,790
Did you wait a long time?

924
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:21,130
No, I didn't.

925
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,320
You got a new scarf?

926
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,190
- Is it good?
- Yes.

927
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,470
Eun Ok!

928
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,230
Long time no see.

929
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,410
Yes, it's been a while.

930
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,370
Hi.

931
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:35,580
What's your name?

932
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,180
Choi Kyung Mee!
How many times have I told you?

933
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:42,280
I've seen you many times,
but I can't remember you.

934
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,140
Unlike Do Kyung.

935
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,800
I'm here too. Have you been well?

936
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,310
Yeah.

937
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,180
I'll go then. Have fun.

938
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,870
Hey...

939
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,510
Kyung Mee!

940
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,420
What?

941
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:04,910
What? Should I hang with
you guys too? I'm free.

942
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:07,400
No, I wanted to say bye. Bye.

943
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:11,010
Okay. Bye then.

944
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,220
Bye then.

945
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,350
If you leave, we'll be an odd number.

946
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:20,180
How about karaoke? I'll pay for it!

947
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,310
<i>I don't know where or when</i>

948
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:29,500
<i>but love always...</i>

949
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:39,030
<i>Can't you make a place
for me in your heart?</i>

950
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:48,370
<i>You're the one and only
beautiful woman in this world!</i>

951
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:06,400
<i>On this sad day.</i>

952
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:13,980
<i>You, on this day the fig ripens.</i>

953
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:21,510
<i>You and I hid under
the fig tree that day.</i>

954
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:24,840
<i>Whenever I think about those days.</i>

955
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,310
<i>I want to tell that story.</i>

956
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:32,690
<i>A girl secretly in love</i>

957
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:36,180
<i>and a boy who's secretly in love.</i>

958
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,180
<i>One day under this sky...</i>

959
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:46,210
<i>One swallowtail butterfly</i>

960
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:53,250
<i>was sitting on a petal.</i>

961
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:58,860
<i>What's wrong with me,
swallowtail butterfly.</i>

962
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:03,640
<i>Fly up high into the sky.</i>

963
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:09,160
<i>Swallowtail butterfly, fly!</i>

964
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,200
<i>- Fly into the clouds!</i>
- Oh yeah!

965
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:21,470
- All right!
<i>- Swallowtail butterfly!</i>

966
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,290
<i>Swallowtail butterfly, fly!</i>

967
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:27,720
Stop it already!

968
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,150
If you don't stop, we'll leave.

969
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:33,610
Should we all go drink more?
Yeah!

970
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:36,400
Enough. Nothing is open
at this hour. Let's go.

971
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,400
Let's go home.

972
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,680
Wait, wait.

973
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:44,350
Let's get some alcohol
and go drink at my office!

974
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:48,660
You are the captain, indeed! Let's go!

975

<i>Swallowtail butterfly, fly!</i>

976
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:01,470
Hey! A swallowtail butterfly!

977
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:06,080
Gi Bum, what is that singer,
Kim Hong Gook, doing these days?

978
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,180
I'm sure he's doing okay.

979
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,450
Hey, who are you?

980
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:15,560
Hey, why are you standing
in front of my office?

981
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,150
Hey, you!

982
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,420
Who are you?

983
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,200
Standing there like that...

984
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,120
How have you been?

985
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,510
You didn't miss me?
