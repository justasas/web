<i>[Episode 5]</i>

3
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,630
What do we do now?

4
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,970
Just stay focused.
We sink or swim!

5
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,000
Should we spray water over him?
He's possessed.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,560
How about a cross, or garlic?
Do you have anything like that?

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,650
It's useless!
It's best to just knock him out!

8
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,580
Ah...

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,030
It's here...
Here... here!

10
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,300
It's here?

11
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,880
It's here!

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,770
Right here!

13
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,800
Huh?

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,270
Something is here!

15
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,310
Looks like something is here.

16
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,470
Take it out.

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,130
Be careful.

18
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,240
These are sandbags.

19
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,700
- Did... did you move it?
- Why would I do that?

20
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,740
What?

21
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,590
Then where the heck did it go?

22
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh no...

23
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,750
My poor child...

24
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,440
Look at me.

25
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,820
Who are you?

26
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,360
Where am I?

27
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,730
Se Woon!

28
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,550
I'm your mom!

29
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,200
Are you crazy?
You're not my mom.

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,020
Go away!

31
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,530
Gi Bum, are you okay?

32
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,170
Are you back, Gi Bum?

33
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,940
- Tae Soo...
- Yeah?

34
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,970
Why am I here? Why am I...

35
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,210
Gi Bum!

36
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,780
I was possessed by Mr. Son's ghost?

37
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,810
Don't even get me started.
I still have goosebumps.

38
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,380
So what happened?

39
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,000
Did it come out?

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,240
If it had come out,
you and I wouldn't be here now.

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,500
Then where did it go?

42
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,740
You and I fixed it on the stormy night.

43
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,180
Geez, lower your voice.

44
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,730
You scared me!

45
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,220
What is it that you have
to discuss so quietly?

46
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,280
By the way,
what brings you here, Officer Seo?

47
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,550
The Shaman of Miari stirred up a big
commotion at the police station.

48
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,290
I'm in charge of that case, you know.

49
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,580
I heard you were at the shamanic ritual.

50
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,430
I need to ask you a few things.

51
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,640
What is it?

52
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,230
You know the other night,
we had thunder and lightning...

53
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,070
Well, I guess
something happened that night.

54
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,530
What do you mean?

55
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,810
Someone reported something to the police.

56
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,590
Someone saw a guy in a raincoat
going somewhere with a shovel.

57
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,210
Perhaps...

58
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,990
You guys...

59
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,380
What the heck are you doing?

60
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,680
Mr. Chairman...

61
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,290
How can you do this to patients?

62
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,850
What station are you at?
What's your name?

63
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,570
Go catch North Korean spies.

64
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,910
Don't ever come back!

65
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,210
<i>What an idiot.</i>

66
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,850
Are you trying to disgrace
your family name?

67
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,010
You always do the dumbest things!

68
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,360
Because I'm a dummy.

69
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,290
I ordered herbal tonic.
You need to restore your energy.

70
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,400
Let's have dinner together later.
Bring your wife with you.

71
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
Pardon?

72
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,030
We have good meat!

73
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,720
And I have something to say to you.

74
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,150
I got it wrong because
my prayers were lacking.

75
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,550
But I'll find my son, no matter what.

76
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,650
Se Woon, please wait for me.

77
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,020
Mommy won't give up!

78
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,040
Of course you won't.

79
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,680
Don't ever give up.

80
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,320
Mother, didn't you say
your train comes at five?

81
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,800
Is it already five?

82
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,870
Let's get up.
You said a rich client was coming.

83
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,340
Thank you for helping me as if
it were your own business.

84
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,750
I'll find my son and come back
to see you again.

85
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,640
Ma'am, please don't worry.
You'll find your son.

86
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,260
Of course! You will find him.

87
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,460
- Take care. Bye.
- Okay. Thanks.

88
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,560
I don't think Mr. Son is alive.

89
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,100
What does it mean to be possessed?

90
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,270
It means you are possessed by a spirit.

91
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,170
Mr. Son's wandering spirit...

92
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,720
Director Baek's...

93
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,190
Ah!

94
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,450
Oh my...

95
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,150
His spirit went into him.

96
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,200
My goodness...

97
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,440
But listen.

98
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,320
Why is it that Mr. Son's spirit
possessed Director Baek, of all people?

99
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,610
That part really bothers me.

100
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,520
All of you saw it.

101
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,150
Mother...

102
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,540
I'm in here, Mother...

103
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,830
Oh... Mother...

104
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,250
Stop it! You're making everyone scared!

105
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,700
Don't go overboard!

106
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,580
Geez! You're the one going overboard.

107
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,410
Why did you slap the possessed man?

108
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,260
For a moment,
I thought you were an exorcist.

109
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,740
It wasn't a mistake...

110
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,580
Wake up, Gi Bum!
You're not Mr. Son!

111
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,480
I did that for Gi Bum--

112
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,380
I thought it was too much.

113
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,160
I know they're friends,
but he's still your husband's boss.

114
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,100
You have manners.
You should apologize to him.

115
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,110
Hyun Jee would be upset
if she heard about it.

116
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,700
He's still her father.

117
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,090
Hi, Honey.

118
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,370
Mr. Chairman invited us to dinner?

119
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,240
He doesn't need to do that.
His hands are so full at the moment.

120
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,800
Okay. I won't be late.

121
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,350
Wow, Eun Ok.

122
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,570
Mr. Chairman really treats you
like his own daughter in-law.

123
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,610
He's a bit harsh on Do Kyung, you know.

124
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,780
He's not being harsh.
He just ignores me.

125
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,300
I'm leaving.

126
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,070
She's being jealous.

127
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,820
And she just sided with Director Baek.

128
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,250
I bet it must be
pretty upsetting and disturbing.

129
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,030
It's her ex-husband who
was possessed. Mother...

130
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,720
I said stop it!

131
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,850
Geez!

132
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,050
Please!

133
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,600
Stop it!

134
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Why do you keep doing that?
Don't do that!

135
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,700
- You scared me!
- Be quiet!

136
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,740
Oh my--

137
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,740
Don't be scared. It's me.

138
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,980
What are you so scared?

139
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,030
I thought you were at the hospital.

140
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,740
I left. It's not like I'm sick.

141
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,100
You saw it all, right?

142
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,640
Yes. It was a bit scary.

143
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,850
Geez.

144
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,110
It's hard to impress you anyway.
But that was awful for you to see.

145
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,670
Please don't tell Hyun Jee.
I came to say that.

146
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,300
Does your father know what happened?

147
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,670
He called me dummy... idiot.. Oh, man!

148
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,170
How much longer will you live like that?

149
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,360
You're over 40, and you have a daughter.

150
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,760
Why are you so intimidated
by your father?

151
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,840
You don't even have the power to
protect me and your daughter.

152
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,030
Do Kyung, I--

153
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,170
You said you wanted to impress us, right?

154
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,380
Then do that with your actions.

155
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,690
Okay... Try it.

156
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,760
It's going to melt in your mouth.

157
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,300
You said you have something to say.

158
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,540
That shaman was powerful...

159
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,850
How did she find out the location?

160
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,560
Thank goodness! The body wasn't there.

161
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,700
But where on earth did it go?

162
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,320
If it shows up somewhere,
you'll be in big trouble.

163
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,730
It's a good thing that it disappeared!

164
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,420
That's why we are eating meat now!

165
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,190
Please talk about something else.

166
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,070
Huh? Okay, okay, I got it.

167
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,340
Tae Soo, how is it going with the movie?

168
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,190
Is there anything I can help with?

169
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,090
Oh... there's nothing.

170
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,760
Can you put it in writing?

171
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,300
What are you doing?

172
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,360
What?

173
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,760
I heard that you promised to
help him with the movie.

174
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,470
If we have something in writing
it'll make us feel much better.

175
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,980
Special tea is here.

176
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,070
Wow.

177
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,910
What's going on?

178
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,120
Are you discussing a secret?

179
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,910
No, no.

180
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,370
I was waiting for our drinks.

181
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,790
Is today a special day?
You've never done this for anyone.

182
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,220
Does it have to be a special day?

183
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,060
My son is worth more than this drink!

184
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,770
Oh... your son?

185
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,630
Mr. Chairman... I mean, Father.

186
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,390
Then I trust that you'll grant my wish.
Please let me pour for you.

187
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,690
Huh?

188
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,450
I'll be sad if you drink alone.

189
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,000
Love shot!

190
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,570
What are you doing?

191
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,930
What? She's being nice!

192
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,280
- Love shot.
- Love shot.

193
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,460
Oh, Director Baek!

194
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,030
Director Baek.

195
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,110
Wow, did I just spoil the mood?

196
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,930
What's the meat party for?

197
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,280
You shouldn't drink, for your health.

198
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,020
You haven't learned anything?

199
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,000
Either way, I'm never in my right mind.

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,440
Gi Bum, don't say that.
Come join us.

201
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,390
You eat it all.

202
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,350
The uninvited guest will leave you alone.

203
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,620
Leave you alone...

204
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,140
Geez.

205
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,110
Please leave me alone!

206
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,040
How old are you?

207
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,910
Why do you always do
the opposite of what I say?

208
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,850
Do it... don't do it.
You can do it... you can't...

209
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,050
Am I a kindergartner?

210
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,370
I'm over 40 now.
What are you trying to do with me?

211
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,330
Do you really acknowledge me
as the CEO of Choong Shin Construction?

212
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,650
Tae Soo says he's jealous of me.
But I'm jealous of him to death.

213
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,480
It's hard for him to support his family,
but he owns his life.

214
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,590
But what about me?

215
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,350
Am I living my life or your life?

216
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,810
Am I your enemy's son?

217
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,200
Did you keep me to torture me?

218
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,240
Don't act up just because you're drunk!

219
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,040
You didn't even let me
be there when Mom died.

220
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,980
You didn't let me cry,
because I'm a man.

221
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,460
Because of you... my eyes don't tear up,
even when I yawn.

222
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,780
That wasn't enough for you.

223
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,240
You kicked out my wife and daughter!

224
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,910
But you're so good
to someone else's wife.

225
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,270
Honey... where on earth did it go?

226
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,240
I can't sleep when I think about it.

227
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,560
This is why you can't live well
when you commit sin.

228
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,790
If it weren't for Soo Min
and Sung Min, I would...

229
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,340
Geez, why are you
saying things like that?

230
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,720
Honey, I can't just go home like this.

231
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,520
Mr. Son, please go to a nice place.

232
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:52,430
We wish you happiness in heaven.

233
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,350
I am so sorry.

234
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,420
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,160
My wife has done nothing wrong.

236
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,870
It's all my fault.

237
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,610
If you have to punish someone,
please punish me.

238
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,810
Why do you say that?

239
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,900
It's not true. I'm a sinner too.

240
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,380
I'll make a good movie.

241
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,890
And I'll dedicate it to you.

242
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,090
That's all I can do.

243
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,850
Please forgive me.

244
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,420
No, please don't forgive us.

245
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,150
It's true.

246
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,330
Don't forgive us.

247
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,990
I am sorry.

248
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,100
- I'm sorry.
- I am sorry.

249
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,700
Wow, your head is always bright.

250
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,100
Welcome, Brother.

251
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,170
Well, you didn't need to bring anything.

252
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,820
You must be feeling okay.
You're exercising.

253
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,480
Of course! I'm going home tomorrow.

254
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,440
My body is all well now.

255
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,270
Well...

256
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,380
I understand that
Mr. Chairman doesn't like me.

257
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,460
But I'm disappointed that he never
even came to see me at the hospital.

258
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,850
Geez. Is that why you told me to come?

259
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,410
Is Tae Soo doing well?

260
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,940
It's too bad that he is doing well.

261
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,050
Do you know how I got through it,
being at the hospital?

262
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,610
"What should I do with Tae Soo?
Chew him up? Fry him up? Bake him up?"

263
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,250
Those thoughts kept me going.

264
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,070
So... what's your conclusion?

265
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,380
My conclusion is...

266
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,610
I will eat him up, no matter what.

267
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,870
I will eat him up without failing.

268
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,360
I will absolutely...eat him up.

269
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,950
How do you like this room?

270
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,820
I want to hand it over to
Yoon Tae Soon when I leave.

271
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,010
Oh, man.

272
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,500
Mr. Cho has become a real man now.

273
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,360
Right?

274
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,530
You definitely understand me.

275
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,530
Oh, my son! Sit down.

276
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,220
What brings you here at this hour?

277
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,730
I know you're busy,
so I prepared this for you.

278
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,060
Investment Confirmation...

279
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,520
Well, you promised my wife.

280
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,250
Huh?

281
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,670
Oh...

282
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,570
You're really prepared.

283
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:24,010
I consulted with other
filmmakers and a lawyer.

284
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,250
You really hate being sloppy.

285
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,160
That's right. Good job.

286
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,030
It's good to be thorough.

287
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:42,240
I already got my stamp out
for Secretary Ma.

288
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,020
Did you take care of him?

289
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,760
Yes. I put him in the river.

290
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,710
A policeman is digging into it.
You better watch them.

291
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,060
Yes, Sir.

292
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,150
What should I do with Yoon Tae Soo?

293
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,440
I guess I'm not good at farming.

294
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,870
I thought I was taking care of my field.

295
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,680
But shoots are still coming up.

296
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,450
Should I call Cheongjoo?

297
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,960
What is your wife like?

298
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,720
Well... she's pretty innocent.

299
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,460
She has an amazing body.

300
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,080
How about this one?
It's easy to wash and practical.

301
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,550
Are those for Eun Ok?

302
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,670
Yeah...

303
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:21,430
You buy your wife underwear?
You're a good husband.

304
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,190
I'm not, really.

305
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,120
Did you see Gi Bum?

306
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,580
Yeah.

307
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,270
Eun Ok wears an A-cup.

308
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,580
That's too big for her.

309
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,400
Since you're buying for them her,
go a little wild.

310
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,280
As they get older,
women like more colorful underwear.

311
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,860
I'll get this one.

312
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,170
Where is he?

313
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,590
Okay, to the left.

314
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,220
Keep going.

315
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,180
Keep going...

316
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,160
And stop.

317
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,030
Take a deep breath.

318
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,550
Tada!

319
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,510
Honey, what on earth--

320
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,180
Don't say a word.

321
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,380
Tada!

322
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,370
What is this?

323
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,940
One billion won?

324
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,510
I thought the chairman might
not do it... but he signed!

325
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,420
Honey!

326
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,360
Yoon Tae Soo, your husband,
is no scarecrow.

327
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,500
After all of these years,
you don't know that?

328
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Geez, you're finally living up to
your good looks?

329
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,590
You're way too handsome.

330
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,860
Oh... I forgot something
really important.

331
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,250
Well, please come this way, Madam.

332
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,680
Come over here.

333
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,810
- What is it?
- Sit here.

334
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,120
What is this?

335
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,990
Open it, and then you'll know.

336
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,830
Oh, my!

337
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,820
Oh, my! Wow! What is this?

338
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,730
Only three women in Korea
can handle that one.

339
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,190
Kim Tae Hee, Jeon Jee Hyun,
and Kim Eun Ok!

340
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,860
My goodness!
People might speak badly of me!

341
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,480
It's so pretty! How's this look?

342
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,850
How do I look?

343
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,520
There's always a way.

344
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,960
After we went through all that,
we found a way.

345
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,170
Is it really over?

346
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,270
Can we really do this?

347
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,670
It's been really quiet.
I'm sure it's over now.

348
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,630
Let's start fresh.

349
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,610
- Okay.
- A toast!

350
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,700
Love shot.

351
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:10,090
Oh, do you remember you were
going to kill me here last time?

352
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,350
Geez, I really felt like
killing you then.

353
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,940
Tonight, I'll kill you.

354
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,590
Your back is broken,
but your mouth talks a big game!

355
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,980
Do you want to see what else is big, huh?

356
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,490
Oh, my! Oh, my!

357
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,630
Oh, my back! Geez!

358
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,660
Roar!

359
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,930
Roar!

360
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,640
Well... go inside.

361
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,320
Have a good day.

362
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,160
Wow, what a nice day!

363
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,680
I love you! Have a good day!

364
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,990
Bye!

365
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,130
I love you! Bye!

366
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:43,690
<i>Oh, my heart is running toward you!</i>

367
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:49,260
<i>I found a new side of me!</i>

368
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,920
<i>If things are always like this...</i>

369
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,990
<i>It won't be too bad to
live in this harsh world.</i>

370
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,530
<i>It won't be too hard!</i>

371
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,560
Mr. Yoon! Please!

372
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,790
Please! Please don't do this!

373
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,270
We beg you!
Why are you doing this, all of a sudden?

374
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,710
If you fall, you'll die!

375
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,850
You'll die!

376
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,330
I'm risking my life for this movie.

377
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,600
But this script tells me
that I'm already dead.

378
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,770
Don't stop me.

379
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,090
See you in hell.

380
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,780
I'll rewrite it! I'll rewrite it!

381
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,330
I can feel it now! I know now!

382
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,410
I know now.

383
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,700
Well, I am sorry.

384
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,060
I just put on a show to
spark us to do a better job.

385
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,520
We went through a lot.

386
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,260
But now we have one billion won.
We can do it.

387
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,700
Let's write a new script.

388
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,720
Okay.

389
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,140
You can't do this to artists.

390
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,040
More than anything,
we need democracy first.

391
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,490
Okay, from now on,
I'll pay attention to what you say.

392
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,830
So let's work well together, okay?

393
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:21,080
Sung Goo, you take care of
the clubs from now on.

394
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,340
Young Il, you're in charge of
keeping the books.

395
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,640
Okay?

396
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,620
Then what about you?

397
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:34,200
From now on,
I'm devoting myself to the movie!

398
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,640
<i>My Hyun Jee, the most beautiful girl
in the universe!</i>

399
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,860
<i>I have a lot of time these days.
When can I buy you something yummy?</i>

400
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,350
- Hey!
- Shh.

401
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,610
This is my favorite part.

402
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,110
I knew it. This song is boring
every time I listen to it.

403
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,090
Here.

404
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,690
What kind of music did you do?

405
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,390
You said you were a singer in training.
What was your genre?

406
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,070
Acoustic... modern funk, hip hop, rock.

407
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,790
And etc.

408
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,070
Is it music, or me,
that you're interested in?

409
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,470
Could it be... me?

410
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,180
Stop it.

411
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,120
Oh?

412
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,530
Strange. Your face turned red.

413
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,260
Did I see it wrong?

414
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,670
Or did I hit the nail on the head?

415
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,990
Should I pretend I didn't see it?

416
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,400
Enough is enough.

417
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,130
Let's go together.

418
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:25,030
You play the guitar, and I will sing.
How's that?

419
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,070
You worked hard. You're the best!

420
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,830
Wow.

421
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,460
Did you guys
call each other this morning?

422
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,300
Was that a gift from your husband?

423
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,800
How do you know that?

424
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,700
Never mind. Sorry.

425
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,720
Why don't you just say it?

426
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,880
What is it?

427
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,270
You're making me upset.

428
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:05,190
Well, I ran into him at
an underwear store yesterday.

429
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,150
I gave him a tip. I guess he picked
the same one as mine.

430
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,620
My goodness...
Mr. Yoon really has no sense.

431
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,420
I know. They have such different styles.

432
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,680
That's not true.
They aren't that different.

433
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,210
They even have the same taste in men.

434
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,340
Huh? What's this?

435
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,080
Isn't that Sung Min and Hyun Jee?

436
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,830
- What?
- What?

437
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,670
- It's them.
- Right?

438
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,250
Did Young Jae send these?

439
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,530
Don't worry too much.
Even pre-schoolers date these days.

440
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,670
Hey!

441
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,300
You scared me!

442
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,750
I wasn't going to say this but...

443
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,920
- Do Kyung, talk to your daughter.
- What?

444
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,130
Since the incident at the police station,
I've been worried.

445
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,910
You're saying it's
Hyun Jee's fault again?

446
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,750
Daughters learn from their mothers.
I don't like how flirty she is.

447
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,940
You're upset, aren't you?

448
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,080
Because Tae Soo bought you
the same thing I bought?

449
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,210
What?

450
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,400
You should thank me.

451
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,790
You could have gotten
yourself granny panties.

452
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,790
You should have seen what he was holding.

453
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,540
I would like anything my husband buys me.

454
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,980
That's what I'm saying.

455
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,640
You shouldn't do this to me.

456
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,580
You got your husband, thanks to me.

457
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,850
Hey! Watch your mouth!

458
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,000
You're a fox, like always!

459
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,050
You are the real fox here.

460
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,630
You play innocent all along,
yet you took my man away.

461
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,490
Is that not a fact?

462
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,330
Lee Do Kyung!

463
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,990
Ahh!

464
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,750
Oh, no!

465
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,790
What did you do just now?

466
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,960
I didn't see it wrong, did I?

467
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,970
I said to not to kill a flower.

468
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,470
I said to make a peaceful world.

469
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,590
I didn't hear her, Ma'am.

470
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,060
Then what was it?

471
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,200
It's still violence,
even if you don't break arms or legs.

472
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,590
My goodness.

473
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:26,090
Then... is this how you've
been controlling the members?

474
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,490
Do Kyung... are you crying?

475
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,910
No... I'm sorry, Ma'am.

476
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,160
Well... Park Sun Young.

477
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,920
Yes... yes?

478
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,820
Tell me.

479
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,570
Was Eun Ok always violent and
controlling to you like this?

480
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,810
You can tell me the truth.

481
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,260
Oh, no. Eun Ok was never--

482
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,240
It's all my fault!

483
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,860
I shouldn't have joined One Heart.

484
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:15,460
I was too excited about
volunteering with nice people.

485
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:21,640
I knew someone here didn't
want me to join, but...

486
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:28,020
It's all my fault!

487
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,970
Why do you think I started
the feet-washing tradition?

488
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:43,740
Why do you think I had you
wash a new member's feet?

489
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,990
It was to prevent
incidents like this one.

490
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,710
This kind of thing happens when
the leader is not mature enough.

491
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,240
What? I'm controlling?

492
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,300
She only scolded me...
being deceived by that fox!

493
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,990
Stop. Blow your nose, blow your nose.

494
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,620
Everything has been going wrong
ever since that vixen came back!

495
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,120
I was upset about Sung Min,
and now it's Madam Oh!

496
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,610
Geez, please stop it.

497
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,830
Why do you guys fight amongst friends?

498
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,160
Be quiet! You have no right to say that.

499
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,290
Geez. I feel like dying from running.

500
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,670
Why are you taking your anger out on me?

501
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,500
You are an idiot.

502
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,330
You know nothing about women.

503
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,120
What have I done so wrong?

504
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
Here.

505
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,210
Forget it.

506
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:02,310
Geez. I'm going to die from running.

507
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,410
Geez.

508
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,010
Oh, my.

509
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:31,800
Black tea and waffles
are a perfect combination!

510
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,580
It's like Do Kyung and One Heart.

511
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,430
Pardon?

512
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,320
I was a bit surprised at your wits.

513
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,720
You are definitely a good actress.

514
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:49,450
And you make me curious
about what's next to come.

515
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,330
In fact, I'm also curious
about something.

516
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,580
Oh.

517
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,740
From One Heart to Eun Ok...

518
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,340
You're helping me left and right.
What is your reason?

519
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:08,030
Oh, didn't I tell you? My goodness!

520
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,620
Director Baek really wishes
to get back together with you.

521
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,830
I just want to help you.

522
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,000
The chairman is stubborn now.

523
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,450
But he would try to move a mountain
if I asked him to do so.

524
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:31,700
In addition, Director Bae
is depending on me these days.

525
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,360
Madam Oh.

526
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,300
Do you think I came back
to get back together with Director Baek?

527
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,940
Of course, my daughter wants her father.

528
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,190
But I don't really like the man,
Baek Gi Bum.

529
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,430
Maybe if he becomes
independent from the chairman.

530
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,930
Huh?

531
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,580
What my daughter needs is her father,
not a son of her grandfather.

532
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,590
Oh...

533
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,310
I knew it! I knew it!
I was right about you.

534
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:12,540
You are really an
independent and wise woman!

535
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,170
That's exactly what One Heart is about.

536
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:22,790
I'm so glad you joined One Heart!
You are amazing!

537
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,390
Your cup is empty.

538
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,180
Oh?

539
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,430
Oh... it's empty.

540
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,500
Mom, hurry up!
The noodles are getting soggy.

541
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:45,740
Do you have to do that at this hour?
I ate a lot.

542
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,240
If you don't want it, I'll eat it all...

543
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,310
Don't do that. Let's eat together.

544
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,860
Okay.

545
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,570
It looks yummy!

546
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,650
Good.

547
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,410
Mom, I want to do music again.

548
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,030
I'll take it easy.

549
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,720
And I have a partner to do it with me.

550
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,730
He's a bit dense, but it's not too bad.

551
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,220
You're not talking about
Sung Min, are you?

552
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,910
Keep it a secret from his mom.

553
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,530
Yoon Sung Min wants to study music.

554
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,610
Eun Ok will be furious if she finds out.

555
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:37,710
She'll blame you for this. She's vicious.

556
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,500
Are you two really friends?

557
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,400
What? Did something happen again?

558
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,410
You don't need to know.

559
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,370
Does your father talk to you?

560
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,480
He sends me childish texts.
He wants to see me.

561
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,750
He's bothersome!

562
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,430
You wanted to live close to your dad.

563
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,380
Hyun Jee...

564
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:10,040
I'll make sure you live a good life here.

565
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,360
Erase all the bad memories
you had back in Seoul.

566
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,740
No one can touch us.

567
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,200
Okay.

568
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,710
Oh, are you taking your medicine on time?

569
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,700
Oh, I forgot!

570
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,460
Wow... did you get a new car?

571
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,340
It's my company car.

572
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,480
You have a nice job.

573
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,190
You just sit around...

574
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,940
and money just rolls in your hands.

575
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,090
Why did you want to see me here?

576
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,510
<i>When you come, you're a regular customer.</i>

577
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:21,190
<i>When you don't come, you're a stranger.</i>

578
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,600
This song suddenly came to my mind.

579
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,530
You asked to see me last time.
But you are acting like a stranger now.

580
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,860
What's wrong with you, Brother?

581
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,770
What about what?

582
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,820
I'm just speaking the truth.

583
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,410
Get to the point.

584
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,990
That stormy night...

585
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:45,890
Director Baek was caught
on camera, speeding.

586
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,250
It was near Bong Gal Mountain.

587
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,930
The road must have been really slippery.

588
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:54,610
I wonder where he was going
at 110 kilometers per hour.

589
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,560
I heard the chairman
turned down Director Baek.

590
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,840
And then he raised your hand.

591
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:08,010
So Director Baek lost his business
chance and you got to make a movie.

592
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,250
So Director Baek got really angry...

593
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:15,260
and took care of him.

594
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,420
What do you think?
Do you see the picture?

595
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:25,130
Draw your picture on a paper!

596
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,320
You said to help each other when in need!

597
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,100
It's your turn to help me, Tae Soo.

598
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,030
Please! Gi Bum isn't that kind of man!

599
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:39,360
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Bye.

600
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,480
Tae Soo, watch your back!

601
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,180
What are you, huh?

602
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,020
Hey!

603
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,930
Do Kyung!

604
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,110
Open your eyes! Wake up!

605
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,470
It was like being in a movie.

606
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:43,700
What? How can you laugh?

607
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,000
You were lucky.
It could have been bad.

608
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,650
Anyway, it seems that we run
into each other too often.

609
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,680
I don't want any misunderstandings.

610
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,610
Don't worry.

611
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,570
Honey! Tae Soo!

612
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,750
Oh...

613
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,530
Oh! Do Kyung!

614
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,370
Do Kyung...

615
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,470
What happened?

616
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,900
Someone was trying to hit me.

617
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,380
Do Kyung happened to see it
and saved me.

618
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,400
Save you?

619
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,490
That's a bit of an exaggeration.

620
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,440
Someone suspicious was
following him so I let him know.

621
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,250
I didn't get hurt badly.
I just need a cast for a while.

622
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:40,240
Geez. Unbelievable...

623
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,890
How could you not notice him?

624
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,500
Eun Ok, don't be too harsh.

625
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,960
I'm sure he was shocked too.

626
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,330
I wasn't talking to you.

627
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:55,410
What's wrong with you?
Do Kyung got hurt because of me.

628
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,830
How long has it been since
the four of us got together?

629
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:08,150
We all met for
the first time at a hospital.

630
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:12,880
Stop making that face.
We were good back then.

631
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,290
Why do you bring that up?

632
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,680
Why not?

633
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:24,580
If hadn't saved me,
then we wouldn't have known one another.

634
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,270
We'd be living different lives right now.

635
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,310
Tae Soo, you don't regret it?

636
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,590
Why would I?

637
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,270
I feel regretful sometimes.

638
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,430
I regret that I turned your
patient room into a love room.

639
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,190
I'll stay. You should go home.

640
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,540
You will?

641
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,360
I don't need that.

642
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,780
As the leader of One Heart,
I can't let my member suffer.

643
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,180
Don't worry. Go back to work.

644
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,090
Okay then. Please take care of her.

645
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,880
I'll call you.

646
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,620
You regret that you turned
his room into a love room?

647
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,570
Why? Because I met him there?

648
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,630
There you go again.

649
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:19,270
I meant that it would impose
on the other patients.

650
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:24,330
Oh... that's why you went on a date
with the patient's friend?

651
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,210
And you made me take care of Tae Soo.

652
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,980
You don't remember how you kicked us out
so you could be alone with Tae Soo?

653
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,710
And you don't remember how desperately
you wanted to get out with Gi Bum?

654
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,310
You never saw him before?

655
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,870
Can you think of anything?

656
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,820
How would I know the man
who wanted to whack you?

657
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,380
You really don't know, right?

658
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,230
What do you mean?

659
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:55,210
I'm already upset about Do Kyung.
Don't do this to me.

660
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:00,590
I'm going to crush him when I find him...

661
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,090
What is it? What? What?

662
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:17,290
You're having fun after
hitting the wrong person?

663
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,870
What's wrong, Brother?

664
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,130
Do you know who was hurt
instead of Tae Soo?

665
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:26,010
You hurt someone who must not be hurt!

666
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,750
What are you talking about?
It wasn't me!

667
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,980
What?

668
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,350
We haven't even gotten started.

669
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:37,330
Look. We're having a party celebrating me
getting discharged from the hospital!

670
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:43,380
Then who was it?

671
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:48,280
Think about it.
Tae Soo has lots of enemies.

672
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,630
It's not me! I swear!
You can cut my hand off if I'm lying.

673
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:00,840
Are you proud that you did nothing?
Do it right. Okay?

674
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:10,750
Boss! How much longer
will you let him be like that?

675
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,700
Have you ever seen a fisherman...

676
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,030
who wastes his bait?

677
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:22,960
I need Back Gi Bum to get Yoon Tae Soo...
and the old man, Baek Man Bo.

678
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,340
That was amazing.

679
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,530
One Heart is all about
sacrificing yourself for others.

680
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,930
Do Kyung showed us exactly what
that is like, with her actions.

681
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,010
Oh my God.

682
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:44,050
I can't express the way my heart feels
right now with any words.

683
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:48,710
Do Kyung, you are a heroine.

684
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:53,010
How could you think of jumping in
to help in that situation?

685
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,680
Could you do that?
We could never do that.

686
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,710
Please stop it.

687
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:03,020
I told her, my action was just
following my innocent heart.

688
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,410
You're being too kind.

689
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,360
Geez, you are being modest.

690
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,490
Eun Ok.

691
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,400
You should erect a statue of her,
out of your own pocket.

692
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,010
She saved your dear husband's life.

693
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:19,770
That's enough.

694
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,120
Leader Kim Eun Ok,
what do you mean by that?

695
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,290
I know she deserves a compliment.

696
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,690
And I'm thankful to her.

697
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:36,090
However, what matters is that
someone tried to hurt Tae Soo.

698
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:40,050
And even the others at Choong Shim
could be in danger.

699
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:44,470
This isn't the time for us to laugh,
going ha ha, ho ho.

700
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,010
Well, you have a point.

701
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:02,020
I guess I'll go home...

702
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:07,840
And contemplate what you said, Eun Ok.

703
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,860
Ha ha, ho ho?

704
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,000
Follow her!

705
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,210
Madam!

706
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,610
It's good that you spoke your mind,
but that was too much!

707
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:22,700
How will you fix this? I'm going.

708
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:31,920
How many songs will you do?

709
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,640
About six songs?

710
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,750
That's not enough.

711
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,510
Short, but impactful!

712
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,630
You need at least ten songs
to make an impact.

713
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,210
What if someone calls for an encore?

714
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,660
Is that right?

715
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,610
What is this? I can't stop eating it.

716
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,890
Isn't the gratin really good?
Sweet and spicy.

717
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,210
"Slunch" is popular these days.

718
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:52,460
Oh...

719
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,810
So are you going to do it or not?

720
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,810
I'm still thinking.

721
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:00,690
Are you playing hard to get?
That's mean.

722
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:04,750
My motto is "Think deeply
and prepare thoroughly."

723
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:08,790
What is it now?

724
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:11,620
When we were in pre-school...

725
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,000
You peed on your pants so often!

726
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:22,280
Geez, that little boy grew up so fast!
It's amazing.

727
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,790
What about you?

728
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,770
You used to fart in others' faces,
and make them cry.

729
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:29,300
You were the first student
to get kicked out of the school!

730
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,240
It was then.

731
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,600
What?

732
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,690
I picked you right then... as mine!

733
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,900
Hyun Jee!

734
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,360
Hyun Jee...

735
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,180
You brat!

736
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,600
Hello, Mr. Baek.

737
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,530
Oh, it's you, Sung Min!

738
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,760
I wondered who the heck this was.

739
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,810
- I'll go.
- Okay.

740
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:05,000
Okay, bye.

741
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,980
Why did you come here?

742
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,110
What is that?

743
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,840
Oh... I recorded what I
couldn't say last time--

744
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,470
Don't you think I'm too old
to be happy about that?

745
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:18,190
Huh?

746
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:20,660
Mom's not here.
She'll be back from Seoul tomorrow.

747
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,550
If you are done, I'll go inside.

748
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:27,660
Well... Okay.

749
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,480
It's cold. Go inside.

750
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,610
I'll take it since you brought it here.

751
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,810
Hyun Jee,
call me if you're scared to sleep alone!

752
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:44,950
I'll put my phone by my bed!
Call me!

753
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,450
<i>It was then.</i>

754
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:09,210
I picked you right then... as mine!

755
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:28,230
You must be tired, deprived of sleep.

756
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,530
A little.

757
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,590
Do you have something to say?

758
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,790
Well... Sung Min...

759
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:41,400
I guess I was a bit edgy these past
few days, because your grades fell.

760
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,790
You must have been even more upset.

761
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:47,530
No... don't worry about that.

762
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:51,880
Sung Min,
let's just endure one more year.

763
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,160
What's wrong, Mom?

764
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:59,120
I don't want you to do anything that
would distract you from studying.

765
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,380
You'll have good friends
when you go to college.

766
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:04,470
Much better than Hyun Jee.

767
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:06,320
Mom.

768
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,700
Who is that from, at this hour?

769
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,660
If you're done, please leave.

770
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,680
I have a lot to do.

771
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:25,530
I trust you, Sung Min. Okay?

772
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:39,620
<i>Will you do it or not?</i>

773
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:42,670
<i>If you don't answer within three seconds,
I'll take it as a no.</i>

774
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,870
Give it a try.

775
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,440
Dad.

776
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,040
Madam Oh insisted on it,
so I made a big decision.

777
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,520
I'll go to the orchard.

778
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,230
Yes, see you later.

779
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:07,550
How is it?

780
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,400
Do you like that?

781
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,660
Why are you doing this?

782
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:17,780
For you to get close to Do Kyung,
that will be the best way.

783
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,460
Let me make this clear.

784
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:27,080
Only after I get back together
with Do Kyung, can you marry Dad.

785
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,300
Do you know that
Do Kyung joined One Heart?

786
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,370
What do you think that means?

787
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:38,140
It means she's kind of
a part of Choong Shim now.

788
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:43,270
Then it's time to make her an official
member of the Choong Shim family.

789
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:48,840
Tae Soo and Eun Ok were the central axes
of Choong Shim and One Heart until now.

790
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,800
But from now on...

791
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,030
Baek Gi Bum and Lee Do Kyung...

792
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:58,640
The two of you can start a new era.

793
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,260
Thanks to you, I was discharged
from the hospital with no problem.

794
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:05,920
And I'm very sorry for
making you worry, Madam Oh.

795
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,310
You don't need to be sorry to me.

796
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,910
You should be sorry to Eun Ok.

797
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,950
I thought about it a lot,
and Eun Ok was right.

798
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:22,100
I didn't think about the real issue,
and I was not responsible.

799
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,010
I am very regretful about that.

800
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:32,150
I thought we should take this chance
for One Heart to be reborn.

801
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,880
Therefore...

802
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,030
I've decided to resign from my position

803
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,330
as Honorary Chairwoman.

804
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,180
What do you think, Eun Ok?

805
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,530
Of course, I won't force you.

806
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:55,540
Pardon? What do you mean by that?

807
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:00,460
Will you support One Heart's reform?
Or will you hold on to your position?

808
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,130
That's my question.

809
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:13,170
The movie production company
is moving in next door.

810
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:14,490
What?

811
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,140
<i>Where are you?</i>

812
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,470
I'm at the production company, of course.

813
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,430
What are you talking about?

814
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:23,460
They just moved into
the Choong Shim building.

815
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,960
What?

816
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:50,960
Okay, this is the new beginning.

817
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,330
I will show you my power.

818
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,450
Okay.

819
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,680
You suffered a lot under Tae Soo.

820
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,860
Your pain is over.
Happiness is on the way!

821
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:14,070
How do you like the office?
Do you like it?

822
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:19,420
I'm a businessman.
This movie is not art, it's business.

823
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,350
I'll make a movie that makes money.

824
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:28,100
Can you please, first,
explain why this is happening?

825
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,280
Just be quiet, Producer Lee.

826
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,380
Why are you always timid like that?

827
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:36,710
Did we do something wrong?
Are you a robot that just follows orders?

828
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:40,910
Please understand. He's a bit stubborn.

829
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:46,010
You couldn't talk back to Tae Soo,
but now you're raising your voice to me?

830
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:49,340
Why? Do I look that easy to you?

831
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,840
Gi Bum, what are you doing here?

832
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,060
Can't you see? I'm talking to my staff.

833
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,370
What right do you have to do that?

834
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,660
<i>[Business License]</i>

835
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,950
- What is this?
- As you see...

836
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:21,850
The director of Choong Shin Construction
is a better fit than a mere gangster.

837
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,590
That's Dad's grand idea.

838
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:24,920
What?

839
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,910
There's no point
in talking to a guy like you.

840
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,610
I invested one billion won, as promised.
What's the problem?

841
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:38,500
Well, I'm not talking about that.

842
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,590
Do I have boatloads of money?
Is one billion won a small amount?

843
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:45,690
Because you kept asking,
I used the company's money.

844
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:50,610
Since I did that, the director
of the company is put in charge.

845
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:54,430
But you promised to put me in
charge of making the movie.

846
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,630
I know, I did.

847
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:02,200
You are still making the movie.

848
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,590
Having two heads,
is better than having one.

849
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:08,160
It's a good thing if the movie
does well with Gi Bum's help.

850
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,130
Do Kyung!

851
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:19,770
Do you know that I'm the owner
of a movie production company?

852
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:21,720
Movie production company?

853
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,990
I'm the CEO of Choong Shim Pictures.

854
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,900
I'm also the Director of
Choong Shim Construction.

855
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:31,990
Tell Hyun Jee to look for
my name in movie credits.

856
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:36,600
No, let's all have dinner
together to celebrate!

857
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:47,910
Oh...

858
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:53,580
How did it go?
What did the chairman say?

859
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:59,240
He took your movie away.
And Madam Oh wants my position.

860
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,230
How badly do they want
to walk all over us?

861
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,590
We were too naive.

862
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:09,460
Geez. I can't do this anymore.
It's so dirty and unfair!

863
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,550
I want to quit it all!

864
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:17,030
Let's go. You are freezing.

865
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:18,360
Let's go.

866
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,000
Honey... over there.

867
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,760
What is it?

868
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:57,270
Sung Min!

869
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,310
What are you doing here?

870
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,050
Mom.

871
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:07,090
You should be at cram school.
Bu why are you here?

872
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,620
- Ma'am... that is..
- You stay out.

873
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:11,740
Don't touch my daughter!

874
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:20,300
What are you doing?

875
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,740
I warned you. I told you,
keep your girl away from my son!

876
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:27,110
What are you talking about?
Your son was already doing music.

877
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,440
You didn't know that, as his mother?

878
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,060
Okay, bring it on!

879
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,910
Your ex-husband and your daughter
are crapping all over us anyway.

880
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,090
What?

881
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,670
Crapping on you?

882
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:41,700
Sure, bring it on! I'm not scared!

883
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,280
Okay, bring it on!

884
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:46,310
