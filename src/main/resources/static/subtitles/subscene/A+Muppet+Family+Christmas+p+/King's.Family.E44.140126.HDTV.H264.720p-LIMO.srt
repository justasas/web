2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,630
Gwangbak, it's been a while.

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,200
Say hi to your aunt.

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,370
Let's not do that when we're alone.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,090
Married life must be easy on you.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,460
It is.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,460
There's no stress?

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,960
I just ignore everything.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,960
In one ear and out the other.

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,390
I'm great at that.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,830
Nothing bothers you, huh?

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,770
I envy you.

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,090
Your mom gets on my nerves, but it's okay.

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,800
I married Don out of love, so I can take it.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,890
You're better than me, Aunt Yeongdal.

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,800
Gwangbak, married life is hard, isn't it?

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,440
Yes. I have a lot to learn.

18
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,390
Being book smart is useless.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,770
I guess I wasn't ready to get married.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,940
It's the same for everyone.

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,270
It's not just you.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,190
Gwangbak, don't worry.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,590
There's something you can try.

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,740
What is it?

25
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,060
How to be friends with your mother in law.

26
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,300
Honey.

27
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,640
You! You stay right there!

28
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,940
You're dead! Hey!

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,130
Stop right there! You're dead!

30
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,390
Hey!

31
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,890
Don't answer all his calls.

32
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,460
- Don't?
- That will drive him mad.

33
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,490
Okay. I got it.

34
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,300
- The person you have called...
- Man!

35
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,640
After the beep...

36
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,890
Man!

37
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,030
Answer it this time.

38
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,640
- What is it?
- Where are you?

39
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,100
What do you think?

40
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,770
At a karaoke place.
Near the shop.

41
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,830
Hobak! Have a drink!

42
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,140
Hobak! It's your turn to sing.

43
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,100
Sing a song! Sing a song! Sing a song!

44
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,340
Aren't you supposed to be working?

45
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,330
I'm busy. I have to sing. Bye.

46
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,600
Hey! Hey! You! You! Hey!

47
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,800
I don't believe...

48
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,170
Oh... Where is she?

49
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,490
Good job.

50
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,670
- You too.
- Thanks.

51
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,860
Hobak.

52
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,890
What are you doing here?

53
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,340
I asked him to come.

54
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,940
So we can put on a real show.

55
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,040
He'll be your driver.

56
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,890
Okay. I got it.

57
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,670
Do what I told you.

58
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,560
Oh, my.

59
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,990
Oh, oh...

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,560
Why that...

61
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,360
How dare she...

62
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,960
Ugh...

63
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,170
Get me some water.

64
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,400
You get it.

65
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,600
What?

66
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,860
You have hands.

67
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,630
Why are you talking like that?

68
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,460
- Get me some water.
- No.

69
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,090
You're defying me?

70
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,740
Tell him to get it for you.

71
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,600
- Who?
- The one who drove you home.

72
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,770
What the...

73
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,690
You watched me from the cold balcony?

74
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,890
You must have been really bored.

75
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,300
You think I'm a joke?

76
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,040
How can you bring a young man here?

77
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,240
I don't believe you.

78
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,800
Get me water before I get really mad.

79
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,430
You...

80
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,170
Oh, this is nutty, nutty...

81
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,840
Ugh...

82
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,360
Leave it there.

83
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,490
We need to talk.

84
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,260
About what?

85
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,690
Go ahead.

86
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,760
What have you been up to these days?

87
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,330
I don't know what I'll do if you keep it up.

88
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,970
What do you mean?

89
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,140
You drink all the time with your co-workers.

90
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,840
You didn't drink?

91
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,400
We just sang at the karaoke place.

92
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,940
He drove you home when you didn't drink?

93
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,430
I can't believe this!

94
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,540
Leave me alone.

95
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,840
Why don't you just...

96
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,170
Why don't I just what?
Quit my job?

97
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,240
You can't say it, can you?

98
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,130
You can't tell me to quit, can you?

99
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,630
You're mad, aren't you?

100
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,300
Don't pick on my weak point.

101
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,470
Tread on a tiger and it will turn.

102
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,860
You mean worm.

103
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,060
Whomever I see, whenever I come home,

104
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,670
just stay out of my business.

105
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,640
Aren't we married?

106
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,660
Did you forget?

107
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,300
We decided not to talk about my past.

108
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,170
When did we decide that?

109
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,060
You're the only one who decided that.

110
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,590
I'm going talk about until the day I die.

111
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,970
So don't be cheeky. I'm tired.

112
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,400
Oh, I shouldn't have become a model.

113
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,130
Why?

114
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,190
People won't leave me alone.

115
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,560
Who? Who won't leave you alone?

116
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,060
They got my number from somewhere,

117
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,860
and they've been texting me all day.

118
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,860
Even the headquarters server is down.

119
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,260
The other models must be ugly.

120
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,530
Why are they texting you?

121
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,640
And the server's down? Hah!

122
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,660
They must be blind.

123
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,270
I know.

124
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,030
I didn't know I was this popular.

125
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,860
Don't wear any makeup from now on.

126
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,240
Work is work.
Don't go there to show off.

127
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,200
So stop putting makeup on.

128
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,490
Whatever. Get ready for the Lunar New Year.

129
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,790
Me?

130
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,530
I've never cooked holiday dishes before.

131
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,060
So this will be your first time.

132
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,670
I can't come home early tomorrow.

133
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,390
It's not my father's ceremony but your father's!

134
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,260
Your father will be very happy

135
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,760
because his son is cooking for him.

136
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,200
Oh, this is really nuts!

137
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,990
What's wrong with your niece?

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,070
Why can't you control your niece?

139
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,840
She's your wife. You control her.

140
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,890
She won't listen to a word I say.

141
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,740
I wish I could tell her to quit her job,

142
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,200
but I can't do that. Can you understand? No.

143
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,840
Who'd understand? Nobody.

144
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,570
I know.

145
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,200
What's wrong with Hobak?

146
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,200
She's cheating on me.

147
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,200
What? Hobak is?

148
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,540
Crazy jerk. Hobak's not like you.

149
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,390
I'm serious.

150
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,690
She comes home with a young man!

151
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,570
And that modeling thing's made her conceited!

152
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,600
She's so full of herself, she'll explode!

153
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,040
I've experienced it.
She's almost there.

154
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,460
I can't even go to sleep because I'm mad.

155
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,630
If I leave her alone, she'll cheat on me.

156
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,890
Loser, you don't know, do you?

157
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,690
But I do because I've been there.

158
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,200
The signs are all there.

159
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,770
It's a good thing, then.

160
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,760
Hobak can experience what you've experienced,

161
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,690
and you can experience the pain she did.

162
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,860
That's our family motto, remember?

163
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,260
I'm sleepy. I'm hanging up.

164
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,600
Hey, hey, Loser! Hey, Loser!

165
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,390
Man! This is crunchy nutty nuts.

166
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,160
Oh, how annoying.

167
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,740
Minjung, come to me.

168
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,290
I'll raise the kids.

169
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,660
Your kids are like my kids.

170
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,760
You can't live by yourself.

171
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,930
And the kids need a mom.

172
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,970
I'll raise them.

173
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,470
He has a woman.

174
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,100
Look. you can tell she's been here.

175
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,490
What if he gets remarried?

176
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,840
You'll be the loser in this situation.

177
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,970
How will you take care of the kids?

178
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,270
Here.

179
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,470
It's for me?

180
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,130
It's for the memorial ceremony.

181
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,930
You should make plenty of food.

182
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,990
But we should be saving money.

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,940
Don't save money on food.

184
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,070
Prepare a feast.

185
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,860
There will be 3 son in laws this time.

186
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,440
One might not come, though.

187
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,200
He has to come for the kids.

188
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,360
It's me. Can we meet?

189
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,130
Okay.

190
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,060
Mom! Mom!

191
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,070
He wants to meet?

192
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,570
Yes.

193
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,470
Hurry up and go. And look pretty.

194
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,360
Look pretty? I was born pretty.

195
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,700
I was in the Miss Korea pageant.

196
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,530
You're finally smiling.
Aren't you happy?

197
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,860
Well...

198
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,740
You have to look extra pretty today.

199
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,860
If you do, he can't hate you.

200
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,260
And beg him to forgive you.

201
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,190
Don't scream and yell.

202
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,440
I won't.

203
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,470
Hurry up and get ready. Go.

204
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,770
You're not going to your father's house?

205
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,990
I'm going this afternoon.

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
Eat.

207
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,760
I haven't been to a place like this in so long.

208
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,160
I used to eat out all the time before.

209
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,790
I didn't know how happy I was.

210
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,970
I spent all the money you made,

211
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,840
and I didn't know how lucky I was.

212
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,240
I didn't know how hard it was to make money.

213
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:35,840
I was so stupid and immature.

214
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,990
Don't blame yourself. 
It's in the past.

215
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,030
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,990
I really am.

217
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,690
Forgive me.

218
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,530
When you called me, I was so happy.

219
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,740
I don't even know how I got here.

220
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,100
My makeup looks awful, right?

221
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,990
I haven't worn it in a while.

222
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,030
You look pretty.

223
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,440
When I saw you outside,

224
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,840
it reminded me of the first time we met.

225
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,970
On that blind date.

226
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,800
Your first impression was awesome.

227
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,760
Your smile was nice and your voice, too.

228
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,470
I love a man with a nice voice.

229
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,790
We only dated for 3 months, but it was nice.

230
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,700
When I had Aeji, you were in Busan.

231
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,070
And you drove all the way to the hospital.

232
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,200
You were so happy it was a girl.

233
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,440
We have many good memories.

234
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,490
Let's stop talking and eat.

235
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,570
Okay, let's eat.

236
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,890
You know how to make pancakes?

237
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,030
I'm not great, but I'll try.

238
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,090
Pan fry these and clean these vegetables.

239
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,260
I'll come back and finish them.

240
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,630
Okay.

241
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,430
Incredible! How unbelievable!

242
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,570
No. 505!

243
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,270
Yes, hello.

244
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,530
- Why did you buy so much?
- Oh,

245
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,060
this is for the memorial ceremony.

246
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,540
By the way, what's so funny?

247
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,940
No. 304 is pregnant.

248
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,140
She is?

249
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,660
Isn't she old?

250
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,890
That's why it's unbelievable.

251
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,990
They were always fighting,

252
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,990
but now they are like newlyweds.

253
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,530
Should I have a baby, too?

254
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,130
Go ahead. I heard it's amazing.

255
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,970
How did she get pregnant when they fight all the time?

256
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,570
It was the alcohol.

257
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,400
Alcohol made the wife so attractive.

258
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,240
Thank you for lunch.

259
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,640
I didn't know what was good in the past,

260
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,900
but now I'm thankful for everything.

261
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,140
I'm glad you're happy.

262
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,440
Subak.

263
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,200
Yes?

264
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,100
If I got remarried...

265
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,990
You're getting married?

266
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,640
If.

267
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,160
What would you like to do about the kids?

268
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,830
You're seeing someone?

269
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,240
You are.

270
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,290
So my mom was right.

271
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,790
She said she sensed it.

272
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,170
What should we do about the kids?

273
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,800
You said you'll let my mom raise them

274
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,530
until they go to elementary school.

275
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,830
I want to raise them.

276
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,840
You want to take the kids?

277
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,130
She'll raise them?

278
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,900
That's why I'm asking.

279
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,640
I want to know what you want.

280
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,600
Your opinion is important in this.

281
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,890
If you want to raise them, you can.

282
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,140
Or I can take them.

283
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:58,540
If you raise them, I'll pay child support.

284
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,330
Your mother's having a hard time.

285
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:09,970
I've always felt badly about that.

286
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,530
What should we do?

287
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,440
Don't cry.

288
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,840
Yes.

289
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,470
Minjung, I'm making a lot of food so drop by to pick them up.

290
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,940
What time are you going to your father's?

291
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,200
I have to finish something up at work.

292
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,170
Okay. I'll be there later.

293
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,590
What do you want to do?

294
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,330
I'll think about it.

295
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,490
Why are you back so soon?

296
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,170
Subak!

297
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,290
Right? He's seeing someone?

298
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,490
So what did he say?

299
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,330
He asked what I want to do with the kids.

300
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,830
If I want to raise them, he'll let me.

301
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,030
What?

302
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,390
She must've told him she's not raising them.

303
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,300
That's why he told you to raise them.

304
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,330
How can he get married again so quickly?

305
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,560
So what did you say?

306
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,630
I told him I'll think about it.

307
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,270
What is there to think about?

308
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,400
Who'd raise another woman's kids?

309
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,600
He obviously wants you to take them.

310
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,330
I'll get him for this.

311
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,430
So who is she?

312
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,840
I don't know.

313
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,430
Why didn't you ask him?

314
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,970
When did they meet?

315
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,330
I don't know. I couldn't ask.

316
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,530
You fool!

317
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,740
I'm sure he didn't meet her recently.

318
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,260
He wouldn't marry someone he just met.

319
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,490
He's been seeing her for a long time.

320
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,560
How come you didn't know?

321
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,530
He divorced you for her!

322
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,260
And you fell for it like an idiot.

323
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,670
He got a call.

324
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,140
She asked him to come over.

325
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,290
Let's go. Get up.

326
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,440
Don't go. What are you going to do?

327
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,300
I'll catch him in the act.

328
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,530
Over my dead body!

329
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,940
Mom! Mom!

330
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,370
You're earl...

331
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,930
Wait.

332
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,330
Who's this?

333
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,970
Sangnam's aunt?

334
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,760
Hello.

335
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,860
Hah!

336
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,040
Hello?

337
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,470
I knew something was off.

338
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,200
What do you think you're doing?

339
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,530
You must be completely out of your mind!

340
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,360
How dare you do this here?

341
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,140
Please don't!

342
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,200
You seduced my son in law?

343
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,470
You ruined my daughter's life!

344
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,260
How dare you hold your head up!

345
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,290
They didn't get divorced because of me.

346
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,490
And don't you think you're overreacting?

347
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,940
Too much?

348
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,200
How dare you!

349
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,490
You!

350
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,140
Hey! You! You!

351
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,400
What are you doing?

352
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,440
Oh!

353
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,530
I'm glad you came.

354
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,530
What are you doing?

355
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,240
How can you do this to Subak?

356
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,870
Stop it. It's not what you think.

357
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,570
Go home.
Why would you put up with this?

358
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,560
Hah!

359
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,760
You're siding with her?

360
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,760
This is who you are?
How could you do this?

361
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,640
Oh, hello...
What's going...

362
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,800
Oh, my! Hey! Sunjeong!

363
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,370
You're making a mistake.

364
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,340
A mistake?

365
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,990
When there's evidence here?

366
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,260
When did you start seeing her?

367
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,740
Way before your divorce, right?

368
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,290
This isn't what you think.

369
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,440
I've known her for a long time.

370
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,970
I knew it.

371
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,870
You got divorced for her, didn't you?

372
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,200
It wasn't like that.

373
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,060
She has nothing to do with the divorce.

374
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,630
She?

375
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:18,170
How can you repay me like this?

376
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,200
I don't want to hear another word. Please go.

377
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,060
 Mom, let's go.

378
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,290
You idiot. He fooled you!

379
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,970
I heard everything. Let's go.

380
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,940
What more can you say?
Let's go.

381
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,640
How can you betray me like this!

382
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,490
You tricked Subak into divorcing you!

383
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,990
How can you fool all of us?

384
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,560
Oh this is outrageous! Outrageous!

385
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,090
And I thought this was all Subak's fault!

386
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,130
Let's go. You're making me feel even worse.

387
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,240
This is why he takes you for a fool!

388
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,170
Just tell me one thing.

389
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,300
When did it start?

390
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,590
When she became your father's caregiver?

391
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,030
Wait, what are you talking about?

392
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,240
His father's caregiver?

393
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,590
She was his father's caregiver?

394
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,960
Yes.

395
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,970
You bastard!

396
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,690
You're home.

397
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,970
What's going on?

398
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,490
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

399
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,590
Go in.

400
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,590
What's going on?

401
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,630
We were fooled.

402
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,140
He stabbed us in the back.

403
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,670
I'm beyond angry.

404
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,740
Minjung has a woman.

405
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,200
She's been coming and going.

406
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,570
And guess who she is.
Unbelievable.

407
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,930
It's Sangnam's aunt. That's her.

408
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,760
What are you talking about?

409
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,990
How can that happen?

410
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,260
I told you I saw her, remember?

411
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:17,240
I saw her getting in his truck once.

412
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,140
When her father in law was hospitalized,

413
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,670
she was his caregiver.

414
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,700
How can this be?

415
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,900
Those two tricked our poor girl.

416
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,490
Why won't you say anything?

417
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,530
Say something.

418
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,670
Aren't you enraged?

419
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,260
You should call him and yell at him.

420
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,490
I can't accept this divorce!

421
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,070
But it's all over now.

422
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,790
Don't pay attention to what Minjung does.

423
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,860
He's a stranger to us now. Accept it.

424
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,970
I can't accept it.

425
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,630
I wouldn't have let them go through with the divorce if I knew.

426
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,370
Bong! Do something!

427
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,340
He's getting married, leaving behind the kids!

428
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,130
Are you Subak?

429
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,900
She's not saying anything, so why are you?

430
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,800
This fool won't, so I have to do something.

431
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,290
Don't tell Gwangbak.

432
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,030
Why shouldn't I?

433
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,470
It's for Gwangbak.

434
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,200
Why can't you see that?

435
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,800
You're wearing hanbok?

436
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,530
I rented it.

437
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,630
I wore this to get in the holiday spirit.

438
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,140
Daese will be happy.

439
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,970
Did you make the pancakes?

440
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,290
Yes. Will you see if they look okay?

441
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,830
Good job.

442
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,830
Aunt, are you not feeling well?

443
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,790
I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

444
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,240
Maybe you're coming down with something.

445
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,440
Maybe.

446
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,670
Come out. I'm at the front door.

447
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,470
Sunjeong.

448
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,670
I'm sorry.

449
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,640
Are you hurt?

450
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,370
I don't know.

451
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,640
My head feels funny.

452
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,900
I'll know better tomorrow morning.

453
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,240
What do we do?

454
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,900
I'm worried about you.

455
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,240
It must have been crazy.

456
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,330
I could handle it.

457
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,560
I can't believe what happened to you.

458
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,590
I'm sorry you had to deal with that.

459
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,760
My mother in law is very possessive.

460
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,900
I think I understand how she feels.

461
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,990
I'm sure she didn't want to lose you.

462
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,530
And she might misunderstand our situation.

463
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,240
She thinks I caused the divorce.

464
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,240
It's frustrating.

465
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,560
Sunjeong?

466
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,840
Huh?

467
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,860
You came to see my daughter in law?

468
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,500
Huh?

469
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,470
No, Daese. It's him.

470
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,900
Huh?

471
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:16,670
My... It's him.

472
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,760
What are you talking about?

473
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,490
He is?

474
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,070
Hello.

475
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,640
I can't believe this.

476
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,940
He's right here, but I can't believe it.

477
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,140
It's nice to meet you.

478
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,900
Sunjeong was so...

479
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,530
We should grab a drink.

480
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,130
I have a lot to tell you.

481
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,590
I thought you were her husband.

482
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,740
If only I were that lucky.

483
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,470
Let's get together after the holidays.

484
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,940
Okay.

485
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,800
Daese, you should go inside.

486
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,490
Huh?

487
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,940
Uh, okay. okay.

488
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,490
I can be so dense sometimes.

489
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,740
I'll see you again.

490
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,570
All the food is ruined.
What will you do?

491
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,390
My father's friend prepared all the food.

492
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,260
You did all that for nothing.

493
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,940
You should go.
Traffic will be bad.

494
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,470
Okay. Take good care of yourself.

495
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,900
Okay. Drive carefully.

496
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,240
Go inside.

497
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,030
Make them pretty.

498
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,560
Don't worry.

499
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,390
I've been making dumplings every year.

500
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,170
Gwangbak, if you make pretty dumplings,

501
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,340
you'll have pretty children.

502
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,790
Mom, am I right?

503
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,560
That's rice cakes!

504
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,530
They're both made by hand, so it's the same.

505
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,940
Your hanbok puts me in the holiday spirit.

506
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,900
I know.

507
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:17,100
It really feels like the holidays, father.

508
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,890
Father, Sangnam eats on regular schedule,

509
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,140
so he gets sensitive around meal time.

510
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,740
And he can't handle being hungry.

511
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,260
He takes after me.

512
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,630
You get sensitive, too?

513
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,800
Of course.

514
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,330
Our belly tells us it's time to eat.

515
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,470
And if we don't eat then and there,

516
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,200
we start getting annoyed.

517
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,840
And later, we lose our heads.

518
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,670
I know.

519
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,030
Food seems to be very important to him.

520
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,030
When we were dating, he watched me eat,

521
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,360
but now, he eats everything!

522
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,140
He gave you all the food before?

523
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,400
Yes, father.

524
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,800
But now, he doesn't.

525
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,790
And father, Sangnam is really stubborn.

526
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,760
He also got that from me.

527
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,440
Totally stubborn.

528
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,870
And he doesn't know when to stop,

529
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,040
and he looks narrow-minded.

530
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,030
You should've beaten some sense into him.

531
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,740
You are right.

532
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,060
Had I done that, you wouldn't be suffering.

533
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,090
I know. And father,

534
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,740
there's something I'm really disappointed in.

535
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,830
He's a blabbermouth. He can't control it.

536
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,290
I even stuck a note calling him Mr. Blabbermouth.

537
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,970
You did what?

538
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,740
You called your husband Mr. Blabbermouth?

539
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,970
Why did you enter the audition, then?

540
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,970
Sangnam is my son.

541
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,170
How dare you say that in front of me?

542
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,340
Imagine Sangnam telling your parents

543
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,060
how you say whatever is on your mind

544
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,060
and how rude you are to your husband,

545
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:12,200
asking them why they let you be that way?

546
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,490
How would you feel?

547
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,590
You should learn to cover his faults.

548
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,060
How can you talk about them to me?

549
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,990
To me, he's a very precious son.

550
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,490
You're working, and you put hanbok on,

551
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,530
so I was trying to get along, to humor you.

552
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,560
Even if I were talking badly about him,

553
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,860
you should say how great he is and thank me

554
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,300
for raising him to be such a nice husband!

555
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,530
From what you said,

556
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:47,940
my son is a blabbermouth and a stubborn and heartless glutton.

557
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,740
Why do you live with them, then?

558
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,470
Father, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

559
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,470
Forget it!

560
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,400
I'm his father. So?

561
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,640
He takes after me. Happy?

562
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,540
Daese.

563
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,090
You make all of them by yourself!

564
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,560
What happened?

565
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:21,200
I've been sending you signals to stop.

566
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,600
What did she do?

567
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,090
The books said to gossip about the husband

568
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,130
with the mother in law, so I told her that.

569
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,200
Daese, you should laugh it off.

570
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:46,060
She did that to get closer to you.

571
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,970
By speaking ill about her husband?

572
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,100
Who would believe that?

573
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,000
She went a bit overboard,

574
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,770
but some people get closer by doing that.

575
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,300
Am I her friend?
How can she think that?

576
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,100
She's naive, so she takes...

577
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,670
That's not naive! That's stupid!

578
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,090
She's dense and says anything on her mind.

579
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,790
She has no manners.

580
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,930
Daese, she's a considerate girl.

581
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,740
She just tried a little too hard,

582
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,060
so be more accepting.

583
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,260
No.

584
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,900
I can't accept her when she's unacceptable.

585
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:23,140
I can't believe I have to cook with my son.

586
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,870
Maybe I should've had more sons.

587
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,290
Pretend Hobak's your son in law.

588
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,660
That'll make you feel better.

589
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,160
But isn't cooking with me fun?

590
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,240
Yes, it's loads of fun.

591
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,000
It's so fun it's nuts.

592
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,600
You're good.

593
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,060
You want the original version?

594
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:48,100
This is nutty, nutty, nuts. Ouch.

595
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,040
This is nuts.

596
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,170
Ugh...

597
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,530
I wish I had 12 arms.

598
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,800
But you only have 2 pockets.

599
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,390
If I had 12 hands, I'd have 12 pockets.

600
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,390
Where would you put them when you sleep?

601
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,160
Six over your head, six down the sides.

602
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,860
But this house is too small for that.

603
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,540
If everyone had 12 arms,

604
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,340
it'll get in the way.

605
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,560
- It's small already.
- You're right.

606
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,790
Stop talking nonsense and work.

607
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,930
We have to make dumplings and stew.

608
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,060
Call Hobak, Anggeum.

609
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,560
You don't seem to like Subak that much,

610
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,600
but you like Hobak, don't you?

611
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,140
She's my brother's wife.

612
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,170
It's me.

613
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,330
Yes, mom, what is it?

614
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,290
You're coming to help out, aren't you?

615
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,640
I'm at the shop. I'm busy today.

616
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,000
But it's a holiday.

617
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,040
We're getting new clothes, so I'm busy.

618
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,570
Sedal's cooking the food at home.

619
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,160
Hobak!

620
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,490
Mom, I have to go.

621
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,840
Hobak, hello?

622
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,870
She can't come?

623
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,940
She's busy.
What's she so busy with?

624
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,790
She's been extremely busy.

625
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,470
After she became a manager, it's been crazy.

626
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,970
She's not giving me any money.

627
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,330
She hasn't even given me any gifts.

628
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,700
she sells clothes, but I haven't seen any.

629
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,660
But Hobak got us this house.

630
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,430
She didn't do it alone.
Gwangbak helped.

631
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,130
Still, she spent her own money,

632
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,200
so she has to be more frugal.

633
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,930
I can't seem to be able to love her.

634
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,930
I wonder where Haebak is.

635
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:42,160
Everyone comes home for the holidays.

636
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,430
Mom!

637
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,540
Speak of the devil!

638
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,700
You're a bad girl.

639
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,700
Mom.

640
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,240
Oh, you're such a bad girl.

641
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:12,940
Mom, I don't want to have any regrets.

642
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,130
I want to follow my dreams.

643
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,940
Please let me do this.

644
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,660
If I give up, I'll regret it later.

645
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,200
Huh?

646
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,890
Say something.

647
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,630
What's the use?
She made up her mind.

648
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,040
All our girls are so stubborn.

649
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,400
Mom.

650
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,240
If you must, you must.

651
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,390
Don't blame me for ruining your life.

652
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,030
Don't say that.

653
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,790
Thank you, mom.

654
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,830
Oh...

655
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,100
None of my children does what I tell them.

656
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,600
Is it like this everywhere?

657
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,500
It's like this everywhere.

658
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,770
No. 304 is pregnant and they're so happy.

659
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,130
I'm home.

660
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,500
What is it?

661
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,490
There's no other choice.

662
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,770
Let's move out.

663
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,470
We can't live like this anymore.

664
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,830
You're stressed out and I'm stressed out.

665
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,640
I can't focus when I go to work.

666
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,400
I worry about what will happen today.

667
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,470
Let's find an apartment after the holidays.

668
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,160
No, I don't want to move out now.

669
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,700
I'm going to win him over.

670
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,270
I want to beat him at this.

671
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,570
What?

672
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:15,260
I want to be accepted by him.

673
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,740
I'm going to make it happen.

674
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,160
Then I can move out of this house.

675
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,830
At this rate, things will just get worse.

676
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,870
So Sangnam, will you wait for me?

677
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,870
Why can't he see how lovely you are?

678
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,200
Oh, what's that smell?

679
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,330
Sedal, Sedal!

680
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,240
Oh, you're home.
When did you come home?

681
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,930
Why don't you lie down?

682
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,470
I was waiting up for you.

683
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,160
You weren't watching from the veranda?

684
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,030
Two handsome men drove me home.

685
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,370
You better stop!

686
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,560
By the way, what's that smell?

687
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,830
Did you pour the whole bottle on you?

688
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,660
I cooked all day, so I smelled greasy.

689
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,970
Oh, it's too much.

690
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,790
You're giving me a headache, so go out!

691
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:51,400
Sintong, Bangtong, bow to your grandmother.

692
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,100
Take the apron off.

693
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,940
That's not your uniform!

694
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,130
It's become a part of me.

695
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,900
Sometimes I wear this to the shower.

696
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,390
Good for you!

697
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,390
Happy New Year.

698
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,390
Okay.

699
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,130
Grow up quickly and take care of your dad.

700
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,240
We will.

701
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,970
Study hard.

702
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,770
And be healthy, okay?

703
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,700
- Okay.
- Okay.

704
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,140
Give that to me.

705
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,160
Let me have it.
It's theirs.

706
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,330
I will put it in the bank for them.

707
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:28,140
And give me what you get at grandpa's, too.

708
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,290
Okay.

709
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,830
You're like children laborers.

710
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,470
The house feels empty without Yeongdal.

711
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,240
She'll come after the memorial ceremony.

712
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,430
Send Yeongdal home when you get there.

713
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,130
I'm going to work today.

714
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,940
- Again?
- I'm busy.

715
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,560
Are you a workaholic?

716
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,060
But you used to be addicted to money.

717
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,930
I switched to being a workaholic.

718
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,030
Take the boys to my parents house later.

719
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,000
- Ugh!
- Ouch!

720
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,070
It's like you're my daughter in law.

721
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,760
Oh, mother!
I mean, mom.

722
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,470
- Mother.
- Yes?

723
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,600
Would you like another drink?

724
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:06,900
Sure. Let me get drunk.

725
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,790
Bong, here.

726
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,100
Okay.

727
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,640
- Mother.
- Yes?

728
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:14,740
The pancake brings back memories.

729
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,470
Memories of how difficult life was.

730
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,470
Everyone's having a difficult time now,

731
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,290
but we're all here, having a feast. It's nice.

732
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,200
It's not that nice.

733
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,160
You think it's nice?

734
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,240
I can't believe what happened to us.

735
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,770
Honey, why didn't you look after Bong?

736
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,340
Your father probably cried when he came.

737
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,990
I'm not sure if he came at all.

738
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:47,000
How could he find such a dump?

739
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:51,440
You shouldn't suffer like this at your age,

740
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,160
but look what happened to you!

741
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,590
Please stop.

742
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,290
If you're drunk, you should go to bed.

743
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,390
What?

744
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,760
This is all your fault.

745
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:06,040
This wouldn't have happened without Subak.

746
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:10,000
Why are you blaming her again?

747
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,870
You want her to go somewhere and die?

748
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,670
Anggeum, mom wasn't saying that.

749
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,390
You should stay out of this.

750
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,660
Just take care of yourself.

751
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,130
You're living off Bong with your wife,

752
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,240
so you shouldn't be talking right now.

753
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,560
You're not feeding my boy.

754
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,160
Bong is feeding him, okay?

755
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,970
Did he ask you for money? Did he?

756
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,830
You still don't get it, do you?

757
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,640
You should feel badly about this.

758
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,940
You and Subak are the same.

759
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,740
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo!

760
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,370
Please stop.

761
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,640
Why are you jinxing the New Year like this?

762
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:56,670
You want Subak to go and kill herself?

763
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,560
Is money more important than her?

764
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,030
What?

765
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:03,840
That's the money Bong worked really hard for!

766
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,160
Please stop it!

767
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,890
Anggeum, please don't yell at my mom.

768
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,540
What kind of example are you setting for my wife?

769
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,970
Uncle, stop it.

770
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,600
Why are you and grandmother doing this?

771
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,870
I'll go and kill myself, okay?

772
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,670
Subak, you stay out.

773
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:24,560
Don't butt in when the adults are talking?

774
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,640
What?

775
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,000
Look at her!

776
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:31,540
You didn't learn anything, did you?

777
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:35,040
To me, all of you are freeloaders.

778
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:39,140
Uncle, Yeongdal, you should move out.

779
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,790
You think Subak is all happy?

780
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,490
You're so mean.

781
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:50,400
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

782
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,140
I'll be back.

783
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:30,540
Where are you going?

784
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,540
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

785
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:36,940
I'm volunteering to make soup for the elderly.

786
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,560
Have a good day.

787
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,530
Go to your parents house with Sangnam.

788
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,140
Okay. Thank you.

789
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,140
Let's go!

790
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:47,200
Oh, how exciting!

791
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,290
You're that happy?

792
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,100
Yes.

793
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:54,430
I'm going to tell my parents how oppressed I've been.

794
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,860
You blabbermouth!

795
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,790
Sangnam! Sangnam!

796
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,870
Let's go.

797
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,940
Say hello.

798
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,630
These are my employees who live alone

799
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,240
or can't make it to their hometown.

800
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,040
Go make some rice cake soup.

801
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,240
I'm sorry?

802
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,560
Yeongdal, where are you?

803
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,390
I can't come today.

804
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,490
Why? Mrs. Lee won't let you come?

805
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:29,040
It's not that.

806
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:30,770
The mood here is a bit...

807
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,840
What's wrong with the mood?

808
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,760
I don't know.
I've never seen this before.

809
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:39,340
They were all fighting at breakfast.

810
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,600
I tried to stop them,

811
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,440
but I'm still scared.

812
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,330
This family's weird.

813
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,370
Sedal took Sintong and Bangtong over.

814
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,270
They're not here yet.

815
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,400
Mom, I'll come tomorrow. Bye.

816
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,290
- Grandfather!
- Grandmother!

817
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,390
Be quiet.

818
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,590
Why?

819
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,330
It's horrible here.

820
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,640
What happened?

821
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,500
They had a fight.

822
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:08,600
I'm worried about Wangdal.

823
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,870
Mom's waiting for you. Go home.

824
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,000
I called her and told her I can't come.

825
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,200
Then she'll be home alone.

826
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,830
She'll cry if she's home alone.

827
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,200
Sedal, you should go home, then.

828
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:23,790
Bong isn't home and mother's sleeping.

829
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,790
Where's Loser?

830
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,970
He went looking for Bong.

831
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,830
He ran away from home.

832
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,930
Really?

833
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,630
He left, so I guess he did.

834
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,200
Don't tell anyone we're related.

835
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:37,100
Then there's nobody to hang out with.

836
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:39,670
They need to make money.

837
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,890
Subak.

838
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,530
Hey.

839
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:56,870
Where's Hobak?

840
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:01,260
She went to work today.

841
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,270
Sintong and Bangtong wants to bow.

842
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,270
I don't feel like doing that.

843
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,470
Oh, that shouldn't matter.

844
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,770
It's the tradition, so...

845
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,470
Close the door.

846
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,560
Okay.

847
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,830
Oh, Daebak.

848
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,030
Sintong and Bangtong wants to bow.

849
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:23,900
Let's call it even.

850
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,740
What?

851
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:29,060
Give them what you were going to give me.

852
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,290
Incredible.

853
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,440
Hey, you scored!

854
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,560
You scored.

855
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:47,040
What is it, father?

856
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,240
Are you doing the dishes?

857
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,040
No, I was just taking the dishes out.

858
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:54,440
Get us some drinks and some fruit.

859
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,360
Okay, father.

860
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,790
My family must be waiting for us.

861
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,370
I don't think they'll finish anytime soon.

862
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,770
Sangnam, I'll get the drinks for them,

863
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,300
so you go and see my parents.

864
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,140
It's the first Lunar New Year after the marriage.

865
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,140
They'll be upset if you don't come. Go.

866
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,440
Should I?

867
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,790
I'm sorry for going alone.

868
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,930
I'm okay. I'll go later.

869
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,470
Scored!

870
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,060
It's me, Sangnam!

871
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,590
- You're here?
- Yes.

872
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,740
Mother, let's go in so I can bow.

873
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,870
It's too crazy here for that.

874
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,040
Where's Gwangbak?

875
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,940
We had some unexpected guests.

876
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,530
She'll come later.

877
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,440
Unexpected guests on a holiday?

878
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,890
I'm sorry. She'll come later.

879
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,470
After the memorial ceremony, you come here.

880
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,770
Ask anyone on the street.

881
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,800
How can he hold her hostage like this?

882
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,870
And why did they come to your house?

883
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,770
Have they no manners?

884
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,440
- Gifts...
- Leave them.

885
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,330
- Bow...
- Nobody wants that.

886
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,390
And my husband's not home.

887
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,990
- Grandmother...
- She's sleeping.

888
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,400
- How about you...
- I said no!

889
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,770
Sangnam.

890
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,060
Come in.

891
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:26,830
Oh, even at my in laws house...

892
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,260
Hello, uncle?

893
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,700
We were having a family gathering on our own.

894
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,790
Have a drink.

895
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,060
I have to go.
We have guests over.

896
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,290
Oh, just have one drink, okay?

897
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,030
Boys, bow to your uncle.

898
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,440
This is your chance to make money.

899
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,990
- Happy New Year.
- Uncle, let us bow.

900
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:47,370
- Okay.
- There you go.

901
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:50,540
Enjoy yourselves.

902
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:53,100
Sangnam, should I bow, too?

903
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,240
Bow to me.
I'll give you a dollar.

904
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,740
Why you little...

905
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,660
One for Daebak, one for Haebak.

906
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:00,930
Okay.

907
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:03,990
- And Aeji, Jungji.
- Okay.

908
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,330
You can't trust him.

909
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,240
I'll give it to them.
 I know how it's done.

910
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,060
Uh, hey.

911
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:20,560
I want to go home.

912
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:22,490
I'm bored, Jangbi.

913
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,500
You know how lonely I get on holidays.

914
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,340
Then go meet your girlfriend.

915
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,370
I'm tired.

916
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,740
Then you go, but they're staying.

917
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,740
Gwangbak should visit her parents.

918
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,140
They must be waiting for her.

919
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,430
Oh.

920
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,860
Men who are taken are useless.

921
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,140
Park Salla, get yourself together!

922
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,560
Honey.

923
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,290
Huh? Why did you come back so early?

924
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,030
Your mother didn't look so happy.

925
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:12,370
And your father wasn't home.

926
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,900
I heard they had a fight.

927
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,890
Oh, I can picture it.

928
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,470
Grandmother probably started it about Subak.

929
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,700
So you didn't bow to my father?

930
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,270
No. I called, but his phone was off.

931
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,000
I gave the kids money and came home.

932
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:29,870
Oh, director!

933
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,140
Oh, what brought you here?

934
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,830
I heard the managers are working today.

935
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,370
You're working really hard, aren't you?

936
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,700
We're almost done.

937
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:39,600
I'm taking other managers out, so join us.

938
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:43,040
Let's celebrate your successful model debut.

939
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,170
Okay.

940
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,640
Oh, it's cold.

941
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:22,000
Where were you?

942
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,870
I was waiting for Hobak.

943
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,240
She came home just now, completely drunk.

944
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,640
When? I didn't see her.

945
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,600
You must have missed her.

946
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,790
I should yell at Hobak.

947
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,830
How can she come home so drunk?

948
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,930
She's doing it because she's not afraid.

949
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,240
What if she cheats on you?

950
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,790
If she meets someone else, you're finished.

951
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,100
This is all your fault.

952
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,990
This is nuts!

953
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,060
Oh, oh.

954
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,740
They got pregnant because of alcohol.

955
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,990
Hobak.

956
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:24,640
Hobak. Hobak.

957
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:28,370
Are you asleep? Honey.

958
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:46,200
<i>You stay still, I'll do everything</i>

959
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:50,470
<i>Is it true or not? I'm not sure</i>

960
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:56,430
<i>I didn't know what love is</i>

961
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,200
<i>Make yourself at home in my arms</i>

962
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,990
- Get me some water.
- Water? Okay.

963
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:11,500
Here is water with honey.

964
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:21,660
<i>Make yourself at home in my arms</i>

965
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:25,030
I'm dying.

966
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,470
Why are you singing so early in the morning?

967
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,240
You must have energy to spare.

968
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,890
Did something happen?

969
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,240
Of course.
Something amazing happened.

970
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,500
You like getting older?

971
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:40,100
Just hold on.

972
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,700
For what?

973
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,640
You'll find out.

974
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,860
How did I come home last night?

975
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,290
You don't remember?

976
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,760
Ugh...

977
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:58,430
The director and other managers all came after me, and I blacked out.

978
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:02,200
You really don't remember anything?

979
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,270
I do.

980
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,830
What? What do you remember?

981
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,060
Come to think of it...

982
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,740
Why? What is it?

983
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,500
I had a weird dream.

984
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:21,300
Dream? What kind of dream?

985
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,270
I was being chased by someone.

986
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,070
Oh, that's a bad dream.

987
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:32,990
And someone pounced on me.

988
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,800
They did?

989
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,930
Yes.

990
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,740
I think it was a tiger.

991
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:42,370
A tiger this big pounced on me.

992
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,790
It must be a bad dream.

993
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:47,830
That's actually a pregnancy dream.

994
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,430
What are you talking about?

995
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,740
There's no way!

996
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,770
It's not like we did anything.

997
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,500
Who knows?
Take care of yourself.

998
00:56:56,510 --> 00:57:00,240
Don't be cheeky. It's horrible.

999
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,660
Anyway, why are you smiling?

1000
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:07,560
If you were me, you'd be smiling, too.

1001
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:08,890
What the...

1002
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,990
Make me some soup.

1003
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,540
Oh, ouch!

1004
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:13,670
Are you okay?

1005
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,700
Are you hurt?
How's your stomach?

1006
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:18,200
My stomach's fine!

1007
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:21,560
Don't overreact. Ugh.

1008
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,440
I'm worried about your stomach.

1009
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,470
Oh, my stomach. 
My stomach's fine.

1010
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,770
But that stomach might not be.

1011
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,870
Munjin Middle School.
This is Wang Bong.

1012
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:47,300
The president?

1013
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:50,600
Okay. I'll be right there.

1014
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,970
Mom, I'm sorry.

1015
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,100
I had to go to work, so I couldn't come.

1016
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,200
You never brought me clothes before.

1017
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:14,700
Is this leftover from last season?

1018
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:17,430
No, mom. That's new.

1019
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,590
That's for you,

1020
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:21,060
this is father's, and this is grandmother's.

1021
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:23,200
I didn't get anything for others.

1022
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:26,060
Where's everyone?
Why is it so quiet?

1023
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:28,970
Why did you get grandmother anything?

1024
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:31,330
Don't be like that.

1025
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:34,240
Oh, I heard you had a fight.

1026
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,700
I don't even want to talk about it.

1027
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,740
It was decided by the board of directors.

1028
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,240
You need to quit before next semester.

1029
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,500
Please sort things out by next month.

1030
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,400
Hello, mother.

1031
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,930
Daebak's not home.

1032
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,000
Hey, don't ever come here again.

1033
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,970
Leave!

1034
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,100
Get out. Like mother, like daughter.

1035
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:28,740
Miho.

1036
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,140
What are you talking about?

1037
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,290
You're taking the kids?

1038
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,790
Over my dead body.

1039
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,790
Aeji and Jungji are my grandchildren.

1040
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,370
Nobody else can raise them.

1041
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,600
You can't have them.

1042
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:47,500
Mother.

1043
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:50,640
Don't call me mother.

1044
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:52,560
If that's what you want, don't come back.

1045
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:53,790
They are my kids.

1046
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,530
They are Subak's kids, too!

1047
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,600
And I'm the one who's been raising them!

1048
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:01,240
You and Subak stay out of it!

1049
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,140
This won't solve anything.

1050
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:06,270
I'll come back and take them soon.

1051
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,740
He wants to take them?

1052
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,600
She must have told him to bring them.

1053
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:22,670
You're going to let him take your kids?

1054
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:25,470
If the kids are gone, it's really over.

1055
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,860
I'm not sure if I can say this,

1056
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,040
but Minjung's seeing a woman.

1057
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,870
I saw them at the beach.

1058
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,290
She told you to never come again?

1059
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,390
Yes.

1060
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,790
Did you do something wrong?

1061
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,740
She said something about you.

1062
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,330
No.

1063
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,790
I did nothing wrong.

1064
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,860
Hello?

1065
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,300
Sunjeong?

1066
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:17,360
This is Subak.

1067
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,940
You know who I am, don't you?

1068
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,360
Let's meet.

1069
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:25,750
Subtitles by KBS World

1070
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,370
We're getting back together.

1071
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,440
Don't you know him at all?

1072
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,890
We'll see about that.

1073
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,240
You want me to slap you around?

1074
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,330
I'm scared to meet him.

1075
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,790
Why should you be?
You have the kids.

1076
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,660
Sunjeong, I'll come to you.

1077
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,130
Minjung.

1078
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,940
Why are you checking my phone?

1079
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:45,390
Who is he?

1080
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,390
What's wrong with you? Who?

1081
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,660
What should I do?
Jungji fell asleep.

1082
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,090
Then you should spend the night here.

1083
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:55,060
Let's cut to the chase. 
I want to see you.

1084
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,740
I don't think I should.

1085
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:59,660
I don't want traces of you at his place.

1086
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:00,560
You can't go in.

1087
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:02,030
- Step aside.
- I won't!
