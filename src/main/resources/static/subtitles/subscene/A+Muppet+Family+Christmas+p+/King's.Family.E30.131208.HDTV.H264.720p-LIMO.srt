2
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,550
This is my house.

3
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,620
My oldest niece used to live here.

4
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,140
Right. I was her landlady.

5
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,240
I rent these out,

6
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,550
and I live at the top, alone.

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,890
Okay.

8
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,920
Semi real estate tycoon.

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,650
I get a lot of money in rent.

10
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,840
I have no financial trouble.

11
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,550
I can support a man.

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,840
Do you want me to buy you a car?

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,780
A car?

14
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,050
I can afford to buy you a car.

15
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,550
Don, you should get a woman like me.

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,340
This house is over $300,000.

17
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,050
That's big money.
You don't see that everyday.

18
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,780
Come inside for some tea.

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,290
There's nobody home.

20
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,350
No thanks.

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,850
I'm not the type who's stingy with money.

22
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,820
I splurge. Like how I spent lots at that Japanese restaurant.

23
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,720
Yes, you do splurge. Like mad.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,140
Good night.

25
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,720
We need to say goodbye properly.

26
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,750
Mom!

27
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,840
Agh!

28
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,550
- What? 
- Don!

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,850
Don!

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,950
How did it go?

31
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,820
How did it go?

32
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,110
It went well, didn't it?

33
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,610
I'll talk to you later.

34
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,050
Is she pretty?

35
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,490
I think he's too shy to talk about it.

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,240
Tell me if things go well.

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,840
Hey,

38
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,790
I'm dying to know.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,250
What does she look like?

40
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,310
She's rich?

41
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,950
Ii heard she's rich and single.

42
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,790
What is it?
You didn't like her?

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,850
She's scary.

44
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,590
Why is she scary?

45
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,680
I can't explain.

46
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,940
Why you little...

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,920
Get married so I can come live with you.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,240
Take a look.

49
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,450
Incredible.

50
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,520
Grandmother, you're up for lunch today.

51
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,950
What?

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,390
Lunch is grandmother and uncle.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,780
The older person goes first because father went first last night.

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,320
You have to give me a break. I'm old.

55
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,290
No exceptions, grandmother.
Right, father?

56
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,920
Huh? Yes, right.

57
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,490
You're really making the winner marry Sangnam?

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,920
That's not right.

59
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,810
You need to know when to be stubborn.

60
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,880
If you're always stubborn, you look like a jerk.

61
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,780
If I can break that rude girl,

62
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,390
I don't care if I look like a jerk.

63
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,410
Man...

64
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,110
The final one is the physical test!

65
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,810
If you want to live long as a happy couple,

66
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,790
you need a sound body and a sound mind.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,150
Patience, resilience, endurance!

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,690
You must use every ounce of energy!

69
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,310
I'll lead the way.

70
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,380
Ready!

71
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,720
Go!

72
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,690
- Number 4, faster!
- Run! Run!

73
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,740
Number 4, run faster!

74
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,990
Jangbi! Number 1!

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
- Number 4!
- Number 1!

76
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,740
- Number 4!
- Number 1!

77
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,140
- Number 4! 4!
- Yes! Number 1!

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,020
- Number 4!
- Run!

79
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,840
A little more! 
Number 4, a little more!

80
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,090
Run! Jangbi!

81
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,690
Number 1! Number 1! Yes!

82
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,790
Number 4!

83
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,850
- Jangbi...
- Number 4! Number 4!

84
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,180
Mom! I won first place!

85
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,790
You did?

86
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,680
Aunt! Aunt!

87
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,310
We will award the plaque to the winner.

88
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,880
We name you the winner of Choi Daese's 

89
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,010
Daughter in law Auditions!

90
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,040
Thank you.

91
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,710
Thank you.

92
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,450
Thank you.

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,490
Thank you.

94
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,010
Thank you.

95
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,280
Thank you.

96
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,820
It's your turn to do the dishes, mom.

97
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,840
I'm going to work.

98
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,220
Anggeum, I'm leaving.

99
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,350
Don't you have any warm rice tea?

100
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,310
Rice tea?

101
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,310
It's cold.
Give me some warm tea.

102
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,820
Grandmother ran away.

103
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,780
Thank you!

104
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,020
Smile!

105
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,490
Man...

106
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,240
Gwangbak!

107
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,240
You're incredible!

108
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,240
Father! Thank you!

109
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,790
Thank you for everything!

110
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,240
Oh, man...

111
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,080
Mom.

112
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,190
How did it go?

113
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,690
I didn't make it.

114
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,950
What?

115
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,450
You spent so much money on learning things,

116
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,690
so how come you didn't win?

117
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,350
You can dance, you can run,

118
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,790
you can play the gayageum, and you're cute!

119
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,910
I wasn't a good student.

120
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,880
So why would you embarrass yourself like that there?

121
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,350
People will talk about you failing now!

122
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,880
How humiliating!

123
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,880
Don't even come home!

124
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,310
Man...

125
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,610
Mom!

126
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,140
What's this?

127
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,680
The person on lunch duty didn't do the dishes.

128
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,850
This isn't working out.

129
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,790
There's no order in the family,

130
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,780
and nobody respects you.

131
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,740
We posted that up so everyone would follow.

132
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,990
"You're home?"
and she'll fake some illness.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,410
You deal with her, if you want to fall for it.

134
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,550
Leave them. I'll do them.

135
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,380
Oh, I'll do them.

136
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,240
Why would you?
It's not your turn.

137
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,220
Step aside.

138
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,740
Go easy on them.

139
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,880
You'll break them all.

140
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,240
Wash this one again.

141
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,090
Oh, you're creating more work.

142
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,320
Wash this one again, too.

143
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,450
Should I go get Bong?
He's good at this.

144
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,520
God will punish you.

145
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,720
Let him, then.

146
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,590
Hello, father.

147
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,920
Hi.

148
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,280
I heard you went on a business trip.

149
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,040
What's up?

150
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,490
I brought some pork belly.

151
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,690
Have you eaten?

152
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,090
Thanks. I was worried about what to cook.

153
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,140
So why did you bring pork belly?

154
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,880
I'm going to start spending money now.

155
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,540
I'll get you better meat next time.

156
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,240
Where's grandmother?

157
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,040
She's doing the dishes.

158
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,040
Huh? Grandmother is?

159
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,540
Things changed, thanks to Minjung.

160
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,010
Everyone's taking turns doing house chores.

161
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,310
Oh, wow! That's great.

162
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,420
Minjung is better than any of you.

163
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,880
But you shouldn't make mother do it, too.

164
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,010
She's healthy,

165
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,350
so it's better if she does some chores.

166
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,590
My sentiment exactly!

167
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,820
I'm home.

168
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,820
- Hi.
- Hi.

169
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,420
- You're back?
- Was it a research trip?

170
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,710
Yes. I brought someone.

171
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,610
- Hello.
- Hi.

172
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,510
- Welcome.
- Come in.

173
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,310
- Welcome.
- It's been a while.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,110
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

175
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,740
It's about meeting my father.

176
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,140
When does he want to do it?

177
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,610
He thought we could do it this weekend.

178
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,110
That sounds good.

179
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,690
Did you come just to tell us that?

180
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,920
Yes, I really wanted to tell you this.

181
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,140
I know you're in a hurry

182
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,110
but you followed her home

183
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,220
from her business trip?

184
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,050
You must really love her.

185
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,140
I'll tell you about that another time.

186
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,720
I should go.

187
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,990
I'll come back and visit again.

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,780
Stay for dinner.
We're having pork belly.

189
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,780
It's okay.
I have to get back to work.

190
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,490
Oh, okay, then.

191
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,440
I'll see you this weekend.

192
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,790
- Yes.
- Okay.

193
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,990
- Take care.
- Bye.

194
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,090
Take care.

195
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,110
Get some rest.

196
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,610
You must be tired.

197
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,240
No.

198
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,340
You shouldn't do this here.

199
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,610
I'll call you later.

200
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,610
Let's celebrate.

201
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,720
Mother, doesn't the food taste better after doing the dishes?

202
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,220
Don't talk to me.

203
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,420
The pork belly tastes really good.

204
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,450
Well,

205
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,950
I have something to tell you.

206
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,140
Congratulate me.
I'm getting a divorce.

207
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,590
- What did you say?
- Divorce?

208
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,780
Please don't say anything.

209
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,080
I've made my decision, so please accept it.

210
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,420
It's not a big secret,

211
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,010
but until Gwangbak's wedding,

212
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,220
I'd like to keep it in the family.

213
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,220
Oh, this feels weird.

214
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,010
I'm fine, so congratulate me.

215
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,840
I don't have an ounce of regret.

216
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,380
And I'm completely over him.

217
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,110
Making the decision was hard,

218
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,410
but now I'm glad it's over.

219
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,180
I'll be really happy.

220
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,550
I'm sure of it.

221
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:03,740
My mother in law always says you never know how your life will turn out. 

222
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,190
Do you want to go singing?

223
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,650
My treat.

224
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,940
Man!

225
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,740
Hey, start clapping your hands.

226
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,450
<i>It's raining,</i>

227
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,420
<i>and I'm on the train to the south! Clap!</i>

228
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,440
<i>As I look out the window!</i>

229
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,290
Woohoo!

230
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,010
<i>There are raindrops, yeah!</i>

231
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,380
<i>And there are my tears!</i>

232
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,720
The mobile phone has been turned off,

233
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,640
so you'll be directed to voice mail.

234
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,490
Are you sure you're okay?

235
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,410
Yes.

236
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,990
So this isn't all an act?

237
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,580
No.

238
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,820
Thanks for being on my side.

239
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,920
Of course, we're family.

240
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,010
Let me know if you need me.

241
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,780
I'll teach Goof-off a lesson.

242
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,340
There's no need for that.

243
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,690
We're strangers now.

244
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,740
Hobak.

245
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,890
Yes, father?

246
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,210
Have a seat.

247
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,690
Are you okay?

248
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,820
I think this is for the best, father.

249
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,610
I'm trying to be positive about it.

250
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,780
Things may get tougher than you think.

251
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,450
Our society isn't kind to divorced women.

252
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,610
It's a difficult world for women.

253
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,350
Money issue aside,

254
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,820
there are times when a man comes in handy.

255
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,950
And raising two boys won't be easy.

256
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,050
And they are sons, not daughters.

257
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,640
Boys need their dad sometimes.

258
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,390
I know.

259
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,140
I'm okay with everything else,

260
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,180
but I feel like I'm taking their dad away.

261
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,740
That really breaks my heart.

262
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,490
But father,

263
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,810
I've given it my all, so I have no regrets.

264
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,050
I...

265
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,940
Even got kidnapped.

266
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,140
What are you talking about?

267
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,720
You got kidnapped? When?

268
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,180
It wasn't real.

269
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,850
I just wanted to test him...

270
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,790
But...

271
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,910
He wasn't any different.

272
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,110
Even when my life was on the line.

273
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,640
What more could I do?

274
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,640
If I was kidnapped,

275
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,310
he should try to rescue me, no matter what.

276
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,150
But he turned his phone off.

277
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,720
That's not family.

278
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,650
I don't want to spend my life with him.

279
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,740
How could you do that?

280
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,920
I didn't want to lose him.

281
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,820
No,

282
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,990
I think I was trying to let him go.

283
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,220
I had to be sure,

284
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,080
so I can let him go without any regrets.

285
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,740
He was

286
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,890
my first love.

287
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,720
Father,

288
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,120
I'm only 36.

289
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,340
I'm not going to live foolishly anymore.

290
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,610
If the boys need a dad,

291
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,050
there's you and uncle.

292
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,840
And if that doesn't work,

293
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,840
they'll just have to tough it out.

294
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,720
You must have been in a lot of pain.

295
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,780
Can you really get over him?

296
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,940
I'll have to.

297
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,720
I think I can now.

298
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,690
I've tried everything,

299
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,820
so I have no regrets.

300
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,450
Oh, man...

301
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:10,740
What is it?

302
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,450
Oh, man...

303
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,280
Ugh...

304
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,280
Ah ah.

305
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,920
<i>What do I do?</i>

306
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,190
<i>What should I do?</i>

307
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,780
Ugh...

308
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,020
<i>I am...</i>

309
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,950
What's wrong with you?

310
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,150
We're here to sing, so stop that!

311
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,740
What's wrong, Don?

312
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,220
Things were going great last night.

313
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,890
Don, I think this is destiny.

314
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,020
I feel like spending lots of money on you.

315
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,340
I don't care about any destiny,

316
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,710
and I don't want you spending money on me.

317
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,280
I appreciate you buying dinner last night,

318
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,310
so I'll pay for this.

319
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,340
Don!

320
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,950
Don! Don!

321
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,450
A bottle of soju, please.

322
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,310
What are you doing here?

323
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,780
Don't talk to me.

324
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,720
You don't have an empty table?

325
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,190
Oh, I don't.

326
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,420
He's alone. 
Can you sit with him?

327
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,720
Is it okay if she sits with you?

328
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,740
She's really pretty.

329
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,650
Oh, you're a handsome man.

330
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,950
Sit, sit.

331
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,090
Sit down.

332
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,890
Give me a bottle of soju.

333
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,120
Where are you coming from?

334
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,290
Are you running away from home?

335
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,340
I went on a trip.

336
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,740
I said don't talk to me.

337
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,110
If you're coming back from a trip,

338
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,020
why are you drinking here alone?

339
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,510
Who did you go with?

340
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,490
Stop asking me stuff like that.

341
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,010
Ah...

342
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,240
You're not eating anything?

343
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,580
I'll gain weight.

344
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,890
You can't drink on an empty stomach.

345
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,720
Should I order you something?

346
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,780
No thanks.

347
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,920
I don't eat with just anyone.

348
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,280
I'm not just anyone.

349
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,510
I'm your brother's friend.

350
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,880
No thanks, Gwangbak's uncle.

351
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,320
How embarrassing.

352
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,720
Pretend you don't know me.
Stop looking at me!

353
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,190
Tell me when there's an empty table.

354
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,890
I think you should keep sitting together.

355
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,850
You two look good together.

356
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,210
Don't you dare say that!

357
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,010
Another bottle please!

358
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,220
How annoying!

359
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,820
Where's my gift for winning the audition?

360
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,680
Oh, I forgot.

361
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,580
What would you like?

362
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,280
What's that in your pocket?

363
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,640
My pocket?

364
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,280
You said you threw them out.

365
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,810
I was going to,

366
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,640
but I couldn't because they were so expensive.

367
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,420
I'm so materialistic!

368
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,310
We promised, remember?

369
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,610
Let's not ever take them off again.

370
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,720
Okay.

371
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,740
We never will.

372
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,780
But I'm worried about this weekend.

373
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,990
Your father and my mom won't be easy to handle.

374
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,340
Let's just keep moving forward.

375
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,540
How?

376
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,920
Yeongdal,

377
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,920
you were much prettier before the surgery.

378
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,990
I said don't talk to me.

379
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,990
You think I like you?

380
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,810
No thank you.
You're not my style.

381
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,840
How dare you! You loser!

382
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,010
What?

383
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,580
You are a loser.

384
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,810
You have no real job,

385
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,540
and you never had a relationship. Loser.

386
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,720
How about you?

387
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,280
You only care for money,

388
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,220
and look what happened to you!

389
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,650
I know you were after a rich man.

390
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,720
Getting bigger boobs did you no good!

391
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,920
What?

392
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,690
You better not say that again!

393
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,690
I'll kill you.

394
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,090
Excuse me!

395
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,580
Give each of us a bottle of soju! Separately!

396
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,410
I'm so upset.

397
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,990
Hello.

398
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,920
I lost because of common sense!
I'm stupid!

399
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,850
Goodbye.

400
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,440
Come again.

401
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,610
Agh! Hey!

402
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,150
Mom!

403
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,590
Man!

404
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,820
Why...

405
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,780
Tell me what happened! Now!

406
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,220
Why are you screaming?

407
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,790
This is crazy!

408
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,720
You forced me here, didn't you?

409
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,950
Am I crazy?
Why would I do that?

410
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,990
Turn around, so I can get dressed.

411
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,920
This is just awful!

412
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,620
What do I do? 
This is crazy.

413
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,520
How about me?
It's not awful for me?

414
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,240
What?

415
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,490
I never follow anyone out.

416
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,080
Did you seduce me?

417
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,850
Are you mad?
I seduced you?

418
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,780
You forced me here!
How will you fix this?

419
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,110
You got drunk and you blacked out.

420
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,750
- Hey!
- Oh, my!

421
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,220
Ask anyone whose fault this is.

422
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,350
Mom...

423
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,010
Stop crying!

424
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,010
This is humiliating!

425
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,110
This is awful!

426
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,340
I'm ruined!

427
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,610
This is horrible!

428
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,850
It's not horrible.
You got lucky.

429
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,550
I got lucky?

430
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,810
This is me getting lucky?

431
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,040
It's horrible!

432
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,540
I'm the one who feels horrible here.

433
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,040
Let me go! Let me go!

434
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,490
How dare you! You're a loser!

435
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,490
This is humiliating!

436
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,920
I never want to see you again.

437
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,990
Don't tell anyone about this.

438
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,690
I won't be able to get married.

439
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,450
Oh, my!

440
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,420
Look who's talking!

441
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,050
Hey! Loser!

442
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,420
Oh...

443
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,620
Where were you?

444
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,750
You told me not to come home!

445
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,320
So you didn't come home?

446
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,280
How dare you!

447
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,490
- Where did you sleep?
- At a sauna.

448
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,280
Why are you screaming?

449
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,140
You failed the audition!

450
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,690
I've had horrible luck!

451
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,510
Totally horrible!

452
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,110
I'm never going back to that sauna again!

453
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,320
Huh?

454
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,220
What the...

455
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,240
Uncle, you're just getting in?

456
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,850
Did you have a good time?

457
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,280
What?

458
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,740
You were with her?

459
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,720
We waited up for you until midnight.

460
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,040
You're home?

461
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,990
Were you with that woman you met?

462
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,950
We should start planning for the wedding!

463
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,350
What wedding?

464
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,340
I drank all night alone.

465
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,680
Subak, she kept doing this!

466
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,040
I know I have nothing to offer, but still!

467
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,780
This is all because of her!

468
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,280
What are you talking about?

469
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,240
Forget it!

470
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,450
Get up.
You're not going to work?

471
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,310
Forget it!

472
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,580
If you didn't tell me not to come home,

473
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,040
this would've never happened!

474
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,080
What? What happened?

475
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,840
Mother, there's something I must tell you.

476
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,940
What is it?

477
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,990
Can you come out?

478
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,080
Yeongdal, you too.

479
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,590
What? You're getting a divorce?

480
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,720
Are you serious?

481
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,890
Yes.

482
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,690
Oh, good for you.

483
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,040
You should've done so a long time ago.

484
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,950
You thought about it during your trip?

485
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,650
Are you serious?

486
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,620
She said yes.

487
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,020
You should live your life now.

488
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,040
You two weren't meant to be together.

489
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,610
Sedal would've never married you if you didn't get knocked up.

490
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,890
So many people get married because of that.

491
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,650
I just don't understand them.

492
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,550
I know lots of girls who did that.

493
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:37,550
They meet someone, test the waters, get pregnant and get married.

494
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,510
This apartment is in both our names,

495
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,420
but you know I bought it, don't you?

496
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,950
- So I was thinking...
- It's okay.

497
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,850
It's not even a lot of money.

498
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,610
You don't need to split it.
Just take it.

499
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,390
You'll be raising the kids, right?

500
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,190
I wasn't going to give you anything.

501
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,150
But for now,

502
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,050
you and Yeongdal will have to move out,

503
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,580
- so you'll need...
- It's okay.

504
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,740
Keep your money.

505
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,310
We're not after your money.

506
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,220
Sedal will take care of it, I'm sure.

507
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,310
He met a very rich woman.

508
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,340
He might just buy us an apartment.

509
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,880
Right.

510
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,890
So you figure out how to fend for yourself.

511
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,950
Congratulations on your divorce.

512
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,150
The phone has been turned off,

513
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,550
so your will be directed to voice mail.

514
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,880
Your brother won't answer.

515
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,350
And he hasn't called in a while.

516
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,040
He hasn't called me either.

517
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,640
He lives in heaven, so he forgot us.

518
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,850
He must be having a party every day.

519
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,280
Should we drop by with Sintong and Bangtong?

520
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,380
What's this?

521
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,820
Yellow corvina stew.

522
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,010
Oh, it looks delicious.

523
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,450
You should eat it while its hot.

524
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,540
You must be busy with your father and work.

525
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,190
It's cold, so you need some hot food.

526
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,420
Hurry up and eat.

527
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,990
Thank you, mother.

528
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,340
Don't thank me. 
We're family.

529
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,540
Subak's making things hard for you, right?

530
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,010
Looking back,

531
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,610
I think I spoiled her too much.

532
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:24,320
Everyone was disappointed she wasn't a son,

533
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,680
so I treated her like a princess.

534
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,490
No other man could put up with her, I know.

535
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,990
I'm glad I moved in here.

536
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,920
If it were just the two of us,

537
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:41,010
we'd be fighting all the time.

538
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,950
Living with you and father makes me happy.

539
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,410
Thank you for saying that.

540
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,220
Where's my gray suit?

541
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,490
Mmm... That smells delicious.

542
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,650
I made some yellow corvina stew.

543
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,920
Minjung loves it.

544
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,320
Have some.

545
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,910
You eat.

546
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,650
You have to go to work soon.

547
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,810
Mother, it's really delicious.

548
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,010
I'm glad. Eat up.

549
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,010
Why can't you be nice to me like that?

550
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,950
What do you mean?

551
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,190
Why wouldn't you cook me something?

552
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,120
Then you be nice to me like him.

553
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,920
What?

554
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,280
When I burned my foot, he rushed me to the hospital.

555
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,840
Who else would do that for me?

556
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,120
You realize that now?

557
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,820
I learned that a long time ago!

558
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,680
I was just upset about his company.

559
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:46,540
What if I got kidnapped.
What would you do?

560
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,840
I'd say good riddance.

561
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,280
You won't pay ransom to get me back?

562
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,510
Why would I want to get an old man back?

563
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,490
What would you do if I got kidnapped?

564
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,840
I'd pay them and thank them for taking you.

565
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,490
How dare you!

566
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,910
I shouldn't be laughing.

567
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:11,010
Now we're going to have a daughter who's divorced.

568
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:15,890
That's why they say there are no certainties in life.

569
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,390
And nobody can predict it.

570
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:22,840
If it's possible, I want my kids to avoid divorcing,

571
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,740
but if it isn't, what could we do?

572
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,510
Hobak seems like she's in a hard place,

573
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,220
but she might be better off without him.

574
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,820
Having to raise the boys alone will be difficult, I'm sure.

575
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,650
Of course it will be.

576
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,790
Having a husband is a big deal.

577
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,850
You knew that?

578
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,220
Right now?

579
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,010
Okay, Mr. Seo.

580
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,740
Let's go.

581
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,420
He want us now?

582
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,490
Yes.

583
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,220
Mr. Seo wants to see us right now.

584
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,040
No! I have to go to Aeji's play!

585
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,490
Aeji's playing? But we're busy.

586
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,080
No, Aeji's in a play.

587
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,080
Mr. Seo likes you, so you have to come.

588
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,280
Call home. Hurry.

589
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,220
Oh...

590
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,690
Why didn't you answer your mobile phone?

591
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,350
Oh, I'm busy.

592
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,490
I was working in the kitchen.

593
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,040
I can't come to Aeji's play today.

594
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,740
That's not good!
Aeji will be mad.

595
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,780
I know. Can you go?

596
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,140
What?

597
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,090
Mom, I'm sorry.

598
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,180
Subak!

599
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,340
Oh!

600
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,120
Oh, no.

601
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,310
Oh.

602
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,140
Oh, I have to take care of Jungji!

603
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,410
Mother! Oh...

604
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,390
Oh...

605
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,910
Mother, you didn't have to come.

606
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,780
I have to.

607
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,250
Everyone else's mom and dad are here.

608
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,250
I don't want Aeji to feel neglected.

609
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,150
Aeji's grandmother! 
Welcome.

610
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,140
Oh, hello, Mrs. Principal.

611
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,740
Where's Aeji's mom?

612
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,520
She's busy.

613
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,590
You must be Aeji's dad.

614
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,990
Yes, he's my son in law.

615
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,740
Hello.

616
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,320
Your son in law is handsome.

617
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,490
Isn't he?

618
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,620
And he's so good to me.

619
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,580
He's like my son.

620
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,410
Aeji, your grandmother came.

621
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,720
Where's mom?

622
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,540
Say hello to your grandmother.

623
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,620
Mom's not here, so no!

624
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,420
But grandmother and dad came. Don't pout.

625
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,610
Other moms all look really pretty!

626
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,250
You're just like your mom.

627
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,050
Aeji, break a leg.

628
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,220
Aeji, let's go!

629
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,720
Let's go.

630
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,720
Let's go.

631
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,450
What's that?

632
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,750
Our family.

633
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,720
- Take dad out.
- Why?

634
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,180
Dad's not here.
He never comes home.

635
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,510
No!

636
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,950
Sintong, Bangtong!

637
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,250
Tada!

638
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,250
Mom!

639
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,950
You're home.

640
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,290
What's wrong?
What happened?

641
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,550
Sintong keeps telling me to take dad out.

642
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,810
But there are four people in our family.

643
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,920
Here.

644
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,350
Isn't it yummy?

645
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,310
Yes, it's yummy!

646
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,890
I wish I could eat pizza every day!

647
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,040
Well, Sintong, Bangtong,

648
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,140
I have something to tell you.

649
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,040
I knew it.

650
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:50,950
You buy us pizza when you need to talk to us.

651
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:58,580
Dad and I won't be living together anymore.

652
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,850
You're finally getting divorced.

653
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,920
You are?

654
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,780
Mom, don't divorce dad.

655
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,250
Don't cry.

656
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,820
Bangtong, please...

657
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,640
I'm not finished yet.

658
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,390
I'm really sorry, but we couldn't help it.

659
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,790
Please understand.

660
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:28,680
Then who do we live with?

661
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,640
With me, of course.

662
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:34,140
But you can see dad whenever you want.

663
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,450
Is that okay?

664
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,720
It's not okay.

665
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,750
I'm okay.

666
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,690
I can live fine without dad.

667
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,740
Mom, I hate you! 
Sintong, I hate you!

668
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,920
I don't want to live without dad.

669
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,510
You come with me.

670
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,890
Stop it. Stop!

671
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,750
Why are you acting like a baby?

672
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,220
You think I'm happy here?

673
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,250
Mom's really sad.

674
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,780
If you keep crying like a baby,
 it'll make things harder for mom.

675
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,250
Do you want mom to be sad?

676
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,350
I don't.

677
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,950
But I don't want to live without dad.

678
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,290
Dad has changed.

679
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,820
I knew this day would come.

680
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,390
You knew?

681
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,720
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

682
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,390
You're still young.

683
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,990
Lots of my friends parents got divorced.

684
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,410
But they survived it.

685
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,410
You're okay?

686
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,580
I'm pretending to be okay.

687
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,220
You can trust me.

688
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,620
If your friends tease you, tell me.

689
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,720
I'll beat them up for you, okay?

690
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,540
Bangtong, don't make this harder for mom.

691
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,990
Imagine how hard it must be for her.

692
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,310
She has to raise us without dad.

693
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,350
Other moms would have run away.

694
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,250
Mom didn't run away.

695
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,320
But what if I miss dad?

696
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,280
We can see him behind mom's back, stupid.

697
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,850
Oh, stop crying!

698
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,420
Your dad and I went!

699
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,510
You always start crying for no reason!

700
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,220
Oh, you're just like your mom.

701
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,620
Stop it! Stop!

702
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,910
There's my in law!

703
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,220
Oh, we're not in laws anymore.

704
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,640
You missed the meeting with our friends.

705
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,540
You must be busy being the nanny.

706
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,490
Are you happy they're getting a divorce?

707
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,990
You're looking really good.

708
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,250
It's not such a bad thing.

709
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,350
Everyone lives according to their own fate.

710
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,450
Then why are you still living at my daughter's place?

711
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,350
That's none of your business.

712
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,650
I'll leave when I want.

713
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,040
None of my business?

714
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:21,150
Just look after your own family.

715
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,050
After all, we're not family,

716
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,450
now that the kids are divorced.

717
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,290
Oh, look at all those wrinkles!

718
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,850
How much do you get paid to be in that prison?

719
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,810
You must have gone mad.

720
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,890
You're acting like we'll never see each other.

721
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,690
Are you picking a fight with me?

722
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,380
Don't get upset.
You'll get more wrinkles.

723
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,750
We talked about going to the hot springs,

724
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,420
but you won't make it, will you?

725
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,410
Instead of thinking about going there,

726
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,540
move out of my daughter's apartment!

727
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:02,220
Who lives with their divorced daughter in law?

728
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,410
Why would you want to mooch off like that?

729
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,990
What's the big deal?

730
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,310
I'm moving out! So don't worry!

731
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,720
Why that...

732
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,290
I don't believe her.

733
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,490
Why is it her business?

734
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,080
As if she ever cared about Hobak!

735
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,040
You're home?

736
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,310
Yes.

737
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,990
Did you find a place?

738
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,020
What place?

739
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,720
The place where you'll move into.

740
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,290
Stop pushing me. I will move out.

741
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,150
I can't believe you two.

742
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,610
Did you tell your mom?

743
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,810
I'm not comfortable with you here.

744
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,490
Rent an apartment or something.

745
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,520
Rent an apartment?

746
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,590
You think I'll rent an apartment?

747
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,810
Please move out as soon as possible.

748
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,490
Fine. I will.

749
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,140
Like mother, like daughter.

750
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,110
Stop nagging.

751
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:02,020
You're just like your mom, did you know?

752
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,750
Man...

753
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,390
Hey did you hear that?

754
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,990
Let's move out of here, mom.

755
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,180
I'm sick and tire of this place.

756
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,780
Let's move to somewhere really far.

757
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,020
I thought you liked this neighborhood.

758
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,490
I got sick of it last night.

759
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,310
Call Sedal so we can move.

760
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,140
His phone is off again.

761
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,490
He's not ignoring us, is he?

762
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,310
Is he dumping us?

763
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,390
What?

764
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,720
You saw her.

765
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,950
She didn't even say hi to us.

766
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,680
She looks Korean, but she's not.

767
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,110
The concept of taking care of her

768
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,750
in laws may be foreign to her.

769
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,290
No, that can't be.

770
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,080
We just left that day,

771
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,780
but I'm going to teach her a lesson.

772
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,690
I'm going to destroy her.

773
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,580
How rude!

774
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,620
Let's go.

775
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,290
Okay.

776
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,720
I'm going to teach her a lesson, too.

777
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:01,620
She's dead.

778
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,010
We'll be back.

779
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,250
You're going apartment hunting?

780
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,590
Yes, I am.

781
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,010
You wait and see!

782
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,720
You'll be really sorry!

783
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,720
Hobak, don't be so mean.

784
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,680
It's not like we want to stay here.

785
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,050
Ouch! Hot!

786
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,310
Mom.

787
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,310
What is it?

788
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,350
What did you wear to Aeji's play?

789
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:35,920
What?

790
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,080
She called me all crying.
What did you wear?

791
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,620
She said you embarrassed her today.

792
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,220
She was embarrassed about what I wore?

793
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,890
Who does that selfish girl take after?

794
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,850
How can you say that?

795
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,190
Why didn't you go and make her feel good?

796
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:56,310
Why did you ask me to go? Huh?

797
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,740
Grandmother wasn't home,

798
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,050
so I had to take Jungji there.

799
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,910
Am I your nanny?

800
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,280
I couldn't even go to my meeting,

801
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,490
and I can't even go to the spa!

802
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,520
You're not doing this for free!

803
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,820
I pay you!

804
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,220
You can't do this after taking my money!

805
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:16,020
I should just hire a professional!

806
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,720
What did you just say?

807
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,990
How dare you yell at your mom?

808
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,420
Is your mom a nanny?

809
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,740
What? You pay her?

810
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,590
How much do you pay her?

811
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,910
Do you pay her thousands of dollars?

812
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:39,720
Wire the money to her account every month and give her days off.

813
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:43,950
How dare you take advantage of my wife!

814
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,310
You go to that spa.

815
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,180
Just leave the kids here.

816
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,110
Why did you take them in the first place?

817
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,850
Who'll take care of you if you get sick?

818
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,240
If you yell at your mom again,

819
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,350
I'll kick you out of my house!

820
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,910
Oh, man!

821
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,840
Ugh!

822
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,040
You should've come to Aeji's play.

823
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:18,390
I was at work!

824
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,580
Why does everyone get on my case?

825
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,780
Why do you pick fights with everyone?

826
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,890
Because everyone's picking on me.

827
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,450
Working is hard and mom's always mad.

828
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,450
Now dad's also mad.

829
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,080
So please leave me alone.

830
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,740
Jungji's our kid.

831
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,420
And you're Jungji's mom.

832
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,990
But you leave him with your mother

833
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,910
and yell at her whenever you want.

834
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,810
How could you do that to your mother who had to

835
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,890
carry Jungji on her back to Aeji's play?

836
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,290
You should've disciplined Aeji instead.

837
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,920
You need to make time for the kids.

838
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,180
You should've gotten today off or something.

839
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,240
Why do you make money?

840
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,350
What?

841
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,350
You said you do it for the kids.

842
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,040
Can't you see what's really good for them?

843
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:07,450
I don't even know what you're up to these days.

844
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,850
What do you mean?

845
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,220
You know what I mean.

846
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,190
Your father fell asleep just now.

847
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,810
Sorry I'm late.

848
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:26,010
I was going to come right over but...

849
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,090
I went home for a bit earlier.

850
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,620
He can walk by himself,

851
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,650
and he can eat alone now if I set the table.

852
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:33,340
It's easier for me now.

853
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,920
I owe it all to you.

854
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,720
Thank you.

855
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,390
I think he can go home now.

856
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,550
What?

857
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,510
Sedal isn't here?

858
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,720
He got kicked out a long time ago.

859
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:49,810
He got kicked out in his boxers.

860
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,080
In his boxers?

861
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,310
Mom.

862
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,640
Why? Why did he get kicked out?

863
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:03,140
How can she kick him out in his boxers?

864
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,580
In this cold!

865
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:08,240
Oh, I don't know what happened.

866
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,020
There was a snow storm,

867
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,690
so I felt really sorry for him.

868
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:17,140
Please leave before Miss Eun comes home.

869
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,390
What do we do?

870
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,650
Did you find a place?

871
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,490
I'm not feeling well.

872
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,910
Mom's really sick.

873
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,720
Stop pushing her.

874
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,810
We'll move out when we can, so stop it.

875
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,010
Mom, let's go.

876
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,950
Oh, what do we do?

877
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:56,890
Where did your brother go, in his boxers?

878
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,040
Quiet down. She'll hear you.

879
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,680
My poor Sedal...
What do I do now...

880
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,110
Why is his phone off?

881
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,120
Where is he?

882
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:17,810
Why did she kick him out?
What did he do?

883
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:23,640
What if your brother did something stupid?

884
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:24,680
What do we do, mom?

885
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,540
What if we get kicked out of here?

886
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,640
Shh!

887
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,610
Be quiet.

888
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,310
Oh, Sedal...

889
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,310
Why won't you call?

890
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,580
What are you doing?

891
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,190
Why did you get up so early?

892
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:18,010
I'm making tofu stew, your favorite.

893
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,020
Go back to bed.

894
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,520
Yes, Hobak.
I'll wake you up later.

895
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:25,190
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

896
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,180
You couldn't find a place, huh?

897
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,040
We're looking.

898
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,490
It's not easy to find a place.

899
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,850
It really isn't, Hobak.

900
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,720
Give us more time.

901
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,450
Renting apartments isn't hard.

902
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,310
Step aside. I'll do it.

903
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,780
It's okay.

904
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,420
Let me finish what Ii was doing.

905
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,950
You go and get ready for work.

906
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,040
Yeongdal, wake Sintong and Bangtong up.

907
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,780
They have to get ready for school.

908
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,650
Don't do this.

909
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:54,880
This is uncomfortable for both of us.

910
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,020
And I don't want to eat your food.

911
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,490
Why not?

912
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,290
I can't cook for my daughter in law?

913
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,690
Lots of mother in laws cook these days.

914
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:09,290
Then you eat the food you made.

915
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,990
I'll eat something else with the boys.

916
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,220
Do you have to act like this?

917
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:15,310
Let's act like family while we're here.

918
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,390
For Sintong and Bangtong's sake.

919
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,390
Yes, Hobak.

920
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,850
Do you think this is easy for me?

921
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,080
Divorcing Sedal wasn't an easy decision.

922
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,890
So I don't want to live with you.

923
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,720
Should I look for a place for you?

924
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,380
I'll leave when Sedal comes back.

925
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,750
I won't leave before that!

926
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,090
Stop fighting!

927
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,810
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

928
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,040
Come back for more.

929
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:52,080
I'm hungry.

930
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,350
Finally, some food.

931
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,490
That wretched girl.

932
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:15,020
She seduced my sweet Sedal then kicked him out in his boxers?

933
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,620
It was partially his fault.

934
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,990
He lost his mind over money.

935
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,990
Why would she fall for a married man?

936
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,040
With two kids, at that!

937
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:24,850
She was just bored,

938
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,690
but he couldn't see what she was doing.

939
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,220
Not everyone can become Cinderella.

940
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,810
What if he's starving?

941
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,140
Where is he sleeping? It's cold!

942
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:40,240
He got kicked out in his boxers.

943
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,890
What if he's going around like that?

944
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,050
Is it Sedal?

945
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,510
I don't know this number.

946
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,750
Hello?

947
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:53,780
Hello?

948
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,350
Say something.

949
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,150
Hello?

950
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,240
Mom.

951
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,720
Is it you, Sedal? Sedal!

952
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,580
Sedal, where are you?
Where are you?

953
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:10,850
I heard you got kicked out in your boxers.

954
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,150
Don't tell Hobak that.

955
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,110
It's embarrassing.

956
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,750
Who cares about that?

957
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,450
Come home.

958
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,680
Why couldn't I get a hold of you?

959
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,910
I lost my phone.

960
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,990
Don't wander the streets.
Come home, okay?

961
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,990
Come home to me.

962
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:35,020
I can't.

963
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,120
How can I?

964
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,850
Sedal, where are you?

965
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,250
I'll come and get you.

966
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,520
Where are you?

967
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,410
Just wait, mom.

968
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,780
I'll come home when I become successful.

969
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:52,620
Please look after Sintong and Bangtong.

970
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,520
Goodbye, mom.

971
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:01,290
Sedal! Sedal!

972
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:05,390
Mom,

973
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,150
what did he say? What did Sedal say?

974
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,610
Where is he? He's alive?

975
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,080
Yeongdal, close the shop.

976
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,340
Mom!

977
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,450
Oh, she's not here! 
Why are you doing this?

978
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,220
- She's not here.
- Hey!

979
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,120
Where is my son?
Where is he?

980
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:28,220
You must leave!

981
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,080
I told you not to let strangers in.

982
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:30,950
Drag them out of here!

983
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,520
What? Drag us out?

984
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,790
You little...

985
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,950
What are you doing?

986
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:40,080
How dare you kick my son out!

987
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:46,010
Why did you fool around with my son?

988
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,750
We should teach her a lesson!

989
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,810
What are you doing?

990
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,810
My son's getting a divorce because of you!

991
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,390
You think you'll get away with this?

992
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,810
You'll burn in hell!

993
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,120
You're a home wrecker!

994
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,850
God will punish you!

995
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,810
I won't let you get away with this!

996
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,650
Sedal...

997
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,810
Mom, mom, get up.

998
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,640
Oh, Sedal...

999
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,990
- Hello. 
- Welcome.

1000
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,290
Daese, your daughter in law is here.

1001
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,990
Don't call her that.

1002
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,810
They're not even married yet.

1003
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,140
But they will get married.

1004
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,240
She's your future daughter in law.

1005
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,350
Hello.

1006
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,910
I gave my blessings,

1007
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,310
but that's because of what I promised,

1008
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,910
not because I actually accept you.

1009
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,110
If you act rude, I won't take it.

1010
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,720
I understand, father.

1011
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,040
That will never happen again.

1012
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,950
I'll be watching you.

1013
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,490
You can't fool me.

1014
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,220
I'm his father,

1015
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,680
so I'm letting him have his way.

1016
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,310
But my heart is like Siberia.

1017
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:10,650
She'll melt your heart, little by little.

1018
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,180
Your adorable future daughter in law will.

1019
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,450
Sangnam, show her your room.

1020
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,950
Wow.

1021
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:39,580
It's so much nicer in person.

1022
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:40,990
- It is?
- Yes.

1023
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:44,720
But your father is so scary.

1024
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:46,020
I'm scared.

1025
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:49,150
Don't worry.

1026
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,840
You have me. 
You can rely on me.

1027
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,890
You're not going to disappear, will you?

1028
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,950
I won't.

1029
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:01,950
Why did you close the door?

1030
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,890
You're supposed to keep the door open!

1031
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,350
That's basic knowledge.

1032
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,250
Where did you learn to behave like this?

1033
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,920
Father, we're getting married.

1034
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,640
But the wedding hasn't happened yet.

1035
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,450
I'm sorry.

1036
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,490
You should be helping Sunjeong in the kitchen!

1037
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,810
I will.

1038
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,080
Father,

1039
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:32,140
she's a guest.

1040
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:34,410
We can't make her do things.

1041
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,080
You're siding with her?

1042
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:38,350
You're an idiot.

1043
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,080
Don't forget your place,

1044
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:42,240
if you don't want this family to be in trouble.

1045
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,110
Don't we have to go too?

1046
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:03,310
It'll just be the parents, to keep it simple.

1047
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,910
But he doesn't have a mother, right?

1048
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,040
He has an aunt who might as well be his mom.

1049
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,620
Hobak, you look great.

1050
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:13,920
I do?

1051
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,450
It's probably because I'm relaxed.

1052
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:19,390
Right. Everyone needs that.

1053
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,790
Uncle, did something nice happen to you?

1054
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,950
What could happen to me?

1055
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,220
Good or bad,

1056
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:29,390
there's nothing going on.

1057
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,490
But you look different.

1058
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,040
It's like you've become a man.

1059
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:35,810
Is that because of that woman?

1060
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,620
Don't even bring that up.

1061
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:44,080
Actually, uncle, you look more handsome.

1062
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:45,220
Stop teasing me.

1063
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,490
You always tease me.

1064
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,020
- No!
- No.

1065
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,920
- Uncle, you're handsome.
- Right, you are.

1066
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,680
- Oh!
- Uncle, you're the best!

1067
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:53,990
I know it's tough.

1068
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:58,510
You should overcome this to become great men.

1069
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:01,720
I'll be there in place of your dad.

1070
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,950
My uncle isn't much help,

1071
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,140
but I'll be a great uncle to you.

1072
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,520
And both of you have dreams.

1073
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:14,250
So never get discouraged.

1074
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,250
Okay, uncle.

1075
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,690
But I still miss my dad.

1076
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,220
He's breaking my heart...

1077
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,580
I can't take this.

1078
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:58,950
I never want to see you again.

1079
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,850
Don't tell anyone about this.

1080
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,250
I won't be able to get married.

1081
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,050
Ugh!

1082
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,850
This is horrible!

1083
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,250
How dare you!
You're a loser!

1084
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,720
This is humiliating!

1085
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,640
Oh, no!

1086
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,950
Wang Haebak.

1087
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,340
What is it?

1088
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,680
It's nothing.

1089
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,810
I'll tell you later.

1090
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,520
Let's go.

1091
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:01,950
Father,

1092
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,720
don't brag about me there.

1093
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,950
They'll think you're silly.

1094
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,450
Did the rude girl tell you to say that?

1095
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,720
Father!

1096
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:12,040
I can say whatever I want to say!

1097
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,540
And there's nothing to brag about you!

1098
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,540
Things like girls lined up for me,

1099
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:20,180
and how I'm the best husband material.

1100
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,580
What's wrong with him?

1101
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,180
I don't know.

1102
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,240
When did he get so cocky?

1103
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,220
Ugh! Stop smiling! Man...

1104
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:39,740
Mom, don't blurt random things out.

1105
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,190
Don't brag about me there.

1106
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:45,180
Don't say things like how smart I am,

1107
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:49,990
how I was a teacher, and how doctors lined  up for me. Don't, okay?

1108
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,750
There's nothing to brag about you.

1109
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,020
Let's go, Miss Unemployed.

1110
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,380
The phone has been turned off,

1111
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,350
so you will be directed to voice mail.

1112
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,420
Mother, where's Sedal?

1113
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,910
His phone's been off for a while.

1114
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,280
You must know, don't you?

1115
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,320
I know you're in contact with him.

1116
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,080
I'm not.

1117
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:41,720
I haven't been able to reach him.

1118
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:43,850
I'm busy. I have to go.

1119
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,220
Sedal's driving me crazy!

1120
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,790
Why did he cheat on Hobak?

1121
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:06,540
- Wow!
- Wow!

1122
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:10,990
- Wow!
- Wow!

1123
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:13,910
Huh?

1124
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,240
It's dad.

1125
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,450
Dad!

1126
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,080
- Dad!
- Dad!

1127
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:19,810
Dad!

1128
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,410
Dad!

1129
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,290
Dad!

1130
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,790
Dad!

1131
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,050
Dad!

1132
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:29,490
What's wrong?

1133
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,040
It's dad.

1134
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:32,780
- What is it?
- I saw dad.

1135
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,850
Dad looked like a homeless man.

1136
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,150
What?

1137
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,880
He looked like a beggar!

1138
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,580
He probably just looked like your dad.

1139
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:49,490
Right, our dad's not a beggar.

1140
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,390
Let's go.

1141
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,150
This is for you, and this is for you.

1142
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:55,380
Yay! How nice!

1143
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,150
- You like it?
- Yes.

1144
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,110
Let's go.

1145
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,350
Oh, your hands are cold!

1146
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,750
- So warm! 
- Wow!

1147

1148
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,220
Women lined up to meet him.

1149
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:35,020
Then why didn't you get someone from there?

1150
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:37,120
Why are you interested in my daughter?

1151
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:38,520
The bed sheet looks a bit...

1152
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:40,150
I changed it just now.

1153
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:42,740
Just do as I say.
Don't talk back to me.

1154
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,420
You were the happiest to hear of the divorce.

1155
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,910
I just can't understand you.

1156
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,450
Why aren't you moving out?

1157
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:51,020
I'll be watching you!

1158
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:53,690
Have a nice life!

1159
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,410
What's wrong with my daughter?

1160
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,910
She's really rude.

1161
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,240
What's so great about your son?

1162
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:02,050
You didn't just say that!
