00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,630
Swallowtail butterfly, fly!

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,530
Gi Bum, I wonder what that singer,
Kim Hong Gook, is doing these days.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,690
I'm sure he's living well.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,590
Hey, Sir. Who are you?

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,940
Who are you? Why are you
standing in front of my office?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,500
- Hey, over there. Geez.
- Geez.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,390
What the heck...

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,120
Have you been well?

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,520
Didn't you miss me?

11
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,790
<i>Honey, what was that noise?</i>

12
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,730
- Gi Bum!
- Ah!

13
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,010
What happened?

14
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,290
Gi Bum!

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,950
Geez! Get up!

16
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,300
What's wrong with them today?

17
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,670
- My goodness!
- How much did you drink?

18
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,250
- Geez.
- Go this way.

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,520
You drank too much!
Wake up, please!

20
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,740
No!

21
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,150
Go! Go!

22
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,420
Oh my--

23
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,040
See you again soon...

24
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,870
<i>[Episode 10]</i>
My goodness...

25
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,260
I can't believe you.
Drink this, wake up.

26
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,960
Okay.

27
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,700
"Swallowtail Butterfly"?
That's an old song.

28
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,090
Change up your repertoire
and stop getting wasted.

29
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,000
You're not young anymore.
Think about your age.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,800
Well... Honey.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,760
You didn't see anyone
last night, did you?

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,000
Who?

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,770
Well... that is... I mean...

34
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,950
Geez, never mind.

35
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,190
Finish what you were going to say.

36
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,940
- Did you see a ghost?
- Don't say that!

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,820
What? You're the one who brought it up!

38
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,800
Sorry. I must have been so drunk
that I was being delusional.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,440
You must be proud.

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, by the way...

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,500
What did you decide about the audition?

42
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,130
You won't audition, right?

43
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,890
I'm going to submit my application today.

44
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,590
Are you really going to do that?

45
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,110
It'll be trouble,
whether you get it or not.

46
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,120
Why do you insist on doing it?

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,450
Honey, just know that I have
a good reason to do this.

48
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,930
Can't you just try to understand me?

49
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,340
Tell me what your reason is, then!

50
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,060
What's your reason for being so stubborn?

51
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,690
That's... I mean...

52
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,690
It's my dream! I want a new life!

53
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,000
What? Married women aren't allowed
to challenge themselves?

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,190
Anyway, I'm auditioning, no matter what.

55
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,850
If you can't support me,
then just don't try to ruin it.

56
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,140
Geez! I'm going to die
from running! Geez!

57
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,440
Man!

58
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,880
Oh, my head...

59
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,520
<i>Your snoring was awful!
You have awful manners!</i>

60
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,350
<i>Eat before you leave!</i>

61
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,930
Wow.

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,500
What? He slept at their house?

63
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,090
It looks like he got drunk
last night and called Do Kyung.

64
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,890
I bet that fox called him first.

65
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,920
He's an idiot.

66
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,580
I warned him so many times,
but he doesn't listen.

67
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,730
- Stop them all.
- Huh?

68
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,450
You don't get it?
Void all of his credit cards.

69
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,300
Come this way.

70
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,690
Are you treating us today?

71
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,120
Wait, wait!

72
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,990
Why are you buying us dinner?

73
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,920
I imposed on you guys
last night, big time.

74
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,700
Hyun Jee, you couldn't even sleep well
last night because of me.

75
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,780
You annoyed me to death!
Is there a motor running in your nose?

76
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,830
I'm sorry. I won't do that next time.

77
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,570
What is this? Who said that
there will be a next time?

78
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,530
I'm just saying.

79
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,800
What should we order?

80
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,750
- I already ordered.
- Ordered what?

81
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,300
I told them to bring out
the most expensive dishes here.

82
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,600
Did I do well?

83
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,160
Here.

84
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,910
You ladies, don't get your hands dirty.
You just eat.

85
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,500
I'll get the meat out for you.

86
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,740
So, how's it going with the score?

87
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,390
It's going okay.

88
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,500
By the way, if your mom gets the role,
we'll be a movie family!

89
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,500
A beautiful actress
and the youngest film composer!

90
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,290
Don't get ahead of yourself.

91
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,690
I'm so excited that I'm proud
even just thinking about it.

92
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,160
Waiter! Wine, please!

93
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,320
Bring the most expensive one
you have, of course.

94
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,690
What? The card is not working?

95
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,800
Well, that must be a mistake.

96
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,310
Please try this one then.

97
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,660
This one is also not working.

98
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,400
Why don't they work?

99
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,890
Please put it on this.

100
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,830
The total is 650,000 won.

101
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,440
Is he home already?

102
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,890
Gi Bum and I bought drinks
from the convenience store...

103
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,130
And then we were going to the office,
singing "Swallowtail Butterfly".

104
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,010
From this side...

105
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,800
Have you been well?

106
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,360
Didn't you miss me, the two of you?

107
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,100
- What are you doing?
- My goodness!

108
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,250
Why are you scared?
I'm the one who should be scared.

109
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,930
What's your problem?

110
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,050
Geez, my dad voided
all of my credit cards.

111
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,690
I was completely humiliated when I took
Do Kyung and Hyun Jee out to dinner.

112
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,600
I see... by the way.

113
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,290
Gi Bum... you know...

114
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,100
Last night, here.

115
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,190
Didn't you see something too?

116
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,550
See what?

117
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,300
I think...

118
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,570
I saw Mr. Son.

119
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,000
I see him every day.

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,120
What?

121
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,480
He shows up in my dreams every night.
I'm about to go crazy.

122
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,700
I've been sleeping with
my lights on, since that night.

123
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,500
Geez!

124
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,710
What? Who is here?

125
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,050
Mr. Yoon!

126
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,450
What the heck is going on?

127
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,760
I don't know.
I almost fainted when I saw him.

128
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,370
Go talk to him. You go.

129
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,030
Geez...

130
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,490
Why is a dead man still walking?

131
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,100
How have you been?

132
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,040
Ah...

133
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,460
Oh, Tae Soo!

134
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,940
What a relief!

135
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,090
I knew this day would come,
just like the shaman said.

136
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,310
Well, Mr. Son.

137
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,660
What's going on?

138
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,850
What do you mean?

139
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,180
I came to say hello, of course.

140
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,590
My mother told me
how great you were to her.

141
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,900
She told me to come and thank you.

142
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,370
Of course, it's my duty to come here
and say hello to you, Mr. Yoon.

143
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,750
Mr. Son, you have good manners!

144
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,200
Oh, you are being so kind!
You are so sweet.

145
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,190
Ma'am, should I give you
a piggy back ride?

146
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,080
No! Don't do that!

147
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,560
Please get on my back.

148
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,810
How do you like it?

149
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,790
I love it!

150
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,070
It's great! As if a dead son
came back to life!

151
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,380
- Come on out!
- Come on out!

152
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,750
- Let's play!
- Let's play!

153
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,200
Come on out! Let's play!

154
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,910
What's going on?

155
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,440
Shaman from Miari?

156
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,090
It's me, Lee Choon Boon.

157
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,260
Your son brought red ginseng for me!

158
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:53,950
I was sad when you left
like that last time.

159
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,040
You can sleep well from now on!

160
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,370
I'm so happy for you!

161
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,080
How long has it been since
we last sat together like this?

162
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,390
Oh, it was at my movie production office.
We were having some coffee.

163
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,230
You said, "Let's go drink more!"

164
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,250
This is the first time since then, right?

165
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,420
Oh, yes.

166
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,990
Well... anyway, what happened to you?

167
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,120
Let's get to that later.

168
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:30,470
I came here out of the blue,
not only because my mother asked me to.

169
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,100
I came here to say my farewells.

170
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,390
Farewells?

171
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,980
I'm sure that you have found out
what kind of person I was.

172
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:47,230
I'm in no position to be
raising my head around you.

173
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,080
I'm sorry for losing
all of your investment money.

174
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,760
What? You spent all of it?

175
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,470
Every penny of it?

176
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,800
No...

177
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,390
Everyone thought you were dead.

178
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,690
Can you please tell us
what really happened?

179
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,870
A person's life depends on God.

180
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,030
I am alive!

181
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,660
That's what I'm saying.
So what happened--

182
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,430
You... This is the first time
I've met you, right?

183
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,860
Yes, this is the first time
that we've met in person...

184
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,180
Wow...

185
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,360
Wow... you are really beautiful.

186
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,680
My mother couldn't have said enough...

187
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,260
about your kind heart.

188
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,060
She said that she wasn't jealous
about her friend's son.

189
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,950
But she was very jealous
about her daughter-in-law.

190
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,010
Oh... please...

191
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:02,390
Anyway, I am really sorry
and really thankful to both of you.

192
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,420
Mr. Son--

193
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,320
Toast! Let's toast!

194
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,750
Oh, that one is empty.

195
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,310
Please.

196
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,150
Drink it.

197
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,740
Okay... please.

198
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,510
Mr. Yoon.

199
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,410
I hope you make a great movie
and become a successful film investor.

200
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,330
I'll get going now.

201
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,250
Now? Already?

202
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,390
You should tell us what
really happened before you go.

203
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,910
Yes, tell us everything.

204
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,880
I have a lot to do
before I leave for good.

205
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,500
I am a thorough person.

206
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,830
So, I prepare very
thoroughly for everything.

207
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,920
Anyway, I owe you a lot.

208
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,730
Please wait!

209
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,290
Let me go with you.

210
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,250
I'll call you a taxi.

211
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,940
Oh my...

212
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,410
Geez.

213
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,180
- Did he leave?
- Yeah, I got him a taxi.

214
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,050
Geez. It feels like
a ghost is fooling us.

215
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,120
Was that really Mr. Son?

216
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,240
He's definitely not a ghost.

217
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,770
But he's scarier than a ghost!

218
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,250
How did he come back alive?

219
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,480
Does he know what we did to him or not?

220
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,670
There's no way to know,
since he wouldn't talk!

221
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,810
That's what I'm saying.

222
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,950
Wait. If you think about it,
isn't this a good thing?

223
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,720
Huh?

224
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,110
Think about it.

225
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,630
We thought he was dead. But he's alive!

226
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,180
Then, what we buried was not a dead body.

227
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,690
That means Gi Bum didn't kill anyone.

228
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,130
Isn't this a good thing for everyone?

229
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,090
That's true, but...

230
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,290
But what we did was still bad.

231
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,750
Of course I know that.

232
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,510
We can try to only do good things
from now on, to repent for our sins.

233
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,880
I'm definitely happy about this,
in terms of our kids.

234
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,410
I was so scared that we would
ruin their lives by being criminals.

235
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,120
Geez, what the heck is going on?

236
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,790
K, it's time for me to let you go.

237
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,420
What do you mean, Nana?

238
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,190
I think the boss has found out about us.

239
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,760
You could die without anyone knowing.

240
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,360
If you left, I would be like
a dead man anyway.

241
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,010
No matter what, I will never leave you--

242
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,450
Not this. Not this.

243
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,510
This part is not realistic at all.

244
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,510
Huh?

245
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,340
His life is at risk.

246
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,670
He can't just be all about
romance in this situation.

247
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,020
As a human, he has to go
through emotional struggles!

248
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,290
This is how people act
when they are in love!

249
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,160
And that's K's real charm.

250
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,990
Just like you and me.

251
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,000
You're a piece of garbage!

252
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,140
Why do you make it so hard on me?

253
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,800
Please save me!
I don't deserve to live!

254
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,390
Oh. Mr. Chairman, you're here.

255
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,910
Go on, go on! Wow!

256
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,380
I was just going to leave
this here and rush out.

257
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,500
But it was so fun to watch.

258
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,400
Mr. Chairman, I have a favor to ask.

259
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,440
What is it? Tell me, tell me.

260
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,650
When you barge in like that
while we're focused on the scene

261
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,110
it makes Director Bong a little upset.

262
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,870
Is that true, Director Bong?

263
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,380
Well... it's not that... but yes.

264
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,880
I'm sorry, Director Bong.

265
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,350
I won't barge in like that anymore.

266
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:04,360
I'll head out to the orchard.
Then the house will be really quiet.

267
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,220
So don't worry, okay?

268
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,200
Thank you.

269
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,800
Why did you use me for your excuse?

270
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,320
I did that because you're so scared
of the chairman! You're so nervous!

271
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:25,030
Let's get into the story. Relax, okay?

272
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,120
What? Mr. Son came to see you?

273
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,070
That's nonsense.

274
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,910
He even brought red ginseng for my mom,
and he gave her a piggyback ride too!

275
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,510
Are you being haunted by
a ghost or something?

276
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,610
You're rambling nonsense.

277
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,510
Director Baek Gi Bum.

278
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,820
Long time, no see.

279
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,660
That feels good.

280
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,790
Nice!

281
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,150
I feel rejuvenated!

282
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,190
You... you are...

283
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,610
If you are a human, stay!
If you are a ghost, get lost!

284
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,220
I am a human.

285
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,040
Get lost! Get lost!

286
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,140
What are you doing?
You're waving dust in my face.

287
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,090
Mr. Yoon...

288
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,500
I saw you yesterday.

289
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,670
Now I see you again.

290
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,220
We run into each other quite often.

291
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,480
Mr. Son... why are you here?

292
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,840
I have something to resolve
with the owner of this room.

293
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,170
Huh?

294
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,900
Isn't that right, Director Baek?

295
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,460
This is bullshit. You are dead!

296
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,870
Yes, you are right.

297
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,650
I returned, alive,
from the gates of Hell.

298
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,970
I ran through the death hills
and crossed the Jordan River.

299
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,950
I walked through the narrow tracks.

300
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,450
And finally I stood in front of
the King of the Underworld!

301
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,960
Ah!

302
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,850
I felt so wronged.

303
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,320
So I said

304
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,690
"Oh, King of the Underworld!"

305
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,810
"I can't die like this!"

306
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:47,310
And then he told me to bring to him,
the most wicked man in the world.

307
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,950
Are you talking about... me?

308
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,370
<i>Director Baek! This is Officer Seo.</i>

309
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,320
<i>I'm going to come in.</i>

310
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,240
I said, freeze!

311
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,450
Is that what you're doing?

312
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,550
Why were you standing like that?

313
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,450
What brings you here, Bro?

314
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,950
Oh! Well...

315
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,330
We heard that Mr. Son
appeared in Daejeon.

316
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,460
Someone saw him going into this building.

317
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,390
So I stopped by Tae Soo's office,
and then I came here.

318
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,670
Have you seen Mr. Son?

319
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,060
- Huh?
- Huh? We have no idea.

320
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,520
Since he contacted you,
you should wait for him.

321
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,950
Why are you running around
impatiently, looking for him?

322
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,180
Running around impatiently?

323
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,060
I bear the lightest responsibility
among my peers.

324
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,410
The other guys are now higher ranks
and shoulder a fair burden.

325
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,250
Whereas the lightest wind
could carry me away.

326
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,430
My nickname is Cotton.

327
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:05,020
My peers are moving up the ranks
at the speed of a bullet train.

328
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,560
But I'm on the slowest train.

329
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,000
Stopping at every station...
taking forever to get anywhere.

330
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,370
My life is like a slow motion picture.

331
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,250
That's why I'm impatient.

332
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,680
I want to catch him
so I can be promoted!

333
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,950
What's wrong?

334
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,920
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

335
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,650
- Are you hiding something?
- Ha!

336
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,650
Ha.

337
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,460
- Hiding what?
- Hiding?

338
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,700
You're talking nonsense.

339
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,350
You guys look extremely
nervous right now.

340
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,550
What is it?

341
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,760
Hey, the chairman is about to be here.

342
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,560
You should leave before
he sees you and gets upset.

343
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,400
- He's coming here?
- Yes.

344
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,470
- Then I should go.
- Yeah!

345
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,260
Geez, why are you so
obsessed with Mr. Son?

346
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,680
There are so many criminals in the world.

347
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,930
He was going to turn himself in
and tell me who tried to kill him.

348
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,010
He said that there was evidence.

349
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,410
Kill two birds with one stone!
Buy one, get one free.

350
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,140
Just wait and see.
Everything will be revealed soon enough!

351
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,530
Go! Get home safely!

352
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,430
Geez!

353
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,000
Bastard!

354
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,810
What? You want to kill me again?

355
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,920
Go ahead.

356
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,030
You think I came into
a tiger's den without a plan?

357
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,180
I didn't kill you. You tripped
on your own and killed yourself!

358
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,610
Please.

359
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,550
Who drove me to that point? Huh?

360
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,300
Oh, I should ask that detective.

361
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,880
Officer?

362
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,700
What is it that you want from me?

363
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,260
Sir?

364
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,300
One billion won.

365
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,700
What?

366
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,010
You blew my three billion won!

367
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,020
He should be still close. Officer!

368
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,120
Why are you doing this?

369
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,850
Do you really have to do this?

370
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,760
You gangsters.

371
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,900
You can't do anything for a man
who came back from the dead?

372
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,790
What will happen if I tell
the police everything?

373
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,530
You will rot in prison!

374
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,660
You'll get even heavier punishment
because you're gangsters!

375
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,050
First, you should thank me for
coming back alive, bastards!

376
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,750
Did you forget that I am
your high school senior?

377
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,970
Attention.

378
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,950
Let's talk about our business.

379
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,200
If you give me that money,
I will disappear quietly.

380
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,960
I don't like drama.

381
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,640
I enjoy meditating.

382
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,140
I listen to classical music a lot.

383
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,590
Anyway, Mr. Yoon,
you're involved in this too.

384
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:22,080
So you should guide him well, so that
he doesn't think of anything foolish.

385
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,210
Okay.

386
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,080
Get it done by tomorrow.

387
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,330
By tomorrow.

388
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,370
What? Really?

389
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,480
Thank you! I love you!

390
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,200
You are the best director in Korea!

391
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,670
I'll never forget what
you've done for me!

392
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,910
Wow! Listen!

393
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,850
Director William said he would
be a judge for the audition!

394
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,300
Really? Really?
Oh, my!

395
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,610
Everyone looked down on our movie
because it's being funded by a gang!

396
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,380
But this will bring so many actors!

397
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,760
High-quality actors!

398
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,620
That's right! High-quality!

399
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,960
What are you doing right now?

400
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,260
What are you doing?

401
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,620
What? They say joy is halved
when you share it.

402
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,530
- You mean doubled?
- That's about the same.

403
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,160
Big news!

404
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,840
Will... Will... Will...

405
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,850
What's wrong?

406
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,700
Director William is coming!

407
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,790
What do you mean?

408
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,190
Director William is going to be a special
guest judge for the upcoming audition.

409
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,500
William? Who's that?

410
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,670
You know, the man who directed
"Kind Ms. Taeng Ja".

411
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,920
And "Gold Boy".

412
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,710
- Director An Byuk Nam.
- Really? That's him?

413
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,060
He's going to Hollywood and will
become famous internationally.

414
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,110
So he needs an English name.

415
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,940
The name, An Byuk Nam,
isn't very Hollywood.

416
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,920
I heard that he's handsome,
and he has good manners.

417
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,730
He's even a great singer!

418
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,590
It'll be an honor to just audition.

419
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,130
How could people like us ever stand
in front of Director William?

420
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,880
Madam Oh! No, I mean Writer Oh.

421
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,500
Writer Oh.

422
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,170
Thank you so much.

423
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,800
It's my honor!

424
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,720
I was going to break the news later.

425
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,590
Anyway, you should prepare well
for your auditions, okay?

426
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,900
Everyone, give her a round of applause!

427
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,350
Excuse me.

428
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,750
This is on the house.

429
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,240
What's up with you?

430
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,280
As you can see, I'm working.

431
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,550
Are you working part-time?

432
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,310
Yes, I am.

433
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,900
Don't tell my mom.

434
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,500
Sung Min, you're here.

435
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,840
Hello.

436
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,810
I heard you guys are
making music for a movie.

437
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,070
I'm planning on having
a small holiday concert here.

438
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,510
Do you want to join in?

439
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,430
Holiday concert?

440
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,220
I haven't finished arranging this yet.

441
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,050
You should hurry up.

442
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,640
Ma'am, he's already excited.

443
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,210
He'll do it.

444
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,070
I look forward to it.

445
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,040
Hey! Why do you always drop bombs on me?

446
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,810
Last time it was a film score,
now it's a holiday concert?

447
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,440
What's next?

448
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,230
Go on a date?

449
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,500
I just spent a half of our monthly
living expenses because of you!

450
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,930
A first impression is really important.

451
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,350
How can you audition when
you have no decent clothes?

452
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,240
I'll totally transform you! Wait and see.

453
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,990
Sister, sister! We forgot
to buy this. Eye shadow!

454
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,130
- Eye shadow?
- Yes.

455
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,640
I said I would use what I have.

456
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,320
Your eyes need to pop!
Good eye shadow is a must!

457
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,920
This color is perfect for you.

458
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,090
Well, use what you
already have. You're poor.

459
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,840
Yes, let's get going.
Sung Min should be home soon.

460
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,480
Hurry up!

461
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,090
I'm out of breath.

462
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,710
What's up with that hand?

463
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,090
What is it? We even kissed!

464
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,350
Stop talking nonsense.

465
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,040
About earlier...

466
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,070
Because my mom was there,
I was trying to not get caught.

467
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,260
You...

468
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,640
Do you know what
the next step on a date is?

469
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,200
What is it?

470
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,730
You have to show me
something amazing and wonderful.

471
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,280
I look forward to your
Christmas gift for me.

472
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,420
Oh, what should we do next?

473
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,030
Hey, wait for me.

474
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,340
I just received the list
of audition applicants.

475
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,970
Many members of One Heart applied.

476
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:15,570
I won't be greedy.
I applied for a very small role.

477
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,230
I know myself, so I didn't even try.

478
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,130
Then you should usher people
on the day of the audition, Sun Young.

479
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,650
Yes, Ma'am.

480
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:30,270
Everyone here was aware of her own
capabilities and made wise choices.

481
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,340
Except for one.

482
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,920
She has no acting experience.

483
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:41,590
But she aimed very high!

484
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,750
There are no qualifications required.

485
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,970
It's true I'm auditioning for Mee Mee.

486
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,750
If I'm good, I'll get it.
If I'm bad, I won't get it.

487
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,630
I don't even know why I have
to defend myself about this.

488
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:05,290
That's just it. You feel the need to be
defensive because something isn't right.

489
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,030
Well, for example...

490
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,250
Your intention of taking advantage
of your husband's position?

491
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,870
Take advantage of my husband?

492
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,030
I have no intention of doing that.
I just want to play fairly--

493
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,750
The chairman said this.

494
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,010
No outside influences on casting.

495
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,890
Keep it fair and square.

496
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,980
That's how this movie can succeed.

497
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,740
And that's what he wants.

498
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:39,590
But you are going against
his grand vision.

499
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,440
You are a housekeeper
with no acting experience.

500
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,630
Simply relying on your husband,
you applied for a major supporting role.

501
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,080
Does that make sense?

502
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,930
Lady! How can you say that?

503
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,560
Hey!

504
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,160
My sister won a lot of awards
for acting back in her school days.

505
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,320
And she was always a star
in Christmas plays at church!

506
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,140
And she has good looks.

507
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,410
She has a clear loud voice!

508
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,510
She's not like what you think, lady!

509
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,770
And she's not a selfish woman
who takes advantage of her husband!

510
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,450
Hey, are you crazy?

511
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,060
This lady pissed me off!

512
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,570
Ma'am, are you okay?

513
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,160
- Oh, no!
- Oh!

514
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,800
Come with me!

515
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,100
Get out!

516
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,520
Don't live your life like that!

517
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,620
Come with me!

518
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,980
Wait! What was that just now?

519
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,680
Have I just been terrorized?

520
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,710
Do you have any sedatives?

521
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,160
Call 911!

522
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,100
Sis... are you upset?

523
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,460
Sis...

524
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,700
Are you crazy?

525
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,500
How dare you speak to her that way?

526
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,030
How could I, your sister, just watch
you being treated that way?

527
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,770
What's wrong with you?

528
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,030
Who is that fox? Why can't
you say one word back to her?

529
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,350
She's the chairman's woman.

530
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,700
What?

531
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,200
She's also the screenwriter,
and a judge for the audition.

532
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,280
Do you think I'm doing this
because I want to be in a movie?

533
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,420
Our house depends on it.

534
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,730
We could lose the house because of you!

535
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,130
What? What does that mean?

536
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,060
Never mind. You didn't hear anything.

537
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,970
What is it? Just tell me.

538
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,620
I said never mind!

539
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,950
I should ask Tae Soo.

540
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,040
Hey!

541
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,690
Don't even think about it.

542
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,380
So you should tell me.

543
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,520
Geez.

544
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,590
You know the chairman owns this house.

545
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,340
And you know he hates Do Kyung.

546
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,070
He said he would give us the house
if I beat Do Kyung and get the role.

547
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,160
Really?

548
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Tae Soo doesn't know.
You must not tell him!

549
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,600
We have no time to kill. Let's go.

550
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,770
Where?

551
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,000
I know an amazing acting coach.

552
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,240
I arranged a lesson for me,
but you take it.

553
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,820
From now on, I'll help you.

554
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,680
- Geez.
- Let's go.

555
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,830
Where are you going? Hey, hey!

556
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,740
My goodness.

557
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,700
Are you feeling better now?

558
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,560
That was so awful...

559
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,710
I guess I got worked up
because I felt humiliated.

560
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,050
That's what I'm saying.

561
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,490
I was totally baffled.

562
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,970
Why did she bring her sister here?

563
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,150
It's better this way.

564
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:31,440
Because of today's occurrence,
I'm more convinced of my idea than ever.

565
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,000
What do you mean by that?

566
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,500
Mee Mee, the cafe owner,
is a spirited, mysterious character.

567
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,390
A blatant, rude tiring woman like Eun Ok

568
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:47,090
can't be an inspiration of my writing!

569
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,870
Do Kyung.

570
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:54,590
For the sake of our movie,
please win Mee Mee's role.

571
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,030
You know, Do Kyung...

572
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,730
I adore you, not only as an actress,
but as someone on my side.

573
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,080
And I totally support you.

574
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,970
To be honest, I am a bit confused.

575
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:14,590
You're such an amazing supporter of mine.

576
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,350
But the chairman is trying
to cut me off from Gi Bum.

577
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,590
He even voided all of his credit cards.

578
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,660
He voided Director Baek's credit cards?

579
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,610
He treated me to an expensive dinner
but I ended up paying for it!

580
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,840
Oh, my!

581
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:34,780
Gi Bum is trying so hard to
get back together with me.

582
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,990
I'm not know if I can
endure this for much longer.

583
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:45,440
There are people who are incapable.

584
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,500
There are people who are careless.

585
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:55,470
There are people who make mistakes.

586
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,550
There are people like that.

587
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,460
But my people can't be like that.

588
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,420
Why did you lie?

589
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,340
Pardon me?

590
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,440
You said you have no acting experience.

591
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,080
That's the truth.

592
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,580
I don't usually praise people.

593
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,350
But I can't help
but praise you, Kim Eun Ok.

594
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,890
You are really amazing.

595
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:40,600
I swear, on my name, that you
can go to Hollywood right now.

596
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,310
Sister!

597
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,480
He said I'm good!

598
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,330
Did you order a taxi?

599
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,970
Yes, I called you last night
from my house too.

600
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,650
Do you remember me?

601
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,130
Yes, I do remember your face.

602
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,780
Then, please take me where you
dropped off my guest last night.

603
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,080
Well, Attorney Kim?

604
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,820
The stocks and the land are in my name.
But why can't I sell them?

605
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,620
<i>It can't be done unless
the chairman allows it.</i>

606
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,050
I'm sure there's a way.

607
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,760
Attorney Kim.

608
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,710
You've worked for my father so far,
but soon you'll be working for me.

609
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,790
Try to be flexible.

610
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,750
<i>Then... should I talk to the chairman?</i>

611
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,660
Forget it, forget it.

612
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,000
What was so urgent, that you
wanted to see me right away?

613
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,860
Madam Oh, please sit down first.

614
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,050
Would you like some tea?

615
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,880
No, thank you.

616
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,740
I have been thinking...

617
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,790
It's time for you
and my father to get married.

618
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,730
Surely, and definitely!

619
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,690
You're a capricious man.

620
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,590
I'm not sure whether I should
take your words literally or not.

621
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,400
Of course you should.

622
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:24,170
If you help me this time around,
I'll make that happen right away.

623
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,250
What is it?

624
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,970
Get me one billion won.

625
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:36,080
Do you need that kind of money
because your cards were canceled?

626
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,400
How do you know that?

627
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,070
I heard that from Do Kyung.

628
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:43,500
We're pretty close like that.

629
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,350
Perhaps... you're planning on
moving into your own place?

630
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,590
Don't ask too many questions.

631
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,810
Just do something about my father.

632
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:56,760
If he doesn't let his own son
touch his money, then how can I?

633
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:02,390
If I were legally married to him,
this could be really easy.

634
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:08,110
I wish I could help you, but I can't.

635
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,480
Hi, Tae Soo.

636
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,060
What?

637
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,540
Oh, Tae Soo.

638
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,130
I felt unsure, so I did some digging.
Look what I found.

639
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,680
It seems like he came back
with a deliberate purpose.

640
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,390
What the heck is he?

641
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,970
He's a swindler and a gambler.

642
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,080
He's no Average Joe.

643
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,420
Geez!

644
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,170
We should have taken
care of him yesterday!

645
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,640
Who is this?

646
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,190
<i>Hey, you gangster bastards!</i>

647
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:11,030
<i>Why did you break into my room?</i>

648
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,240
<i>What the heck are you up to?
Where are you?</i>

649
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,720
Where am I?

650
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,420
Where am I?

651
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,610
I'm inside your heart.

652
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,710
What?

653
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,940
<i>I was going to leave with
the money, nice and quiet.</i>

654
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,710
But you're making it difficult for me.

655
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,860
Double double.

656
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,230
- What?
- <i>You don't know double double?</i>

657
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,750
I want twice as much.

658
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,510
If you don't send me
two billion won by tomorrow

659
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,130
I'll send those pictures to Lee Do Kyung.

660
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,510
Via a quick delivery service!

661
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,910
No! You can't do that!

662
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,500
I don't want to do that either.
So don't overreact.

663
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,540
<i>You should get back
together with her soon.</i>

664
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,300
<i>Think about your daughter.</i>

665
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,580
Anyway, enough of that.
Put Mr. Yoon on the phone.

666
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:06,030
Well... Mr. Son.
Do you really have to do this?

667
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,420
Tae Soo, I know you're totally broke.

668
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,090
<i>So you should talk to Gi Bum,
and you guys should work as a team.</i>

669
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,710
Finish it quickly and cleanly, okay?

670
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,760
Oh, my phone is about to die!
It's shutting off!

671
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,770
My Bal Gwang High alumni, go, go!

672
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,300
Geez!

673
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:32,980
Bastard! Crazy bastard!

674
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,990
Really? You got praised for your acting?

675
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,250
It's true.

676
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,030
He's really picky and particular.

677
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,950
But he praised her after her first scene!
She really has potential!

678
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,350
Really? Am I supposed to believe that?

679
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,000
I said it's true!

680
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,050
Are you sure he isn't full of hot air
and fooling your family?

681
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,750
Don't think that way, Ma'am.

682
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,990
Imagine that your daughter-in-law
was an actress.

683
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:03,190
More money and new cosmetics for you!
That would be wonderful!

684
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,340
Really?

685
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,650
Then could we have
drumsticks every night?

686
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,830
That's not all.

687
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:12,090
You said your friends were jealous
of your dad being a movie investor.

688
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,090
Imagine your mom was an actress.

689
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:17,820
Mom... becomes an actress?

690
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,120
<i>[Korea's actress, Kim Eun Ok,
goes to Cannes.]</i>

691
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,600
This is for you.

692
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,430
Ta-da.

693
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,960
What is it?
Taffy?

694
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,560
Yes, so you can score the audition!

695
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,810
I wanted to get you a rice cake,
but I have no money.

696
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:50,820
If you become an actress,
give me lots of money, please!

697
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,850
Lady, just eat the taffy and shut up.

698
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:59,240
From now on, I'll take care of the house!

699
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,050
You just focus on acting!

700
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,150
Mother, I haven't been picked yet.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

701
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,250
It's time to give a massage
to our actress, Kim Eun Ok!

702
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,930
Don't call me that yet.
I'm embarrassed.

703
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:14,800
What's wrong with it?
I'm calling you that from now on.

704
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,960
Get used to it.

705
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,630
That's right! Actress Kim!

706
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,130
- Actress Mom!
- Actress Mom!

707
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,090
Yes, Actress Kim!

708
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,940
Don't say that!
You're making me blush.

709
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,180
I'm shy.

710
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,360
I don't even have 20,000 won.
But two billion won? Geez!

711
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,170
I thought about it. This isn't
something he can do by himself.

712
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,490
There is something else.

713
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,250
He said he has the
"King of the Underworld" on his side.

714
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,940
Stop messing around.

715
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,720
It's all your fault.

716
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,600
You are the one who
proposed the movie business.

717
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,040
That doesn't matter now.

718
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,320
Could it be...

719
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,780
He already sent the pictures to Do Kyung?

720
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,550
Do Kyung, it's me.

721
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,440
Is everything okay?

722
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,730
Yes, everything's fine.

723
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:18,710
Okay. If anything happens,
call me right away.

724
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:21,230
Okay. I'm busy now. Hang up.

725
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,670
Good luck with your audition.

726
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,860
Thanks.

727
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:33,530
Well... how was my acting?

728
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,050
I don't usually praise people.

729
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:41,500
But I can't help
but praise you, Lee Do Kyung.

730
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,590
You are really amazing!

731
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:54,450
I swear, on my name, that you
can go to Hollywood right now.

732
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,520
You're much better than I am.

733
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,820
How so?

734
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,370
You know what...

735
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,790
I couldn't wish my wife
good luck with her audition.

736
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:11,710
You don't need to say that when you
live with her. She must already know.

737
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,190
Is that so?

738
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,480
Why do you guys look so down?

739
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,500
You scared me! Geez!

740
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,920
Don't ask me what brought me here.

741
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,450
I'm a regular here.

742
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,450
Then go over there and drink.

743
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:33,710
I came alone. Can I join you guys?

744
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:35,380
It's on me.

745
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,000
What's gotten into you?

746
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,780
What? I can buy you drinks too.

747
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:48,630
Judging by the look on your face,
there must be a problem.

748
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,100
Drink over there, will you?

749
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:56,160
I know. Sometimes, in life,
unexplainable things happen.

750
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,710
Geez, it's so hard to live in this world.

751
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:02,710
That's what I'm saying.

752
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:06,110
But what can you do?
That's how people live.

753
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,890
Life is like that. When you're
unlucky, nothing works out.

754
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,370
Things only get worse.

755
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,130
Excuse me! Please make way!

756
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,840
Please get out of the way!

757
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,130
Please, no photography! No pictures!

758
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,940
Have they never seen
a celebrity? So tacky.

759
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,830
No pictures! Give me that camera!

760
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:00,220
Oh my goodness!
Are you the Kyung Mee that I know?

761
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,630
The Kyung Mee you know died yesterday.

762
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:07,110
Please cheer on the new Kyung Mee!

763
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,430
Manager Chang, let's go.

764
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:10,730
Yes, Ma'am.

765
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,320
Can you see well?

766
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,600
Yes!

767
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,170
Get out of the way! You!

768
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,070
No pictures! Get out of the way!

769
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:22,000
Did she pour hot sauce all over her?
What's all that?

770
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,760
By the way, Honey.

771
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,530
Why aren't Mr. Yoon
and Mr. Baek here yet?

772
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,540
They made all of you do the dirty work.

773
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,530
They said that they were
going somewhere on business.

774
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,350
They're really busy these days.

775
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,590
Oh!

776
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,600
You're crazy!

777
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,560
Welcome to the open audition
for The Man Of Two Faces

778
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,690
the very first film by
Choong Shim Pictures.

779
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,620
First, let me introduce
our special guest judges.

780
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:08,280
Korea's pride! Asia's star, who has
been discovered by Hollywood as well!

781
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,890
Please welcome Director William!

782
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,550
Welcome him with a round of applause.

783
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,820
Byuk Nam! Bro!

784
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,800
Thank you! I love you.

785
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,080
My baby, baby. Baby. Baby.

786
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,670
What's with the hair and the clothes?

787
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:55,150
Excuse me. I'm Oh Joo Ran,
the screenwriter.

788
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,050
Do you want one? She's funny.

789
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,370
Let's get started.
I'm not sober yet.

790
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:07,400
Applicants in Group One,
please come forward.

791
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,840
Why did you put a hold on my properties?

792
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,440
Call Attorney Kim, please?

793
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,040
Dad, please! Please?

794
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,260
Why do you need one billion won?

795
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,380
It's not easy to find
investors for the movie.

796
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,630
The money we have now
can afford us one actor.

797
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:38,060
The audition has begun.
We need more fuel, now! More fuel!

798
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,020
Tae Soo is the new captain.

799
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,000
Whatever it is, you stay out of it.

800
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,190
I know you're doing this
because of Do Kyung.

801
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,500
No matter what,
I won't back down on that.

802
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,690
You fox!

803
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,230
You are the disaster in my life!

804
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,270
That was a disaster.

805
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,380
You're a tsunami and a nuclear bomb!

806
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,740
Yes, you are.

807
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,700
I'll reveal your dirtiest secrets!

808
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,430
I'll crush you before you can do that!

809
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:12,100
All I can hear is your beating heart.

810
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,750
All I can see is your lips...

811
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,040
That was the man's line.

812
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,090
I'll do it again.

813
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,510
Pass.

814
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,690
What just happened?

815
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,790
Does anyone have any special talents?

816
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,370
- Me!
- You.

817
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,500
Oh, Gi Bum! How did it go?

818
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,820
He won't budge. He's determined
to control my life with his money.

819
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,060
Geez.

820
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,760
It's already 2 p.m.

821
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,550
Wow, it's like he's psychic.

822
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:58,650
<i>[Mr. Son]</i>

823
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,530
Hello, Mr. Son?

824
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,440
<i>Hello, Mr. Golden Spoon!</i>

825
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,590
I just checked my bank account.

826
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:14,180
Are you going to stab me
in the back like this?

827
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,810
Mr. Son, that is--

828
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,160
<i>Never mind.</i>

829
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,090
Give me the number for
the quick delivery service.

830
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,300
I'll send some pictures to Lee Do Kyung.

831
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,170
You bastard!

832
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,580
Mr. Son, this is Yoon Tae Soo.

833
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:34,790
Oh, Mr. Yoon... geez.

834
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,900
I told you to work with him as a team.

835
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,690
I'm disappointed.

836
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:43,130
Well, it's too early
for you to be disappointed.

837
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:46,760
I have the money, all in cash.

838
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:53,380
All of it? In cash?
All in cash?

839
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:57,330
Yes, we borrowed it from a loan shark.

840
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:00,050
It won't look good if we deposit it
into a bank account.

841
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,000
That's why we couldn't
send the money yet.

842
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,880
Wow, I totally misjudged you.

843
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,980
You are so bad at lying.

844
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,800
<i>Do you really think I believe that?</i>

845
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,210
Well, since you're a filmmaker...

846
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:18,750
You should find out like
you would in a movie.

847
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,520
Where should I leave the bag of money?

848
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:28,580
This concludes the first round.

849
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,290
We have two candidates competing
for the role of cafe owner, Mee Mee.

850
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:37,360
The next round is scene number 74--

851
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,900
That's enough.
I'm sure they've practiced hard.

852
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,240
They'll be good, of course.

853
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:49,040
Okay... why don't you try...
Try to make me laugh.

854
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,280
Are you going to do it?

855
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,810
Are you shy?

856
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,990
In my opinion...

857
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:03,180
Actors must know how to appeal
to people in any given situation.

858
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,230
Director! Look at me!

859
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:25,590
It's raining cats and dogs!

860
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:28,290
Wow, that's a lot.

861
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:31,610
Batman!

862
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,500
Young Gu is here!

863
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,550
La-la-la.

864
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:40,890
"Dashing through the snow,
in a one-horse open sleigh."

865
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:44,800
"Over the hills we go,
or not? Go or not?"

866
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,250
I don't know!

867
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:51,590
"Did you season bean sprouts?"

868
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:54,670
Soo ri... Soo ri...

869
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,550
<i>Isn't it fun?</i><i></i>

870
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:58,580
Isn't it funny?

871
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,320
Aren't I funny?

872
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,710
Excuse me.

873
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,910
Bravo! Bravo!

874
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,570
Bravo!

875
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,820
In this awkward situation, you put
in everything, and you did your best!

876
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:20,300
They are amazing actresses! Bravo!

877
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:24,170
This is annoying. I'm torn. I'm torn!

878
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:25,460
What do you think?

879
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,320
- I'm torn too.
- I know.

880
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,160
I don't feel that way at all!

881
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:36,230
From the beginning, I knew which
one would be perfect for Mee Mee!

882
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,320
Right there, the one
who did the "Soo ri Soo ri" line.

883
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,800
Can we really do this?

884
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,690
What if Mr. Son finds out
that that's an empty bag--

885
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,060
We are standing on the edge of a cliff.

886
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,090
We can't just let him dupe us.

887
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:02,210
Whatever comes out of this,
we have to meet him.

888
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,600
Do you have a plan?

889
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,750
Just wing it.

890
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,440
I'm going crazy here.

891
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:13,350
Anyway, why did he ask us
to come to a place like this?

892
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,000
Let's wait calmly.

893
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,800
What's wrong with the water?

894
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,230
Water is water.

895
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,430
We'll move on to the next round,
which is situational acting.

896
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,300
I will give you a scenario.

897
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,820
Two women are fighting over a man.

898
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:43,150
He's Lee Do Kyung's man,
and Kim Eun Ok is interested in him.

899
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:48,580
Lee Do Kyung feels
betrayed by her friend.

900
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,400
That's the scenario.

901
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,440
Is he a movie director
or a fortune teller?

902
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,050
Crazy...

903
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:57,620
That's a bit of a cliche.

904
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,130
But life is kind of like that.
So give it a try.

905
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:02,840
Get in the mood.

906
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,140
Go.

907
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:12,030
How could you do that to me?
He was my man!

908
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:14,770
You're the one balancing two men.

909
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:19,180
A diamond or a pure heart?
Whatever it is, just make your choice!

910
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:23,580
Whoever I choose,
I won't let you have him!

911
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,260
What a fox.

912
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,830
You're making that man miserable.

913
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:31,210
That's what you want to think.
That way you can steal him from me!

914
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:33,990
You're using him
for the way that he loves.

915
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,670
No, he loves me!

916
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,360
Love can change.

917
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,150
Wow! Wow!

918
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,750
That was so real!
That gave me goosebumps.

919
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:55,390
Their acting was neither excessive,
nor was it lacking.

920
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,050
That was good acting.

921
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:00,880
Lee Do Kyung, you are full of energy.

922
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,500
Thank you.

923
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,650
You felt it, right?

924
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:08,450
Yes, I got an idea of it.

925
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:10,800
- What about you?
- I did too.

926
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:17,710
Let's move on to the final round.

927
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,510
Huh?

928
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,320
What's going on here?

929
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,630
Geez!

930
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:43,230
Who did this?

931
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,330
Geez.

932
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:51,860
Huh?

933
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:01,520
What the heck?
Mr. Son?

934
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,820
You're asking because you don't know?

935
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,630
Look here.

936
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,610
Man...

937
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,170
The two of you, keep me company
on my way to the Underworld.

938
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:25,640
Mr. Son, please don't do this.

939
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,970
Let's talk. Talk!

940
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:29,170
Talk?

941
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,280
Talking is good.

942
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:38,860
All in cash?

943
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,860
Is this cash? Huh?

944
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,510
Cash? Is this cash? Huh?

945
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:52,940
You're trying to swindle a swindler?

946
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:57,630
My father will never leave you alone
if he finds out that you kidnapped me!

947
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,290
You dare touch me?

948
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:02,830
How scary.

949
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,960
Ouch.

950
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,200
Hurts?

951
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,380
- Hurts?
- Ouch!

952
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:13,400
I touched you, so now what?

953
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,990
I'm just repaying you
for what you did to me.

954
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,400
Let's go.

955
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,030
Untie it.

956
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,360
It's loose!

957
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:40,550
- Come on!
- Wow.

958
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:42,390
Come on!

959
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,610
You!

960
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:46,320
Hey.

961
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,760
Let me do it.

962
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:51,980
Geez.

963
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,230
Stay away.

964
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,450
Okay, okay.

965
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:09,100
Why I ought to...

966
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:19,550
Tae Soo, are you okay?

967
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:21,180
Huh? Oh!

968
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,140
Over here! Over here!

969
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,150
Save us!

970
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,860
Over here! Over here!

971
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:37,800
Don't move!

972
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,840
I have real bullets in my gun.

973
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:46,410
Thank you for coming, Bro!

974
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:49,800
I texted him earlier.
I told him to come.

975
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,150
You did a good job, Tae Soo!

976
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,650
Are you okay, Tae Soo?

977
01:00:58,650 --> 01:00:59,910
Yes, Bro!

978
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:01,300
How about you, Director Baek?

979
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,210
I'm fine!

980
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:08,130
What have you done so far?

981
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:11,630
They're saying they're fine.

982
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:14,650
Are you going to stay up all night?

983
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,670
- Huh?
- Huh?

984
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:35,150
I feel so bad,
I can't be rough with them.

985
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,400
Bro!

986
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:45,130
What the heck are you doing?
You're a policeman!

987
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:46,850
Officer Seo!

988
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:50,390
I told you yesterday,
when I bought you a farewell drink.

989
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:52,890
Life is all about making it,
or not making it.

990
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:55,290
And if you don't make it,
things only gets worse.

991
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,900
Bro!

992
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:13,430
