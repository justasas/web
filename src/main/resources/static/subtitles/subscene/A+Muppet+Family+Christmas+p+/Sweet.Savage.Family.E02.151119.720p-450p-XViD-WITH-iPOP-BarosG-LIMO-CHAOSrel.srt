00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,360
We can't do that.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,440
Flying kick!

<i>[Episode 2]</i>

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,160
Huh? Where is everyone?

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,400
What the heck...

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,020
Boss. There's nothing here.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,770
It's all empty.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,080
What's going on?

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,710
<i>The number you dialed does not exist.
Please confirm and try again...</i>

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,020
What the heck? Did they run away?

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,130
Boss?

14
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,040
Didn't you say the chairman
deposited three billion won?

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,410
Rats...

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,880
Get out and find him!

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,200
Run!

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,250
Geez!

19
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,850
Is this the right place?

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,580
Yes, he was living off of his friend.

21
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,930
Search thoroughly.

22
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,080
It seems like he knew we were
coming and ran away quickly.

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,890
Catch him!
Stop right there!

24
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,970
Get him!

25
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,180
Stop right there!

26
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,660
Hey!

27
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,100
Stop right there!

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,870
Hey!

29
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,000
Hey! Stop there!

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,370
Hey!

31
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,360
Get him!

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,610
What's this?

33
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,190
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, Sun Young.

34
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,740
They're beautiful.

35
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,770
Do you like what I picked for you?

36
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,850
Oh, I knew it!
It's definitely your taste!

37
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,390
You never change.

38
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,840
Graceful and sophisticated.

39
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,990
Sit down, sit down, everyone.

40
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,020
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,720
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

42
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,780
Let's toast to One Heart!

43
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,210
One Heart!

44
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,900
Ma'am, don't bother yourself.
I'll cut it for you.

45
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,070
You might hurt your wrist.

46
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,310
Thank you.

47
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,280
- Please have some wine.
- Thanks.

48
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,920
Eun Ok.

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,010
I guess you can sleep well now.

50
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,630
You wished your husband
had a different job.

51
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,920
Please don't say that.

52
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,100
I just hoped he would do a variety
of things within the group.

53
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:28,350
As an advocate of art, I look forward
to watching Mr. Yoon's movie.

54
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,110
You should support him well.

55
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,390
Yes, ma'am. I will do my best.

56
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,940
Young Il told me that
if the movie does well

57
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,120
Tae Soo will continue
to work as an investor.

58
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,320
Of course that's a possibility.

59
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,580
You never know what could happen in life.

60
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,320
It's not easy to make a big hit movie.

61
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,360
Life doesn't change that easily.

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,860
If it was that easy,
we wouldn't be wives of thugs.

63
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,810
Hey.

64
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,270
I'm sorry, ma'am.

65
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,750
Should I stitch up my lips?

66
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,910
Yes, you should.

67
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,130
Yes, ma'am.

68
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,670
- That's pretty.
- Yeah.

69
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,390
- So many pretty things.
- I know.

70
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,580
Excuse me.

71
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,920
Do you have time?

72
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,180
- It was me.
- It was me!

73
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,110
- It was me!
- Don't argue. You better back down.

74
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,430
Be a little modest, Mom.

75
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,060
And think about your age.

76
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,990
You lost to me many times!

77
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,040
Don't make me a bad mother.

78
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,570
We are pretty even so far.

79
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,600
Should we find out?

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,260
- Sure!
- Sure!

81
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,870
Excuse me.

82
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,210
Oh, you mean me?

83
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,060
Which of us were you talking to just now?

84
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,560
Were you interested in me or was it...

85
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,090
this old lady?

86
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,550
- I was--
- For your information...

87
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,810
We are not really interested in you.

88
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,700
So would you please
just tell us the truth?

89
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,650
Both of you have good
energy in your faces.

90
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,650
Pardon me?

91
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,500
If you get training,
you can dispel all bad luck.

92
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,870
Perhaps, you are interested
in finding the way to do so?

93
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,930
Hey!

94
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,900
Stop right there!

95
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,370
Hey!

96
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,030
Geez.

97
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,280
Oh!

98
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,360
I finally got you, little rat!

99
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,230
Geez! Please!

100
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,060
Geez!

101
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,790
Come over here, you little rat!

102
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,360
- Hey!
- Geez!

103
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,940
Stop right there!

104
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,710
Geez!

105
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,350
- Geez!
- Hey!

106
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,050
Stop right there!

107
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,110
You're dead...

108
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,100
You are...
Stop please...

109
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,040
You come here.

110
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,240
- Come on.
- Geez!

111
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,300
Don't even try.

112
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,580
It's not me!

113
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,780
Come here!

114
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,630
Hey!

115
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,910
I won't beat you. Let's talk outside.

116
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,410
You're dead.

117
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,890
Hey!

118
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,830
Easy! Easy!

119
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,270
Boss! Boss!

120
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,270
Ugh.

121
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,610
What's this?

122
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,680
Get up.

123
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,270
What a mess.

124
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,250
What's this stuff? What...

125
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,270
Oh.

126
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,630
Oh... Lee Do Kyung.

127
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,780
Long time no see.

128
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,700
Oh, man.

129
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,820
Well.

130
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,910
I'm sorry but...

131
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,170
I'm in a hurry. But I'll be back.

132
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,850
Hey.

133
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,280
How did it go?

134
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,510
Huh?

135
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,220
He says Mr. Son even stole
his money and ran away.

136
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,870
He ran because he was afraid.

137
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,010
That's a lie, right?

138
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,370
Where is that bastard?

139
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,480
I really don't know. I don't know!

140
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,220
Get this.

141
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,180
Geez.

142
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,520
I'm very sorry about that.

143
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,930
I'll clean all of this up.

144
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,020
Don't worry.

145
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,700
That's not right.
I should pay for all of this.

146
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,040
You haven't changed one bit, Tae Soo.

147
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,030
Geez.

148
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,970
It's been ten years.
And this is what you had to see.

149
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,150
I live like this.

150
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,230
Ouch.

151
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,190
What's wrong?

152
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,000
I guess I twisted it when
I used the fire extinguisher.

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,320
Let me see.

154
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,940
Oh, luckily your bones seem fine.

155
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,960
<i>It's hasn't been a month
since she came to Daejeon.</i>

156
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,840
<i>She opened her store last weekend.</i>

157
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,770
<i>And Tae Soo stopped by
the store just now.</i>

158
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,080
Hey.

159
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,050
Did you just come home?

160
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,550
Looks like you had a drink.

161
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,890
Is it the movie or Tae Soo?

162
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,300
On which did you spend three billion won?

163
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,980
On both.

164
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,540
Honestly, I wanted to
give Tae Soo a chance.

165
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,760
He's worked hard all of these years.

166
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,570
And he's never caused trouble.

167
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,690
You mean whereas I failed many times?

168
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,840
It's time for him to do
something different.

169
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,200
He can't just do the clubs.

170
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,750
The clubs are our source of income.
Who can run them other than Tae Soo?

171
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,870
Do you trust anyone other than Tae Soo?

172
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,420
You can’t make someone keep shoveling
just because he's good at shoveling.

173
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,690
People work harder when there's a reward.

174
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,390
He's a muscle man.
He doesn't have the brains.

175
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,270
Someone like me, who does have
the brains, should do the thinking!

176
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,060
But he has the heart.

177
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,110
There's no one as responsible,
or as loyal, as Tae Soo.

178
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,450
He's a person I need the most,
and you know that!

179
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,260
Then make him your son.

180
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,770
Okay?

181
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,090
How did it go? Did you find out?

182
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,910
We checked all the CCTV
footage we could get.

183
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,920
But we found nothing.

184
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,570
What the hell...

185
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,750
I'm totally screwed!

186
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,730
What have I done, huh?

187
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,650
So why did you get into
the movie business?

188
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,560
Just make up some excuses,
like Gi Bum does.

189
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,490
You'd just get scolded,
but that would be it.

190
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,480
I'm not Gi Bum!

191
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,100
Would I be like this if
the chairman was my father?

192
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,000
<i>I'm doing this because I trust you.</i>

193
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,770
<i>Tae Soo, this can change our lives.</i>

194
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,830
Work to death.

195
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,340
Your life depends on it.

196
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,380
He's been a bit edgy since
he invested in the movie.

197
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,630
He spent three billion won all at once.

198
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,960
<i>Yoon Tae Soo! Yoon Tae Soo!</i>

199
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:34,010
Now that I'm looking at this,
my husband looks so handsome!

200
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,770
Why are you doing that?

201
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,890
What do you mean?
Of course I should clip these.

202
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,610
This is our family's treasure to pass on!

203
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,990
Not anyone can be a movie investor.

204
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,480
Geez.

205
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,540
One Heart threw a surprise party
for me today.

206
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,250
Madam Oh came to congratulate us.

207
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,920
The ladies are so jealous of me.

208
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,360
I heard some movies
make 10 billion won!

209
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,320
Let's buy a house in Seoul first.

210
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,630
We need to do that when
Sung Min goes to college anyway.

211
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,120
Don't get ahead of yourself.

212
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,300
You have to succeed.

213
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,700
Everyone knows about it now.
If you fail...

214
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,480
We won't be able to lift our heads up.

215
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Okay?

216
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,220
Stop it! My head is about to explode!

217
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,200
Did you just yell at me?

218
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,240
No... it's not that...

219
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,440
You're already like this?
Will you hit me if the film is a success?

220
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,820
Go ahead. Hit me.

221
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,910
Hit me.

222
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,020
- Hit me!
- Geez!

223
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,310
There's so much on my mind.
My tongue just slipped.

224
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,770
Come to your senses, jerk!

225
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,020
Come to your senses.

226
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,670
Enough. Just take out the trash.

227
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,120
It's overflowing.

228
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,560
Ugh...

229
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,800
Yeah.

230
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,940
<i>Boss, we got him for real!</i>

231
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,190
What?

232
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,140
Where is Mr. Son?

233
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,480
Geez.

234
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,250
You must know where he is.

235
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,700
They say they don't know.

236
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,010
No worries. I can beat them to a pulp.

237
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,810
Please... please, please.
There must be a misunderstanding.

238
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,630
We just did what Mr. Son told us to do.

239
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,820
He told us to lay low. So we did.

240
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,170
What about the money? Where is it?

241
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,920
What money?

242
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,260
We didn't see even a penny.

243
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,510
We're victims here too.

244
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,190
- Yes.
- What?

245
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,560
Do you look down on me
because I'm an uneducated boor?

246
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,380
- Huh?
- No.

247
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,130
What is it?

248
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,770
<i>What did you do with the trash?
The town councilman came to see me.</i>

249
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,630
I was going to toss it
and got sidetracked.

250
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,550
She totally blew up on me.

251
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,230
<i>My ears still hurt!</i>

252
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,360
Boss...

253
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,560
I got it.

254
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,030
- Talk to you at home.
<i>- Honey!</i>

255
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,450
<i>What time are you coming home?</i>

256
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,610
I'll be home as soon as I'm done.

257
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,250
Stop by the market on your way.
I forgot to get milk.

258
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,090
Trash bags too. 10-liter ones.

259
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,340
Please!

260
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,520
<i>Don't get 20-liter ones like last time!</i>

261
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,110
Okay.

262
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,180
10-liter trash bags.

263
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,240
And two cartons of milk.

264
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,870
I got it. See you later.

265
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,570
You rats! Do you think I'm nobody? Huh?

266
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,100
Do you know what
that three billion won means?

267
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,310
Geez!

268
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,950
Please just report it to the police.

269
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,720
Then we can get our money back
and be proven innocent.

270
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,990
The police? Great idea!

271
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,920
Call the TV station too!

272
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,700
You give them an interview on TV!

273
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,580
How great!
Our chairman will be dancing around!

274
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,760
Mr. Yoon.

275
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,920
We don't know anything! We know nothing!

276
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,090
Yeah?

277
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,240
If words don't work, use something else.

278
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,540
Go ahead.

279
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,570
What is this?

280
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,760
My phone is on fire...

281
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,100
Brother!

282
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,740
Man!

283
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,790
I'm sorry I'm late.

284
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,860
Don't worry.

285
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,770
Why did you come so fast?

286
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,720
You should have taken your time.

287
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,120
I'm sorry for making you wait.
You're a busy man.

288
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,980
That's all right.

289
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,920
I have no home and no money.

290
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,050
All I have is time.

291
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,040
I have nothing.

292
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,130
Would a busy policeman
run errands for a gangster?

293
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,810
What's wrong, Brother?

294
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,690
What do you mean?

295
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,260
I'm just speaking the truth.

296
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,710
Well, did you look into it?

297
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,740
Do you know what kind of guy
Son Se Yoon is?

298
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,830
Yeah?

299
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,180
This isn't right.

300
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,400
It's a violation of human rights.

301
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,870
I may be running errands
for a gangster...

302
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,550
But as a policeman,
I do have a conscience.

303
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,320
Let's say there was nothing.

304
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,820
Hey, Bro!

305
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,130
You scared me!

306
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,830
Do you want to see me die?

307
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,500
I can just--!

308
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,170
Okay. I got it!

309
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,980
Son Se Yoon is a rock bed.

310
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,010
Yeah?

311
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,310
He has five stars!

312
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,470
Fraud, gambling...

313
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,480
Violations of the
Foreign Exchange Control Law...

314
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,030
He goes to Las Vegas and
Macao as if he lives there.

315
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,300
Is that true?

316
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,110
Where is this bastard now?

317
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,580
Tae Soo.

318
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,000
I am a policeman.

319
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,010
I don't work for the CIA.

320
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,930
My God!

321
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,430
Why do you yell at me?

322
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,230
Judging by the given situation

323
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:41,030
he probably already
went overseas with the money.

324
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,220
Give me some tea.

325
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,550
Go somewhere else.

326
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,870
I need to clean the store first.
It'll be a while.

327
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,420
If you had told me

328
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,390
I would have helped you
to find a home and a store.

329
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,690
Do I have to report to my ex-husband
when I come to my hometown?

330
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,980
"Why did you come?" "Do you need help?"
"What do you need?"

331
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,270
If that's what you're
going to say, I will get up.

332
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,450
I was surprised that you came so quickly.

333
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,700
I was going to come see
you when I was ready.

334
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,840
Ready for what?

335
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,550
You hated me when you lived with me.

336
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,720
But you hated being
a gangster's wife even more.

337
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,310
Since it happened this way

338
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,070
it'll be good to show you
how I've become a different person.

339
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,850
Are you saying you're
becoming a new person... for me?

340
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,830
I know you won't believe me
no matter what I say.

341
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,730
But I mean it.

342
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,250
I'm trying very hard
these days, Do Kyung.

343
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,610
Aren't you curious about Hyun Jee?

344
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,040
Isn't asking about her
the first thing to do?

345
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,650
I have no right to say her name.

346
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,180
How funny.

347
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,110
But she says she misses her daddy.

348
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,410
Leave.

349
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,040
My first customer was bad.
My day isn't off to a good start.

350
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,470
<i>Honey, it's a scoop!</i>

351
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,910
<i>Director Baek met his ex!</i>

352
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,550
<i>She opened a cafe
in Eunhaeng-dong called La Mer!</i>

353
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,720
One, two, three!

354
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,020
Lee Do Kyung's back.

355
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,800
- She came back to Daejeon!
- What?

356
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,940
My goodness.

357
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,340
I'm very sorry.

358
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,820
Really?

359
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,250
You should have told us.

360
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,430
I feel a bit disappointed.

361
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,440
I'm sorry.
I was too busy opening the store.

362
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,940
I haven't seen you on TV for a while.
You don't act anymore?

363
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,590
I quit acting long time ago.
Everyone knows except for you, I suppose.

364
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,920
Were you an actress?

365
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,190
- Actress?
- Yes.

366
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:41,370
You were Lady 3 in Farm Diary.

367
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,920
You were in a movie too.

368
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,170
Her Fight?

369
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,860
Right. I played a bitch who
seduces a married man.

370
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,560
Right. Your acting was amazing!

371
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,850
Right?

372
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,210
I baked it myself.
How do you like it?

373
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,150
Wait a minute.

374
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,090
Perhaps... La Mer from Samchung-dong?

375
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,870
Some people recognize it.

376
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,950
I used to go there often
when I lived in Seoul.

377
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,830
When I feel gloomy...

378
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,710
Drip coffee and a waffle...

379
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,990
That was like food for my soul.

380
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,570
By the way...

381
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,640
I guess you came from Seoul?

382
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,480
Yes. But my hometown is Daejeon.

383
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,760
Hmm.

384
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,820
Do Kyung, Eun Ok, and Me.

385
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,480
The three of us were like the
Charlie's Angels of Ho Soo High.

386
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,210
Eun Ok was the smart one.

387
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,510
Do Kyung was the pretty one.

388
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,010
And I was...

389
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,010
The slutty one!

390
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,660
You're laughing too loud.

391
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,900
Sorry, sorry.

392
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,700
Actually the slutty one was Eun Ok.

393
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,450
Ah...
what the heck are you talking about?

394
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,060
You were good at that kind of stuff.

395
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,850
In the end you married the man
you loved unrequitedly.

396
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,970
Our handmade cookies are good.
Would you like to try some?

397
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,170
Bub Kyu.

398
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,970
Yes, Boss.

399
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,090
We have to succeed with this one.

400
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,820
I really want to succeed.

401
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,900
Yes, of course you will.

402
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,460
I heard you like soccer, Chairman Wang.

403
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,410
Soccer is all about
the center of the field.

404
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,770
Chungcheong-do is the center of Korea.
And I'm the midfielder.

405
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,430
You can't go to Seoul, Jeolla-do or
Gyeongsang-do without going through here.

406
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,140
A thematic park in the middle
of the transportation hub.

407
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,560
You will see.

408
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,300
Not only foreigners

409
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,310
but also Koreans will come here
from all over the country.

410
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,870
<i>I understand what you are saying.</i>

411
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,520
Haste makes waste.

412
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,440
I will get it all ready.
Please wait patiently until then.

413
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,090
And enjoy looking around.

414
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,650
<i>Okay.</i>

415
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,060
<i>I trust you, Director Baek.</i>

416
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,410
<i>But don't make me wait too long.</i>

417
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,370
<i>Don't worry. Thank you.</i>

418
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,960
<i>Thank you, Director Baek.</i>

419
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,240
Thank you!

420
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

421
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,800
Thank you.

422
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,140
What do you think? Was I good?

423
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,910
Yes. You should be a politician.

424
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,130
I'll do it if I have the chance.

425
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,360
Of course!

426
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,870
Huh?

427
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,340
Isn't he the CEO of the
movie production company?

428
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,170
I think so.

429
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,380
What is he here for?

430
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,550
Find out what he's up to.

431
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,910
Yes, Boss.

432
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,910
Boss, this is big!

433
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,460
What is?

434
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,670
They say Mr. Son is a
regular at this casino.

435
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,590
He's staying in a VIP room.

436
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,240
Only foreigners can come here.

437
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,350
It seems that he has a fake passport.

438
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,180
What's that... Do...

439
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,790
He has the passport from
the Dominican Republic.

440
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,300
Oh, he has some guts.

441
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,370
That bastard lost a ton
of money since yesterday.

442
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,870
Is that true?

443
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,590
Card for player, card for banker.

444
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,340
Player's, banker's.

445
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,780
Player's card.

446
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,220
Banker. Natural nine.

447
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,030
Geez.

448
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,420
You should have rubbed your nose.

449
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,040
You're losing lots of money here.

450
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,700
Does Mr. Yoon know this?

451
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,650
Gi Bum.

452
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,780
My friend, I have big news.
Want a drink?

453
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,020
Here.

454
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,720
How's the movie going?

455
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,880
What do you mean?
It's just starting now.

456
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,560
What's the big news?

457
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,310
You know Mr. Son...

458
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,110
Yeah.

459
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,710
What is his personality like?

460
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,780
I want to get to know him,
but I haven't had the chance.

461
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,830
Can you set something up?

462
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,100
Sure. Another time...

463
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,680
I heard your family is excited
about your doing that movie.

464
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,990
You wife and kids are excited to death!

465
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,090
What's the big news?

466
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,790
I discovered something about Mr. Son...

467
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,420
No, never mind.
I'll tell you another time.

468
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,830
What is it?

469
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,230
Huh? What was that?

470
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,780
Are you upset?

471
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,510
Are you on your period?

472
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,090
Don't joke around.

473
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,390
I'm sorry.

474
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,030
Why are you so worked up?

475
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,050
Oh.

476
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,660
I just found out

477
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,710
Mr. Son...

478
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:19,430
He's our high school senior!
Isn't that big news?

479
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,860
Thanks, Tae Soo.

480
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,570
What the heck are you talking about?

481
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,130
It's been a while since
my dad smiled like that.

482
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,980
You're like a good son to him.
So I'm thankful.

483
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,120
He's crazy.

484
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,040
All he talks about these days
is movies, actors...

485
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,000
I can't believe it.

486
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,160
My friend.

487
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,030
Do it right.

488
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,490
Make a good movie.

489
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,680
I want to see...
how big his smile can get.

490
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,910
Oh my god! Oh my god!

491
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,410
Oh my! My goodness!

492
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,830
Let me ask you for the last time.

493
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,440
Where is Mr. Son?

494
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,640
Don't do it again!

495
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,070
I really don't know.

496
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,850
Save me!

497
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,740
I told you we are the victims here!

498
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,010
Put them in.

499
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:43,470
Don't let go!

500
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:47,290
Wait!

501
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,610
I will make the movie!

502
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,470
That way we get to live.

503
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,640
And you get to live too!

504
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,030
With one billion won!

505
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,220
We can make a movie that's
worth three billion won!

506
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,620
Back in college, my nickname was...

507
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,040
Low Budget, High Quality!

508
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,710
- That's right!
- Yes!

509
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,740
- You don't make a movie just with money.
- Right!

510
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,750
Low-budget movies!

511
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,010
Yes, low-budget!

512
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,240
Everyone dies. I'm not afraid to die!

513
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,360
But we can't die like this!

514
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,150
I can't die like this!

515
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,870
I'll make the movie!

516
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,870
Please?

517
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,540
How can I trust you?

518
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,490
How?

519
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,610
You know what...
Since I was eight years old

520
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,590
my dream has been to make movies.

521
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,720
If you give me one last chance

522
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,800
I will put my life on it.
I'll make the movie!

523
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,720
If we can have one billion won

524
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,980
we will make the movie, no matter what!

525
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,350
One billion won! Save us!

526
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,360
Are you crazy?

527
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,560
Stop talking nonsense.

528
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,000
You have no money.

529
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,380
If I don't make the movie,
I'll have to put up my head.

530
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,600
I have no choice.

531
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,860
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

532
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,340
What's going on?

533
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,170
Oh my goodness!

534
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,610
What's going on?

535
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,280
- Hey...
- Grab his leg.

536
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,780
How much did you drink?

537
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,470
I can't live like this!

538
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,590
- Geez!
- It hurts!

539
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,460
- It hurts.
- Are you okay?

540
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,830
Just get up.

541
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,540
Are you making a movie or something?

542
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,220
Yoon Soo Min!

543
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,880
Stop that. Help!

544
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,420
You didn't wash your face.
You look like a puppy.

545
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,980
Put that away!
Give me that!

546
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,940
Mom! Help.

547
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,250
- I don't want to be late for school.
- Okay. Open the door.

548
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,150
Honey! My goodness!

549
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,060
Look at your belly button! You stink!

550
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,850
I can't live like this!

551
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,400
He stinks!

552
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,570
This is worth 50,000 won at least.

553
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,840
Geez!

554
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,590
- Take his clothes off.
- Let go!

555
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,430
You jerks!

556
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,520
Am I number two?

557
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,690
You want to die?
You are dead.

558
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,810
I won't leave you alone.
Get my fist.

559
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,350
Hi!

560
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,890
I'm sorry for having you come out.

561
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,880
Why did you want to see me?

562
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,020
I remember the day you
first came to our house.

563
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,380
I thought my husband finally
found someone he could trust.

564
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,240
I was very pleased.

565
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,220
If it hadn't been for him,
I would not be alive now.

566
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:48,870
Please tell me the truth.

567
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,320
Something happened to Tae Soo, right?

568
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,000
Well.

569
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,130
Nothing is going on.

570
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,340
I'm going crazy here.

571
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,180
Please don't do this.

572
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,990
Tae Soo will beat me up for this.

573
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,630
It's bad enough for him
to lose his life, right?

574
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,210
Look here.

575
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:17,120
I've been married to
a gangster for 18 years.

576
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,650
I can tell something is up.

577
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:31,760
I'm not sick anymore. Why did you come?

578
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,040
I have something to discuss with you.

579
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,900
With me?

580
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,470
Yes...

581
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,030
Geez.

582
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,700
I can't handle this on my own.

583
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,280
What is it?

584
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,720
It's Soo Min.

585
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,140
Soo Min doesn't listen to me.
I'm dying here!

586
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,830
What's wrong with my puppy?

587
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,730
Did she get in trouble again?

588
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,350
It's not like that.

589
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,140
She never listens to me.

590
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,140
She's good with you.

591
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,940
Of course, I raised her with love!

592
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,090
Don't be hard on her.

593
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,460
These days parents
have no control over their kids.

594
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:19,610
The only thing you can
control is your food.

595
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,670
That brings up my point.

596
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:28,020
I want you to come back.

597
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,850
For Soo Min!

598
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:34,400
I know things are still
awkward between you and me.

599
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,360
No need to say more.

600
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,280
It's for my puppy.

601
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,590
Mother.

602
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,130
I'll come right now.

603
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,010
Oh, my.

604
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,660
I had no idea what was going on.

605
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,780
I slept well without knowing anything.

606
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,360
What's all this?

607
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,180
I took out all of my savings.

608
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,850
I broke our savings.

609
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,710
Your mom is coming back,
so we sold her place too.

610
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,050
This is all I can do.
You take care of the rest.

611
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,430
- How did you--
- I've lived anxiously for 18 years.

612
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,170
I can tell by just looking at you.

613
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:44,110
If you fail,
our entire family will suffer.

614
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:48,320
You saw how excited the kids
were about your movie business.

615
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,180
I'll go. Soo Min will be home soon.

616
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,240
The room looks bigger with
everything organized.

617
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,690
It looks bigger because of that tiny TV.

618
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,950
Pardon me?

619
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:16,820
I have bad sight, and the TV is tiny.
I guess I'll just listen.

620
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,350
It's practically a radio.

621
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,580
A 32-inch TV isn't small.
It's perfect for this room.

622
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,410
Okay. My eyes are the problem.

623
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:31,030
Why do you have to take away
my joy of watching TV?

624
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:36,180
The TV in the living room is yours.
So I can't touch that.

625
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:41,140
Others think I have a good life.

626
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,970
But my life is miserable.

627
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,810
My friend left behind a 42-inch TV
when she left the country.

628
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,570
I'll bring that.

629
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,610
A used one?

630
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:54,240
No, it's only been used for two years.
It's practically new.

631
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,760
My goodness.

632
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,130
It's used when you open the box.

633
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,100
How much longer will I live?

634
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:07,900
If I buy a new one now,
I'll use it for the rest of my life.

635
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,190
I shouldn't have said anything to you.

636
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,500
Tae Soo would buy one
for me if I asked him.

637
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,370
Your son is in a bad situation now.

638
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,700
He has no money.

639
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,250
Huh? What do you mean?

640
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,620
Do you know how many clubs he manages?

641
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,940
Grandma!

642
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,900
Oh, my puppy!

643
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,620
Are you going to live with us?

644
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,340
Of course.
Now I'm in charge of you, puppy!

645
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,620
Yay!

646
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,890
I love it.

647
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,350
My precious granddaughter!

648
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,550
I bought them!

649
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,730
Air spray, apples, orange juice...

650
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,220
Toast for breakfast...

651
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:08,970
Oh, no. I forgot squid legs. Sorry, Mom!

652
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,570
Okay. I'll pay attention.

653
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,330
Come home early. Bye!

654
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,380
Oh?

655
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,070
Is he a singer or something?

656
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,020
Who said you could sing here?

657
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,630
He sang in the park last time.

658
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,100
It's him.

659
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,940
Hey, it's you, right?

660
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:21,520
He ignored us last time,
and he is doing that now!

661
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,400
Hey! Hey!

662
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,980
Who said you could sing here and there?

663
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,240
Huh?

664
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,520
Stop it. I don't want to fight.

665
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,930
- He said stop.
- What a cutie.

666
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,700
Are you leaving?

667
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,660
You should pay the rent.

668
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,490
I don't like this guy.

669
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,950
Hey, can't you hear me?

670
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,450
You can't hear me?

671
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,880
You want to die?

672
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,200
What's this?

673
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,130
Guys, run!

674
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,070
You improved a lot.

675
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,610
What?

676
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,640
Let me see.

677
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,310
You didn't grow much.

678
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,990
I kind of like your chin, and your style.

679
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,330
I'll forgive you for your shortness.

680
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,770
You don't recognize me?

681
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,610
Geez!

682
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,300
It's not easy to forget me.

683
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,970
I've been well known for
my beauty since I was little.

684
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,500
All right.

685
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,410
You'll have to remember who I am
by the next time we see each other.

686
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,750
Bye then.

687
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,960
When did he toughen up?

688
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,730
He's making my heart flutter.

689
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,000
Hey! Your vocalization is awful!

690
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,010
If you sing like that,
you'll hurt your throat!

691
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,900
Producing Mr. Son's script
will cost us a lot.

692
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,750
So I modified my script around the one
for which I was highly praised in Poland.

693
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,330
I want to use that.
Did you read it all?

694
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,980
I can't understand any of this!

695
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,180
I don't understand what
is hard to understand.

696
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,310
Mr. Lee, do you understand this script?

697
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:49,020
Honestly, it's not a commercial piece.

698
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,050
This is a bit lacking...

699
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:55,370
These gangsters don't fight.
They talk funny.

700
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,150
There should be some order!
Like One, Two, Three, A, B, C.

701
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,140
It has no story, it's no fun!

702
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,310
What do you think movies are?

703
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,970
Movies are movies!
What else are they?

704
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,650
Do you know the director Otani Iosselian?

705
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,620
- Otani what?
- My--

706
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:17,100
He made
"The Favorites of the Moon" and said this

707
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:23,310
"A movie is to weaving our daily lives
that are like dust, in an artistic way."

708
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,420
Those are the kinds of movies
I want to make!

709
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,340
I feel like dying from running.

710
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,760
What the heck are you talking about?

711
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,170
I told you many times that we're making a
movie about the fists in Chungcheong-do!

712
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,160
That's just a motive.

713
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,190
What TV?

714
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,420
Motive... I mean.

715
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,890
The main thought.

716
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,380
- I'm an educated man.
- I don't give a shit about that!

717
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,620
Talk about gangsters.

718
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,140
You don't know gangsters?

719
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,200
Should I call my underlings?

720
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,660
Huh?

721
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,620
This is our asset! Stop!

722
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,190
What's going on?

723
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,620
Did something happen?

724
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh.

725
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,930
It's not that.
We are having a meeting.

726
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:10,930
Having a meeting without the CEO?
Where is Mr. Son?

727
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,410
Oh, well...

728
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,990
He went to Seoul for business.

729
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,270
Hmm.

730
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:27,070
My dad is about to die from anxiety.
I guess Mr. Son has a lot of time.

731
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,010
What are you here for?

732
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:35,200
I just wanted to see
how things were going.

733
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:40,170
"The Pavane of the Fist Emperor"?

734
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,390
Wasn't it Hot Brothers?
Did the title change?

735
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:48,110
We are just reviewing some other things.

736
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,000
We haven't decided anything.

737
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,860
A bad movie can be made
with a good script.

738
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,280
But a good movie can't be
made with a bad script.

739
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,560
I am so curious as to what kind of
script you're thinking of, Tae Soo.

740
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,950
Did you come here to spoil it?

741
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:12,380
Why are you upset?
You're making it awkward.

742
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,200
You are scary.

743
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,110
Oh, my!

744
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,520
Why do you treat an
important person like this?

745
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,080
Are you a gangster?

746
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,470
I told you not to act like Tae Soo.

747
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,170
I'm sorry, Boss.

748
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:00,520
Where... where am I?

749
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,310
Why do you want to know?

750
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:12,240
Tae Soo was having a meeting
with the director and producer.

751
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,770
I guess they're going
to make a hit movie.

752
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,650
Jian Carlos Jackson?

753
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,580
What a name!

754
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,980
I know.

755
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,480
Did you make the name or
did your broker do that?

756
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,480
What is it that you want from me?

757
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,380
I've seen a movie

758
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,300
where they put two hungry
beasts up for a fight.

759
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:38,040
I'm making Tae Soo starve now

760
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,730
until his eyes are rolling back.

761
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,950
You said you had one billion won left.

762
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,630
Where did you hide it?

763
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:52,000
If you give me that, I might let you go.

764
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,530
There's nothing left.

765
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,150
I've lost it all.

766
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,510
Look here, Mr. Son.

767
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,310
I'm different than Tae Soo.

768
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,830
He uses his fists.

769
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:15,120
And I use this.

770
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,150
You better punch your numbers again.

771
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,700
Got it?

772
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,660
Boss! Are you okay?

773
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,880
Hey, where are you going?

774
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,590
Where are you going?

775
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,130
Where?

776
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,660
What will you do?

777
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,550
Where will you go?

778
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,290
What are you good at, Mr. Son?

779
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,380
You're bad at gambling
and you're bad at escaping.

780
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,490
I feel sorry for you.

781
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,790
How do you like it?

782
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:24,170
Wow, it has an amazing aroma.

783
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:27,140
- What kind of tea is it?
- Oriental miracle...

784
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:31,040
Oriental beauty tea.

785
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,370
Is there such a thing?

786
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,590
This is my favorite tea.

787
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:37,610
It's the top class among Oolong tea.

788
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:41,840
It's made out of leaves eaten by bugs.

789
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,370
Bugs?

790
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:47,270
Because of some kind of
chemical reaction they cause

791
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:50,900
it has a honey-like scent.

792
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,440
Wow.

793
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,830
It's good.

794
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:05,190
Is there anything you don't know?

795
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,810
Please don't say that.

796
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:10,410
I'm lacking in many areas.

797
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,980
What do you lack?

798
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:16,880
Let me know if you lack clothes or bags.

799
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,200
Oh, my.

800
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,960
If you really want to buy me something...

801
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,140
would you buy
the entire Dostoevsky collection?

802
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:32,390
I feel like reading
classics when it's cold.

803
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,460
You got it!

804
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,860
I'll buy you a library before I die.

805
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,720
Do you mean it?

806
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,360
You promised.

807
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,800
Of course!

808
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,080
Oh.

809
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,030
Are you going to work?
It's early.

810
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,160
Father, I went to
the movie production company.

811
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,270
What about Tae Soo?

812
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,200
He's working really hard.

813
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,120
I was surprised.

814
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,980
Speaking of that

815
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,950
for the success of the movie and Tae Soo

816
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:09,760
should we call a shaman
to hold a ceremony?

817
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,950
Shaman?

818
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:11,980
Yes.

819
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,800
You spent the money but you were
a bit indifferent to him.

820
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,940
You should drop in sometimes
and encourage them.

821
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,920
When was the last time you saw Mr. Son?

822
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,560
Well, it's been a while.

823
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,680
Geez.

824
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,460
What do you think, Madam Oh?

825
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:33,220
Actually, I thought about that.

826
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:38,060
But I wasn't sure how you feel
about a shamanistic ceremony.

827
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,770
So I didn't ask.

828
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:43,630
You should have asked me.

829
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,240
Do it tonight.

830
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,760
Let the people know.

831
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,040
I will.

832
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,020
Oh, my goodness!

833
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,430
Look!

834
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,840
Take a look, Mr. Lee.

835
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,940
Look!

836
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,200
What's this?

837
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,490
Oh, geez!

838
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,530
Ahh!

839
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:11,220
Put it away!

840
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,150
It did? It came sooner than I thought.

841
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,410
Is it smiling?

842
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,840
I see.

843
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,650
Father asked me to do that,
and he wants to see Mr. Son.

844
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,550
Don't worry about the ceremony.

845
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:28,510
Just tell Mr. Son to
come down from Seoul.

846
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,120
See you later, my friend!

847
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,260
Okay.

848
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,570
Mr. Son.

849
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:39,490
There will be a shamanistic ceremony
for the movie tonight.

850
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:44,060
Don't you need to go to bow down to
the pig head and pray for a blessing?

851
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,610
Huh?

852
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,090
Please save me.

853
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:03,320
<i>[Hot Brothers! May it be a big hit!]</i>

854
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:08,480
<i>November 19th, 2015.</i>

855
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,380
Gods of the heavens and Earth...

856
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,750
Who rules all things in the world!

857
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,880
We pray to you!

858
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,750
Thank you, Tae Soo.

859
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,500
Make a good movie.

860
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,350
I'll help you as best as a I can.

861
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,760
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

862
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,240
Oh, man! The order was wrong.

863
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,040
The CEO of the company
should have bowed first.

864
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,260
Mr. Son!

865
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,160
Mr. Son Se Yoon, please come out!

866
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,650
Tae Soo! What are you doing?
Bring Mr. Son!

867
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,460
Where is the CEO of
the movie production company?

868
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,070
Mr. Son, please come out!

869
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:10,520
Where is the CEO?

870
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:15,010
Well...

871
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:18,130
Then One Heart can do it now.

872
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:20,410
Members, please come forward.

873
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,840
The CEO should go first.

874
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,900
Good to see you!

875
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,730
Mr. Chairman, you look amazing!
May it a big hit!

876
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:38,870
What happened to Mr. Son?

877
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:41,700
Oh, that's...

878
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,420
- He had an urgent matter in Seoul--
- Even so, he can't do this!

879
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,220
If he doesn't come, I'll look funny.

880
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:50,060
It takes only one hour
to get here by train.

881
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,260
Is someone dying or something?

882
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,800
- He said he was busy--
- So, what is it that he's busy with?

883
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,750
Actually...

884
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:05,490
He's meeting with someone from
Hollywood about a remake.

885
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,450
Do you think we're idiots?

886
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,700
The movie isn't even made yet.
What remake?

887
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:14,440
If the concept is good,
they often make a deal before it's made.

888
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,350
Many of my seniors in Poland
had those kind of deals.

889
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:21,360
- That doesn't make sense.
- Be quiet.

890
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:25,970
So he's meeting with an American?

891
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,810
Yes, Hollywood.

892
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:31,310
- To me--
- What do you know?

893
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:34,160
If you know nothing, just don't ruin it.

894
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,110
Okay. I know nothing.

895
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:41,830
We will see what kind of
movie we end up with.

896
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,480
Tae Soo, why are you sweating so much?

897
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,470
Oh?

898
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,570
Oh... I'm not.

899
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:59,530
Oh, pack some rice cakes
from the ceremony for me.

900
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:02,880
There's someone who has
really has to try the rice cakes.

901
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,330
Okay.

902
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:13,690
Geez.

903
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,380
Jian Carlos!

904
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,200
- What's his name?
- Jackson.

905
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,350
CEO Jian Carlos Jackson!

906
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:52,000
Have some rice cakes from the ceremony!

907
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:01,570
Carlos! The ceremony went well!

908
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:06,130
I didn't get the pig head meat.
Just eat the rice cakes.

909
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,470
Where is that bastard?

910
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,560
Hey!

911
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,150
I'll find him.

912
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:27,850
Geez! What a resilient Korean!

913
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:30,500
Geez!

914
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:34,500
Stop right there!

915
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,100
CEO Son! Hey!

916
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,770
Get him!

917
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:43,110
Hey! Stop!

918
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,100
Let go!

919
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:53,280
- Bastard!
- I'm sorry!

920
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,980
Come on!

921
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,720
Your feet hurt! Stop right there!

922
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:14,650
Hey, Mr. Son!

923
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:16,470
You're going to hurt your feet!

924
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,380
Hey!

925
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,770
Man! What a way to sleep!

926
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,600
Go wash up. Let's go to the market.

927
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,460
Do I have to go?

928
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,550
Then should I carry everything
all by myself?

929
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,950
Now!

930
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:40,830
Hurry up.

931
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,260
Geez.

932
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:45,890
Did you wake me up
that early just for this?

933
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,920
Your mom's at home.
I should pay more attention.

934
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,400
Open it.

935
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,610
What was that?

936
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,950
I don't know.

937
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:17,760
Who knows if you don't know?

938
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,520
Oh, man.

939
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,550
I feel like dying from running.

940
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,070
Check again.

941
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,110
Okay.

942
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,550
What the heck is going on?

943
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,630
My goodness.

944
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,000
Did you do that?

945
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,510
Am I crazy?

946
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,060
Then why is his dead body in there?

947
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,980
I really don't know.

948
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,060
It's your car. How can you not know?

949
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,000
I don't know because I don't know!

950
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,790
That's right!

951
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,450
The black box!

952
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:21,980
Let's check it.

953
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:25,400
We turned it off at night.
The battery was low.

954
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,410
Then what are you going to do?

955
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,290
Are you trying to kill me too?

956
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:34,700
Over... there.

957
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,780
Turn around.

958
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,480
What do we do?

959
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,720
What's that?
Is he looking at us?

960
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,850
Be calm.

961
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,390
Excuse me. I'm going to check your car.

962
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,630
Oh, you're working hard!

963
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,900
Is something going on?

964
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,410
An armed soldier
deserted the base nearby.

965
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,900
Oh.

966
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,750
Oh, man.

967
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,490
We went to the market.

968
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:42,720
Right.

969
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:47,270
Please open the trunk.

970
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,510
Please open the trunk!

971
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:53,980
What are you doing?

972
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:56,920
Excuse me.

973
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:59,400
Please come here.

974
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,130
Just a minute.

975
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,580
Please.

976
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,340
I asked you to open the trunk.
What are you doing?

977
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:17,930
It's okay. Just buy something to eat.

978
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:22,240
Look carefully.
It's not a 5,000 won bill.

979
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,700
Keep up the good work.

980
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:26,290
Over here!

981
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,510
Please come over here.

982
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,420
Honey.
