1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,350
Pretty nice up here, isn't it?

2
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,351
- Kermit?
- Huh?

3
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,159
What if we drift out to sea?

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,869
What if we're never heard from again?
What if there's a storm?

5
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,953
- Or we get struck by lightning?
- That'd be neat.

6
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,794
Listen, nothing's gonna happen.
This is just the opening credits.

7
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,553
Oh. Where are they?

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,551
Wow!

9
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,031
- <i>"The Great Muppet Caper."</i>
- Nice title.

10
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,108
Whoo-wee!

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,794
I'd like to try this without the balloon.

12
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,758
- Try what? Plummeting?
- Yeah!

13
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,593
I suppose you could try it once.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,636
- Kermit?
- Mm?

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,280
How long are these opening credits?

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,158
Just about another minute or so.

17
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,231
My ears are popping.

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,476
I wonder how far you
could plummet before you blacked out.

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,757
Well, don't try it, Gonzo.
We need you for this movie.

20
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,354
Sure is tempting.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,035
- Kermit?
- Huh?

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,998
What does "BSC" stand for?

23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,594
I don't know.

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,677
Gee, a lot of people worked on this movie.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,230
This is nothing.
Wait till you see the end credits.

26
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,639
- Kermit?
- Mm?

27
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,678
- Are the credits over?
- Not quite.

28
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,190
Nobody reads those names
anyway, do they?

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,511
Sure. They all have families.

30
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,555
Ah.

31
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,835
That's it. The sky is clear.

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,754
So, OK. Well, now what do we do?
I mean, how does this movie start?

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,071
- Well, we just pull that rope.
- Yes, sir!

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,952
We're going down!

35
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,349
Heads up, below!

36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,194
What a fantastic beginning.

37
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,632
<i>There'll be spectacle</i>
<i>There'll be fantasy</i>

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,190
<i>There'll be derring-do</i>
<i>and stuff like you have never seen</i>

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,636
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>Yeah. We're gonna be a movie</i>

40
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,678
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- <i>And me</i>

41
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,196
<i>There'll be heroes bold</i>
<i>There'll be comedy</i>

42
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,511
<i>And a lot of fuss</i>
<i>that ends for us real happily</i>

43
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,036
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>We can watch it all develop</i>

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,112
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- <i>And me</i>

45
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,556
<i>We'll take the world</i>
<i>and set it on its ear</i>

46
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,758
<i>Come on. Join in</i>
<i>We're gonna start right here</i>

47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,910
It's OK. I landed on my head.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,991
Come on!

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,672
Here, chicken!

50
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,991
Hey! Why, you...

51
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,638
Whoa!

52
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,190
Hold it!

53
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,352
- Go ahead, Kermit.
- Thank you. See, in this film,

54
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,035
me and Fozzie play crack investigative
reporters for <i>The Daily Chronicle.</i>

55
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,192
And Gonzo, he's our photographer.
And it's gonna be terrific.

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,393
Boy, I wish I were you people,
seeing this for the first time.

57
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,516
Wh?

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,517
- <i>There'll be crooks and cops</i>
- <i>There'll be villainy</i>

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,797
<i>But with us on call</i>
<i>we'll fix it all real easily</i>

60
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,509
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>Wow. It's gonna be terrific</i>

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,990
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- And me.

62
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,150
Argh!

63
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,555
Now, what we need, guys,
is an exciting photo story.

64
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,553
Right this way, young lady.
I'll take a picture of this chicken.

65
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,392
- Beautiful.
- That's great, Gonzo.

66
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,074
Yeah. Smile, chicky babe.

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,957
My jewels! That man stole my jewels!

68
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,429
Help! My jewels!

69
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,270
Look up. Hey, do you wanna
make the front pages or not?

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,237
Kermit, I got a great picture of the chicken.

71
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,150
Oh, good.

72
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,630
<i>There'll be mystery and catastrophe</i>

73
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,156
<i>But it's all in fun</i>
<i>You paid the money. Wait and see</i>

74
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,835
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>Is there any way to stop it?</i>

75
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,469
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

76
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,393
- <i>Everybody and</i>
- <i>Oh...</i>

77
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,270
<i>Me</i>

78
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,352
How could you miss a story like that?

79
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,397
It was right under your noses,
practically bit you on the seat of the pants.

80
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,799
There's just no excuse.

81
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,952
I guess this would be the wrong time
to ask for a raise?

82
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,073
Raise? A raise?

83
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,395
I'll give you a raise!

84
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,159
Did you read these headlines? Huh?

85
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,028
"Jewel heist on Main Street."
And it's nice bold print, isn't it?

86
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,111
- Yes, it's very easy to read.
- Mm.

87
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,956
- Shut up now.
- Sorry.

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,191
"Lady Holiday's Jewels Stolen",
that's what it says in the <i>Times.</i>

89
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,400
And here's the <i>Herald.</i>
"Fashion Queen of London Robbed."

90
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,438
And last but not least...

91
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,914
...here's our cute little banner story.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,912
"Identical Twins Join the <i>Chronicle</i> Staff."

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,468
Now, I ask you,
what paper would you buy?

94
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,873
- I read the one that has "Dear Abby".
- Bah!

95
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,357
Gee, Mr Tarkanian. We thought identical
twins working on a newspaper

96
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,829
- would make an interesting story.
- Yeah.

97
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,313
Well, it doesn't. Especially since
you two guys don't look anything alike.

98
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,278
Well, that's cos Fozzie's not wearing
his hat. Fozzie, put your hat back on.

99
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,432
Oh. Yes, sir. See?

100
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,190
Oh, yeah.

101
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,909
I can see it now. But that's still
no excuse for blowing a story.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,834
- We'll do better next time.
- Next time? Next time?

103
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,150
What makes you think
there's gonna be a next time?

104
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,435
Well, if there isn't
it's gonna be a real short movie.

105
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,112
Look, the only reason I hired you two jerks

106
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,033
was because your old man
was a friend of mine.

107
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,431
Dad spoke well of you too.

108
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,672
Well, I'm as sentimental as the next guy.
That's why I don't want him to hear this.

109
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,035
You're fired.

110
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,715
- Take that thing down off the ceiling.
- Yeah, but, Mr Tarkanian...

111
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,439
- Gonzo.
- Check. Whoo-wee!

112
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,919
Won't you listen to reason, sir?

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,072
I'm not listening to anything
and I'm not giving you your job back.

114
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,879
I don't want you to give us anything.
We just want to go to England

115
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,190
and talk to Lady Holiday -
the woman who was robbed?

116
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,316
And we'll catch those jewel thieves for you.

117
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,709
You see, all you have to do
is pay our way to London.

118
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,630
Oh!

119
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,473
Is that all I have to do?

120
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,596
Well, we could use
some new luggage for the trip.

121
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,318
Luggage?

122
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,949
- Now look, beat it. I got a deadline to meet.
- But how are we gonna get to London?

123
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,397
I'll tell you what, Fozzie, since you're such
an investigative reporter, you figure it out.

124
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,598
- I'm Fozzie.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. The hat.

125
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,752
Stop the presses!

126
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,277
Why? What happened?

127
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,874
I don't know.
I've always wanted to say that.

128
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,190
Look, you guys...

129
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,197
Oh, boy.
It must be 50 below in here.

130
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,236
You're lucky, you have fur.

131
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,997
No, no, no. You're the one with the fur.
Turn on your light and see for yourself.

132
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,672
Oh, yeah!

133
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,796
I keep mixing us up.

134
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,957
I think I'll read for a while.

135
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,798
- I wish I had a book.
- Hey, Kermit?

136
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,758
Can you reach the hostess call button?
I'm hungry.

137
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,434
They don't serve food in ninth class.

138
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,751
What?
$12 and you don't even get a meal?

139
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,399
Hey, could you guys keep it down?
I'm trying to watch the movie.

140
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,477
- Hey, somebody's coming.
- Maybe they're bringing hamburgers.

141
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,950
- All out for England!
- Oh, great, the plane is landing.

142
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,238
- The plane? Nah, the plane lands in Italy.
- Huh?

143
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,788
- You land in England.
- Whoa!

144
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,035
Kermmmmiiitt!

145
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,111
What's happening?

146
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,919
Whoopee!

147
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,878
Geronimo!

148
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,228
Glug!

149
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,356
For once the forecast was right.

150
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,113
It said it was going to rain cats and dogs.

151
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,431
- No, no. We're bears and frogs.
- And Gonzos.

152
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,115
Whatever you are, whoever you are,
welcome to Great Britain.

153
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,395
Great Britain?
We're actually in Great Britain!

154
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,631
Oh, no, we'll never get to England now.

155
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,439
You are in England, my furry friend.

156
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,035
This 'sceptred isle.
This jewel of the North Atlantic.

157
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,917
Oh, good. Well, we're going to London

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,673
and we were wondering
if you could recommend a nice hotel.

159
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,433
- Actually, a cheap hotel.
- How cheap?

160
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,988
- Free.
- That narrows the field a bit. Let's see.

161
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,197
"Places where you can park
your carcasses."

162
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,555
Bus terminals. River banks.

163
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,269
- The Happiness Hotel.
- Happiness Hotel? That sounds great.

164
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,591
What's wrong with bus terminals?

165
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,875
Well, thanks a lot for your help, sir.

166
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,073
Hey, guys, this is London.

167
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,879
Yeah, London!
We made it! Oh, boy!

168
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,757
- Is that the Eiffel Tower?
- Yeah!

169
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,831
- No.
- No, no.

170
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,312
- Hey, Kermit?
- Yeah?

171
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,358
- Are bears allowed in those fountains?
- What?

172
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,158
Are bears allowed in those fountains?

173
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,151
- No, I don't think so.
- I need a bath.

174
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,359
This is terrific.
Wow, look at the scenery.

175
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,069
It's very realistic.
Hey, what's the name of this river?

176
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,072
- I don't know.
- I think it's the English River.

177
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,434
Oh.

178
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,751
I'll take a picture of it.
Say cheese!

179
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,199
Did I get my elbow in the shot?

180
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,556
- Don't worry. It adds human interest.
- But I'm a bear.

181
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,473
- Anyone for the Happiness Hotel?
- Huh?

182
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,516
- Oh, Happiness Hotel!
- That's us!

183
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,034
- Yes, we want the Happiness Hotel.
- Yeah.

184
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,998
Argh!

185
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,074
Wow.

186
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,674
Boy, another crash landing.
That was terrible.

187
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,990
Well, we'll just have to do it again.

188
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,471
Oh, look. The Happiness Hotel.
What do you think, guys?

189
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,515
Wow.

190
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,991
If that's the Happiness Hotel
I'd hate to see what the sad one looks like.

191
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,519
- Excuse me?
- What?

192
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,909
We'd like a room.

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,911
Really?

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,639
Yeah, we'd like to check in.

195
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,951
Somebody's checking in!

196
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,429
Somebody's checking in?

197
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,439
<i>Oh. There's no fire in the fireplace</i>
<i>There's no carpet on the floor</i>

198
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,956
<i>Don't try to order dinner</i>
<i>There's no kitchen any more</i>

199
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,237
<i>But if the road's been kinda bumpy</i>
<i>and you need to rest a spell</i>

200
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,551
<i>Well. Welcome home</i>
<i>to the Happiness Hotel</i>

201
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,150
- Hey, how are you guys fixing to pay?
- What are our choices?

202
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,232
A, credit card. B, cash.

203
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
C, sneak out in the middle of the night.

204
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,038
We'll take C.

205
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,759
Very popular choice.

206
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,149
<i>If you got luggage keep it handy</i>
<i>but you're running out of luck</i>

207
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,789
<i>Cos the bellhops ain't too organised</i>
<i>and the elevator's stuck</i>

208
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,838
<i>Still if you don't mind friendly animals</i>
<i>and can learn to stand the smell</i>

209
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,549
<i>Well. Welcome home</i>
<i>to the Happiness Hotel</i>

210
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,074
You know, I may be mistaken,
but the bellhops look like rats.

211
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,435
You should see the chambermaids.

212
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,718
- <i>Welcome home</i>
- <i>Welcome home</i>

213
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,791
- <i>Welcome home</i>
- <i>Welcome home</i>

214
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,111
<i>No matter where you wander</i>
<i>you will never do as well</i>

215
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,795
<i>OK. The lobby's looking shabby</i>
<i>and it's got the wrong address</i>

216
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,236
<i>And the whole dang thing has</i>
<i>been condemned by American Express</i>

217
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,517
<i>Still the management is cheerful</i>
<i>though the whole joint's gone to hell</i>

218
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,991
<i>Well. Welcome home</i>
<i>to the Happiness Hotel</i>

219
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,234
- You guys live here?
- Yeah, but only between gigs.

220
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,710
So that means we've been here this time,
what, five years?

221
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,952
Yeah, but, like, OK, you know, our agent,
you know, like, he says, I mean, like,

222
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,555
things are really going to break
as soon as we get our new glossies.

223
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,196
Argh!

224
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,316
What's wrong with the drummer?
He looks a little crazed.

225
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,075
Aw, he's just upset about missing the
Rembrandt exhibit at the National Gallery.

226
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,628
Renoir!

227
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,798
- <i>Oh. There are bugs</i>
- <i>There are bugs</i>

228
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,836
- <i>And there are lice</i>
- <i>There are lice</i>

229
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,356
Sure, we have our little problems
but you'll never beat the price

230
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,796
- <i>You got every kind of critter</i>
- <i>You got every kind of pest</i>

231
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,395
But we treat 'em all as equals
just like any other guest

232
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,631
Though you're cleaner than the others
still, as far as we can tell

233
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,792
You'll fit right in to the Happiness Hotel

234
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,352
We'll fit right in to the Happiness Hotel

235
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,193
Say cheese!

236
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,394
You are all weirdos.

237
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,275
Ugh.

238
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,516
Oh, that's just fine right there.

239
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,836
Thank you.

240
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,360
Hey, not bad.

241
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,238
Are you sure we can afford this?

242
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,311
Hey, Kermit, I'm getting hungry.

243
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,595
- Call room service.
- There's no phone.

244
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,514
- That's OK. There's no food either.
- Come on, Rizzo.

245
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,273
Look, why don't we forget about food
and get a good night's sleep?

246
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,909
We have to get up early
to interview Lady Holiday.

247
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,232
Boy, I sure could use something
from one or more of the basic food groups.

248
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,395
We'll have breakfast in the morning.
Right now, let's just be thankful we're here.

249
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,353
Say, this is nice.

250
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,795
Can somebody
turn out the light?

251
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,471
Thank you.

252
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,479
This is Lady Holiday.
Milan speaking? Then put him on.

253
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,869
Oh, yes, darling. Yes, I'm fine.

254
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,509
I had quite a scare.
Thank God I wasn't hurt.

255
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,355
Of course my diamonds were valuable.
All my diamonds are valuable.

256
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,749
Now, darling, I want you
to call the United States and tell <i>Vogue</i>

257
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,354
they can't have the photographs
of the spring line until after the show.

258
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,197
I'm not too happy with some of the designs.
Still have to make some changes.

259
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,839
Well, I'm looking at three of the gowns now
and I can see horrendous mistakes.

260
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,275
Of course Paris should be notified.

261
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,636
Carla. The neckline on that gown
is too high, don't you think?

262
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,915
- I rather like the effect.
- Do you like looking like an ostrich?

263
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,116
- Of course not.
- And Marla.

264
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,918
Too many frills and furbelows.

265
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,231
I don't think we should strive
for the fantail pigeon look, do you?

266
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,869
And you, Darla. That outfit's the pits.

267
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,951
Loose where it should be tight
and tight where it should be loose,

268
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,234
like the folds on a turkey's neck.

269
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,916
Why would I design
such atrocious-looking clothes? Oh!

270
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,276
- I must be getting senile.
- <i>Yes. Lady Holiday?</i>

271
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,238
We have to make drastic changes
in the new line before the show tomorrow.

272
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,313
All my girls are going around
looking like barnyard animals.

273
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,160
Good heavens. Who are you?

274
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,236
My name is Miss Piggy and
I would like to be a high-fashion model.

275
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,391
Doesn't surprise me.
Seems to be the way we're heading.

276
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,314
I've always dreamed
of being a Holiday model.

277
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,313
I have brought my <i>je ne sais quoi</i> and
my portfolio all the way here to London

278
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,598
to see you, the one and only Lady Holiday.

279
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,354
- May I come in?
- Absolutely not.

280
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,391
- May I show you my portfolio?
- No.

281
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,836
Good. Here. You may open it.

282
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,917
Ah.

283
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,197
This is me reeking grandeur.

284
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,953
Being aloof.

285
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,600
Being demure. Ah.

286
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,352
Daring.

287
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,035
- Interesting range of emotions.
- You think so?

288
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,557
Well, as you can see from
this small sampling, modelling is my life.

289
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,313
It is my destiny. I shall accept nothing less.

290
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,870
I can offer you a job as a receptionist.

291
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,748
I'll take it! I'll take it!
Oh, thank you, thank you! Thank you!

292
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,478
Oh! Oh! Oh!

293
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,588
You won't be sorry, I promise. I can type,
I can take shorthand, I can make coffee.

294
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,638
- I can do it all.
- Sit.

295
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,315
- I can sit. I'm very good at sitting.
- Are you quite under control?

296
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,755
Mm, mm, mm, mm!

297
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,994
Now, I'll be lunching with my brother Nicky.

298
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,436
He's second in command here
and he's an irresponsible parasite.

299
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,192
But I had to bring him into the business

300
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,236
because he squandered
his half of the inheritance

301
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,790
and he has categorically no prospects.
Not that he's grateful.

302
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,838
He still gambles and incurs bad debts,
uses my charge accounts,

303
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,595
eats my food and borrows my cars
without asking permission.

304
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,194
And certainly he's not to be trusted.

305
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,511
I wouldn't even put it past him to try to steal
my most valuable and largest jewel,

306
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,750
the fabulous Baseball Diamond.

307
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,072
And I don't know why his bow ties
are always crooked.

308
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,312
- Still, in all, he is my brother.
- Why are you telling me all this?

309
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,356
It's plot exposition. It has to go somewhere.

310
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,477
Anyway, I want you
to answer the telephone while I'm gone

311
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,676
and straighten up the office.

312
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,716
Consider it done.

313
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,359
Everything's under control. Not to sweat.

314
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,278
Carry on. I'll be back in an hour.

315
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,630
Whee!

316
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,836
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

317
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,595
Oh, I am going to be a famous model.
Oh, I'm so happy for me.

318
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,559
Miss Piggy, you are on your way.

319
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,359
Where does Lady Holiday get off
calling me an ostrich?

320
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,796
We'll get even with Lady Holiday tonight
when we steal her necklace.

321
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,395
What are you going to wear
for the robbery?

322
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,434
Hi.

323
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,308
- Hi. Hello.
- Hubba hubba!

324
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,755
Excuse me, where's Lady Holiday's office?

325
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,195
- Round the corner, to the left.
- Oh. Thank you.

326
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,874
- Did you just give directions to a frog?
- I guess I did.

327
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,520
Smile.

328
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,670
Is that a new photographer?

329
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,512
Urgh!

330
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,236
- I think I'm stuck.
- Gonzo? Gonzo!

331
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,276
Gonzo. Gonzo.

332
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,351
Pull.

333
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,599
- Gonzo, are you OK?
- Oh, sure. It was just my nose.

334
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,274
Hey, you guys stay here.
I'll find Lady Holiday.

335
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:17,951
Yes, sir.

336
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,795
Hey, Fozzie. Come on,
get your nose in here. It's really fun.

337
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,832
Mr Holiday? Did you order
a gross of flowered socks?

338
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,596
Oh! What an honour.
You're all so wonderful.

339
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,309
Thank you for choosing <i>moi</i>
as model of the year.

340
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,439
Oh! I never dreamed
when I first began in this business

341
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,080
that I would reach such lofty heights.

342
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,355
Thank you! Thank you!

343
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,715
Excuse me.

344
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,240
So, what do you think
about the drapes, hm?

345
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,959
Personally, I'd rather see shutters. Yes.

346
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,749
And on this wall here...

347
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,430
Lady Holiday?

348
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,316
Lady Holiday?

349
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,831
Gee, are you OK?

350
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,230
I don't think I'll ever be the same.

351
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,754
- Pardon?
- Oh.

352
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,274
I mean, I don't usually fall like that.

353
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,875
I thought it was a very nice fall.
It was quite graceful, actually.

354
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,350
Oh, thank you, whoever you are.

355
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,431
My name is Kermit the Frog

356
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,638
and I've come all the way from America
to interview you for <i>The Daily Chronicle.</i>

357
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,870
Me? Why me?

358
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,951
Because you're Lady Holiday.

359
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,913
Oh. Oh.

360
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,719
Yeah, right. Reason enough.

361
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,552
Um...

362
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,198
You wanna help me
out of this wastebasket?

363
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,076
Oh.

364
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,832
- Oh, yeah.
- Now just pull.

365
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,673
OK.

366
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,035
- Harder.
- OK.

367
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,594
So... listen. Can I ask you
a couple of questions now?

368
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,513
No, no. Um... Not here.

369
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,478
So busy. So much to do.

370
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,313
Well, perhaps we could
have dinner tonight?

371
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,517
Yes. Fine. Swell. See you then.

372
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,273
I'll pick you up at your house.
It must be beautiful.

373
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,316
- I'm sure it is.
- Hm?

374
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,597
- I mean, sure it is!
- Yeah.

375
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,956
So, where do you live?

376
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,837
Um...

377
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,115
Guess!

378
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,430
Probably some highbrow street
somewhere.

379
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,559
Highbrow Street, absolutely right.
Highbrow Street.

380
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,350
How did you guess? Are you psychic?
But now, guess what number.

381
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,637
I don't know. Number 17?

382
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,915
Yes, all right. 17 Highbrow Street.

383
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,719
OK. I'll pick you up at, shall we say...

384
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,836
- eight o'clock?
- 5:30?

385
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,751
- 4:15?
- 9:20?

386
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,149
- Seven o'clock.
- OK. That was easy.

387
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,992
- Yes, easy.
- OK, well I'll see you later.

388
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,514
Yes. Eight o'clock.

389
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,875
- Seven.
- Seven, seven.

390
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,031
Well, um...

391
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,078
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

392
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,628
Adios, <i>mon chéri.</i>

393
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,672
Much obliged.

394
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,957
So, Kermit, tell me, what about
Lady Holiday? I mean, is she pretty?

395
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,591
Oh, yeah. Not at all what I expected.
Nice eyes, sturdy legs.

396
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,593
And it might have been my imagination,
but I think she found me attractive.

397
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,159
Oh. Taxi!

398
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,630
Well, of course she found you attractive.
It runs in the family.

399
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,917
Taxi! Taxi!

400
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,710
- I don't know why the cabs won't stop.
- Just leave it to me.

401
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,189
Taxiiii!

402
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,190
That's very effective.

403
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,475
Yeah, it's great when it works.

404
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,792
- Did you want me to stop or what?
- Thank you very much, sir.

405
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,110
Oh, you can call me Beauregard.

406
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,998
- Where are you guys going?
- The Happiness Hotel.

407
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,470
Oh, good, that's where I'm going.
How do you get there?

408
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,996
- Haven't you ever been there?
- Of course. I live there.

409
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,071
I just don't know how to get there.

410
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,277
- It's straight down this street.
- OK.

411
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,513
- OK. Good. Now just keep going straight.
- Will do.

412
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,679
It takes a while to get to know the town.

413
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,957
- How long have you lived in London?
- All my life.

414
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,792
How come you don't have
an English accent?

415
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,519
Hey, I'm lucky to have a driver's license.

416
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,832
- Hey, it's just up ahead there on the right.
- What is?

417
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,912
- The Happiness Hotel.
- Oh, yeah.

418
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,991
What's your room number?

419
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,230
Wh? I don't know.
We're on the second floor.

420
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,552
Oh, I'm sorry. I can only take you
as far as the lobby.

421
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,560
Whee!

422
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,080
You can never find a cab
when you need one.

423
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,038
Whoo-whee!

424
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,918
- Can we do that again?
- Well, thank you very much, Beauregard.

425
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,150
You're welcome.
Hey, how do I get out of here?

426
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,277
I suggest you make a U-turn.

427
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,920
Right.

428
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,712
- He's headed for the kitchen!
- Oh, no!

429
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,156
Well, looks like steering wheel soufflé
for dinner.

430
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,878
Again?

431
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,951
If you'll excuse me, I'm going out to dinner.

432
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,713
That's right. Kermit's got a date
with Lady Holiday.

433
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,429
- You don't have to tell everybody.
- Oh. Right.

434
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,478
Pops, don't tell anybody.
Kermit's got a date with Lady Holiday.

435
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,949
Kermit's got a date
with Lady Holiday?

436
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,952
Oh, wow. Wait till I tell
the guys in the band.

437
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,998
- Tell us what?
- Yeah, what's going down?

438
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,349
Kermit and Lady Holiday? All right!

439
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,676
Fozzie, this is all very embarrassing.

440
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,638
Kermit, don't worry.
It won't go outside this room.

441
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,392
Here is a Muppet news flash.
Kermit the Frog to date Lady Holiday.

442
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,074
Details at 11.

443
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,270
Smile.

444
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,919
Local poultry.

445
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,118
Boy, it's a good thing you didn't
tell everybody where Lady Holiday lives

446
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,270
otherwise they'd all
be camped on her doorstep.

447
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,591
That is just for you and me to know,
brother.

448
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,276
We are going to have ourselves
a time tonight. Wacka wacka.

449
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,352
- "We"? What do you mean "we"?
- The two of us. You missed a spot.

450
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,670
Anyway. When we get there tonight,
just act naturally.

451
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
No, no. Wait a second, wait a second.
It's when <i>I get there.

452
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,679
This is my date with Lady Holiday.
I'm going alone. So it's "me" not "we".

453
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,034
Oh.

454
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,317
I see. Fine.

455
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,755
Boy, I wish I had whiskers.

456
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,876
Of course, then I'd have to use a blade.

457
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,554
Kermit? Turn around.

458
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,269
Are you really
going to go without me tonight?

459
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,433
Well, Fozzie, I figure
this is something that I have to do alone.

460
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,398
No problem.

461
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,392
- Oh good. Just hand me my cuff links.
- Yes, sir.

462
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,755
<i>And straighten my tie</i>

463
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,515
<i>Just drench me in rich cologne</i>
<i>and don't ask me why</i>

464
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,476
<i>Go on and pluck me a boutonniere</i>

465
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,199
<i>You're moving up and walking on air</i>

466
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,159
<i>Steppin' out with a star and feeling high</i>

467
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,475
<i>Come polish my wing tips</i>

468
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,154
<i>And call for the car</i>

469
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,996
<i>I'll sweep her right off her feet</i>
<i>wherever we are</i>

470
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,510
<i>A satin collar and velvet vest</i>

471
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,830
<i>I never settle for second best</i>

472
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,549
<i>Steppin' out with a star</i>
<i>Sad times. Bye-bye</i>

473
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,074
<i>Have I got style?</i>

474
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,549
<i>Have I got taste?</i>

475
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:58,755
<i>On someone else. I swear.</i>
<i>This savoir-faire would be such a waste</i>

476
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,508
- <i>Come toss me my top hat</i>
- Yes, sir!

477
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,909
<i>I'm ready to fly</i>

478
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,357
<i>Busting into the upper crust</i>
<i>as easy as pie</i>

479
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,069
<i>Just watch my dreams come true</i>

480
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,435
<i>This is something I was born to do</i>

481
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,433
<i>Steppin' out with a star</i>
<i>That star is you</i>

482
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,029
- <i>Have you got class?</i>
- <i>Have I got class?</i>

483
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,395
- <i>Have you got chic?</i>
- <i>Have I got chic?</i>

484
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,156
<i>To think that you and me</i>
<i>were nobody. Why. Only last week</i>

485
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,992
Hey, guys!

486
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,152
<i>I'm ready to flyyyyyy</i>

487
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,071
- Kermit!
- At least I can try.

488
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,515
<i>Just watch my dreams come true</i>

489
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,830
<i>This is something I was born to do</i>

490
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,354
<i>Steppin' out with a star</i>
<i>Bye. Bad times</i>

491
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,749
<i>Steppin' out with a star</i>
<i>Hey. Good times</i>

492
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,628
<i>Steppin' out with a star and feeling high</i>

493
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,237
Yeah!

494
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,595
Well, how do I look?

495
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,755
Which one are you?

496
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,035
- I'm the one on the right.
- Oh.

497
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,908
Well, y... you look like you're gonna
have a terrific time.

498
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,514
Without me.

499
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,909
- Fozzie?
- What?

500
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,195
You can come.

501
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,032
- You mean it?
- Mm-hm.

502
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,475
Oh, boy!

503
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,393
Great news, gang. We can go!

504
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,594
Awfully disappointing weather today.

505
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,671
Hm?

506
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,479
The weather. Awfully disappointing today.

507
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,951
Is it, is it? Yes. Mm, yes, yes.
I know what you mean.

508
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,273
It was rather disappointing yesterday.

509
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,749
And the day before.

510
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,633
What is it, Neville?

511
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,590
Um...

512
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,033
Pig... um... climbing up
the outside of the house, dear.

513
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,155
Oh.

514
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,951
Next time they want stunts
they get a double.

515
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,635
The day before that
was awfully disappointing too.

516
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,358
Mm.

517
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,353
And of course the weekend was
perfectly frightful. Never stopped raining.

518
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,840
- Neville?
- Hm?

519
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,514
- Am I boring you?
- What, dear?

520
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,230
- I said, am I boring you?
- Boring me?

521
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,552
That's a good one.
I'm having the time of my life, dear.

522
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:14,430
Neville, did you say... a <i>pig</i>
was climbing up the outside of the house?

523
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,833
- Yes. Yes. Yes, I believe I did, yes.
- I thought so.

524
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,718
You'd have to look a long way
to find a chap

525
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,839
who was more... stimulated than I am, yes.

526
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,593
Oh, dear me, no, no, no.

527
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,556
The last time I was bored -
and never by you, my little armada...

528
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,835
- What was that?
- Just making a point, dear.

529
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,229
I mean, if I was bored I'd go out
and buy something, wouldn't I?

530
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,995
Like cheese or quails' eggs.

531
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,753
- Something like that.
- Yes, I suppose you would.

532
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,073
Yes, of course I would, dear. That's
the sort of spur-of-the-moment fellow I am.

533
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,196
What?

534
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,189
- What, dear?
- What would you buy if you were bored?

535
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,673
Ah! Uh...

536
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,999
A jar of calf's-foot jelly?

537
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,715
I'd like to come with you
and help you pick one out.

538
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,872
Oh, that isn't necessary, Dorcas.
There's no need for you to leave the house.

539
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,396
I wouldn't mind.
Haven't been outside for 12 years.

540
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,914
Well, the weather's
been most disappointing.

541
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,753
Still, there's no reason
for me to stay here all the time.

542
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,990
The children are gone, the pets are dead,

543
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,038
the butler's been discharged,
no one ever visits us.

544
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,075
That was the doorbell, Neville.

545
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,639
So it was.

546
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,190
- And the butler's dead?
- No, no, no.

547
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,034
The pets are dead.
The butler's been discharged.

548
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,111
Ah.

549
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,157
- I think one of us should answer it, Neville.
- Oh, do you?

550
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,234
Or we could both answer it.

551
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,312
Come, dear, I hardly think it's necessary
for both of us to...

552
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,675
I'll answer it!

553
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,996
I thought you said the pets were dead.

554
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,189
- Hello.
- Uh...

555
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,316
This is for you.

556
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,949
Oh, thank you. Shall we go?

557
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,555
You know, I've never been inside
a real ritzy English house before.

558
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,188
- Aren't you hungry?
- Sure, but we've got a few minutes.

559
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,919
OK. Let's take a few minutes.

560
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,275
- Say, nice place you got here.
- Yes. I practically stole it.

561
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,754
Let me show you around.

562
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,833
- Who was that guy back there?
- Oh. Just some sort of servant.

563
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,911
This, of course, is the drawing room.

564
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,833
Did you decorate this place yourself?

565
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,316
I'll just close the door.
It's very draughty.

566
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,550
There's a chair and some walls.

567
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,154
- A whirlwind tour, huh?
- Yes.

568
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,630
This is the bedroom and, uh... bath.

569
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,750
We have hot and cold running water.

570
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,355
There's probably a bathtub and everything.

571
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,313
Oh, here. I want to show you something.
This is the closet.

572
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,555
Nice. Dark but nice.

573
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,230
Ah. Sorry.

574
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,911
Don't think me rude, but is there,
in fact, anything I can do for you at all?

575
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,511
Um...

576
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,558
Yes. Yes, yes.

577
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,234
You may suggest a nice restaurant.

578
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,709
Ah. Well, there's the Dubonnet Club.

579
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,678
Actually that's not so much a restaurant,
more a supper club.

580
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,795
Ah.

581
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,714
Thank you, Jeeves. No time for cocktails.

582
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,109
Evening.

583
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,155
Why are you staring into the closet,
Neville?

584
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,198
You recall that pig I mentioned?

585
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,713
The one that was climbing
up the side of the house?

586
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,519
- That's the chap. That's the chap.
- Yes, I seem to recall that.

587
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,388
Well, he was in there just now,
along with a... a lizard.

588
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,675
I see. And what did they want?

589
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,718
Name of a good restaurant.
I told them the Dubonnet Club.

590
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,631
That's more of a supper club
than a restaurant.

591
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,392
Yes, well, I tried to tell them that.

592
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,995
- Don't blame yourself.
- No.

593
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,354
No.

594
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,519
Hey! There they are!

595
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,875
Kermit and his new flame.

596
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,713
- Hubba hubba.
- Ding ding!

597
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,958
You'll have to jump in the front seat.
The back seat's been quarantined.

598
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,238
Let's hit the road.
How about a little travelling music?

599
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,313
- For sure. A love song.
- Love song, love song.

600
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,995
Hit it!

601
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,152
<i>Give me my good friends</i>
<i>and play me my music</i>

602
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,470
<i>Yeah. Give me my night life</i>

603
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,759
<i>Talk me that guitar</i>
<i>and roll me that boogie</i>

604
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,229
<i>Yeah. Give me my night life</i>

605
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,073
- Are these your friends?
- Just the ones on the fenders.

606
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,952
<i>Sing me the good times</i>
<i>cos I need the feeling</i>

607
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,429
<i>Yeah. Give me that night life</i>

608
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,837
<i>Give me my night life</i>

609
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,990
<i>Whoo. Yeah</i>

610
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,149
<i>Give me my night life</i>

611
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,393
- They don't have to play this loud.
- That's OK. They don't mind.

612
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,397
<i>Sing me the good times</i>
<i>cos I need the feeling</i>

613
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,789
<i>Give me my night life</i>

614
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,869
<i>Give me my night life</i>

615
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,669
Boy, a classy place like this you'd think
they'd have pretzels on the table.

616
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,029
Well, what a delightful menu.

617
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,157
- What?
- Nothing. It's just sort of amusing

618
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,756
that the roast beef is the same price
as an Oldsmobile.

619
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,831
You come here often, Lady Holiday?

620
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,832
Oh, only on special <i>occasions.</i>

621
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,639
And this is very special, Kermie.

622
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,109
Waiter! Champagne, caviar.

623
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,875
Hey, hey, Kermit.
How are we gonna pay for this?

624
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,717
- You got about 1600 bucks on you?
- Hey, relax, Kermit. I'll take care of it.

625
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,312
Say cheese!

626
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,550
There you go, folks. Souvenir photograph.

627
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,632
Just gimme your name and address
and ten bucks.

628
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,834
Good evening, Lady Holiday.
Such a pleasure to see you.

629
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,754
- Thank you, Stanley.
- Why, what a lovely diamond necklace.

630
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,476
It is rather breathtaking, isn't it?

631
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,792
I thought it a little outré, but my brother
Nicky insisted that I wear it.

632
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,755
Your table, Lady Holiday.

633
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,956
Thank you, Stanley.
Give Stanley a tip, Nicky.

634
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,998
- For complimenting you on your necklace?
- No, because it is customary.

635
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,674
- I don't have any change.
- Then give him something bigger.

636
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,829
Bigger?

637
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,356
- I left my wallet at home.
- You left your wallet in college.

638
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,715
How about you, folks?
Souvenir photograph?

639
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,755
No thanks. No picture.

640
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,752
Aw, come on. It'll be a great memento
for you and your wife.

641
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,671
My wife isn't feeling very well.

642
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,194
That's too bad.
Maybe she should be at home.

643
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,635
My wife is at home.

644
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,518
Yes. Next table!

645
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,392
That caviar was yummy. Mwah!

646
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,155
Love those fish eggs!

647
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,471
- Uh, Lady Holiday?
- Oh. Yes?

648
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,676
Can we talk about the jewel robbery now?

649
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,593
Oh, Kermit. Let us not talk business.

650
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,310
Music is in the air, the night is young,
and I'm so beautiful.

651
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,074
- What jewel robbery?
- Your jewels. The ones that were stolen.

652
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,914
You know, you have lovely eyes.

653
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,149
You know, if you put enough sugar
in this stuff it tastes just like ginger ale.

654
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,957
Catch you later, Stanley.
Aren't you happy we're here?

655
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,112
I have grave doubts
about wearing these jewels.

656
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,316
I feel as if thieves
were breathing down my neck.

657
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,118
Thieves aren't breathing down your neck.

658
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,633
- I want to put them in a safe.
- No.

659
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,914
- Yes.
- Yes, I meant yes.

660
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,070
Why would I say no when I meant yes?

661
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,752
- Go and see Stanley.
- Go and see Stanley?

662
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,436
- Go and see Stanley immediately.
- All right. If that's what you want.

663
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,274
- And don't forget to tip him.
- Tip. Tip.

664
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,710
<i>The first time you see her</i>

665
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,190
<i>No bolt from the blue</i>

666
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,636
<i>Just something so quiet</i>

667
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,269
<i>Yet waiting for you</i>

668
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,796
<i>With no one to tell you</i>

669
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,031
<i>That you've got to go</i>

670
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:32,752
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

671
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,870
<i>The first time you see her</i>

672
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,350
<i>No magical change</i>

673
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,796
<i>No angels appearing</i>

674
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,839
<i>No dreams to arrange</i>

675
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,912
<i>Just warmer and colder</i>

676
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,436
<i>Than springtime or snow</i>

677
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,071
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

678
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,349
<i>And so you fall</i>

679
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,716
<i>And how complete it is</i>

680
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,078
<i>And for each moment that it lasts</i>

681
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,550
<i>How sweet it is</i>

682
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,076
<i>The first time together</i>

683
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,596
<i>How simple. How rare</i>

684
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,194
<i>And just when you thought</i>

685
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,717
<i>You'd forgot how to care</i>

686
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,190
<i>And though you feel much more</i>

687
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,716
<i>Than you dare to show</i>

688
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,999
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

689
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,350
Wow. She's fantastic.

690
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,718
<i>The first time you see her</i>

691
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,917
<i>No magical change</i>

692
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,231
<i>No angels appearing</i>

693
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,517
<i>No dreams to arrange</i>

694
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,637
<i>Just warmer and colder</i>

695
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,757
<i>Than springtime or snow</i>

696
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,879
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

697
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,428
What a great number!

698
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,119
Nicky?

699
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,316
That's my new receptionist
dancing out there.

700
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,868
- Which one?
- The pig.

701
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,556
- She's sensational.
- 45 words a minute. About average.

702
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,510
<i>And just when you thought</i>

703
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:00,357
- <i>You'd forgot how to care</i>
- <i>For the first time</i>

704
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,000
<i>For the first time</i>

705
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,799
A-ha!

706
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,312
<i>The first time it happens</i>

707
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,312
<i>The moment it happens</i>

708
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,437
<i>Then suddenly there's a whole new world</i>

709
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,114
<i>The first time it happens</i>

710
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,352
<i>The first time it happens</i>

711
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:44,429
<i>The first time it happens</i>

712
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,193
<i>You know</i>

713
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,550
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

714
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,155
Aieee!

715
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,435
Lady Holiday! What's happened?

716
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,274
- Was it you that screamed, "Aieee!"?
- She screamed right into my ear.

717
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,590
Of course I screamed.
Somebody's just stolen my necklace.

718
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,114
I told you this would happen.
That necklace was worth a fortune.

719
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,838
- Do something.
- What do you want me to do?

720
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,639
I spilled ketchup all over my cummerbund.

721
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,790
For God's sake. Straighten that tie.

722
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,634
It's Lady Holiday, her necklace,
it's been stolen.

723
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,188
"Lady Holiday"? But I thought...

724
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,158
Kermit. I think I've got a picture of the thief.

725
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,198
- Oh, great.
- Yeah!

726
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,271
But...

727
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,995
This is great, Gonzo. You popped the flash
just before the soup landed on his tie.

728
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,275
Yeah, well, photography's an art.

729
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,272
You gotta have the right film,
you gotta have the right exposure,

730
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,158
and you gotta scream
just before they get the food to their mouth.

731
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,279
What's going on in there? Lot
of folks out here want to use the rest room.

732
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,113
Well, we're developing these pictures.
We'll be out as soon as we finish.

733
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,475
- We're trying to catch a jewel thief.
- A jewel thief.

734
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,232
Well, catch him in another room.

735
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,676
People are dancing up and down
on one leg out here.

736
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,150
Hurry, Gonzo. There's gotta be a picture of
somebody taking Lady Holiday's necklace.

737
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,119
Well, I don't know.
I still think that pig took it.

738
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,919
- She wouldn't steal.
- Why not? She lied.

739
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,719
That's two different things. Besides,
she couldn't have stolen the necklace

740
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,916
because she was dancing.

741
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,790
That's right. There's that old adage: You
can't dance and steal at the same time.

742
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,713
No, that's "You can't walk
and chew gum at the same time."

743
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,554
Oh, no. I think it's "You can't pat your head
and rub your stomach at the same time."

744
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,437
What's the difference?
She didn't steal the necklace.

745
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,873
- I bet you I can do it.
- Do what?

746
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,269
Pat my head and rub my stomach
at the same time.

747
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,511
Big deal, anybody can do that.

748
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,789
Would you guys cut it out?
We're wasting time.

749
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,198
- Hey, here it is.
- What? What? What? What?

750
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,635
Look at that.
It's that guy sitting next to Lady Holiday

751
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,948
and those girls standing in the back.

752
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,793
It's probably the same gang
that pulled that first job.

753
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,517
Wow!

754
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,354
Yes, and we got them
with their hands in the cookie jar.

755
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,116
- What's going on?
- What is this, anyway?

756
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,430
Aw.

757
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,592
The cookie jar just busted.

758
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,270
- Look, Dad. There's a bear.
- No, Christine, that's a frog.

759
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,430
Bears wear hats.

760
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,754
How you doing, young fella?

761
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,910
OK, I guess.

762
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,389
Penny for your thoughts.

763
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,630
Well, it's a long story.

764
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,075
- But a familiar one, I bet.
- Mm.

765
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,913
Older than the hills.

766
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,959
I've been there, my friend.
I've been there and back.

767
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,237
You know, I see the way you're sitting here

768
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,392
and I see the way you've got your hand
around that little shoe, and that's all I need.

769
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,597
- I know your whole story.
- You do?

770
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,356
Absolutely.
I know exactly what happened to you.

771
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,908
- What?
- Well, I tell you, friend.

772
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,595
What happened was
you and your brother-in-law Bernie,

773
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,389
you cashed in your stock certificates
and your insurance policy

774
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,189
and you went out and bought
a dry-cleaning establishment.

775
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,319
Now another place opens up
down the street and it's charging less.

776
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,119
And they're getting the stuff out faster
because they got more help.

777
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,272
It's not your fault. Right?

778
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,715
All right. So Bernie comes to you, he says:

779
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,872
"I want you to buy me out."
He says he's fed up.

780
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,997
Well, your kids are growing up,
you never see 'em

781
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,674
and all of a sudden,
they're turning into juvenile delinquents

782
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,875
and your wife is saying to you:

783
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,589
"Listen, you care more about this
lousy business than you care about me."

784
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,990
And the equipment breaks down
and your sister moves in with you

785
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,753
because that jerk Bernie,
he went and joined the circus.

786
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,115
Well, you had it up to here, right?

787
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,350
You didn't know what to do.

788
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,228
So what did you do?
You did the only thing you could do.

789
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,311
You dumped the business for a song.

790
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,277
- And who did you sell it to?
- Who?

791
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,990
You sold it to that jerk down the street, that
slob that had been burying you for a year.

792
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,310
Then you took whatever money
you had left

793
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,312
and you sunk it
into the glass slipper business.

794
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,631
That's your story, my friend.
Not a happy one, is it?

795
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,071
You know, it's amazing.
You are 100 per cent wrong.

796
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,390
I mean, nothing you've said has been right.

797
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,710
Oh, yeah?

798
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,876
Well, how about this?

799
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,475
I hate to be rude,
but we're trying to do a movie here.

800
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,596
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

801
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,672
Oh, I didn't know that. Gee, I'm sorry.

802
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,149
Listen, one thing, son.

803
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,838
Would you like to buy a watch?

804
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,596
No.

805
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,712
Movie stars.

806
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,112
Get your filthy hands off me!

807
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:49,197
- I beg your pardon, young lady!
- Just keep your hands to yourself, turkey.

808
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,158
Hey, you.

809
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,472
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the fake Lady Holiday.

810
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,549
Hello.

811
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,910
"Hello"? Last night
you never even said goodbye.

812
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,390
Kermit, that was just silliness.

813
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,392
But you lied to me. You used me.

814
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,397
Oh, Kermit, please,
let me explain. Kermit.

815
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,790
- My name is Miss Piggy. I am a model.
- Yeah.

816
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,077
I only lied because I wanted to be with you.

817
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,118
Yeah, well, I saw the way
you were dancing with that guy last night.

818
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,555
- Oh, Kermit.
- Well, lemme tell you something.

819
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,919
Your dancing partner happens to be
a jewel thief. What do you think of that?

820
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,436
- You're jealous.
- I am not.

821
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,193
You are. You are, you are, you are, you are.

822
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,513
Kermit, I'm sorry.
Please don't go, Kermit. Please.

823
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,876
Please don't go. Kermit, please.
Oh, please, I'm sorry. Please.

824
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,791
- Piggy. Piggy, hold it.
- Please, please, please.

825
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,314
- Piggy. Piggy?
- Please, please, please.

826
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,356
- You're overacting.
- What?

827
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,715
You're overacting. You're hamming it up.

828
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,234
I am not. I am trying to save this movie.

829
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,390
Oh, yeah?
Well, save your performance instead.

830
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,155
- I am playing 800 different emotions.
- Well, try to play one of them right.

831
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,435
Oh, oh! I have a career of my own.

832
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,398
- I know all about your career, Pig.
- I don't need this lousy duck pond here.

833
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,118
- Sure you don't need a lousy duck pond.
- I'll just walk.

834
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,634
- OK, sure. Go ahead, walk. OK?
- Should I walk? Then I'll walk.

835
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,950
Walk! Go ahead and walk.

836
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,590
Oh, Piggy.

837
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,349
- Listen.
- I'm doing my best.

838
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,193
I know you are.

839
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,158
Piggy, I'm sorry.

840
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,835
- We gotta get back to the movie though.
- All right. All right, all right, all right.

841
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,876
Kermit, I'm sorry I left you
last night at the nightclub.

842
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,520
Well, that's OK, Piggy.

843
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,069
- Oh, Kermie.
- Oh, Piggy.

844
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,396
<i>Pretty day. Sunny sky</i>

845
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,075
<i>Lovely pictures dance in your eye</i>

846
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,994
<i>It all seems so right</i>

847
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,197
<i>It all feels so rare</i>

848
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,669
<i>Summer soft sudden breeze</i>

849
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,639
<i>Watch the wind play tag in the trees</i>

850
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,110
<i>The world is so bright</i>

851
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,433
<i>So perfectly fair</i>

852
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,910
<i>Lovers sing. Children dance</i>

853
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,470
<i>For a minute. We've got a chance</i>

854
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,469
<i>Why couldn't we fly?</i>

855
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,111
<i>I know we'd get by</i>

856
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,273
<i>Couldn't we fly?</i>

857
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,555
<i>Sunny sky. Pretty day</i>

858
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,428
<i>Just a push and we're on the way</i>

859
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,990
<i>Yes. Couldn't we ride</i>

860
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,073
<i>Side by side?</i>

861
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,031
Whoa!

862
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,589
Whoa!

863
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,597
"Look, Ma, no brains."

864
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,195
Hup. Whoo, Miss Piggy.

865
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,556
Whoa!

866
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,793
Wah! Oof!

867
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,515
<i>Why couldn't we fly?</i>

868
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,276
<i>I know we'd get by</i>

869
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,194
- <i>Sunny sky</i>
- <i>Pretty day</i>

870
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,193
<i>Just a push and we're on the way</i>

871
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,670
<i>Yes. Couldn't we ride</i>

872
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,594
<i>Side by side?</i>

873
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:24,312
<i>Couldn't we ride?</i>

874
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,558
Gangway! Watch it. Coming through.

875
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,835
She's wonderful. She's so wonderful.

876
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,992
She certainly seems to know
where she's going. It's time.

877
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,348
All right, everybody.
Keep it moving. Don't linger.

878
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,476
We just want to give them a hint,
a taste, a soupçon.

879
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,357
Appetisers not four-course meals.

880
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,874
Marie. I don't think we should chew gum.

881
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:04,036
Stephanie, those false eyelashes are
coming unglued. Those shoes are scuffed.

882
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,509
- I know where they are. I'll get them...
- Sorry.

883
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,717
Watch it, buster. Oh. Mr Holiday, I'm sorry.

884
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,677
Hello.

885
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,988
- Miss...
- Piggy.

886
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,229
- Miss Piggy?
- Right.

887
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,276
Of course.

888
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,238
Have dinner with me tonight.

889
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,675
Mr Holiday, really, I'm very busy.

890
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,479
- Could we meet just for a moment?
- Underwear, underwear, underwear.

891
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,313
Just one brief moment, Miss Piggy. Miss...

892
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,150
Hm?

893
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,834
Miss Piggy.

894
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,912
You're a very different-looking woman.

895
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,276
I'm so tired of the same type.
Those tall, thin creatures

896
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,591
with the long legs, the aquiline noses,

897
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:44,150
the teeth like pearls, soft skin.

898
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,755
Yeah, well, I can see why
that might make you sick to your stomach.

899
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,637
- Please now... Please...
- Miss Piggy.

900
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,632
No! Please! No. Please, please.

901
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,916
Don't put a door between us.

902
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,154
- Hi.
- Oh, Kermit.

903
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,755
I was looking for the men's room.

904
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,798
Kermit, I just want you to meet someone.
This is Nicky Holiday.

905
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,838
Mr Holiday,
this is Kermit, my special friend.

906
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,953
Oh.

907
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,594
Nice to meet you.

908
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,069
Well, excuse me.

909
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,998
- Need I say more?
- He's a frog, isn't he?

910
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,955
Yes.

911
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,630
Miss Piggy.

912
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,315
We could've had something
very, very special.

913
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,596
Now, I can't be responsible
for what might happen.

914
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,114
Yeah, well, uh...

915
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,589
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

916
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,989
I don't know why you love her like you do.

917
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:50,390
I don't know why. I just do.

918
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,516
Well, you'd better snap out of it, and fast.

919
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,034
We've got to plant the goods on her
to take the heat off us.

920
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,190
I know the plan.
I just wish there was another way.

921
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,192
It's the only way. Especially now
the cops are starting to ask questions.

922
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,909
OK, I'll do my job.
When I give the signal, you do yours.

923
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,231
Forgive me, Miss Piggy.

924
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:12,038
- Am I dressed right for this?
- You look fine, Fozzie.

925
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,236
Thank you.

926
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,835
And now,
without further ado,

927
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,878
roses, hyacinths,

928
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,032
lilacs and bluebells

929
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:28,079
- make up our first fashion bouquet.
- Ooh!

930
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,594
- Pretty nice lines, huh?
- Yes and the dresses aren't bad either.

931
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,353
Here's capricious Carla,

932
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,591
a dream in hyacinth-blue chiffon

933
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:43,117
with the classic allure
of the white pleated collar and cuffs.

934
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,475
The skirt, a flutter of godets,

935
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,916
all complemented
by the cloudy folds of blue

936
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,754
forming the perfect flower-framing hat.

937
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,593
<i>Fantastique.</i> And thank you, Carla.

938
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,389
- Pretty good-looking duds.
- I found the white pleated collar alluring,

939
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,234
but I was rather taken aback
by the flutter of godets.

940
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,639
Mm-hm.

941
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:09,149
And now here's delicious Darla

942
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,196
in a swirl of apricot silk

943
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,034
above a tight bodice
with a cleverly-draped décolletage.

944
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:21,000
Finishing with roses to match the
confection of flowers and silk on her head,

945
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,038
forming a teeny-weeny hat.

946
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,638
Oh. Ow! My knee. I think I've twisted it.

947
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,950
You all right? You've got to get up!
You've got to go on!

948
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,349
I can't go on!

949
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,749
Oh! You poor thing.

950
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,276
Oh, don't worry, Marla.
I'll stay right here with you.

951
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,035
You can't. You've got to go on in her place.

952
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,078
And now, the Lady Holiday
swimwear collection.

953
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,436
Hey, Waldorf, wake up.
Here come the bikinis.

954
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,193
Oh, boy. We'd better
synchronise our pacemakers.

955
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:06,196
A cloud of lavender starburst pleating
surrounds our next model.

956
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,192
Oh, I say!

957
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,677
<i>A miracle of spring</i>

958
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,832
<i>A miracle of beauty</i>

959
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:16,916
<i>Be dazzled by the magic of one smile</i>

960
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,958
<i>A vision of loveliness</i>

961
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,315
<i>A universe of charms</i>

962
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,918
<i>We'll never rest until you're in our arms</i>

963
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,398
<i>Daffodils. Miss Piggy</i>

964
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,836
<i>Whippoorwills. Miss Piggy</i>

965
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:49,314
<i>Everything that's lovely.</i>
<i>Warm and spring. Miss Piggy</i>

966
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,710
<i>Fantasy. Miss Piggy</i>

967
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,917
<i>Ecstasy. Miss Piggy</i>

968
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,798
<i>All that's fair or fine or wonderful</i>

969
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,190
<i>Or anything. Miss Piggy</i>

970
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:08,037
<i>Where does the rapture</i>
<i>begin and grow?</i>

971
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:14,992
<i>Where does devotion and passion go?</i>

972
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,356
<i>Happiness. Miss Piggy</i>

973
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,716
<i>One caress. Miss Piggy</i>

974
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:25,793
<i>All the world's ever wanted was you</i>

975
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,633
<i>A dream come true</i>

976
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:33,032
<i>Oh. Miss Piggy. It's you</i>

977
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:53,634
<i>Where does the rapture</i>
<i>begin and grow?</i>

978
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:59,636
<i>Where does devotion and passion go?</i>

979
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,956
<i>Happiness. Miss Piggy</i>

980
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,157
<i>One caress. Miss Piggy</i>

981
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:11,358
<i>All the world's ever wanted was you</i>

982
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,954
<i>A dream come true</i>

983
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:28,278
<i>Oh. Miss Piggy. It's you</i>

984
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,078
<i>It's you</i>

985
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,397
<i>It's you</i>

986
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,194
Oh, Miss Piggy, are you OK?

987
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,910
Yeah, sure.
I was just looking for my contact lens.

988
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,554
Excuse me. Excuse me.

989
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,598
Oh, dear. Oh, you poor thing.

990
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,240
Excuse me. Here, put this on.

991
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,117
- You'll get a chill.
- Thank you very much.

992
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,474
- You all right?
- I don't know what happened.

993
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,630
I must've tripped.

994
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,029
Wait a minute. What's this?

995
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,590
I don't think these belong to me.

996
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,069
Do you recognise this?

997
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,072
That was my necklace.
But... where are the diamonds?

998
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:33,039
- Where are the diamonds?
- Miss Piggy stole my necklace.

999
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,795
- Miss Piggy, how could you?
- No! No! I don't know anything about it!

1000
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,077
Somebody must've put it... You!

1001
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,754
- It was you! Kermit was right there!
- Oh, no, no, no!

1002
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,354
You're a phoney! Yes you are.

1003
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:50,592
And you know what? You can't even sing!
Your voice was dubbed.

1004
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,274
Watch out, guys. Kermit!

1005
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,510
Don't worry, Miss Piggy.
We'll get you out of this.

1006
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,239
It just goes to show
you can't trust anybody.

1007
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,709
Excuse me, Lady Holiday,
will you be hiring any more pigs?

1008
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,598
Well, I shall certainly think twice about it.

1009
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:07,275
Kermit, find out if they'll let me
keep the costumes.

1010
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:10,113
What about your most famous piece of
jewellery, the fabulous Baseball Diamond?

1011
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,634
As from Monday,
the fabulous Baseball Diamond

1012
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,439
will go on permanent display
at the Mallory Gallery.

1013
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,798
I shall never have it either on my person
or in my possession again.

1014
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,598
That's right. It'll be in our possession.

1015
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,716
Tuesday at midnight
we'll go to the Mallory Gallery.

1016
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,633
The Baseball Diamond will be ours.

1017
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,559
<i>So there I was.</i>
<i>Backstage under a table.</i>

1018
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:35,189
I was doing a little photographic essay
on kneecaps,

1019
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,670
and I heard 'em planning to steal
the Baseball Diamond.

1020
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,749
Bummer.

1021
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,479
- So what's the plan, man?
- I already told you.

1022
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,678
Tuesday, midnight, at the Mallory Gallery.
That's all I know.

1023
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,876
You mean they're really gonna
try to steal the diamond?

1024
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,672
Quiet!

1025
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,035
"Look, Mother, it's my life, OK?"

1026
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:05,318
"So if I want to live on a beach
and walk around naked..."

1027
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,515
Oh.

1028
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,830
Now, if we wanna get
Miss Piggy out of jail,

1029
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,593
we're gonna have to catch
those thieves red-handed.

1030
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,556
Yes, Beau?

1031
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,189
What colour are their hands now?

1032
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,238
Now, we're about to embark
on a potentially dangerous mission.

1033
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,551
There could be physical violence,
there could be gunplay,

1034
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,154
and there's a slightest chance
that somebody might even get killed.

1035
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:28,391
So if anybody wants out,
now is the time to say it.

1036
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,072
- I'm out.
- Me too.

1037
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,673
- Ditto.
- Meep.

1038
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,957
Don't we have a gig around here,
or something or somewhere?

1039
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,634
Yeah, sorry. I got a dental appointment.

1040
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,915
It's like this, Kermit.
I have to go to work all day.

1041
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,960
Hold it!

1042
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,636
Shame on you.

1043
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,472
I thought we were in this thing together.

1044
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,997
I'm just as scared as you are,
but this has to be done.

1045
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,714
We don't want the bad guys to win.

1046
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,349
We've got to do this for... for... for justice.

1047
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,910
For... freedom. For... honesty.

1048
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,110
Boy, do I feel ashamed.

1049
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,919
Me too. I feel like two cents.

1050
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,914
- I'm back in.
- You can count on me.

1051
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,991
Oh, hey, I was only joking.

1052
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,311
Yeah, it'll be a lot of fun
to go out there and risk our lives.

1053
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,391
- Yeah!
- All for one and one for all.

1054
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,674
Yeah!

1055
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:35,231
At times like this
I am proud to be an American.

1056
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,193
Thank you. I knew I could count
on each and every one of you.

1057
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,511
Fozzie, are you OK?

1058
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,160
That took a lot out of me.

1059
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,277
OK. Now we don't have any time to waste,
so everybody gather round.

1060
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,158
And the first thing we have to do
is make our plans.

1061
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,992
- Right.
- Whoa!

1062
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,280
Or we could get some sleep.

1063
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,313
- Miss Piggy?
- What?

1064
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,755
Your lawyer is here to see you.

1065
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,479
Lawyer? I don't have a lawyer.

1066
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,358
Och, sure you do. Little green guy.

1067
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:29,798
Kermie! No wonder he hasn't come by
to see me. He had to finish law school.

1068
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,513
Oh, Kermit! Oh!

1069
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,319
Two minutes, pig.

1070
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:49,235
- Oh, Kermie. Oh, I've missed you so.
- Please. The name is Rosenthal.

1071
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,150
I'm your attorney.
That's the only way they'd let me in here.

1072
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,629
Oh, right.

1073
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:58,793
I've missed you so... Rosenthal.
It's been an eternity.

1074
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:03,757
- It's been 45 minutes.
- Time goes slow in the cooler.

1075
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,035
Well, I just want you to know
that we're gonna get you out of here,

1076
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,634
cos we're gonna catch those thieves
red-handed.

1077
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,280
What colour are their hands now?

1078
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,272
I don't think this is the time
for that type of humour.

1079
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,909
When you're in stir you take the laughs
when you can get 'em, Rosenthal.

1080
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,560
Yeah, well, anyway, just stay put

1081
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,234
because we've got a plan
and we're gonna prove you're innocent.

1082
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:26,710
You see, tomorrow night...
precisely at midnight,

1083
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,792
those thieves are gonna try to steal
Lady Holiday's Baseball Diamond

1084
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,233
from the Mallory Gallery.

1085
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,278
- And we're gonna stop 'em.
- Oh, Kermit, be careful.

1086
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,635
Don't worry
because I've got Gonzo and Fozzie

1087
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,951
and all our friends
from the Happiness Hotel to help.

1088
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,758
- Those clowns?
- Mm-hm.

1089
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,230
Great. I'll be stuck in the big house for life.

1090
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,118
"Big house"? Is that prison talk?

1091
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:53,672
Yeah, "big house", "squealer", "slammer".
That's the lingo we use here in the joint.

1092
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,433
Yeah. Well, you may talk tough,
Miss Piggy,

1093
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,638
but underneath I know you're still the same
beautiful, sensitive, vulnerable woman

1094
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:04,633
I was out with the other night.
The one who scarfed down all that caviar.

1095
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,869
You have such a way with words.

1096
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,235
I love you, Rosenthal.

1097
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,480
You're wearing my moustache.

1098
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:33,838
Yeah, well, you have mesh marks
on your face.

1099
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,637
- Glass cutter?
- Check.

1100
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,790
- Nylon rope?
- Check.

1101
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,599
- Computer deprogrammer?
- Check.

1102
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,511
- Stopwatch?
- Check.

1103
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,636
- Pocket laser?
- Check.

1104
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:57,280
- Infrared reflex?
- Check.

1105
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,873
- Portable detonator?
- Check.

1106
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,397
- Whoopee cushion?
- I think it's in the bus.

1107
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,711
- Rubber raft?
- It's got holes in it.

1108
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,997
Bag of chickens?

1109
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,311
- Fake vomit?
- It's on order.

1110
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,550
- Frisbee?
- Lost.

1111
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,358
- Pneumatic drill?
- Check.

1112
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,237
- Computer printout?
- Check.

1113
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,276
- Radar gun?
- Check.

1114
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,952
- Walkie-talkies?
- Check.

1115
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,672
- Wax lips?
- Man, I just had 'em.

1116
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,992
- Did you leave them in your other pants?
- I don't have no other pants.

1117
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,640
- Yo-yo?
- For sure.

1118
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,597
- Harpoon gun?
- That's you.

1119
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,194
Check.

1120
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:54,353
All right, team. Let's go for it.

1121
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,159
- Peanut butter?
- Animal ate it.

1122
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:00,357
Sorry.

1123
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,158
Well, Kermit,

1124
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,310
I guess that's it.

1125
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,630
All right, everybody.

1126
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:09,951
Let's go for it.

1127
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,996
Go for it!

1128
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,196
Beauregard.

1129
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,316
Back it up here.

1130
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,596
Sh. Sh.

1131
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,240
- OK. Quiet.
- Sh.

1132
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,232
OK. You guys
all got your disguises in place?

1133
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,958
Sh.

1134
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,235
Wow.

1135
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,392
- Wow!
- Sh!

1136
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,471
- I'm taking a picture.
- Sh.

1137
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,073
Rowlf, hand me the blowtorch.

1138
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:26,435
Blowtorch? Who said
anything about a blowtorch?

1139
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:29,159
I got some paper towels.

1140
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,754
How are we supposed to cut through
the bars if nobody brought stuff to cut with?

1141
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,196
I brought some hot mustard.
Maybe that'll eat through the bars.

1142
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,633
Eat through the bars!

1143
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,438
- Animal?
- What?

1144
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,559
Hey. Why don't you see if you
can eat through these iron bars.

1145
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,949
Eat through bars.

1146
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,434
- Doggy!
- The cops!

1147
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,879
Do you know where Lady Holiday's
Baseball Diamond is being kept?

1148
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:09,512
Funnily enough, I do.
It's at the Mallory Gallery,

1149
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,151
a virtually impregnable fortress,
many miles from here.

1150
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:18,028
- I only have a half an hour to get there.
- On foot? You'll never make it.

1151
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,950
- I know. How about a ride?
- You can read, I presume?

1152
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,190
"No passengers."

1153
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:27,875
Oh, couldn't you make an exception
for little old <i>moi?</i>

1154
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,599
Not even for little old <i>vous.</i>

1155
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,956
- Pretty please?
- No!

1156
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,554
I've tried to be nice.

1157
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,036
- Huh?
- Hiii-yah!

1158
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,913
Hey.

1159
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,390
- What's all the racket?
- What are you doing here?

1160
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:54,156
- A very brief cameo.
- Me too.

1161
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,476
Breaker one, this is Hamhock.
Do you read me?

1162
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:27,473
<i>Loud and clear. Hamhock.</i>
<i>This is Dirty Bird. What's your 20. over?</i>

1163
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,949
Well, good buddy,
we're westbound out of Highgate.

1164
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,156
Any smokies between me
and Blimeytown?

1165
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,913
<i>Negatory. Hamhock.</i>
<i>You're free and clear.</i>

1166
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,070
Ten-four, Dirty Bird. Much obliged.

1167
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,799
We got the hammer down and we gone.

1168
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,870
I never ordered no pepperoni.

1169
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,872
It's right here on the slip.
Medium pepperoni with double cheese.

1170
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,111
That's-a right. We don't-a
make them, we just-a deliver them.

1171
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,192
Somebody here called Pizza Twins,
and that's us.

1172
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,669
What's the name on that slip?

1173
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,915
Uh...

1174
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,560
- What's your name?
- Henderson.

1175
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,472
- That's it! That's the name on the slip.
- Ah!

1176
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:10,150
- But I hate pepperoni.
- I'll eat it.

1177
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,800
- Stand by, guys.
- Right!

1178
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,075
Ooh.

1179
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,636
'Ere. Just one moment.

1180
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:27,314
- Can I see that slip?
- Uh... uh... well...

1181
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,117
Actually, this is the wrong slip.

1182
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,033
That slip, sir,
you said it had my name on it.

1183
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,270
Oh, that-a slip.

1184
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,751
That-a slip we left at home.
But we got-a the pepperoni.

1185
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,400
- But I hate pepperoni.
- Hate pepperoni. Right.

1186
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,439
- How about you could feed it to the dogs?
- Yes. That's-a right. Here, sir.

1187
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,478
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.
Thank you very much, sir.

1188
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,830
What am I? A glutton for punishment?

1189
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,755
- Hey, Fozzie...
- Sh.

1190
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,115
Fozzie, how do we get in?

1191
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:25,193
- Why don't we just ring the doorbell?
- No, no, no. There's got to be another way.

1192
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:29,751
Well, you'd better think of it pretty quick.
Those dogs have nearly finished the pizza.

1193
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:34,038
- I know. The roof.
- Oh, man. No way we'll ever get up there.

1194
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:07,237
Phew.

1195
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:11,598
- So far I'm not having any fun.
- Let me talk to 'em.

1196
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,515
Woof woof. Woof woof.

1197
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,999
It helps to know a second language.

1198
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:25,912
It's nearly midnight.
What am I going to do?

1199
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,871
Hey! Hey, you! Hey!

1200
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,349
What an unbelievable coincidence.

1201
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,319
Now, this window probably
has an alarm system on it.

1202
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,632
My assistant Beaker will check it out.
Go on, Beaker.

1203
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,438
Very good, Beaker. Now it's perfectly safe.

1204
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:27,910
Oh, good. Animal, do your stuff.

1205
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,438
Sorry.

1206
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:50,638
There it is.
The fabulous Baseball Diamond.

1207
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,313
How are we
gonna get down there?

1208
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,277
I suggest we jump.

1209
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,828
Are you crazy?
That's about a hundred feet.

1210
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,990
I didn't say it was a good suggestion.

1211
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,753
Maybe we could jump partway.

1212
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,871
Oh, boy, what do we do now?

1213
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,077
We're just gonna have to go down there
and catch those thieves red-handed.

1214
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,072
What colour are their hands now?

1215
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:31,158
We'll just have to improvise. We'll make
a ladder out of whatever will hold us.

1216
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:35,597
Good idea. Here's the paper towels.

1217
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,917
I'm coming, Kermie!

1218
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,349
Well, you wanted excitement.

1219
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,711
Excuse me, I don't think
that belongs to you.

1220
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,033
Say cheese!

1221
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,709
Woman!

1222
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,950
Hey, nice catch, Animal.

1223
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,873
- Heads up, Lew.
- Over here, Rowlf! Yeah, got it!

1224
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,838
Hot potato! Keep away. Here we go.

1225
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:06,079
I got it. Thank you. Be careful, guys.

1226
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,390
Catch it. Get him!

1227
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,315
Still got a good eye.

1228
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,631
Welcome to the wild world
of Muppet sports.

1229
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:18,075
This is Louis Kazagger
with a play-by-play

1230
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,309
- of the game.
- Woman!

1231
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,119
And it looks like ladies' night
here at the gallery.

1232
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:25,033
- Peekaboo.
- Hey! Ba-ba-do-be-bop.

1233
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,078
OK. Here she comes, boy!

1234
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,595
Hey, way to chuck,
way to look, way to move!

1235
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:42,071
Popcorn, popcorn.
Get your red-hot popcorn.

1236
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,272
Popcorn, chicken?

1237
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,755
Woman!

1238
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,278
- Woman!
- OK, OK.

1239
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:01,194
Lew Zealand leads off the order
as we join the game.

1240
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:05,710
- Chuck it to me, Beakie baby.
- Pitchy witchy, Beaker.

1241
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,109
Pitcher, you couldn't hit
the front side of a barn!

1242
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,395
Picture of the pitcher.

1243
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,471
Wait for what you want, Lew, baby.

1244
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,788
Rah, rah, rah!

1245
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,633
Beaker goes into the windup.

1246
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:20,633
It's the pitch.
It's a high fly ball to Kermit the Frog.

1247
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,075
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1248
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,519
Hey, gimme that diamond, you crook.

1249
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,800
- Come on, guys. Get him.
- All right. Back off!

1250
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,958
But, Nicky, why are you doing this?

1251
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,032
Why am I doing this?
Because I'm a villain. It's pure and simple.

1252
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:40,554
Excuse me, Mr Holiday, sir.

1253
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:43,837
Would you let Kermit go? If you hold him
too long he'll just give you warts.

1254
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,196
Oh, no. He's coming with us.
Come on, girls. Let's get out of here.

1255
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:08,795
Hii-yah!

1256
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,951
Hiii-yah!

1257
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:16,314
Hii-yah!

1258
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,948
- Hii-yah!
- Ow!

1259
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,235
- Watch out!
- Miss Piggy!

1260
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,675
Yeah! Way to go!

1261
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,909
Ha ha ha ha.

1262
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,630
Bye-bye.

1263
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,678
- You were magnificent, Miss Piggy.
- I did it all for you.

1264
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,239
- Could I have just a moment?
- Thank you.

1265
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,470
<i>Por nada.</i>

1266
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,357
Oh.

1267
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,908
- I really did care for you, you know.
- I know.

1268
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,912
We could've had the world
on a silver platter.

1269
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,437
- That silver's turned to iron bars, Nicky.
- Don't hate me, Miss Piggy.

1270
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,956
Oh, I don't.
It's just that somehow along the road

1271
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,554
I found out the difference
between wrong and right.

1272
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,835
You're wrong...

1273
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,070
He's right.

1274
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:24,512
Would you believe it, Statler? They're
heroes. Now they're gonna be obnoxious.

1275
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,716
So what else is new?

1276
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:32,156
- Well, I say all's well that ends well.
- It doesn't matter to me as long as it ends.

1277
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,194
It was nice of the <i>Chronicle</i>
to pay for our flight home.

1278
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:45,716
Yeah, but a man should be treated
better than his luggage.

1279
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,314
Yeah, well, my luggage
was sucked out the door.

1280
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,392
Luckily my radio's frozen to my wrist.

1281
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:54,677
OK, guys. Everybody out for the USA.

1282
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,955
Oh, boy. How close are we?

1283
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,235
Oh, about 30,000 feet.

1284
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:01,595
- You mean?
- Yup.

1285
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:04,114
Happy landing!

1286
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,395
Whoa!

1287
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,710
Come on, carrot-top.

1288
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:23,550
- <i>We've had comedy</i>
- <i>We've had mystery</i>

1289
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,712
<i>We've had a real good time</i>
<i>and solved a crime real easily</i>

1290
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,315
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>I just can't believe they did it</i>

1291
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,631
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- And me!

1292
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,996
- <i>There was spectacle</i>
- <i>There was fantasy</i>

1293
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,390
- <i>Where we took a chance</i>
- <i>And saw romance end happily</i>

1294
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,436
- <i>In a movie</i>
- Oh, Kermie!

1295
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:43,794
<i>I just love a happy ending</i>

1296
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:47,475
- <i>One for everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

1297
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,711
- <i>Everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

1298
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,396
- <i>Everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

1299
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,153
<i>Everybody in the world</i>

01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,639
- And me.
- And me.

01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,398
- And me.
- And me.

1302
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,272
- And me.
- And me.

1303
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,749
And me.

1304
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,115
- And me.
- And me.

01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,958
- And me.

And me.

1310
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:38,550
<i>Just warmer and colder</i>

1311
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:42,110
<i>Than springtime or snow</i>

1312
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:47,991
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

1313
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,356
<i>And so you fall</i>

1314
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,830
<i>And how complete it is</i>

1315
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:03,277
<i>And for each moment that it lasts</i>

1316
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,432
<i>How sweet it is</i>

1317
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,430
Wait a minute!
Wait! Hold it right there.

1318
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:50,590
Don't go home yet.

1319
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,636
Say cheese.

1320
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,516
I'll send you each a copy.
