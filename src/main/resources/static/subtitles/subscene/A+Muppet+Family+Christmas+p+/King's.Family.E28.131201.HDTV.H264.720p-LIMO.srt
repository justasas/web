00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,780
Who's there?

3
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,780
Why are you doing this to me?

4
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,880
Who are you?

5
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,750
We're not going to hurt you.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,520
Do as I say and I'll let you go.

7
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,220
How could you...

8
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,120
Stop wasting your energy and do as I say.

9
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,320
Okay. I'll do whatever you tell me to.

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,220
Your family will call the police,

11
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,750
so you should call home.

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,650
If they call the police,

13
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,690
I can't promise your safe return.

14
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,690
Call them.

15
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,120
Who?

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,990
Your family.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,280
Hold on. I'm shaking so hard.

18
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,550
Calm down.

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,320
If you say anything other than what I said,

20
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,720
you know, right?

21
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,350
I'll put it on speaker.

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
Hello?

23
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,610
Mother.

24
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,240
Where are you?
Why aren't you home?

25
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,210
Do you know what time it is right now?

26
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,220
Mother, I'm...

27
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,290
On a business trip.

28
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,690
You did that without telling me?

29
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,110
Something urgent came up at work.

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,580
I'm at a factory outside Seoul.

31
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,640
When are you coming home?

32
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,020
I don't know yet.

33
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,520
I'll have to see.

34
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,850
Okay.

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,850
Oh?

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,250
Hobak.

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,140
Gwangbak,

38
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,580
I'm on a business trip.

39
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,310
When did you go?

40
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,990
Today.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,920
It was a last minute thing, so I couldn't call.

42
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,320
So don't look for me.

43
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,790
Even if you can't get a hold of me, don't worry.

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,750
I'm at the factory,
so my phone may not work.

45
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,780
Okay. Call me if you need anything.

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,550
Gwangbak!

47
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,140
What is it?

48
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,080
Well...

49
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,810
Hobak, is something wrong?

50
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,120
No, nothing's wrong.

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,890
Gwangbak, I've been kid...

52
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,490
Hobak? Hello? Hello...

53
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,320
The person you called isn't available.

54
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,520
Your call will be directed to voice mail.

55
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,950
She didn't tell you about it?

56
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,850
Who knows if it really is a business trip.

57
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,790
Maybe she went on a vacation leaving the kids with me.

58
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,350
What if she went with a man?

59
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,720
She's been acting weirdly lately.

60
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,390
She sneaks out and gets home late.

61
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,510
Huh?

62
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,940
Don't be scared.

63
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,880
You just need to stay here.

64
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,220
Why aren't you in bed?

65
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,420
I'm not sleepy.

66
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,220
Oh, right.

67
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,110
You want to travel?
You should pack.

68
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,110
You can come?

69
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,420
Of course.

70
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,150
I won't disappoint you this time.

71
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,320
I, Heo Sedal, will be a free man tomorrow.

72
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,310
Get ready to leave the day after tomorrow.

73
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,940
And prepare the yacht.

74
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,350
Good shot.

75
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,520
Oh, it's cold.

76
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,990
Where were you?

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,010
What are you doing here?

78
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,080
I said where were you?

79
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,520
Uh, I...

80
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,010
You didn't pick up so I called mother and she said you were asleep.

81
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,640
It's cold. Let's talk inside.

82
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,940
Tell me where you were.

83
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,620
It's weird.

84
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,920
I thought you were supposed to be asleep.

85
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,240
What's wrong now?

86
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,220
I don't know!

87
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,850
He's nagging on me again.

88
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,850
And I'm exhausted.

89
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,720
How can a mother of two come home in the morning like this?

90
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,190
What's wrong?
She had to go to a funeral.

91
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,140
A funeral?

92
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,890
Yes, a funeral.

93
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,940
I was at a funeral all night!

94
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,440
But you said she was asleep.

95
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,940
She was at that time.

96
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,710
She got a call after that.

97
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,090
But she's not dress for a funeral.

98
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,750
I didn't have time to dress properly.

99
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,350
I had to throw something on and go.

100
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,850
That's nonsense.

101
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,550
Mother, instead of covering up for her,

102
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,740
you should scold her.

103
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,740
Scold me for what?

104
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,310
Would you feel good if I told your father to scold you?

105
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,340
A housewife should sleep at home.

106
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,180
I'm not a housewife.
I have a job.

107
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,440
Even if you have a job,

108
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,580
you have two young kids.

109
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,550
You can't keep acting like this.

110
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,440
Why not?

111
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,010
She has a job,

112
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,680
and she can go to funerals and parties.

113
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,990
You can't nitpick and expect her to work.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,920
If you're going to do that,
 you should provide for your family.

115
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:51,110
It's the losers who get suspicious and suspect their wives over nothing.

116
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,440
Right.

117
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,140
This is really crazy.

118
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,990
It's today?

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,090
I've been telling you for days.

120
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,490
Everyone else has done it.

121
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,420
Who's going to help?

122
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,940
I have a seminar.

123
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,080
I'm working.
I'm busier on Sundays.

124
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,690
I'm sorry, mom.

125
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,920
Remember my friend, Aeran?

126
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,020
I'm her bridesmaid.

127
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,580
You're the only friend she has?

128
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,350
But she asked me a long time ago.

129
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,520
I have to meet her at the beauty salon.

130
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,810
Mom, I have to go to work today.

131
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,490
I can't miss it.

132
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,740
The investors love me.

133
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,110
No way.

134
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,510
I have to study.

135
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,410
I'm meeting my teacher at school.

136
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,150
Oh.

137
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,690
So nobody's going to help?

138
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,850
I can't do it alone.

139
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,950
Call Hobak and ask her to help.

140
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,640
She went on a business trip.

141
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,490
When?

142
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,880
Yesterday.
It's going to take a few days.

143
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,640
What should I do?

144
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,290
I can't make kimchi alone.

145
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,180
You're free today, aren't you?

146
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,220
He has to go to the hospital.

147
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,240
It's Sunday, so his sister and her husband will be there.

148
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,510
Then you should help me make kimchi.

149
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,380
Me?

150
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,010
Who else is there?
Nobody else can help.

151
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,680
Why? You don't want to?

152
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,090
It's not that.
I don't know how to do it.

153
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,190
Just do what I tell you to do.

154
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,090
Mother, please take care of Jungji.

155
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,420
Aeji's going to her friend's house.

156
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,010
It's not like we can say no.

157
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,090
We all must do what you say.

158
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,190
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

159
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,210
I think it's a good idea.

160
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,880
It'll be a bonding experience.

161
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,040
Who knows if we'll become friends or foes.

162
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,840
Do you have to go to work? It's Sunday.

163
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,640
The investors can't do it another time.

164
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,790
I can't be alone with mother.

165
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,220
How do they look?

166
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,820
We can rinse them in a while.

167
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,520
Salting is the key to good kimchi.

168
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,090
I've been doing this for 40 years.

169
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,350
Minjung!

170
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,110
Where do you think you're going?

171
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,690
I...

172
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,610
She caught you!

173
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,320
Were you sneaking out?

174
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,590
I told you already!

175
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,880
I can't do this alone!

176
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,140
Go get some rubber gloves. Hurry.

177
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,240
Okay.

178
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,840
Minjung.

179
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,820
Hi.

180
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,220
Is she your daughter?

181
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,110
Yes, this is Miho.

182
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,910
Miho, say hi.

183
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,540
I remember you.

184
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,310
I remember you, too.

185
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,190
You know each other?

186
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,850
She gave me directions once.
Smart girl.

187
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,550
I knew she looked familiar.

188
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,780
How have you been?

189
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,610
Good.

190
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,740
Hello.

191
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,720
Hi.

192
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,920
Are you going somewhere?

193
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,790
I need rubber gloves, too.

194
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,580
My in laws are making kimchi.

195
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,050
So are we.

196
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,780
We're not making a lot.

197
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,490
I'm trying to get it over with.

198
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,090
You must be making a lot.

199
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,090
Yes, it's a big family.

200
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,780
Everyone's busy, so it's just me and my mother in law.

201
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,510
You?

202
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,010
What about the hospital?

203
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,410
Minsuk is there.

204
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,540
I better go.

205
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,990
Goodbye, Miho.

206
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,610
Oh, right.

207
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,780
Don't.

208
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,040
But I want to.
She's your daughter.

209
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,940
Miho, buy some snacks.

210
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,050
It's okay.

211
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,850
Thank you.

212
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,280
I'll see you again.

213
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,540
I'll see you again.

214
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,740
Bye.

215
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,290
Goodbye.

216
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,220
Bye.

217
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,510
Mom, how do you know the delivery man?

218
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,810
We go way back.

219
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,490
I wish he was my dad.

220
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,640
What?

221
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,310
He has a kind face.

222
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,350
I like him for some reason.

223
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,740
Oh, a comma.

224
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,040
Comma, comma, comma, comma.

225
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,680
Aunt, this is wrong.

226
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,990
What's wrong with father?

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,540
You know how he is.

228
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,940
He hates to lose.

229
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,010
But a daughter in law audition?

230
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,280
It has to do with his pride.

231
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,080
Just humor him.

232
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,450
She can pass the audition.

233
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,020
But it is funny.

234
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,240
What should I tell her?

235
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,010
My father's having an audition, so take it?

236
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,040
I didn't know he could be this childish.

237
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,110
And she can't audition alone.

238
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,720
Where am I going to get other women?

239
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,610
And who would actually go through with it?

240
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,910
I'm sure your father will figure it out.

241
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,610
I'm making kimchi today.
I'm busy.

242
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,780
The person you called is unavailable...

243
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,910
This is nuts.

244
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,390
This is how you're going to handle this?

245
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,280
You signed the paper already!

246
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,080
I can't believe you stood me up!

247
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,920
I've been shaking like a dog for the past hour.

248
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,640
I told you I'm going to the police!

249
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,220
If you don't show up,

250
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,820
I'm going to sue you, using the assault.

251
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,150
Understand?

252
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,740
This is nuts.

253
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,880
Eat.

254
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,740
You haven't eaten anything since last night.

255
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,280
You have to live, so I can get what I want.

256
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,240
Give me some water.

257
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,850
Please.

258
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,010
What is this about?

259
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,780
Mr. Heo Sedal.

260
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,110
Who are you?

261
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,110
What are you doing?

262
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,110
You don't need to know who I am.

263
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,380
I've been looking after your wife.

264
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,780
Looking after?

265
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,490
Why would she need looking after?

266
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,640
She needs no such thing.

267
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,780
In other words,

268
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,680
she's been kidnapped.

269
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,240
What?

270
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,350
Your wife's been kidnapped.

271
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,720
That's the best news I've heard yet.

272
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,510
Thank you for taking her.

273
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,740
I was sick and tired of her.

274
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,010
Why didn't you take her sooner?

275
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,940
Did Hobak put you up to this?

276
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,340
She's using the ruse because she doesn't want a divorce?

277
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,220
Tell her I'm not falling for this!

278
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,190
Satisfied?

279
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,190
It's obvious. It's fake.

280
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,040
Listen to me carefully.

281
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,780
I don't know what she's paying you,

282
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,910
but this is pathetic.

283
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,680
When you pull something like this,

284
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,820
make sure he's gullible enough.

285
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,110
My name is Goof-off, not Gullible.

286
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,610
I don't fall for stuff like this.

287
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,910
Are you really this dumb?

288
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,610
She wouldn't get kidnapped.
She's strong.

289
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,490
I don't need my wife,

290
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,320
so you can have her.

291
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,640
Why, why are you doing this?

292
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,940
Your wife's been kidnapped.

293
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,920
How am I supposed to believe that?

294
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,040
If she really was, she'd be on the news.

295
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,940
But nothing's happened yet!

296
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,990
Where is she?

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,780
I can't tell you that.

298
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,140
Can I talk to her on the phone?

299
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,510
I should at least hear her voice.

300
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,040
Put her on.

301
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,310
Sedal!

302
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,110
It's me! Sedal!

303
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,220
You really kidnapped her?

304
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,140
Why?

305
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,010
What do you want?

306
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,690
Money.

307
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,090
Money?

308
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,380
We don't have any money!

309
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,120
You've made a mistake, then.

310
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,350
You shouldn't kidnap just anybody.

311
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,810
An apartment she bought with a loan is all

312
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,640
she has, so why would you kidnap her?

313
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,550
Enough.

314
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,810
Bring me $100,000 by the end of today.

315
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,990
$100,000?

316
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,390
Where am I supposed to get that?

317
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,120
Get it by five o'clock.

318
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,420
And you better not call the police.

319
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,280
You can't cut it like that.

320
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,190
They have to be the same size.

321
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,510
This is too small,

322
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,150
and this is too big.

323
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,850
You can't tell?

324
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,380
You can't do anything right.

325
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,190
Go rinse the napa cabbages.

326
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,740
Ugh.

327
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,690
Rinse them thoroughly.

328
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,220
And drain them on the strainers, okay?

329
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,490
Yes, mother.

330
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,310
This is the area they're redeveloping.

331
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,010
Right here.
It's 1.3 million square meters.

332
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,840
There'll be a 36 hole golf course and a resort.

333
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,180
The driveway is here.

334
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,540
There'll be a resort and...

335
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,310
If you grind them, they'll be too watery.

336
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,640
Doing it by hand is much better.

337
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,920
Right.

338
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,950
Who's making Minjung cry?

339
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,190
They're burning my eyes.

340
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,420
You can't do anything.

341
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,350
Go bring the napa cabbages in.

342
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,820
Oh, how could you drop them?

343
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,780
You've ruined them all!

344
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,110
I'm sorry.
I'll rinse them again.

345
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,790
How do you deliver parcels?

346
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,640
You can't even carry this!

347
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,420
I'm not good in the kitchen.

348
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,720
This isn't the kitchen!
Hurry up and rinse them.

349
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,720
We're never going to finish this today.

350
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,620
Hello.

351
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,490
Daebak isn't home!

352
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,040
Oh? Miho.

353
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,410
Hi!

354
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,620
Mom, mom!

355
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,780
Don't run.

356
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,410
That man is Daebak's brother in law.

357
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,420
What?

358
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,990
Your friend.

359
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,040
He's Daebak's eldest sister's husband.

360
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,040
But mom,

361
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,110
Daebak's mother is really scary.

362
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,520
She was yelling at your friend.

363
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,190
How am I supposed to marry Daebak?

364
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,420
She was yelling at him? Why?

365
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,510
Because he dropped napa cabbages.

366
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,690
I feel so bad for him.

367
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,810
- Bring me sesame seeds.
- Okay.

368
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,420
- Bring me chili powder.
- Okay.

369
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,950
Garlic.

370
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,350
- Bring me the ginger.
- Okay.

371
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,610
Bring me fish sauce from under the sink.

372
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,720
Hurry up.

373
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,010
Okay.

374
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,420
What's taking so long?
It's right there!

375
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,010
Oh, okay.

376
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,650
Oh, man!
Why can't you find it?

377
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,050
I can't believe how slow you are!

378
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,740
Where did it go?

379
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,740
Oh, right.

380
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,490
I forgot.

381
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,950
When you're my age, you'll understand.

382
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,010
I've been like that for a while now.

383
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,990
We're short on julienned radish.

384
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,740
I want you to julienne some more.

385
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,110
Is Jungji asleep?

386
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,950
He's not, but he finished his bottle.

387
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,150
Okay.

388
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,820
Did you cut yourself?

389
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,110
Oh, no!

390
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,510
Oh, that's terrible!

391
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,720
What is it?

392
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,390
Minjung cut himself.

393
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,720
You cut your hand?

394
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,120
You can't do anything right!

395
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,510
Ouch! Hot! Hot!

396
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,650
Oh, I'm dying!
Oh... Ugh...

397
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,350
Oh, no! Ugh...

398
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,710
- Oh, no!
- Ouch...

399
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,120
- Oh, no! 
- What do we do?

400
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,620
Take that off!

401
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,010
Don't move, okay?

402
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,810
Oh, no.

403
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,990
Oh, it hurts. It hurts.

404
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,150
There you go.

405
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,140
Oh, oh, no! What will I do?

406
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,010
Isn't that too cold?

407
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,310
Oh, no...

408
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,040
Get on my back.

409
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,450
Huh? What?

410
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,310
Oh, get on his back!

411
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,580
Oh, hold on.

412
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,080
Oh, oh.

413
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,740
Oh, it hurts.

414
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,040
Hold on.

415
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,450
Here!

416
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,450
She needs help right now.

417
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,350
My mother needs help right now. Hurry.

418
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,410
What happened?

419
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,490
My mother burned her foot.

420
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,990
She spilled boiling liquid.
Please hurry up.

421
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,010
Wait here.

422
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,990
Excuse me!

423
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,240
Time is crucial for burn wounds.

424
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,690
What if something happens to my mother?

425
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,540
Please treat her right now.
Right now!

426
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,240
Ouch...

427
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,040
What happened?

428
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,720
Oh, oh.

429
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,240
Thankfully, she'll be fine with a little treatment.

430
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,740
Carrying her on your back must've been so tough!

431
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,720
We got lucky.

432
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,990
You sit down and mix the kimchi.

433
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,540
I'll fetch anything you need.

434
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,740
What happened to your hand?

435
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,720
He cut himself with the slicer.

436
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,080
You should've gotten them to look at that, too.

437
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,990
I'm fine. 
It's not bleeding anymore.

438
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:02,350
There's a first aid kit in my room. Get it.

439
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,640
It's a deep cut.

440
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,920
It must have hurt.

441
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,790
Mom, mom!

442
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,780
Big news!

443
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,340
Remember the guy I met before?

444
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,010
The guy from our neighborhood?

445
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,720
His father's picking a daughter in law.

446
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,650
The one who bought you the bag and dumped you?

447
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,590
What kind of woman is he looking for?

448
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,680
How is he doing it?

449
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,950
Through an audition.

450
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,120
Audition?

451
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,020
You know, like on TV,

452
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,990
they pick singers, dancers and chefs?

453
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,510
They look for people like that?

454
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,190
They have all these people there?

455
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,740
He wants someone who can sing and dance?

456
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,740
No, but there are five exams.

457
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,390
Exams?

458
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,150
That family must be really weird.

459
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,420
Why would he hold an audition?

460
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,720
He's going to eat you alive.

461
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,150
He can't be normal.

462
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,890
But it's fun.

463
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,150
It's fun? You're going?

464
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,990
Huh?

465
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,150
But he dumped you!
Have you no pride?

466
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,050
And you're awful at exams.

467
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,580
You'll fail the moment you take it.

468
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,380
Mom, I'm not that bad.

469
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,720
Don't you dare!

470
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,120
I won't.

471
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,350
Look.

472
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,140
I'm getting so many applications.

473
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,790
This is crazy.

474
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,280
I posted Sangnam's photo and resume

475
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,920
and photos of my house,

476
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,320
and they love him.

477
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,910
There's even a woman with a Ph.D.

478
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,950
You know how ridiculous you look?

479
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,990
In places like China, rich people pick their children's spouses this way.

480
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,540
I read it in the newspaper before.

481
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,110
That's what weird people do.

482
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,820
You're really weird.

483
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,910
You think those women are normal?

484
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,590
Half of them aren't even serious about it.

485
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,110
You can't expect to find anyone decent.

486
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,650
Who cares?

487
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,920
You're bullheaded.

488
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,050
Making your son suffer is fun for you?

489
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,950
Grow up.

490
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,740
I never back down from anything.

491
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,890
We'll see who gets the last laugh.

492
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,220
Yes, Mr. Kim.

493
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,420
I met him the day before yesterday.

494
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,220
Yes, yes, yes.

495
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,890
Okay, I got it. Yes.

496
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,190
Did you hear about this?

497
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,220
Can you believe it?

498
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,720
He's just being a jerk.

499
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,890
You need to make an effort.

500
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,150
Ask her to take the audition?

501
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,790
She has to, don't you think?

502
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,450
But how can she?

503
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,590
What do I say?
I can't even bring it up.

504
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,440
If she wants to marry you, she has to.

505
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,190
We'll help her, so tell her.

506
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,740
Neither one of you will back down.

507
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,420
Your father came this far, so he won't.

508
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,820
He'd rather die than give in.

509
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,510
You know that.

510
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,880
You're just like your father.

511
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,950
Where are you?

512
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,090
I'm at my friend's wedding.

513
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,240
Oh, right.

514
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,110
Should I come over to your house later?

515
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,520
I think I'll be late.

516
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,080
My mom's making kimchi today,

517
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,720
and I couldn't even help her.

518
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,740
You're making kimchi?

519
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,150
My mom and Minjung are.

520
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,280
Got it.

521
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,450
Try this to see if it needs more salt.

522
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,620
How is it?

523
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,820
I can't tell.

524
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,910
I think I'll need another bite.

525
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,120
You can't?
Maybe it needs more salt.

526
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,720
How is it?

527
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,540
I can't tell if it's salty or not.

528
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,340
Well...

529
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,180
You can't tell?

530
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,420
Jungji's asleep.

531
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,920
Maybe he knows we're busy.

532
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,920
I can't tell if anything's too salty.

533
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,990
Hey, that's not good.

534
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,280
When you're old, you can't do anything.

535
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,490
Minjung's waiting with his mouth open.

536
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,450
Oh, I forgot.

537
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,120
So? Does it need more fish sauce?

538
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,650
It's perfect.
It's really delicious.

539
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,150
It was perfect, but I just wanted more.

540
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,120
As long as you like it, I'm happy.

541
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,690
Let's finish this off.

542
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,650
Okay.

543
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,490
Hello.

544
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,690
- Welcome.
- You're here?

545
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,740
Hi.

546
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,310
I heard you were making kimchi.

547
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,640
Why didn't you call me? I'm strong.

548
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,820
You can't make kimchi with your strength.

549
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,340
I bought some pork and fruit.

550
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,280
Great! Pork goes well with fresh kimchi!

551
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,740
I heard if you're smart, you don't starve.

552
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,010
Right, right.

553
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,920
If you're smart, you don't starve.

554
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:00,550
I'm glad you came.
Wash your hands first.

555
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,080
You have to have good ingredients.

556
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,180
If the cabbage is good, the kimchi is good.

557
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,850
- Okay.
- Yes.

558
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,410
If the radish is good, the kimchi is good.

559
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,450
The ones that are crunchy are delicious.

560
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,590
When you mix ground perilla seeds,

561
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,880
it makes the kimchi taste even better.

562
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,120
You put ground perilla seeds in this?

563
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,050
Of course. It adds more flavors.

564
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:34,690
Mix the green onions and the mustard leaves whole with the radishes.

565
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,320
It'll be perfect for eating with rice.

566
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,510
Okay.

567
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,540
How is it going?

568
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,510
This is the last one.

569
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,690
You don't buy salted cabbages? Others do.

570
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,890
It's better to salt them at home.

571
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,920
I deliver lots of salted cabbages these days.

572
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,690
But instead of writing "salted,"

573
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,010
some write pickled.

574
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,650
Like as in pickled vegetables.

575
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,490
Those cabbages must be sour.

576
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,150
Oh, you must be really happy

577
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,490
since your son in laws did all the work.

578
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,150
I am!

579
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,850
I bet this is what it feels like

580
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,910
to get daughter in laws.

581
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:23,490
Pretending they are daughter in laws makes me so happy right now.

582
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,490
Mother, she's being rude.
Can I teach her a lesson?

583
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,310
Oh, please!

584
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,840
Be nice to me.

585
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,710
If Goof-off were here, it would be perfect.

586
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,650
Don't even talk about Sedal.

587
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,490
He's awful.

588
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,350
If you call the police

589
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,490
or tell anyone else,

590
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,340
you know what will happen, don't you?

591
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,150
This is nutty, nutty, nuts.

592
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,350
Sunjeong, I'm sorry.

593
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,340
I finished making kimchi just now.

594
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,740
Something happened in the middle of it.

595
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,450
I'll have dinner and come right over.

596
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,810
It's okay. Take your time.

597
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,410
I just got here and sent Minsuk home.

598
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,190
Your father fell asleep just now,

599
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,740
so when you get here, help him exercise.

600
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,450
Oh, can you buy him some long johns?

601
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,690
Okay, Minjung.

602
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,650
Oh...

603
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,420
Good job, everyone.

604
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,040
This kimchi came out especially delicious.

605
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,740
Right, thanks to my hard work.

606
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,420
Your hard work?

607
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,990
All that nagging, yes.

608
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,490
It must have been a lot of work for you.

609
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,450
I didn't do it alone.
Minjung helped me.

610
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,740
And Sangnam came later to help.

611
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,720
I didn't do much.
Minjung did everything.

612
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,950
What would Minjung know?

613
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,490
He did a lot.
He worked the hardest today.

614
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,040
He made kimchi and carried me on his back.

615
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,080
What did they say at the hospital, mom?

616
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,990
They said I was lucky for getting their early.

617
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,340
If I hadn't, it would've been a lot worse.

618
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,840
It'll be all right in a few days.

619
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:21,510
Wasn't it hard to carry her on your back?

620
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,850
Is your back okay?

621
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,310
What?

622
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,450
What are you expecting to hear?

623
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,150
Fine! I'm heavy. So what?

624
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,190
Lucky! Minjung gave you a piggyback ride.

625
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,110
I've had a few.

626
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,310
From both Minjung and

627
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,810
Sedal at their weddings.

628
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,310
You should start practicing, too.

629
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,620
Don't worry.

630
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,690
I don't even have one son in law!

631
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,640
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

632
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,010
I could give you a piggyback ride.

633
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,750
Don't. You'll hurt your back.

634
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,190
Why you little!

635
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:58,340
She's worried I might hurt her groom's back!

636
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,150
Now I definitely need on.
Come here! Hurry!

637
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,180
Grandmother.

638
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,080
Hey, look.

639
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,850
Go.

640
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,490
Grandmother, you're light as a feather!

641
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,580
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

642
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,950
Anyway,

643
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,120
why did Hobak have to go on a business trip?

644
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,810
It would've been nice if she was here.

645
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,120
There's no money, and he's not picking up.

646
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,080
He's not?

647
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:42,810
He doesn't care if you lived or died.

648
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,790
If that's the case,

649
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,990
we can't let him get away with this.

650
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,950
What are you going to do?

651
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,690
Hello.

652
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,680
- Hi.
- What's up?

653
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,280
I wasn't expecting you to show up.

654
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,190
Did you know Hobak's on a business trip?

655
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,910
Of course I do.

656
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,080
And I know more than that.

657
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,810
If you haven't eaten, sit down.

658
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,140
Mom made kimchi today.

659
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,040
I'm not hungry.

660
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,950
You don't seem to have any worries.

661
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,450
What are you talking about?

662
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,750
Did you come here to spy on us?

663
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,890
Why don't you sit down?

664
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,420
It's okay.

665
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,950
I'm just bad because I'm the only one worried.

666
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,450
What do you think you're doing?

667
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,450
Loser, you stay out.

668
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:39,040
You're no help and I can't tell you anything.

669
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,950
I should go.

670
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,240
Is he crazy?

671
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,990
Sedal,

672
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,350
what's going on?

673
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,410
Why wouldn't you even sit down?

674
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,740
This is not time to sit around laughing.

675
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,190
Hobak is...

676
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,540
Don't blow this out of proportion.

677
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,810
This is nuts.

678
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,350
What?

679
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,750
I don't care what happens now.

680
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,820
I'm not responsible.

681
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,010
It's not like I'm Hobak's parent.

682
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,290
Man.

683
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,990
What did Sedal say, father?

684
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,350
I don't know.

685
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,790
He said some gibberish and left.

686
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,750
Is he crazy? How dare he?

687
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,850
Did something happen to Hobak?

688
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,850
No, she didn't even see him.

689
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,690
He's crazy. Don't mind him.

690
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,220
May I help you?

691
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,640
Excuse me?

692
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,640
Well, I...

693
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,340
You can go inside and talk to someone.

694
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,410
Okay.

695
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,540
Sedal!

696
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,990
What took you so long?

697
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,910
What?

698
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,840
I told you to meet me by the gate.

699
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,540
You're going inside?

700
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,540
Oh, you're so dense.

701
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,720
Let's go.

702
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,040
Please don't hurt me.

703
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,110
Don't hurt me.

704
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,720
Mom...

705
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,180
Mom...

706
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,720
Where am I?

707
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,950
Bastards!

708
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,040
Help! Help...

709
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,040
Mom... Mom...

710
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,390
Sedal, Sedal!

711
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,890
Sedal!

712
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,120
Wake up, Sedal!

713
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,390
- Bye.
- Go.

714
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,620
Oh, Minjung...

715
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,220
What are you doing?

716
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,990
Who is he?

717
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,640
Uh...

718
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,990
Say hello.

719
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,410
He's the CEO of the company I work for.

720
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,540
He's my hubby, I mean, husband.

721
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,010
I've heard a lot about you.
I'm Heo Udae.

722
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,310
Please take good care of my wife.

723
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,180
Of course.

724
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,380
I'll see you tomorrow, Director Wang.

725
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,190
Good night, sir.

726
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,850
He's pretty young.

727
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,810
Not all CEO's are old.

728
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,490
Where are you going?

729
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,350
To the hospital.

730
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,810
Go, then.

731
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,240
Where's my father?

732
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,640
He went out for a walk by himself.

733
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,850
How did the kimchi making go?

734
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,420
Good.

735
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,510
Miho came over earlier.

736
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,890
I didn't know she was Daebak's girlfriend.

737
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,350
When Sangnam marries Gwangbak,

738
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,190
I'll see you at the wedding.

739
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:21,450
Your wife thinks I'm a caregiver.
Will it be okay?

740
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,410
She wouldn't even notice you.

741
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,610
She's not interested in anyone else but herself.

742
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,020
She's kind of cool that way.

743
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,650
Your father will be released soon.

744
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,340
He will.

745
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,810
Thanks to him, I saw you every day.

746
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,310
It's getting late. You should go.

747
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,040
Thank you for today.

748
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,640
For what?

749
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,910
You help making kimchi, dug the ground,

750
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,990
and even brought pork.

751
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,850
It was nothing.

752
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,450
But,

753
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,040
promise me something.

754
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,640
Anything.

755
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:06,310
It's for both you and me.

756
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,890
Let's not try too hard for each other's families.

757
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,450
Higher the expectation,

758
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,720
greater the disappointment.

759
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:16,350
Expectations can only grow higher.

760
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,690
That's how everyone is.

761
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,390
You'll have to come the next time

762
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,690
we make kimchi and so on and so forth.

763
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,140
Do you see where I'm going?

764
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,040
I can come. No problem.

765
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,310
You might not know yet,

766
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,040
but I have two brother in laws, so I know.

767
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,810
You have to control this at the beginning.

768
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:44,910
Let's do only what we can keep doing.

769
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,780
People say they think of their children's

770
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,520
spouses like their own children, but I know

771
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,990
that is down right impossible.

772
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,520
I have experience, so just do as I say.

773
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,050
I will, Miss Experienced.

774
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,390
Again?

775
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,790
This is for what you did today.

776
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,540
That wasn't enough.

777
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,790
I was really worried about the piggyback ride.

778
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,120
Because you're worried about our first night?

779
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,350
Yes, Oh, no.

780
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,810
Oh, boy.

781
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:44,010
Oh, I'm so happy to be walking with you like this.

782
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:51,240
Well, have you heard of the daughter in law audition?

783
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,490
Huh? What was that?

784
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,140
The daughter in law audition.

785
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,450
I haven't. Which channel is it on?

786
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,680
It's not on TV.

787
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,450
It's an actual audition.

788
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,640
They're auditioning for a daughter in law?

789
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:08,610
Yes.

790
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,080
That's nonsense. How crazy!

791
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,280
Shh!

792
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,250
I know audition shows are popular,

793
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,020
but who picks their daughter in law that way?

794
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,150
They must be some crazy people.

795
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,280
Marriage isn't a joke, so who would...

796
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,590
Shh!

797
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,750
I think we should stop here.

798
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,080
It's my father.

799
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,640
Huh?

800
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,110
The person who wants to hold an audition

801
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,450
for his daughter in law is my father.

802
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,620
This is crazy.

803
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,740
It's nonsense. 
This can't even happen.

804
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,090
Ask anyone if this makes sense.

805
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,680
I can't believe I told you.
Forget about it.

806
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:53,910
Wait.

807
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:01,910
If that's what he wants, I won't back down.

808
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,990
What will you do?

809
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,810
I'll be in the audition.

810
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,720
What?

811
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,850
But promise me one thing.

812
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,150
Anything.

813
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:21,910
When we're married, always be on my side.

814
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,840
I promise.

815
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:32,190
Thank you for going along with this.

816
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,850
If you humor my father a little,

817
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,720
I'll be the best husband ever.

818
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,950
She's in?

819
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,810
Why are you so surprised?
You wanted this.

820
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,390
Sunjeong, see?

821
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,190
She can't be normal.

822
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:59,110
Others would come and beg for forgiveness,

823
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,350
but she told him she's in!

824
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,620
That's how much she loves Sangnam.

825
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:08,450
Why else would she take the audition?

826
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,080
You go, aunt!

827
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:14,680
Nobody's on my side.
I'm so lonely.

828
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:18,220
Fine. Let's do this, then.

829
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,120
Look at the contestants.

830
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,680
You already got applications?

831
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:27,180
I narrowed them down to 40.

832
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,110
Pick 20 out of them.

833
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,420
Pass on this side, fail on this side.

834
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:51,410
Huh?

835
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,250
Why? I like her.

836
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,820
Fine.

837
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,610
look at them. They are all great.

838
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:04,150
She's going to have a hard time.

839
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:07,310
She'll be crying her eyes out.

840
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,990
She'll get eliminated early.

841
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,140
Tell her to give up.

842
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:15,990
She's pretty strong.

843
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,350
Yes, she seems to be.

844
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,120
She's so strong that she could be a thug.

845
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,490
That rude girl!

846
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,310
Father,

847
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,720
she has a name. It's Gwangbak.

848
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:29,220
I don't even want to know.

849
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,390
How'd they come up with that name?

850
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,120
It's a cheesy name.

851
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,680
Are you awake?

852
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:49,640
Wake up, Sedal!

853
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,910
Where are we?

854
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,220
I don't know.

855
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:54,040
I think it's some basement.

856
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,850
There's no use.
 Don't waste your energy.

857
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,920
Look what you did!

858
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,080
You're driving me nuts!

859
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:04,740
Why did this happen to me?

860
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,820
Why did you get kidnapped?

861
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,040
How stupid must you be to get kidnapped?

862
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,220
I'm sorry.

863
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,290
Sorry's not going to solve this!

864
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,820
What did I do to deserve this?

865
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,240
Why did I have to be dragged into this?

866
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,920
Have I wronged you in another life?

867
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,350
Sedal, calm down.

868
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,690
We have to work together and...

869
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:31,840
Hey!

870
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,120
I'm not like you.

871
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:39,720
Why do I have to go through this with you?

872
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:41,850
We're getting a divorce!

873
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:49,380
This wouldn't have happened if you signed the paper sooner!

874
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,650
Hey!

875
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:54,580
I have nothing to do with this woman, so let me go!

876
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:58,220
I don't care if she lives or dies!

877
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:02,310
We signed the divorce paper,

878
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,950
and we just need to submit it!

879
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,620
Why are you doing this to me?
Let me go!

880
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:17,510
Did you talk to your wife?

881
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,350
She's not my wife!

882
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,020
Let me go, please!

883
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,620
I have nothing to do with this woman.

884
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,540
We signed the divorce papers!

885
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,040
I was in such a hurry that I had forgotten

886
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,890
it was Sunday and waited at the court!

887
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,920
I don't know this woman! I don't know her!

888
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,880
I don't care about that.

889
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,450
I'll let you both go if you pay $100,000.

890
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,490
I don't have $100,000!

891
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,950
Sedal,

892
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,340
stop screaming.

893
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,690
I can't help it!

894
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,650
Stop asking me.
Ask your parents.

895
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,580
Wouldn't that be faster?

896
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:55,140
I can't.

897
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,680
My father will go into shock!

898
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:59,180
You only worry about your parents!

899
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:03,450
Your parents don't care about you!

900
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,250
They were all laughing, having pork.

901
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,750
So why would you worry about them?

902
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,920
And why do I have to be here?

903
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,510
I haven't eaten all day!

904
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,520
You didn't tell my parents, did you?

905
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,650
You can never tell them.

906
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:20,910
I had a hard time!

907
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,140
But I didn't do it for you!

908
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,680
I did it for him, understand?

909
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,340
You're impossible.

910
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,150
You father's a vice principal,

911
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:36,310
so he could get a load from school or at the bank to help you out!

912
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,350
If I had been kidnapped,

913
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:43,080
I would call my mom, not you!

914
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,580
Where could I get money now?

915
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,720
Can you ask the director?

916
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:53,790
She's rich. Wouldn't she help?

917
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:57,350
Huh? Sedal?

918
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,190
Let's sell the apartment.

919
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:05,220
Not the apartment.

920
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,850
If one of us survived,

921
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,450
we'd have to take care of the kids.

922
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,750
One of us?

923
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,250
It has to be me!

924
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,250
So don't touch the apartment.

925
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,720
It's in both of our names,

926
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,850
so we'd both have to be there to sell it.

927
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,080
This is nuts.

928
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:24,350
Meeting you was the biggest mistake of my life.

929
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,150
Mom... Mom...

930
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,680
Shh.

931
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,750
I'll make a suggestion.

932
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,920
One of you stay here

933
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,010
while the other goes to get money.

934
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:38,220
Me! I'll go!

935
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:41,680
Let me go.

936
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:44,720
I'll use the severance package if I have to.

937
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:45,810
You...

938
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,890
I should go and work this out!

939
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:50,720
Let me go.

940
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,750
She's the one you kidnapped in the first place!

941
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,790
I should go!

942
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,550
Yes.

943
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,790
Let him go.

944
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,140
Sedal,

945
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,340
you have to get the money.

946
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,540
Come back and save me.

947
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:26,220
You have until the banks close tomorrow.

948
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:39,810
Sedal! Sedal! Sedal!

949
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:43,540
You must come back! You must!

950
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,290
Excuse me!

951
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,720
Time is crucial for burn wounds.

952
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:19,020
What if something happens to my mother?

953
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,420
Please treat her right now!
Right now!

954
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,490
Meow.

955
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,720
What are you doing?

956
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:37,950
How could you pretend to be a cat?

957
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,180
Was fooling me fun for you?

958
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,990
I'll be like a son to you, mother.

959
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,280
Oh, that hurts.

960
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,650
Stop that!

961
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:48,780
How can you break the soy sauce pot!

962
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,350
Can't you do anything right?

963
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,690
Oh, how could you drop them?

964
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:56,490
You ruined them all!

965
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,510
Minjung.

966
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,910
Have a seat.

967
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,620
Have some food.

968
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:30,190
It's cold.
You need food in your stomach.

969
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,490
How's your foot?

970
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,420
It feels much better.

971
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,080
I dressed it again this morning.

972
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,790
Soybean paste soup.

973
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,390
I couldn't make any other side dishes.

974
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,520
Try it.

975
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,950
It's delicious.

976
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,990
Thank you for yesterday.

977
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,310
It must be hard.

978
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,120
Working, looking after your father,

979
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,540
and having to put up with me.

980
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,490
Try the soup with the rice.

981
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,350
What is it?

982
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,520
The soybean paste soup

983
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:30,990
reminds me of my late mother.

984
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:39,820
Whenever she made kimchi, 
she made this soup with leftover cabbage.

985
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:46,140
It used to taste so sweet and delicious.

986
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:55,640
The way you're tearing the kimchi with your hands reminds me of her even more.

987
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,450
You think about your mother?

988
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:06,050
When I first got married,

989
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:08,950
I kept thinking about my mother,

990
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,120
and it made me cry all the time.

991
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,180
You really miss your mother, don't you?

992
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,990
Thank you, mother.

993
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,810
I should thank you.

994
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,540
You're so kind and understanding.

995
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:34,910
I was terrible to you but

996
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,110
you ran to the hospital carrying me.

997
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:42,620
I would've just tossed me aside.

998
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:47,120
But you were screaming at the nurse, 

999
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:50,150
calling me your mother.

1000
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:54,220
Hearing you call me that really touched me.

1001
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,810
Minjung, my Minjung.

1002
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:09,240
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

1003
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,250
I felt heartbroken...

1004
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:17,910
I'm selfish and I lack so much...

1005
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:27,890
I know I'm not good enough, but think of me as your own mother.

1006
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:35,720
Forget the mean mother in law that I've been  and pretend you've met a new mother.

1007
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,720
I'll be good to you.

1008
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,640
I won't make you sad.

1009
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:49,810
You couldn't get over how I treated you

1010
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:54,950
overnight, but let's work on it together.

1011
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:00,310
We're not related by blood,

1012
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,720
but we're still family.

1013
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,750
We can't reach your husband.

1014
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,720
You know what that means, don't you?

1015
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,280
Don't kill me.

1016
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,220
Please don't kill me!

1017
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,720
I can't die like this.

1018
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:13,120
It's not fair! I can't!

1019
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:16,290
I won't!

1020
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:23,080
Mom, I'm going.

1021
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:24,680
When are you coming back?

1022
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:28,510
I have a lot to research, so 2 or 3 days.

1023
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,390
When are we meeting his father?

1024
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,920
Huh? We'll figure things out.

1025
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,720
If you want to get married this year, hurry.

1026
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,750
Okay. I'll set it up when I come back.

1027
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,080
Get in two lines!

1028
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:24,510
Please move quickly!

1029
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,150
Get in two lines!

1030
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,750
You too?

1031
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:35,140
How crazy!

1032
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:36,780
This isn't happening.

1033
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,950
Why not?

1034
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,720
I got set up with him before.

1035
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:44,350
I can't believe you signed up for this.

1036
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:53,220
Everyone who signed up for this audition!

1037
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:55,080
Until we arrive at the destination,

1038
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:59,510
do not reveal any personal information.

1039
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:01,790
Get on the bus.

1040
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,350
Please move quickly.

1041
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,590
Focus! Clap!

1042
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:16,420
This is nuts.

1043
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,220
Where are we going?

1044
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,790
You two, get your things and come out.

1045
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,220
You've been eliminated.

1046
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:27,350
This is for transportation.

1047
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,750
- It's your fault.
- What did I do?

1048
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:38,490
You must focus for 3 days!

1049
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:44,310
Let me introduce the CEO, Mr. Choi Daese.

1050
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,180
Applause please!

1051
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:58,220
Hello, I'm Choi Sangnam's father, Choi Daese.

1052
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:01,350
Applause! Applause!

1053
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:06,520
Congratulations in making it to the audition.

1054
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:10,020
Only one of you who pass the audition

1055
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:12,690
will be able to marry my son.

1056
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,450
So,

1057
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,120
good luck, everyone.

1058
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,790
This bus will leave now.

1059
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,990
Let's clap to lift the mood up.

1060
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,310
The 3-3-7 applause, go!

1061
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:34,320
Subtitles by KBS World

1062
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,810
He turned his phone off.

1063
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:38,580
Please go and look for him.

1064
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:41,640
It's because you're not being affectionate!

1065
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:42,450
Come with me.

1066
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,080
I'm not affectionate?

1067
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:46,580
How can you say that to me?

1068
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:48,410
I might be eliminated.

1069
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:51,220
You can't.
That's what my father wants.

1070
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,390
Oh, no!

1071
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,250
Oh!

1072
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,750
Anggeum! Anggeum!

1073
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,550
He'll get the money.

1074
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,280
When did I say I'll marry you?

1075
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,420
You were playing with me?
