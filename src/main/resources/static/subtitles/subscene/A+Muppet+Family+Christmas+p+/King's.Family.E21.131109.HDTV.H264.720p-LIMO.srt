00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,440
Hobak? Is everything okay?

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,610
I had lunch with Sedal,

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,610
and I talked to him.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,980
He even took notes.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,740
I think he's okay now.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,640
That must be why.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,580
What do you mean?

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,520
He called me just now,

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,310
saying he'll come home early today.

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,250
You should try to humor him.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,590
A married couple goes through lots of different things in their lives.

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,240
I know, father.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,740
Thank you.

15
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,850
What are you doing?

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,940
I need to leave here.

17
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,240
Would you like to come?

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,810
Me?

19
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,720
Remember the summer house from before?

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,890
I'm going to go there.

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,120
There's someone I don't want to run into.

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,240
You'll come with me, won't you?

23
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,290
I want us to go to a place where

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,390
your in laws can't bother us

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,590
and just be together with you.

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,710
We can play golf all day.

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,620
Just the two of us? Playing golf?

28
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,180
That's heaven!

29
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,540
Of course.

30
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,890
We'll be there for about a month.

31
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,520
A month?

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,110
Why? Think of it as a business trip.

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,920
That's what the hotel's going to call it.

34
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,450
And you'll be paid for it.

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,690
My wife is on hyper alert.

36
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,890
I don't know if she'll fall for it.

37
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,920
Open it.

38
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,990
Is, is this the famous

39
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,540
watch from Germany, next to Italy,

40
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,480
no, no, no, I mean Switzerland,

41
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,850
the watch every man dreams of,

42
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,320
the legendary luxury brand watch?

43
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,650
Yes.

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,890
You're coming, right?

45
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,920
I am. I've been wanting to come.

46
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,750
Let's go. What the heck.

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,540
This is nuts.

48
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,350
Why aren't you asking me for the time?

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,820
What time is it?

50
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,390
People of Seoul, get excited.

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,580
It's 2:45, going into 20 seconds. Again!

52
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,920
What time is it?

53
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,320
Look, look, look...

54
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,510
2:45, going into 40 seconds.

55
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,690
Oh, you're home?

56
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,990
Where were you?

57
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,040
I told you to wait for me looking pretty.

58
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,180
I took the boys to mother's house

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,820
and went t take a bath at the bath house.

60
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,010
How do I look?

61
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,350
Don't ask me stuff like that.

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,150
Here.

63
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,120
What's this?

64
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,950
Why did you buy this? It'll be trash.

65
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,250
Do you have money to burn? How much was it?

66
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,190
I know. I know.

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,390
No, I would've been mad if you didn't get me flowers.

68
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,320
Oh, it's nice to get flowers.

69
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,640
I must be a woman after all.

70
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,340
I never knew you were a woman.

71
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,190
Wow!

72
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,120
What's all this?

73
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,010
Wow.

74
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,340
Today is a special day.

75
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,320
Let's enjoy it together.

76
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,820
You didn't forget?

77
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,920
Forget what?

78
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,610
You know.

79
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,950
Let's have a drink.

80
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,510
Huh?

81
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,490
Is that a new watch? Whoa!

82
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,150
As if you know what brand this is.

83
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,910
Where did you get it?

84
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,610
It's none of your business.

85
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,550
They give these to the VIPs at the hotel,

86
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,220
and they gave me one.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,450
Here.

88
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,690
You really love me, don't you?

89
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,250
No, the ring.

90
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,910
I'm learning women really are materialistic.

91
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,110
I'm feeling more love.

92
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,640
It's so nice to get gifts.

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,950
Be honest with me.

94
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,320
Getting a thousand origami cranes.

95
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,080
Do women like it?

96
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,420
I'll be really honest with you.

97
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,450
We don't.

98
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,580
We don't like handmade stuff.

99
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,450
We act like we love it and we're moved,

100
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,780
but it's really hard to pretend.

101
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,580
We hope men don't give us gifts like that.

102
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,280
Oh, no, I must be really materialistic!

103
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,640
I got that impression from the other women I've dated, too.

104
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,250
You can't control it, can you?

105
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,580
I think you got a text. Check it.

106
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,050
There's no text.

107
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,790
Ding dong, you got a text.

108
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,110
Hello? This is Gwangbak Telecom.

109
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,640
Mr. Choi Sangnam is behind on 10 kisses,

110
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,580
so unless the payment is met,

111
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,480
the girlfriend service will be canceled.

112
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,450
How do you want it done?

113
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,990
Tell me what you've seen on TV or in movies.

114
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,140
Kiss me at the door

115
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,210
when you take me home after a date.

116
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,550
Kiss me under a street lamp in the snow.

117
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,250
I would remember those forever.

118
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,080
We'll wait for snow for the second one. And?

119
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,540
On the elevator.

120
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,220
Whenever the door opens. It'd be exciting.

121
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,580
And?

122
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,690
We can run into a building and kiss in the dark stairway.

123
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,950
Where did you learn those?

124
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,580
I've always wanted to try them.

125
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,410
Okay, I got it. And?

126
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,780
Pushed

127
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,980
against,

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,490
pushed against the wall?

129
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,950
A man pushes a girl against the wall.

130
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,690
Oh, my! Oh my!

131
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,280
I should go.

132
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,890
I'll take you to your door.

133
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,350
It's okay. It's right around the corner.

134
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,410
I thought you wanted me to kiss you there.

135
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,390
I had enough. I want to save it for later.

136
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,250
Sweet dreams!

137
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,990
Careful! You'll fall down.

138
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,010
Are you okay?

139
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,780
I'm okay.

140
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,180
What are you looking at?

141
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,080
Mom.

142
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,250
Why are you home so late?

143
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,040
Your father has been waiting for you.

144
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:35,810
He has?

145
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,080
What are you going to do with all that stuff?

146
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,350
Were you with him?

147
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,390
No, I wasn't.

148
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,180
Were you

149
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,980
making out inside the alley near here?

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,590
Your jacket looks familiar.

151
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,850
What? I wasn't making out.

152
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,790
I was at the library.

153
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,940
We should return them.

154
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,610
What's his address?

155
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,010
We should get them delivered to him.

156
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,590
Father, I want you to accept them.

157
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,850
Returning them would be too...

158
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,320
That's not right.

159
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,810
I do love free stuff,

160
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,740
but I don't want anything from a guy like that.

161
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,850
He thinks this might change our mind,

162
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,320
so we need to be firm.

163
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,540
Call him now.

164
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,690
We should send them back tonight.

165
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,110
Telling him to come and get them would be rude, so tell him we'll send them.

166
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,890
Father.

167
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,040
Father, I think that's too cruel.

168
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,280
They're just food,

169
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,280
so it would be too cruel to send them back.

170
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,620
I think we should thank him

171
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,220
but tell him never to do this again.

172
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,510
I agree with Minjung.

173
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,120
Getting them back would be too...

174
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,910
Then let's do that.

175
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,810
Send him a text

176
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,010
saying thank you

177
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,310
but never to do this again.

178
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,810
Okay.

179
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,390
Is that a new ring?

180
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,890
Did that guy give it to you?

181
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,620
Did you guys get rings?

182
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,410
No, this is a friendship ring.

183
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,840
It's not from him.

184
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,450
Don't even dream about it.

185
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,310
You and I will both be dead.

186
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,090
You should've asked me.

187
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,280
I can make coffee.

188
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,580
Oh, how pretty.

189
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,820
Did you get this with your girlfriend?

190
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,140
Bet it's the first time.

191
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,590
Is it?

192
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,050
You used to hate wearing rings.

193
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,910
You must really like her.

194
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,620
You're completely in love.

195
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,250
Not completely.

196
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,240
Are you happy?

197
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,540
Yes.

198
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,910
I've been sad lately, but now I'm happy.

199
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,440
Now that you're happy, I'll talk.

200
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,910
What are you going to say?

201
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,710
I'll give everything to you.

202
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,420
You can take anything and everything.

203
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,350
The apartment, the boys, and all I have.

204
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,120
Here.

205
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,140
This is my elementary graduation album.

206
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,940
And middle school, high school and college.

207
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,710
Look at them whenever you miss me.

208
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,510
Oh!

209
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,310
And the more important things.

210
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,110
Tada!

211
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,390
My undies, your favorite.

212
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,350
Look, all my undies are here.

213
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,250
One with the band loose and gone,

214
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,890
the ones with holes in the front, in the back,

215
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,910
and they come in every color, so wear them.

216
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,780
You wouldn't need to buy any for a year.

217
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,940
Think of me whenever you put these on.

218
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,320
Look, I'm broke now.

219
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,510
Aren't they perfect for a parting gift?

220
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,510
Why do you think I wore your old undies?

221
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,350
Because you like me.

222
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,950
Right?

223
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,010
I'm not the only one who thinks this way.

224
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,620
I have another person on my side.

225
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,890
On your side? Who?

226
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,280
Your father.

227
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,910
He feels the same way I do.

228
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,580
He said you have lots of problems.

229
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,820
He's proud of me for living with you.

230
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,540
Even your father called you hopeless.

231
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,750
He said he almost had an affair.

232
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,690
You're out of your mind, aren't you?

233
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,040
Ask him.

234
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,580
Even a teacher feels that way,

235
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,690
so imagine how I must feel.

236
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,680
I wrote it down because it was moving.

237
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,110
Look.

238
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,310
After 10 years of marriage, think of cheating.

239
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,010
Yelled at for not buying any dollar undies.

240
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,350
You didn't get a word of what my father said!

241
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,890
He said those things, word for word.

242
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,620
You only heard what you wanted to hear.

243
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,950
Your father's really different from others.

244
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,340
he's really fair.

245
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,850
So please set me free.

246
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,740
Do you know what today is?

247
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,910
This is the day we get a divorce.

248
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,210
Today is our wedding anniversary.

249
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,690
Our wedding anniversary?

250
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,410
To me, it's the anniversary of agony.

251
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,390
It brought nothing but agony to me.

252
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,910
You're not sorry at all?

253
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,040
As if you ever did anything for me!

254
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,490
You have no right to ask me for a divorce.

255
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,640
I should be the one.

256
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,220
Then go ahead.

257
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,990
Nobody in the world would ask for a divorce on their wedding anniversary.

258
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,620
You picked the perfect day, you bastard.

259
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,440
- Get out!
- Hey!

260
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,610
Get out of my apartment!

261
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,090
Hey! We need to settle this!

262
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,010
Let me go! Hey!

263
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,310
Get out!

264
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,280
Hey! Open the door!

265
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,990
Hey! Wang Hobak! Open the door!

266
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,580
Hey! Goof off!

267
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,180
This is nutty, nutty, nuts!

268
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,640
Here you are.

269
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,490
Thank you.

270
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,320
It's been a while.

271
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,510
How's your delivery job going?

272
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,720
I don't want to talk to you.

273
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,350
Loser.

274
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,720
What?

275
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,290
Come on. Let's grab a drink.

276
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,280
I got a room.

277
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,210
I'm not drinking with you.

278
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,220
Sedal!

279
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,220
You came alone?
Where's Madam Park Salla?

280
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,490
She said she's tired. Why am I here?

281
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,850
Let's get a drink.

282
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,640
Loser, I'll see you later.

283
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,010
You asked me to go drinking.

284
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,720
Which room is it?

285
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,510
Why did you call him?

286
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,890
I didn't. He was here, delivering pizza.

287
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,090
You want to hang out with him?

288
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,290
Why not?

289
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,280
We used to hang out all the time, us three.

290
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,620
Stop talking about that.

291
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,640
I don't even remember.

292
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,220
You don't, of course.

293
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,450
When we were in middle school,

294
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,040
you were a munchkin in first grade.

295
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,850
Let's drink.

296
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:49,140
Her hair shines through she didn't use mousse

297
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,540
She looks into my eyes...

298
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,280
Hey!

299
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,810
This is boring.

300
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,340
Yeongdal, you sing.

301
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,490
Give it to me, give it to me

302
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,350
Give it to me, give it to me

303
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,940
I don't know if I'll get to marry

304
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,740
Before I'm thirty

305
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,110
I'd given my heart away

306
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,020
What will I do now that it's broken?

307
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,050
Amidst the rain falling blamelessly

308
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,140
You should blow off some steam.

309
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,550
Don't hold it all inside.

310
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,410
Punch it.

311
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,490
Oh, my.

312
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,280
Just how much did you drink?

313
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,910
He didn't, but he got drunk.

314
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,480
Oh, oh.

315
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,280
Was it just you two?

316
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,290
With Loser.

317
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,020
I want a divorce.

318
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,750
Let me go! Why won't you let me go?

319
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,640
Let me breathe, huh?

320
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,090
Divorce me.

321
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,020
Divorce me, please.

322
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,620
What's he talking about?

323
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,710
I think he's getting a divorce.

324
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,820
Oh, that's cold!

325
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,020
Aagh!

326
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,010
Cold!

327
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,490
Get up.

328
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,310
Mom, why are you here?

329
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,520
Don't you remember?

330
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,620
What were you talking about last night?

331
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,620
What?

332
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,180
Yeongdal, get me some water.

333
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,140
You're getting a divorce?

334
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,820
How did you know?

335
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,850
Are you really getting a divorce?

336
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,410
I wish we were.

337
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,210
This is nuts!

338
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,780
Haebak, you must have lost of free time with your exams behind you.

339
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,890
Yes.

340
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,850
You did well on the exam, didn't you?

341
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,020
She did. Studying comes naturally to her.

342
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,690
Incredible.

343
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,640
Father, can I have some money?

344
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,640
I want to start going to the gym.

345
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,850
The gym?

346
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,620
I want to exercise and learn how to swim.

347
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,980
I need to.

348
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,310
Why do you need to swim?

349
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,410
Knowing how to swim is a good thing.

350
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,390
It can come in handy, and it's good for you.

351
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,680
Don't even think about meeting any boys.

352
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,390
Why not? She should go on dates.

353
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,520
Studying for the bar exam is hard!

354
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,420
No dating until you pass it.

355
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,390
You have to pass it the first time.

356
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,610
I should go to school.

357
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,320
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

358
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,050
Please do it for me.

359
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,450
Stay focused until you become a judge.

360
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,120
I should have at least one good child.

361
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,550
Bong, I have something to tell you.

362
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,590
What is it?

363
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,490
I have a dream.

364
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,580
Incredible!

365
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,850
What do you want to do?

366
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,550
Open a pizza place.

367
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,520
Not like any franchised ones,

368
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,420
but one in my own name.

369
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,140
My own, Wang's Family Pizza.

370
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,890
I'm going to take classes, starting today.

371
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,550
If you do a good job,

372
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,820
I'll help you, even if I have to get a loan.

373
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,790
But you have to be careful.

374
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,090
People go out of business all the time.

375
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,520
Don't take it too lightly.

376
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,520
Why can't you be more encouraging?

377
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,090
You'll bring bad luck.

378
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,780
Subak, what are you going to do?

379
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,440
Excuse me?

380
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,640
You quit because the work is too hard.

381
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,350
Making money isn't easy.

382
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,350
So treat your husband with respect.

383
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,350
Money doesn't grow on trees.

384
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,350
Making money is really hard.

385
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,990
Of course.

386
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,240
You never earned a dime, so you don't know.

387
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,680
You're not above it.

388
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,440
You're an able bodied woman.

389
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,390
You're not above manual labor.

390
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,480
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

391
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,740
Don't copy me. Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

392
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,090
Parcel service.

393
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,240
I get everything delivered now,

394
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,510
so I can see you.

395
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,720
You're being too bold for a married woman.

396
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,440
You seem to be in a good mood today.

397
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,940
It's because I'm happy to see you.

398
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,210
I can't help but smile these days.

399
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,350
It's all because of you.

400
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,910
Really?

401
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,820
Come in for some tea. I made jujube tea.

402
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,320
It's okay, I'm busy.

403
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,640
I can't stay longer than 5 minutes per house.

404
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,910
I'm glad I got to see you.

405
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,010
You must be tired.

406
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,720
You've never done such hard manual labor before.

407
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,820
Oh, the parcel delivery guy is here.

408
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,390
Isn't it cold outside?

409
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,120
It is. Have a good...

410
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,940
- Hold on.
- Excuse me?

411
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,440
The jujube tea was good. Bring some.

412
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,680
Okay.

413
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,680
Oh, it's okay. I'm busy.

414
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,640
Oh, please have some. It won't take long.

415
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,050
It's okay.

416
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,950
Oh, how odd.

417
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,850
As if he was caught stealing something.

418
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,590
He could've stayed for tea.

419
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,320
He must be busy.

420
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,990
He looked like a nice guy.

421
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,740
He didn't seem like he would be doing this.

422
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,750
Hi, there.

423
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:08,340
Are you the Heo Udae I know?

424
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,750
Wang Subak?

425
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,910
Wow, you're alive and well?

426
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,390
It's nice to see you again.

427
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,020
How have you been?

428
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,820
Enough small talk. Come out.

429
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,940
Oh, who made you cry?

430
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,850
Mom, I'll be back.

431
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,820
I said I'm meeting my friends.

432
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,020
I'm sorry.

433
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,690
Something urgent came up. I'll be back.

434
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,980
Hey! I don't...

435
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,180
Oh, who made you cry?

436
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,980
Oh, man!

437
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,680
You look the same. It's been a long time.

438
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,740
How long has it been?

439
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,890
I don't remember exactly.

440
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,390
When was the last time we met?

441
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,740
It's been a few years.

442
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,780
How many kids do you have?

443
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,690
Two. A girl and a boy.

444
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,850
How are your parents doing?

445
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,520
They're doing fine.

446
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,990
They were so mean.

447
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,180
Remember how mean they were to me,

448
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,140
saying I couldn't see you anymore?

449
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,890
How's your little sister?

450
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,140
Was her name Hobak?

451
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,940
Yes.

452
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,810
If it weren't for her, who knows where we'd be?

453
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,620
I can't believe it happened on the day of

454
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,640
the preliminary round of the pageant...

455
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:44,510
They said I was a favorite to win,

456
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,920
but I couldn't even go there.

457
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,280
Now it's an old memory.

458
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,120
Old memory?

459
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,320
I don't even want to think about it.

460
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,940
But we kept in touch behind everyone's back.

461
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,390
We met a few times after you got married.

462
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,590
Was it the night before your wedding?

463
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,520
That was really exciting.

464
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,490
Let's talk about something else.

465
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,980
Because you're sorry for me? Or your husband?

466
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,540
You were all into me,

467
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,320
so how could you get married after 3 months?

468
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,120
It wasn't because I wanted to.

469
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,980
I was getting old and had no job,

470
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,910
so I thought, oh, what the heck.

471
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,550
You got married, too.

472
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,320
I ended it soon afterwards.

473
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,450
She couldn't compare to you.

474
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,040
I heard your husband is doing well.

475
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,590
Doing well my butt.

476
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,440
His company went bankrupt.

477
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,480
He's in parcel service now.

478
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,120
He's in parcel service?

479
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,140
Whoa, what will your parents do?

480
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,790
I thought they'd find someone amazing for you.

481
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,490
Wow.

482
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,320
You've changed.
You're staying with him?

483
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,120
But I have two kids.

484
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,750
We're living with my parents. It's crazy.

485
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,310
And it's no fun.

486
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,390
Why don't you get out of the house?

487
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,890
My company needs someone like you.

488
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,890
What's this?

489
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,740
That's "land," isn't it? In Chinese?

490
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,890
Udae Land Development Corporation.

491
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,740
CEO Heo Udae.

492
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,810
Simply put, I buy and sell land.

493
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,020
You're a realtor?

494
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,750
It's much bigger than that.

495
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm not into renting.

496
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,320
You know how I am.

497
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,990
I deal in millions of dollars.

498
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,580
The commission is a lot bigger.

499
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,490
Wow.

500
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,890
I'd like a part of that commission.

501
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,820
You should follow me around.

502
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,850
Your pay will be different month to month.

503
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,090
When can I start?

504
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,440
Tomorrow.

505
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,120
Here.

506
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,680
Get a nice suit.

507
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,310
Is this an advance?

508
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,640
I can't believe you'd even ask that.

509
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,390
This is like a bonus.

510
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,680
Your pay will depend on how you do.

511
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,890
It can be tens or hundreds of thousand dollars.

512
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,620
Oh, my!

513
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,550
I have to go.

514
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,250
Look nice tomorrow.

515
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,940
Tell people you were in the final round.

516
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,240
You know me better than anyone in the world.

517
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,180
Of course.

518
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,620
It's me.

519
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,640
I got the 2 million dollars yesterday.

520
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,790
Send me 5 million by this weekend.

521
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,620
Let's make it 10.

522
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,750
We should grab a drink sometime.

523
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,980
Or play golf.

524
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,220
It's two dollars.

525
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,410
Oh, wait, let me see.

526
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,180
I have some dollar bills.

527
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,450
Keep the change.

528
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,680
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

529
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,350
I'd drive you home, but I'm busy.

530
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,710
It's okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

531
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,640
Okay.

532
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,390
Mom! Mom!

533
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,610
You got a job?

534
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,620
Yes, I start tomorrow.

535
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,050
What do they do?

536
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,990
It's a really nice company.

537
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,580
It's like every hair on my body has come alive.

538
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,410
Every hair on your body?

539
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,850
That happens when you're cold.

540
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,090
I mean I feel amazing.

541
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,520
It's "effing" amazing!

542
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,490
Why would you say that?

543
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,010
You're a mom.

544
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,890
If your father heard you, he'd be mad.

545
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,940
Anyway, I start tomorrow.

546
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,410
What about the kids?

547
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,410
You have to take care of them.

548
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,510
I didn't make it to my meeting today.

549
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,320
I'll give you money, mom.

550
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,910
I'll pay you for babysitting.

551
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,590
It's getting harder every year.

552
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,520
I'm old and it's hard for me.

553
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,890
I'm afraid to take care of them.

554
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,410
Where is Gwangbak?

555
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,590
Why can't she babysit?

556
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,910
Did you wait long?

557
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,980
What is it?

558
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,180
Well...

559
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,510
have you ever experienced this?

560
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:48,350
You see a person walking towards you,

561
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,390
and you see a halo like this,

562
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,520
like a big moon, shining brightly.

563
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,320
Like in paintings of Jesus,

564
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,720
he has this halo behind his head.

565
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,910
It was just like that.

566
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,590
You saw my halo?

567
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,410
Oh, carrying that was a lot of work.

568
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,320
I'm hungry. Here. 
Rock, paper, scissors!

569
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,220
What was that?

570
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,480
You're cooking the meat! Lets go in.

571
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,140
Yummy.

572
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,010
You're good at this.

573
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,410
Oh!

574
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,980
It's really delicious.

575
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,090
You're really good at this.

576
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,410
Oh, that was good.

577
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,090
I'm done. Let's go.

578
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,050
- What?
- Let's go.

579
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,750
This can't be.

580
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,310
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

581
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,790
I didn't get to eat anything!

582
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,920
What were you doing?

583
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,320
You told me to grill the pork.

584
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,490
You said I'm it, so I have to do this!

585
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,010
I'm not going to marry you.

586
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,750
What?

587
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,040
If I married such an inconsiderate man,

588
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,220
I'd starve to death.

589
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,810
I'm starving, but you ate alone.

590
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,820
I waited to see if you'd give me a bite,

591
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,320
but you didn't.

592
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,590
And now that you're full, you want to go.

593
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,590
I didn't know you were like this.

594
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,520
Excuse me!

595
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:46,710
Can we get a new grill and two portions of pork belly?

596
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,580
Eat.

597
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,480
I was testing you, and you fell for it.

598
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,280
You're so simple minded.

599
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,290
You were testing me?

600
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,290
If I don't have any income,

601
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,290
you'd pack up and leave me.

602
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,590
Just because you didn't get to eat,

603
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,890
you called me inconsiderate.

604
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,210
I can't believe my own wife would call me that.

605
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,120
Are you going to call me that again?

606
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,640
I won't.

607
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,320
What do you think about how you acted?

608
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,090
I'm sorry.

609
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,250
You really think I'd eat it all by myself?

610
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,390
If you'd won, I would've grilled the pork.

611
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,040
I was just trying to be funny,

612
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,390
but you have no sense of humor.

613
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,580
You don't have an ounce of patience!

614
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,540
Eat slowly.

615
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,640
I told you, from now on...

616
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,350
Eat only the meat I buy you,

617
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,390
eat only the meat I grill for you,

618
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,580
and eat only the meat I wrap for you.

619
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,740
Got it?

620
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,980
Good girl.

621
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,910
Is it good?

622
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,910
Because you grilled it, it's so, so good.

623
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,520
Don't say so, so.

624
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,680
Oh, no! Oh, no! Fire! Fire!

625
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,050
What do I do?

626
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:47,980
Oh, no!

627
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,150
Hi.

628
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,540
Hello.

629
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,290
Here.

630
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,390
Thank you. Thank you so much.

631
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,690
Good luck.

632
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,190
You got a job?

633
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,020
She starts tomorrow.

634
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,440
Where is it?

635
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,980
It's some land developing company.

636
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,310
They'll pay me a lot, depending on how I do.

637
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,180
There are a lot of grifters in that field.

638
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,490
You should do some research.

639
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,080
He's not a grifter. I can trust him.

640
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,810
You don't know what you're talking about.

641
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,480
I know the CEO,

642
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,810
and he gave me the job.

643
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,120
He gave her $5,000 as an advance,

644
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,210
so she could buy some clothes.

645
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,890
The company must be very solid.

646
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,980
He gave you $5,000?

647
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,680
Yes, he believes in me.

648
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,590
Why would he?

649
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,540
You don't know how to do anything.

650
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,980
She looks good just standing there.

651
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,540
Who would pay you to just stand there?

652
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,710
Hey, I would love to have that job.

653
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,440
The real estate market is really bad,

654
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,410
but it's okay to try different things.

655
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:15,010
Work hard for your family and for the country's economy.

656
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,290
You'll meet lots of people in that field,

657
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,320
and I think it would be perfect for you.

658
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,410
I won't disappoint you.

659
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,650
I'm going to become a working mom.

660
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,650
Don't forget to pay me for raising your kids.

661
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,120
Now that you got a job, you should.

662
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,790
What are you doing?

663
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,480
Stay still.

664
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,580
Subak, I'm sorry.

665
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,440
I didn't want you to get a job.

666
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,350
I know you love it.

667
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,310
I don't.

668
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,780
If I could, I wouldn't want you to work.

669
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,290
It's okay.

670
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,790
It's about time I got a job.

671
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,520
Won't it be too much?

672
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,350
Even if it is, I have to do it.

673
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,080
Oh, why can't I open this?

674
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,120
I met your brother in laws.

675
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:14,120
Should I take your sisters out for dinner?

676
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:17,410
It's okay. You don't have to.

677
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,020
But I want to earn points.

678
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,350
You already earned lots of points.

679
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,940
Oh, the fish I sent before,

680
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,810
they don't sell them anywhere.

681
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,440
My company does business with them,

682
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,680
so when you run out, let me know.

683
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,010
Don't worry about it.

684
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,850
You already sent too much stuff.

685
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,980
I haven't been able to do anything for you.

686
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,120
Oh, the night air is chilly.

687
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,390
You're not cold?

688
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,580
I get cold easily,

689
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,620
but being here with you,

690
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,580
I don't feel cold at all.

691
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,980
Liar. Your lips are blue.

692
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,020
No, no, I'm okay.

693
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,890
Don't fart in front of him.

694
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,020
If you feel one coming when you're with him,

695
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,690
start clapping really loudly.

696
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,050
I see stars.

697
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,480
Autumn night is very picturesque.

698
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,520
Autumn is the man's season.

699
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,580
Do you know what autumn smells like?

700
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,440
How funny! Autumn doesn't smell!

701
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,310
So funny!

702
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,910
I didn't say anything funny.

703
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,550
The smell of autumn is funny?

704
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,350
It's so funny.

705
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,290
Oh, my stomach.

706
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,290
This is a children's playground,

707
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,590
so you shouldn't pollute it like this.

708
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,780
You hid the sound well,

709
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,050
but I guess you didn't learn to rid the smell.

710
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,080
Oh, no! Oh, no!

711
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,910
Good night, my sweet sucker!

712
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,210
What is it?

713
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,120
Well,

714
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,120
please don't tell him the family is opposed of us.

715
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,650
I haven't told him.

716
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,050
What are you going to do?

717
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,850
Mom and dad are really against him.

718
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,750
I'm going to change their mind.

719
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,710
He's a good man.

720
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,680
I know, so don't ever tell him.

721
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,010
Can we talk?

722
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,140
Hey, you.

723
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,750
Hey, how could you run home like that?

724
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,790
I had to clean the mess you left.

725
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,890
I won't ever do that to you again.

726
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,710
So delete that from your memory, please.

727
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,140
I'll think about it.

728
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,790
I'll be good to you.

729
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,320
Would you like to video chat?

730
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,920
No, I look awful right now.

731
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,390
I can't show you my bare face.

732
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,480
You've been wearing makeup?

733
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,210
I hate you.

734
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,210
Gwangbak! Can I get some sleep?

735
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,440
Sorry.

736
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,290
I'm sorry.

737
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,150
This is my room.

738
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,390
This is my library.

739
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,120
And this is the bedroom side.

740
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,390
This is our bed.

741
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,040
I mean, it's my bed.

742
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,090
It's a really nice house.

743
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,350
It's so much nicer than my house.

744
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,120
I don't feel hungry anymore these days.

745
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,310
You're such a liar!

746
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,780
Remember how much pork you ate tonight?

747
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,350
I'll have to make lots of money just to feed you.

748
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,350
No, you won't. I don't eat much.

749
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,790
You can't call that "not much."

750
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,420
2 portions of pork and a bowl of rice and soup?

751
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,750
And you ate noodles, too.

752
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,940
You call that "not much"?

753
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,680
You eat like me, a manual laborer!

754
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,450
That's how much I ate?

755
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,120
Oh, no.

756
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,290
Eat up. Eat a lot and get fat.

757
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,590
I'm sure I'll make enough money to feed you.

758
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,290
How nice! I'm so happy.

759
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,890
I don't have to worry about food, do I?

760
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,440
I'm going to get fat.

761
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,210
Hey,

762
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,580
do you still think of me when you wake up?

763
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,620
I think of you before I go to sleep,

764
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,650
I think of you while sleeping,

765
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,150
and whenever I toss and turn, you pop up.

766
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,720
Do you think of me?

767
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,810
I'm a manual laborer, so...

768
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,040
Okay, okay.

769
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:05,710
So when you fall asleep, you don't wake up.

770
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,520
How many times a day do you think of me?

771
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,980
Just twice?

772
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,080
No, no!

773
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,710
I think about you all day.

774
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,180
For me, it's quality over quantity.

775
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,690
I think of you twice a day, very seriously.

776
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,190
You do?

777
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,540
I'm not sleepy yet.

778
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,640
I want to talk to you all night.

779
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,820
Why don't you stay up all night with me?

780
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,210
Please let me sleep! Please!

781
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,680
Are you trying to torture me?

782
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,190
Who's that?

783
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,020
My uncle. He was awake.

784
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,080
He asked me if I'm trying to torture him.

785
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,290
I should get you out of there soon.

786
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,550
I can't even talk to you in peace.

787
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,010
Let's do this before the end of this year.

788
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,550
Let's set a date after you meet my father.

789
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,020
Before the end of this year?

790
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:09,820
Can we take it slowly?

791
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,920
But you're the one who wanted to rush this.

792
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,120
I know.

793
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,290
Put on a coat and a scarf when you go out.

794
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,440
It's pretty chilly outside.

795
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,210
You're outside?

796
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,810
I'm going to the construction site.

797
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,810
You're driving?

798
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,540
Of course. For a while now.

799
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:35,440
Oh, no, I didn't know you were driving.

800
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,910
I thought you were in your room.

801
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,150
I can't talk on the phone while driving.

802
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,090
My voice goes up and I can't talk nicely.

803
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,390
How can you drive so well?

804
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,210
Have you ever seen a player who can't drive?

805
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,440
Are you there yet?

806
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,250
Yes, I'm here.

807
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,820
They are all ready to start working.

808
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,020
What time is it?

809
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,750
The newspaper is here.

810
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,550
So we talked all night.

811
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,940
Write it in your journal.

812
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,790
I'm going to start now.

813
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,420
Okay. Be safe.

814
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:14,720
You can't get hurt.

815
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,210
If you're hurt, you can't take care of me.

816
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,250
Okay.

817
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,350
Go to bed. I have to work to feed you.

818
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,420
Give me a kiss!

819
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:23,450
Kiss!

820
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,790
Were you on the phone all night?

821
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,820
Yes.

822
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,480
I'm sorry I kept you awake, uncle.

823
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:40,750
Gwangbak,

824
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:44,690
I don't mind being awake,

825
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,190
and I'm happy you're in a relationship.

826
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,420
I know it's not in my place,

827
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,390
and I can pretend not to know anything...

828
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,290
I know, uncle.

829
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,850
Break up with him before your parents find out.

830
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,040
It'll only get harder for you.

831
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,090
He doesn't want you.

832
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:32,910
Why do you want to stay married?

833
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,580
- Mother.
- What?

834
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:38,480
Must you say this so early in the morning?

835
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,540
Why do you think I came?

836
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,740
Sedal came to my house all drunk.

837
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,580
He drinks every night and comes to my house saying he hates you.

838
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:49,510
How could you say such a mean thing?

839
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,350
You're a woman, too!

840
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,690
When Sedal talks nonsense like that,

841
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,450
you should kick some sense into him.

842
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,810
You said Sedal will become the president.

843
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,640
Who knows what your grandsons will become?

844
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,590
If you don't want to end up at a hearing,

845
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,640
you should talk to him.

846
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,990
Who cares about any hearing?

847
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,520
I agree with everything my son says,

848
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:11,420
and I'm always on his side.

849
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,950
I didn't want you as my son's wife,

850
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,540
but I said yes because he wanted you.

851
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,680
And the same will go for the divorce.

852
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,190
You have sons, so why can't you understand?

853
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,820
If Sintong and Bangtong told you

854
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,390
they'd rather die than stay with their wives,

855
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,190
would you tell them to die?

856
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,220
"Put yourself in his shoes" is your family motto.

857
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,850
Let's say you met an amazing man.

858
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,350
How would you feel if Sedal wouldn't let you go?

859
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,940
You'd kick him off and go your way.

860
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,020
I don't even want to answer that.

861
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,950
You should go. I have to go to work.

862
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:54,350
Think about what you did to Sedal.

863
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,890
You treated him like dirt because you work,

864
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,250
and how did you treat me and Yeongdal?

865
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,440
Even that rich women fell for my son,

866
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:04,350
so how dare you treat him so badly?

867
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,710
I knew this day would come.

868
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,190
Mother.

869
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,450
He wouldn't cheat on you if you were good to him.

870
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:16,810
I can't believe you gave him $3 a day and beat him up every day.

871
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,740
Stop that, please!

872
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,250
Sedal and I are married.

873
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,190
So you stay out of this.

874
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,820
Just think of it as your fate.

875
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,480
I didn't want to be a widow.

876
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,750
I just accepted it because it happened.

877
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,180
Where to?

878
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,890
The department store.
 I need to go shopping for our trip.

879
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,420
Okay.

880
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,820
Oh, oh, my god!

881
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,620
She scared me! What's wrong with her?

882
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,210
Why are you doing this?

883
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,680
I'm sick and tired of you.

884
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,390
We need to talk.

885
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,810
I'm working. Can't you see?

886
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,890
Quit!

887
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:20,180
What?

888
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,950
Quit this stupid job!

889
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:26,710
Let's go. Let's talk.

890
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:37,210
Why did you tell your mother?

891
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,440
Now my family will find out.

892
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,080
What are you trying to do here?

893
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,680
I'm trying to get a divorce here.

894
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,190
You don't feel guilty?

895
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,590
I do.

896
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,280
I know I did nothing for you.

897
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,050
Then why do you want a divorce?

898
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,540
I feel guilty so let's get a divorce.

899
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,440
If you really love her, go.

900
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,910
Go to her, but

901
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:01,050
come back when you think it was a mistake.

902
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,390
Really? For real?

903
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:07,250
I'd like to say that,

904
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,590
but I'm not that open minded.

905
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,620
Why you... Are you playing with me?

906
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:14,650
You owe me a lot, so you can't divorce me.

907
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,450
If I divorce you, I'd regret it.

908
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:19,250
You said you feel guilty.

909
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,520
Then stay by my side until you die.

910
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,690
Die on my lap!

911
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,620
This is nuts.

912
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,390
How many more times must I tell you?

913
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,710
Even if I wanted to, I can't stay with you!

914
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,620
You're not a woman to me.

915
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:36,120
You're like a piece of log!

916
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:44,020
I'm like a piece of log?

917
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,980
Yes. That's all I have to say.

918
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,520
This is making you more pathetic, you know?

919
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,440
Sedal! Sedal!

920
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,540
Don't! Don't go. Let's talk.

921
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:05,080
Stop this!

922
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:31,080
You're not a woman to me anymore.

923
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:34,210
You're like a nagging older sister,

924
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,910
and you make me feel little!

925
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,490
You're like a piece of log, okay?

926
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,150
Get in.

927
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,550
Hi!

928
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,710
Yay! New clothes!

929
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,180
Finally, I got new clothes! How exciting!

930
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,020
Now.

931
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,790
Sit down.

932
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,240
What is it, mom?

933
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,710
Are you going to yell at us again?

934
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,710
I'm not.

935
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,280
Mom's going somewhere.

936
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,750
Where?

937
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,120
Somewhere far away.

938
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:32,940
Do you want to stay or come with me?

939
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:35,080
Where are you going?

940
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:36,180
I'm coming with you.

941
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,750
Bangtong, you come, too.

942
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,120
Is dad coming, too?

943
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:41,580
Dad's not coming.

944
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:42,940
It's just the three of us.

945
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,480
Do you want to come with me?

946
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:51,540
Get in.

947
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,480
Is this our car?

948
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:54,350
Yes.

949
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,690
I bought it for you guys.

950
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,190
How exciting!

951
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,590
Mom, you're the best!

952
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:02,280
We have a car! How exciting!

953
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,980
Mom, mom, I wish dad would come with us.

954
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,180
Can't you see what's going on?

955
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,550
Why would you talk about dad now?

956
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:19,140
Look how upset she looks.

957
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,250
Why aren't we taking dad?

958
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,420
Get in.

959
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:37,680
I'm not responsible for anything that happens.

960
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,150
The phone is turned off...

961
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,790
Oh, man.

962
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,080
The phone is turned off...

963
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,040
This is nuts.

964
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,150
What is it?

965
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,750
I need to go home.

966
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,150
What is it? We have to go now.

967
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,290
Just hold on.

968
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,920
I don't want anything bad to happen.

969
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,620
I'll be right back.

970
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:13,540
Hey! Where are you? Hey!

971
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,410
Sintong! Bangtong!

972
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,750
How dare you...

973
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:30,850
Your call will be forwarded to voice message.

974
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,520
This is nuts.

975
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,390
What is it?

976
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,620
Mom, are the boys with you?

977
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,190
No, why?

978
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,910
There's no one home, and she won't answer the phone.

979
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:52,650
I called her office and she's on vacation.

980
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,820
Where did she go? She took the boys?

981
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,040
Right?

982
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:00,120
Mom, come to my apartment. We need to talk.

983
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:01,890
Okay.

984
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,980
After you meet my father,

985
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:26,140
we'll go ahead and plan our wedding.

986
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,080
You cannot marry him.

987
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,650
I'm taking this to the police!

988
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,620
How dare you punish my child?

989
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:50,020
How can a teacher beat my child?

990
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,320
I'm sorry.

991
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,120
I apologize for what he did.

992
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:58,520
What if something bad happens to my child?

993
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:01,980
I'll make sure this doesn't happen again.

994
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,180
I'm very sorry.

995
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:13,120
Let's go.

996
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,290
Oh, what's with the fuss?

997
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,190
Are you introducing me to your future wife?

998
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,390
It's Sangnam's future wife, not mine.

999
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,390
My daughter in law is coming today.

1000
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,940
Really? Sangnam went on a blind date?

1001
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:30,440
He didn't. He found one on his own.

1002
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,350
I never met her before.

1003
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,440
And you're calling her your daughter in law?

1004
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:37,850
I trust Sangnam,

1005
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,850
and I trust Sunjeong.

1006
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:44,680
You go ahead. The excavator mechanic is coming, so I'll catch up with you.

1007
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,590
- Okay. I'll see you later.
- Yes.

1008
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:49,350
- I'm going!
- I envy you.

1009
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,620
- Bye.
- Yes, I'll see you.

1010
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:51,520
Okay.

1011
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:55,550
Wow!

1012
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,890
That smells delicious.

1013
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,850
Sunjeong, what should I wear?

1014
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,620
You should wear something nice.

1015
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:04,810
Should I wear a suit?

1016
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,680
You don't have to go that far.

1017
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,320
Wear a shirt and a cardigan.

1018
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,810
okay.

1019
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:15,040
I'm nervous. I hope she likes me.

1020
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:18,210
But Daese, your hair is a bit...

1021
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,140
Why? Does it look weird?

1022
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,990
I think you should do your hair again.

1023
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:25,210
Hairstyle for men is like makeup for women.

1024
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,620
I don't have time to go see my barber.

1025
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:30,420
Just go to a nearby hair salon.

1026
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:32,820
You could get them to style your hair.

1027
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,580
I got it.

1028
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,790
Oh, hold on!

1029
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,090
Excuse me?

1030
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:49,510
I'd like to get my hair done. Can you do it?

1031
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:52,090
I have to be somewhere.

1032
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:54,740
Please. This is really important for me.

1033
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,440
I can't...

1034
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,910
- Oh, my...
- Please!

1035
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:00,120
Oh, my! I can't! Hey!

1036
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,750
- Come in.
- Oh, my!

1037
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,920
I can't believe you. Oh...

1038
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,290
Oh, my...

1039
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,150
I'm in a hurry. What would you like?

1040
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,220
Just make me look good.

1041
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,940
Make you look good?

1042
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,320
- You have curly hair?
- Yes.

1043
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,510
Blow drying it to style it won't do.

1044
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:26,320
I'd have to straighten it.

1045
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,180
That's going to take time.

1046
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,390
Please, I really need this.

1047
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:34,980
I'm sorry.

1048
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,350
I'll pay whatever you want,

1049
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,540
so please make me look really good.

1050
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,280
I think she planned this.

1051
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:49,550
She cleaned the whole apartment and emptied the trash.

1052
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:52,080
She even took the boys.

1053
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:55,280
If she just went somewhere, that's okay.

1054
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,750
What if it's not just that?

1055
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,690
Who knows? Awful things happen these days.

1056
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,450
Mom! How could you?

1057
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,790
Hurry over!

1058
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:10,420
What is it?

1059
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:13,220
Mom, Sedal wants me to come over.

1060
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,440
What's going on?

1061
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,980
I don't know.

1062
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:18,850
He said she must have planned this.

1063
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:22,890
She cleaned the apartment and everything.

1064
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:27,290
She took out the trash and took the boys.

1065
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,890
I don't know where she fled to.

1066
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,210
She fled to somewhere? Why?

1067
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,120
Excuse me...

1068
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:37,420
It's okay if she just fled,

1069
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:41,210
but I'm afraid of her trying something stupid, like in the news.

1070
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,790
You should hurry over to his apartment.

1071
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,250
I'll come over right after I'm done here.

1072
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:47,020
I think something's burning.

1073
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,790
What could be burning?

1074
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,750
It's not burnt.

1075
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,350
But the smell...

1076
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,890
I don't smell anything.

1077
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,750
Go.

1078
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:00,650
Get out.

1079
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,390
Bye!

1080
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,620
Hey...

1081
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,720
It's burnt?

1082
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,680
Yes, a bit...

1083
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,520
Why didn't she pay attention?

1084
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,440
Oh, man. What do I do now?

1085
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:18,980
I want my daughter in law to like me.

1086
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,520
She won't see that, so it's okay.

1087
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,750
Go and change. They'll be here soon.

1088
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,050
Okay. Oh, man...

1089
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:40,810
Come in.

1090
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:45,290
Hello.

1091
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,920
Welcome. You must be nervous.

1092
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:50,750
Yes, I can hear my heart pounding.

1093
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,390
This is my first time.

1094
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,040
Hey.

1095
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:57,180
Oh, my! Miho!

1096
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,720
What's going on here?

1097
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,620
She's my niece. My aunt's daughter.

1098
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,350
I told Miho earlier.

1099
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:08,580
Wow, I don't believe this.

1100
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:13,310
You didn't tell him about us, did you?

1101
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,140
No, I didn't.

1102
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,290
But I think you've graduated.

1103
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,350
No, you have to keep teaching me.

1104
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,390
And you must become my spy.

1105
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,520
Okay, I will.

1106
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,420
What are you whispering about?

1107
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,190
It's nothing.

1108
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,250
We must be meant to be together.

1109
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:34,890
Miho's my baby brother's girlfriend.

1110
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,980
She's told me a lot about you.

1111
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:38,790
Her third sister in law.

1112
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,120
Gwangbak, good luck.

1113
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:44,920
I'm going to piano lesson.

1114
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,290
I'll see you later.

1115
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,920
Yes, see you.

1116
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,390
Come straight home when you're done.

1117
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,080
Where's father?

1118
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:52,410
He's getting dolled up in his room.

1119
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:54,590
He even went to a beauty salon.

1120
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,280
He didn't have to.

1121
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,390
Father!

1122
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:01,540
That's enough! Come out!

1123
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,280
Your daughter in law is here.

1124
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,250
Okay.

1125
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,620
Oh, I can't believe she burned my hair.

1126
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,020
I'll get her for this.

1127
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:19,080
My daughter in law, welcome.

1128
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,480
Nice.

1130
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,920
Where did she go with the boys?

1131
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:06,720
We should call the police, Sedal.

1132
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,680
She must be...

1133
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,450
How many years has it been?

1134
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:12,020
Did you miss me?

1135
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,550
Of course.

1136
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:15,390
I've never forgotten you.

1137
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,350
I'm going to stop delivering to your house.

1138
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,810
Minjung, actually...

1139
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,890
Please don't ever see my son again.

1140
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:27,310
Please let me see you and apologize in person.

1141
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:31,040
You met a rude girl and completely lost your head!

1142
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,350
This is who you are?

1143
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,250
Is this really who you are?
