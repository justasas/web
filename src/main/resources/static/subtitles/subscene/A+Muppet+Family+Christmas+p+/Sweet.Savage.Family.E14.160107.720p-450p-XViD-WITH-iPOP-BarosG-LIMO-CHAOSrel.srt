<i>I told you to keep your feet
out of the mine field.</i>

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,030
<i>You just struck a mine.</i>

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,160
<i>Now, I have no choice.</i>

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,700
What the heck is he talking about?

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,190
Be quiet!

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,690
<i>I realized a long time ago, that I should
pay the cost of living a brand new life.</i>

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,880
<i>It's my fault that I didn't
put that plan into action.</i>

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,130
I'm taking the original
recordings to a reporter.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,900
It'll be a big story in
tomorrow's newspaper.

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,530
It's time to end this ridicule.

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,900
Let's pay the prices for our sins.

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,230
You have to stop him now.

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,610
You need to find that reporter.
Check every newspaper.

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,050
How am I supposed to find him?
There are so many newspapers!

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,470
Are you going to just sit around
and let this happen then?

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,350
Tae Soo is trying to go to hell,
and he wants to take us there with him!

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,090
I got it.

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,940
Leave it to me for now.

Mr. Yoon?

21
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,660
Are you Reporter Kim Hyuk Soo?

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,190
- Yes.
- Hi.

23
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,200
What happened to your arm?

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,510
Oh, it's nothing.

25
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,430
Honey, give it to him.

26
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,590
We're depending on you for this.

27
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,190
We've come this far, risking our lives.

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,680
Here it is.

29
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,440
Of course, I know.

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,290
The country will be up in arms tomorrow.

31
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,500
I'll make sure that your courage
does not go wasted.

32
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,230
Please help us.

33
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,860
We're depending on you.

34
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,290
Honey, did we do the right thing?

35
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,600
I'm really nervous.
I feel uneasy.

36
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,940
It's only natural
for you to feel nervous.

37
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,550
In a few hours, our lives
will change completely.

38
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,040
But... no matter what,
let's not regret our decisions.

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,670
It's already out of our hands.

40
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,300
Geez.

41
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,750
Soon, my handsome husband
will be on TV once again.

42
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,510
It feels like yesterday, they coined you
a hero on TV for catching the deserter.

43
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,040
This time, you're the snitch.

44
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,700
You do lead a rough life.

45
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,130
Don't worry about me.
I've already been to jail.

46
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,670
Now that I think about it,
it was good practice for me.

47
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,900
The floor isn't that cold.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,190
I don't even need this, honestly.

49
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,010
You must be proud.

50
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,720
But...

51
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,790
I'm worried about you.

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,270
You'll have to take care of
the family without me for a while.

53
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,090
I need to find a job.

54
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,470
I'll do anything.

55
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,490
I am sorry, Eun Ok.

56
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,700
Thank you for trusting me,
and for following me.

57
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,310
I really am sorry.

58
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,560
Make sure to explain the situation
to your mom and the kids

59
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,870
so they're not completely shocked.

60
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,340
And don't worry about me.

61
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,650
Okay.

62
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,310
Here. Drink up!

63
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,920
To my wife, whom I love
more than anything else in the world.

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,020
All right!

65
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,130
Even if the whole world turns upside down
tomorrow, I won't regret this.

66
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,710
Here.

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
Dad.

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,360
Hey.

69
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,030
You haven't gone to sleep yet?

70
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,700
You're still up.

71
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,860
Dad.

72
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,420
Can I talk to you?

73
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,040
Okay, I'll see you upstairs.

74
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,640
Let's get you into bed.

75
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,420
What's with this look on
my son's handsome face?

76
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,160
Is something wrong?

77
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,030
Dad.

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,110
I'm not a little boy.

79
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,170
Tell me the truth.

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,200
Was there a problem
because I lost the pen?

81
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,330
The pen that you gave me.

82
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,830
Geez, what are you talking about?

83
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,500
It's not like that.

84
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,840
Then what is it?

85
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,780
I need to know.

86
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,500
Okay.

87
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,710
You're not a child anymore.
You're an adult now.

88
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,200
You know that...
just like Hyun Jee's dad

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,650
my line of work
was not very reputable.

90
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,590
Shameful adults, we are...

91
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,430
I will pay the costs for my sins,
and I will start a new life.

92
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,610
Pay the costs?

93
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,230
It's something that I have to do.

94
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,110
So, for a while...

95
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,870
I won't be around.

96
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,980
Dad...

97
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,450
You and I are the only
two men in this family.

98
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,520
My son...

99
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,650
Please take care of...
your mom, and everyone else.

100
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,520
Okay?

101
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,490
<i>[KEEP US SAFE TODAY.]</i>

102
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,440
<i>It's not here.</i>

103
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,060
I don't see anything.

104
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,260
What's going on?
Why isn't the story here?

105
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,860
Is it going to be in tomorrow's paper?
No, he said it'll be printed right away.

106
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,770
Maybe he meant it'll be a TV story,
or he was going to publish it online.

107
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,810
No, I didn't see anything.
I already checked.

108
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,750
What the heck...

109
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,820
What?

110
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,730
He's on vacation?

111
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,450
He didn't mention that yesterday.
Why is he on vacation, all of a sudden?

112
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,010
Then give me his home phone number.

113
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,630
I need to talk to him!
But his cell phone is off!

114
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,290
Then give me his home address...

115
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,700
Hello? Hello?

116
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,520
What the heck?

117
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,650
Nice work, Director Baek!

118
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,100
I couldn't have imagined that you
would take care of it so quickly.

119
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, this wasn't my doing.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,150
With his knack for good judgment,
Reporter Kim is destined for success.

121
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,490
Oh, thank you.

122
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,170
I was listening to the recording
when Director Baek called me.

123
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,170
I knew, immediately, that this would be
very sensitive material to write about.

124
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,430
Director Baek, be sure to treat him well.

125
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,320
Of course.

126
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,710
We've already spoken.

127
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,850
Reporter Kim.

128
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,100
What are you doing?

129
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,840
Are you really a reporter?

130
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,430
What are you doing?
Are you threatening him?

131
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,980
- You stay out of it.
- Huh?

132
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,200
You're a journalist. How could you
stab someone in the back like this?

133
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,150
You're no different than a gangster!

134
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,540
A journalist's conscience?

135
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,990
That's a good argument.

136
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,310
However, when I thought
about my family...

137
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,390
It didn't matter that much.

138
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,390
Also, nothing would change anyway.

139
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,620
Reporter Kim!

140
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,730
It's best to avoid a fight that
you have no chance of winning.

141
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,530
At your age, you can't
run on passion.

142
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,840
Tae Soo, did you hear that?

143
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,000
No matter how hard you try,
you can't escape our grip.

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,540
My dad is furious.
You're in big trouble.

145
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,030
Please go inside.
The editor-in-chief is waiting for you.

146
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,680
This is Yoon Tae Soo.

147
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,400
Manager, what do you mean?

148
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,950
I don't have to come anymore?

149
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,160
You missed several days' work.

150
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,390
We already found someone.
You should go home.

151
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,230
I'll mail you your last check.

152
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,520
You told me you would excuse my absence!

153
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,010
Why are you doing this, all of a sudden?

154
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,990
Is there a real reason
you're not telling me?

155
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,610
Geez, I'm a really busy man!

156
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,000
Manager!

157
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,990
Mr. Yoon Tae Soo.

158
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,050
Why didn't you tell me
you worked for Choong Shim?

159
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,980
They keep sending people
here to bother me.

160
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,050
We really don't want to get
involved with Choong Shim.

161
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,970
Well...

162
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,870
Nice!

163
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,490
Did something good happen?

164
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,690
It seems that Gi Bum
is finally displaying his worth.

165
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,950
Come again?

166
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,590
He tamed a crazy horse
with just one hard grip!

167
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,780
If you want to praise
Director Baek, do it properly.

168
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,220
Not just with your words.

169
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,580
What do you mean?

170
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,990
Please grant his wish.

171
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,610
Why don't you meet with Lee Do Kyung?

172
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,120
Please?

173
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,720
Hyun Jee! Hyun Jee!

174
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,340
Dad! What are you so excited about?

175
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,730
Hyun Jee, your grandpa invited you
and your mom to his house for dinner!

176
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,160
What are you talking about?

177
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,200
Oh, Do Kyung.

178
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,830
My dad wants to see you.

179
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,620
I know it's awkward for you.
But please, do it for me.

180
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,120
Why bother?
It's going to be really awkward.

181
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,580
Hyun Jee and I won't go.

182
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,020
I'm going.

183
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,030
I want to see Grandpa's house again.
Just like the old days.

184
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,670
Dad, tell Grandpa that
I'll be there, no matter what.

185
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,760
Hyun Jee.

186
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,900
Really?

187
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,240
Definitely.

188
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,110
Honey.

189
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,620
How did it go? Did you see Reporter Kim?

190
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,850
Yes.

191
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,750
What? Is it what we thought?

192
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,630
Seriously?

193
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,670
Geez, I ask to be punished,
but they won't help.

194
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,510
What kind of a world do we live in?

195
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,500
We risked our lives for that!

196
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,270
I'm going to protest in front of
Choong Shim, or the newspaper offices.

197
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,730
I can't let it end like this!

198
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,170
Calm down.

199
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,960
How can I calm down?

200
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,730
Even if they destroy me because of it,
I have to do something.

201
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,110
All I'm saying,
is that now is not the time.

202
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,360
They have every intention
of destroying us.

203
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,650
I already know.

204
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,160
That you got fired from Home Mart.

205
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,980
Geez. I'm so sick and tired of them!

206
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,950
What did we ever do to them?

207
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,640
I'm sick and tired of the Baek family!

208
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,130
<i>I already know.
That you got fired from Home Mart.</i>

209
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,930
<i>Geez. I'm sick and tired of them.</i>

210
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,370
What did we ever do to them?

211
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,990
I'm sick and tired of the Baek family!

212
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,470
Even if you get a new job,
you'll get fired almost right away.

213
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,980
Also, they'll try to kick us
out of the house soon.

214
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,740
What do we do now?

215
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,160
I'll get a job.

216
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,620
They won't do that to me.

217
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,720
I know how you feel.

218
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,320
But you should take care of the kids.

219
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,420
No matter the situation,
I'll bring home money.

220
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,190
Honey, you can't just say that.

221
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,410
We're in deep trouble right now.

222
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,280
I'll do my best to not
spend money from now on.

223
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,320
The kids should stop
going to cram school.

224
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,020
You can't do that!

225
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,450
You said that since they wont be getting
any inheritance, you need to study.

226
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,670
But we are in a different situation now.

227
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,180
Do you know what our cost of living is,
on a monthly basis?

228
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,750
Bills, groceries,
your mom needs money...

229
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,840
The kids' cram school fees
and their allowances...

230
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,650
The minimum is two million won per month.

231
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,690
I can't go to a hair salon or buy clothes
for myself without worrying about money.

232
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:40,190
When we move out of this house,
where can we really go?

233
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,420
We need at least two or three billion won
to put down a deposit on rent.

234
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,070
You have no job
and nothing to use as collateral.

235
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,090
We can't even get a loan!

236
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,870
Sometimes, I even contemplate
borrowing money from a loan shark.

237
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,660
This is not the time to worry
about the kids' cram school.

238
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,300
You often say we're standing
on the edge of a cliff, right?

239
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,800
Right now, that's exactly how I feel.

240
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,530
Sung Min.

241
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,630
I'm a pathetic father.

242
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,740
I feel ashamed, and I am sorry.

243
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,060
It's all so absurd...
yet, I can do nothing about it.

244
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,950
Sung Min, I wish...

245
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,100
I wish that you
will be different than me.

246
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,650
You can do the right thing
when you have power.

247
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,830
Only when you have power,
can you protect your family.

248
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,390
Sung Min, you're studying so hard.

249
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,720
So, you will do well.

250
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,060
You always have.

251
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,770
What are you doing up?

252
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,340
Eun Sil, your friend's father
owns a food company, right?

253
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,250
Do you still talk to her?

254
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,250
Yes, why?

255
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,480
Find out if they have any open positions.

256
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,560
They hire a lot of married women.

257
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,860
Eun Ok.

258
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,840
Young people who just graduated
from college can't find a job.

259
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,210
It won't be easy to find a job after
spending 20 years tidying up the house.

260
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,250
You're talking nonsense.

261
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,330
Either way, find out for me.

262
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,400
Why?

263
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,670
Are you nervous because
Tae Soo quit Choong Shim?

264
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,790
Then get into business.

265
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,620
Starting your own business
is the way to go.

266
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,030
Hi. I'm interested in getting a loan.

267
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,450
I'm a stay-at-home mom.

268
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,650
Collateral?

269
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,580
I have nothing.

270
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,090
I see.

271
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,960
I'm too old, I'm too inexperienced.

272
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,650
Geez, I can't find a job,
I can't get a loan...

273
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,360
Geez.

274
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,860
Mom!

275
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,780
Oh, Soo Min! How was school?

276
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,030
Good.

277
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,690
I saw her on the way.
She gave me a free one.

278
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,590
You didn't have to do that.
Give me this week's special.

279
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,860
Sure.

280
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,410
Soo Min must be happy.

281
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,810
Her mom is taking care of her at home.

282
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,020
Ma'am, how do you like your job?

283
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,880
I like it. It's pretty good to me.

284
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,770
I'm sorry to ask you this,
but how much do you make?

285
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,960
If I apply, can I start right away?

286
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,340
Why don't you ask the company?

287
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,920
Oh, of course. I'm sorry.

288
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,580
What was that? You want to work?

289
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,120
Well, I was just curious...

290
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,380
Hurry up. I'm really hungry.
What do we have at home?

291
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,570
I didn't go grocery shopping.
How about kimchi fried rice?

292
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,980
Yes! Your kimchi fried rice is the best!

293
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,820
It's way better than
anywhere around here.

294
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,370
- Really?
- Yes.

295
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,510
You'd make big money in front
of a cram school. Just not mine.

296
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,190
I said I would do it!

297
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,030
Geez! Boss!

298
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,350
Can you really support
your family by doing that?

299
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,280
I need to do what I need to do.

300
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,150
Boss, let's go to Seoul together.

301
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,750
What? Seoul?

302
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,940
Someone I know just
opened a club in Gangnam.

303
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,090
But he hasn't hired a manager yet.

304
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:15,840
He's offering twice as much as
what you made at Choong Shim.

305
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,910
Sung Goo!

306
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,670
I know. It's a fancy neighborhood.

307
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,320
It's a bit intimidating.

308
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,400
But you won't need to
worry about your family.

309
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,400
Do you want to be a gangster again?

310
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,080
What was the point
of leaving Choong Shim?

311
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,810
Don't come to me
offering things like that!

312
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,320
Boss!

313
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,270
Geez... I can't believe him.

314
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,040
"I love you!" "Thank you!"

315
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,790
Learn Chinese at
Mr. Wang's Chinese School!

316
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,500
"I love you!" "Thank you!"

317
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,740
Huh? What are you doing?

318
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,500
Director Bong. Producer Lee.

319
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,450
How did you find me?

320
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,970
You can't do this to us.

321
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,110
You threatened us into making this movie.

322
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,400
And then you left us, just like that?

323
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,530
I had no choice.

324
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,660
I understand why you did it.

325
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,280
But even your wife quit.
What are we supposed to do?

326
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,440
She did?

327
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,240
Our movie is falling apart.
Please help us, Mr. Yoon!

328
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,810
I'm really sorry, guys.

329
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,140
I'm no longer a part of Choong Shim.

330
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,600
You already know that.

331
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,300
Someday, I'll pay back
what I owe you guys.

332
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,140
Making a movie isn't child's play.

333
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,840
You guys are too much!
You are too much!

334
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,680
Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee!

335
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,290
How can you just leave us like that?

336
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,520
Director Bong!

337
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,790
Geez...

338
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,850
Hey, Sung Min!

339
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,520
What's up with you?

340
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,360
You don't take my calls,
you ignore my texts...

341
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,170
We just started dating.
But you're already ignoring me?

342
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,020
Oh, man! You're not even
going to try to give me an excuse?

343
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,950
Okay.

344
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,510
Since something wonderful
happened to me today

345
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,220
I will let it go, just this once.

346
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,750
Aren't you going to ask me what happened?

347
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,220
What is it?

348
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,970
I'm going to my grandpa's house.

349
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,850
He invited me and my mom to dinner.

350
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,470
If it goes well, my parents
might get back together.

351
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,980
I wanted to tell you
before anyone else!

352
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,060
I am sorry... but I have to go.

353
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,450
I'm not feeling well.

354
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,240
Are you sick?
Do you have a cold?

355
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,080
I don't think you have a fever.

356
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,200
Then, I'll take you home.

357
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,780
No, thanks. It's not that bad.

358
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,630
Okay then. Rest well at home.

359
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,380
Call me when you feel better.

360
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,180
Honey, I'm home.

361
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,120
Oh, you're home!

362
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,780
Welcome home.
You must be hungry.

363
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,600
Well, I was so busy that
I didn't have the time to eat.

364
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,250
Go wash your hands.
I'll get your dinner ready.

365
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,120
Ta-da!

366
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,180
Oh, it's kimchi fried rice!

367
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,780
You must be hungry. Eat up.

368
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,630
Oh, it looks good.

369
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,560
How is it?

370
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,570
It goes without saying

371
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,650
that I would not notice if someone
was dying right next to me.

372
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,970
This is a little taste of heaven!

373
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,450
Yeah?

374
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,750
Oh, by the way...

375
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,940
I heard you quit acting.

376
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,080
Oh? How did you know?

377
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,780
Well...

378
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,210
Director Bong and Producer Lee
came to see me earlier.

379
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,400
You're not going to regret it?
You really wanted to do it.

380
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,560
There's nothing to regret.

381
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,010
It's not like acting was my dream.
I did that to keep the house.

382
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,110
That's that.

383
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,930
So, there is something that
I want to do more than acting.

384
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,220
Huh?

385
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,600
Honey, why don't you quit your gig,
and start a business with me?

386
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,250
We have no money
with which to start a business.

387
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,190
Not too big. We can start small.

388
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,190
How about a food truck?

389
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,450
We can start with kimchi fried rice.

390
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,030
A food truck?

391
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,720
All you know is housekeeping.
How are you going to run a business?

392
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,980
I'm being serious.

393
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,060
Look at this.

394
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,500
I compiled this scrap book.

395
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,530
Huh?

396
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,240
I'm worried about you working
out in the cold all day.

397
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,790
Soo Min says mine is better than
the restaurant in front of her school.

398
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,720
I thought about it, and it's the perfect
thing that we can actually manage to do!

399
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,700
It's cheaper to buy a food truck
than it is to rent a store.

400
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,880
I have plenty of kimchi!

401
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,090
Wow, when did you make all of of this?

402
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,570
I'm worried about the table.

403
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,420
It might fall into the ground!

404
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,100
I tried. For someone
with culinary training

405
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,110
this isn't much, right?

406
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,490
Now that we're all sitting together...

407
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,030
we look like a true family!

408
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,120
What kind of family?
A quiet family.

409
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,110
Do Kyung, how is it?
Do you like the food?

410
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,840
Yes, Madam.

411
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,700
Do you like the food, Mr. Chairman?

412
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,720
Yep.

413
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,480
- Dad.
- Yeah?

414
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,340
Can you pass me the fish?

415
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:47,280
Huh? Oh, the fish! This fish!

416
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,330
Oh, here, eat the fish!

417
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,860
Grandpa, please.

418
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,020
Huh?

419
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,580
It used to be your job.

420
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,970
Hyun Jee...

421
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,950
Hyun Jee, I'll do that for you.

422
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,710
No, I don't want you to.

423
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,460
You always left bones. I only ever ate
the ones Grandpa would fix for me!

424
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,400
Grandpa, won't you do it for me?

425
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,330
I knew it. You're the best!

426
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,840
By the way, this house
hasn't changed one bit.

427
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,810
This table... and the cabinet over there.

428
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,570
You really remember all of that?

429
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,520
Yes. I think about
this place all the time.

430
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,150
That way, I won't forget.

431
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,660
With Do Kyung and Hyun Jee here...

432
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,100
This big house actually feels full.

433
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:20,130
It's like... finally,
our family is complete.

434
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,660
I need to talk to you.

435
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,340
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

436
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,940
Not you.

437
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,890
Sit down.

438
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,740
Do you have something
you want to say to me?

439
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,790
You raised your daughter well.

440
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,950
She grew up on her own.

441
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,120
I just cheered her on.

442
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,940
Move in here with Hyun Jee.

443
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,810
Pardon me?

444
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:03,580
It's better to gain a daughter in-law and
a granddaughter than it is to lose a son.

445
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,680
I will think about it.
And I'll let you know.

446
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,430
Okay. I hope you'll do it.

447
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,050
What I said last time...
I said that amidst my worries for my son.

448
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,150
Please erase that from your head.

449
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,590
If you live here, it will be pretty
uncomfortable for both of us.

450
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,720
But...

451
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,430
Let's try not to ruin it
like we did ten years ago.

452
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,620
I understand.

453
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:42,220
More than anything,
we need the lady of Choong Shim.

454
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,890
You should prepare for that,
starting tomorrow.

455
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,490
But you have Madam Oh.

456
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,300
If I suddenly emerge, wouldn't that
trigger some sour feedback?

457
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,590
I'll go with the flow.

458
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:59,010
That will be the best way to go about it.

459
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,670
In the end, it's all Gi Bum's.
So you should help him along.

460
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,820
He's still lacking.

461
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,600
I think Gi Bum goes underestimated.
He's a real, hidden gem.

462
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,540
He didn't receive
a lot of love and trust.

463
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,210
So he made a few mistakes.

464
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,500
But it seems, from now on,
he's going to be different.

465
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,840
I will help him with all of my might.

466
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,020
How is it? Does it look decent?

467
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,610
After all this cleaning, it's spotless.

468
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,410
Sung Goo spent big money to help us out.

469
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,850
Boss, am I a stranger to you?

470
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:51,000
He might have spent everything
he saved to get married one day.

471
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,020
Really?

472
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,680
Sung Goo, you might not
be able to get married then.

473
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,160
What are you saying?

474
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,440
I saved so much money that
I don't even know where to put it.

475
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,120
If I can't get married just
because I spent some money

476
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,340
then I must be pretty pathetic!

477
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,340
- Really?
- Yes!

478
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,740
Sung Goo must be a pretty capable man.

479
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,540
Wait, honey.
I think something is missing.

480
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,650
Huh?

481
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,550
Right! It's the name!

482
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,210
We don't have a name for the truck!

483
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,200
That's right! We forgot
the most important thing!

484
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,250
Wait a second.

485
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,410
Oh!

486
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,840
How about Gyeryong Mountain Fried Rice?

487
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,420
What is that? It sounds like
a place to get your fortune told.

488
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,290
How about Fry Fry?

489
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,000
Fry Fry?

490
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,120
Well, it's not bad.

491
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,040
But it sounds like a hair salon.

492
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,750
Does it?

493
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,980
Boss!

494
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,530
How about Gangster Fried Rice?

495
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,160
Yes! That sounds good!

496
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,550
Are you kidding me?
You can keep that name.

497
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,800
How about Tae Soo and Eun Ok's?

498
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,080
So annoying! Annoying! Annoying!

499
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,400
Who said you could use my name?
That's so embarrassing!

500
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,560
Change it! Change it!

501
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,840
You aren't the only Soo Min in Korea.

502
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,720
You should know that
it's quite honorable.

503
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,100
Geez! Never, ever!

504
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,690
Change it! Change it to Sung Min's!

505
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,650
Eun Ok, just change it to
Little Kiddo's Fried Rice.

506
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,810
I told you not to call me Little Kiddo!

507
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,180
Oh, my! What's wrong, my little puppy?

508
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,690
I love that name!

509
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,350
By the way...

510
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,230
Will this type of business work?

511
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,980
Of course!

512
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,740
Food trucks are popular these days.

513
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,180
If the food is good,
people will hear about it.

514
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,060
And the line will be miles long!

515
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,230
Trust me.

516
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,320
Really?

517
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,740
Then we'll get rich really soon, right?

518
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,540
We'll have to see.

519
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,750
You're getting ahead of yourself again.

520
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,010
It's Eun Ok's kimchi fried rice!
I can set my sights high!

521
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,490
Am I wrong?

522
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:30,720
Now that you started the business...

523
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,450
Do your best, so that you
won't miss Choong Shim!

524
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,510
You know what I mean, right?

525
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,140
Yes, Mom.

526
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,940
It's cold. Let's go inside.

527
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,080
- Let's go.
- Come on.

528
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,860
Soo Min, don't be upset.

529
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,220
I'm glad that it will do well.

530
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,750
We'll see, we'll see!

531
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,770
Dad, this is bad!

532
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,380
What do you mean?

533
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,550
Huh? Huh?

534
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,720
Oh, my!

535
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,330
Where did the truck go?

536
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,770
I don't know. I came out to
take a photo but it was gone.

537
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,670
Could someone have stolen the truck?

538
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,000
Who would steal a used truck?

539
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,290
Honey... perhaps...

540
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,170
I can't believe it.

541
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,950
Did the chairman order you to do it?

542
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,380
What are you talking about?

543
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,080
Did he tell you to steal my truck?

544
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,970
You've got the wrong person!
What would I do with that used truck?

545
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,830
How did you know it was a used truck?

546
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,220
Well... that's...

547
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,890
Well... you can't buy a new truck...

548
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,720
Geez, let go!

549
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,940
This is ridiculous!
Why are you treating me like a thief?

550
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,650
What did you say?

551
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,250
Look here, Mr. Yoon.

552
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,120
I'm not your underling.

553
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,200
Why are you treating me
like I'm your underling?

554
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,660
You brat!

555
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,250
Okay, go ahead. Hit me.

556
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,100
Hit me, hit me. Huh? Huh?

557
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,350
You...

558
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,550
Hey.

559
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,390
Bring me evidence. Real evidence.

560
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,020
<i>Hyun Jee, Do Kyung!</i>

561
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,410
<i>All together in this house...</i>

562
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,480
<i>Let's live happily ever after!</i>

563
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,940
You're in a good mood.

564
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,660
Can I help you with anything?

565
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,530
Not really.

566
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,560
It's so great that the two
of you got back together.

567
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,890
I am so happy for you.

568
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,160
Now, it's time to take
care of our business.

569
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,840
What business?

570
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,260
What do you mean?

571
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,360
You know, the chairman and I getting
married officially and reporting it.

572
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,140
You didn't forget that, did you?

573
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,920
Oh, that's right! My little brain!

574
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,290
I didn't know how brazen-faced
you actually were, Madam Oh.

575
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,420
Come again?

576
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,890
Think about it.

577
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:07,160
I bribed the reporter,
and therefore, I stopped Tae Soo.

578
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,960
That's how I earned this.

579
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,370
And it was Hyun Jee
who melted Dad's icy heart.

580
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:16,080
Honestly, what have you done, Madam Oh?

581
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,130
What? How can you say that?

582
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,380
I drove Kim Eun Ok out from One Heart,
so Do Kyung could become chairwoman.

583
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,430
You know that!

584
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,400
So, did she become chairwoman?

585
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,250
Director Baek!

586
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,300
Please get out.
Dad might see you.

587
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,240
<i>Now, it's time to take
care of our business.</i>

588
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,770
<i>What business?</i>

589
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,520
<i>What do you mean?</i>

590
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,180
<i>You know, the chairman and I getting
married officially and reporting it.</i>

591
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,930
<i>You didn't forget that, did you?</i>

592
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:06,490
Oh... what are you
doing here, Mr. Chairman?

593
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,030
Madam Oh...

594
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,900
Are you feeling all right?

595
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,720
You look pale...

596
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:19,270
Is it because of Gi Bum and Do Kyung?

597
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,920
Well...

598
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,420
That's been bothering me too.

599
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,790
Yeah?

600
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,860
I thought it would be good for Gi Bum
to get back together with Do Kyung.

601
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,920
That's why I was so insistent on it.

602
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,200
But now that I think about it...

603
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,440
I feel like it's a bit rushed.

604
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,560
You might not be ready for that yet.

605
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,020
But I really rushed you.

606
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:53,320
I'm afraid I might have
made it hard on you.

607
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,240
Madam Oh.

608
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,910
Yes, Mr. Chairman?

609
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,050
You always think about me first.

610
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,000
But I haven't been
very considerate of you.

611
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,600
Is there anything you want from me?

612
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,590
I told you many times.

613
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,520
As long as you stay healthy...

614
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,350
That's enough for me.

615
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,160
Gi Bum finally got the family he wanted.

616
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:26,640
Now, you and I should live
happily, traveling together.

617
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,700
Of course, we should do that.

618
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,710
<i>[DIRECTOR BONG JIN WOOK]</i>

619
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,540
If you're done, then I will...

620
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,610
Okay. Go take care of your business.

621
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,090
Okay.

622
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:59,190
I told you to stop calling me.
We shouldn't do this.

623
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,110
Why isn't he coming back?
It's so late.

624
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,440
I wonder if it's gone forever.

625
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,200
Don't say that.

626
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:21,010
Why don't you call your dad?

627
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,210
Sure, Grandma.

628
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,310
- Honey!
- Dad!

629
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,850
Did you find the truck?

630
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,390
What happened?

631
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,710
I haven't found it yet.

632
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,830
Who the heck did this?

633
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,430
Does he even know what
that truck means to us?

634
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,710
Oh my goodness!

635
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,730
Don't worry, Mom.

636
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,740
I said I would find it,
and I will find it!

637
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,290
Wait and see.
Give me three days. I'll find it.

638
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,850
<i>Are you feeling better?</i>

639
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:11,450
<i>Something big happened at my grandpa's.
Aren't you curious?</i>

640
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:15,680
<i>Yoon Sung Min, I don't like
how you are these days!</i>

641
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,500
<i>You're ignoring my texts!</i>

642
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,530
<i>Okay, keep it up!</i>

643
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,920
<i>When I'm upset, you won't
be able to handle me!</i>

644
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,680
<i>[TURN OFF]</i>

645
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,730
Why isn't he calling me?

646
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,640
Are you sleeping?

647
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,920
Come in.

648
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,730
Well...

649
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,580
Tonight is our last night
living together, just the two of us.

650
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,660
So, I want to sleep with you tonight.

651
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,030
Shall we?

652
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,020
Okay.

653
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,370
Dad is going to be so happy tomorrow.

654
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,350
Finally, the day he's been anxiously
awaiting, for you and him, is here!

655
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,030
Don't tease me. I'm moving in
there because you wanted to!

656
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,340
If you keep that up,
I'll cancel the move tomorrow!

657
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,340
No...

658
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,230
I think I put it somewhere here.

659
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,130
Please handle with care!

660
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,520
These are the ladies' belongings.
Be gentle with them.

661
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,890
This one! This one!

662
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,480
This one goes to that room over there.

663
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,870
Hyun Jee, that box is yours, right?

664
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:58,430
- Well, wait. Mom?
- Do Kyung?

665
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,900
- What?
- See that box?

666
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,810
Don't carry that. It's heavy.

667
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,370
Is that box mine or yours?

668
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,170
Yours are all in your room.
I already organized it.

669
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,620
- Thank you, Mom!
- You're welcome!

670
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,350
Madam Oh.

671
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,100
What are you doing in here all alone?

672
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,210
I just wanted to stay out of their way.

673
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,840
Oh, are you going out?

674
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,810
Did you forget?

675
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,170
I told you, it's the couples party!

676
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,760
Oh... no.

677
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,670
Get ready quickly.

678
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:43,510
Since we're going out, we could do
some shopping at a department store.

679
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,710
Or we could go to a book store
and get you some books.

680
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,980
Let's make it a date.

681
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,660
Oh... but...

682
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,920
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

683
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,500
I'm not feeling well.

684
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,910
Can't you just go by yourself?

685
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,100
It's New Year's Eve.

686
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,740
I told you it was a New Year's party.

687
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,460
I would go if I didn't feel like this.

688
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,510
Please understand.
I want to rest.

689
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,500
I guess I have no choice then.

690
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,910
I'll be late.

691
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,000
Okay. Have a good time.

692
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,880
What? Someone stole the truck?

693
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,370
Geez, I'm about to go crazy!

694
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,960
I'm really upset and sad too.
But I have no one to talk to.

695
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,310
I thought you might have a solution,
so I asked you to come meet me.

696
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,740
Well, I'll try.

697
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,500
But if they stole it to get rid of it...

698
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,570
then there's nothing
that can be done now.

699
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:55,520
What are my sister
and Tae Soo going to do?

700
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,620
We bought that truck with
all the money we could find.

701
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,550
Can't you do something, Sung Goo?

702
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,750
Tae Soo lost his job
and we need to move out soon.

703
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,890
If we don't find that truck, all five
of us will be stuck sucking our fingers.

704
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,050
I'm living off of them right now.
So I'll have to go back to Seoul.

705
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,170
That can't happen!

706
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,440
Pardon me?

707
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,660
I mean...

708
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,450
Tae Soo's family of five shouldn't be...

709
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:27,870
stuck sucking their fingers.

710
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,040
Eun Sil!

711
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,870
I need you to come with me.

712
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,310
We need to talk.

713
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,390
Do you still have something to say?

714
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:51,200
We need to close our deal
about the marriage license.

715
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,640
Of course, I will report it.

716
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,970
Do Kyung and I will
report our marriage soon.

717
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,300
Please!

718
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,520
If you keep this up,
I will not simply sit back.

719
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,000
Then what will you do?
Are you threatening me?

720
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,660
Director Baek!

721
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,450
Madam Oh Sook Ja.

722
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:10,160
What would happen...

723
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,810
if my father found out the real reason
for why you're staying with him?

724
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:20,970
You should thank me for
keeping that secret of yours.

725
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,020
- Dad!
- Oh!

726
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,770
Let's go. What do you want to eat?

727
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,170
Mom and I want rice noodles.

728
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,650
Why don't you come with us,
since the chairman isn't home?

729
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:36,490
No, she's not feeling well.
Let's go, let's go.

730
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,990
What? I haven't done anything?

731
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:53,110
Now that you've gotten
what you want, you ignore me?

732
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:59,180
How dare you...
How dare you treat me this way!

733
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:13,920
<i>Find the third volume of Dostoevsky’s
Crime and Punishment, page 69.</i>

734
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,020
<i>My dearest Madam.</i>

735
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,200
<i>While you are reading this letter...</i>

736
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,060
<i>I'm probably lying, broken-hearted,
not able to eat anything.</i>

737
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,870
<i>Madam, you were
my savior, and my Messiah.</i>

738
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:02,350
<i>Had it not been for you, I couldn't have
overcome the pain of artistic creation.</i>

739
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:05,120
<i>I would have ran away like a coward.</i>

740
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,700
<i>It's true though,
I'm in much greater pain right now.</i>

741
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,800
<i>But no matter what, I won't regret
my sweet memories with you.</i>

742
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:18,670
You are my muse,
my persona, and my soul.

743
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,500
<i>Madam, I have a favor to
ask of you, for one final time.</i>

744
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,200
<i>Please meet me one last time.</i>

745
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,680
<i>I'll live the rest of my life, cherishing
the moment we shared for the last time.</i>

746
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,490
<i>I am waiting to hear from you.</i>

747
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,360
<i>Director Bong, come right now!</i>

748
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,620
<i>At the very place where we first met...</i>

749
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,260
<i>Let's have our final moment together!</i>

750
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,160
Madam Oh!

751
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:47,160
Director Bong!

752
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,390
I wasn't going to see you again.
However...

753
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:58,290
I couldn't say no to your
beautiful, hand-written letter.

754
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,620
What about the chairman?

755
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,300
Everyone is out.

756
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,460
We have a few hours.

757
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,450
Oh! Madam!

758
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:08,950
Director Bong.

759
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:25,080
How are you, Mr. Chairman?

760
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,610
Why are you here?

761
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:30,930
Didn't I tell you that
we had a script meeting?

762
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,490
The ending needs revision.

763
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:35,670
You came home early.

764
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,590
I think I have a cold.

765
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,810
I wanted to drink your herbal tea.

766
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,890
I guess I can't.

767
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,290
Why can't you? Should I make the tea now?

768
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,390
No, continue your meeting.

769
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,810
It seems that I interrupted you.

770
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:21,670
I can't go back and forth like this.

771
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,060
It's wrong of me to do this to everyone.

772
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,500
I'm sorry. I was impulsive.

773
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,400
No, I was the one
who was impulsive.

774
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,690
When the chairman and I
officially report our marriage

775
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,510
I will be his woman for life.

776
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:43,350
I can't see you ever again.

777
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,090
I know.

778
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,110
That's why...

779
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:51,670
I am trying to make one unforgettable
memory with you for the last time.

780
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,080
Director.

781
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:02,410
Madam.

782
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,530
You're still up?

783
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,450
It's past 3 a.m.

784
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,590
I can't sleep.

785
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,990
Alcohol only makes it harder
for you to fall asleep.

786
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,390
Madam Oh.

787
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,350
Are you happy?

788
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,410
Huh?

789
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:17,180
I am happy because of you.

790
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,430
But I wonder if you are happy at all.

791
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,540
What kind of question is that?

792
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,060
I have the joy of life because of you.

793
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:33,080
But you, I wonder if you would
rather wish for your own death.

794
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,180
You're being strange.

795
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,540
Are you drunk?

796
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,260
I am drunk.

797
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:49,120
I've lived my entire life drunk.

798
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:57,680
Go to sleep.

799
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,830
I'll be in the study.
I'll sleep when I feel sleepy.

800
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,290
What's this?
I bought you a scarf.

801
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,960
Why aren't you wearing it?

802
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:02,380
You're not wearing your ring either.

803
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,910
Why are you acting this way?

804
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,010
You ignore my calls and my texts.

805
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,340
I have something to say.

806
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,870
What is it? Say it.

807
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,370
Let me hear it.

808
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,090
I'm going to focus on studying.

809
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:21,710
In college, music will just be a hobby
I pursue in my spare time.

810
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:25,160
Okay, do that.

811
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:29,240
Having a job that is your passion
doesn't always make you happy.

812
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,920
Do it as a hobby.
I'll help you.

813
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,640
No.

814
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,540
I can't see you anymore.

815
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:38,020
What?

816
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,050
I'm going to study, only.

817
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,060
I have no time to see you.

818
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,030
Yoon Sung Min!

819
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:50,720
I understand that you want to focus on
your studies and that you can't do music.

820
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:54,090
But do you really have to do this?

821
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,500
I'm trying to have
enough time just to study.

822
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,980
Honestly, I've been too
distracted since I met you.

823
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,680
I regret it.

824
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,770
Tell me. What's the real reason?

825
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,550
Is this about our parents' relationship?

826
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:19,600
Bye.

827
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,270
Yoon Sung Min!

828
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,090
I said, leave me alone!

829
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:34,760
Sung Min!

830
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,860
Yoon Sung Min!

831
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,520
Come to your senses already!

832
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,810
You promised not to do this anymore.

833
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,660
I know. I know.

834
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,270
But I can't control my own heart!

835
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,870
You need to review these.

836
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:58,200
Who's calling at this hour?

837
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,910
Hello?

838
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:03,660
Who is it?

839
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,070
Chairman Baek Man Bo?

840
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,150
Yes, Mr. Chairman!
What is this about?

841
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:16,840
Yes, I understand. I will do that.

842
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,110
What did he say?

843
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:26,400
He has something to discuss
with me about investing in films.

844
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,810
What?

845
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,310
Is that it?
He didn't say anything else?

846
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:33,860
Do you wish that there was something?

847
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,290
I'm just a bit nervous for you.

848
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:40,310
When you go there,
don't even look at Madam Oh, okay?

849
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:45,360
You promised to move on.
You better only think about the movie.

850
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,430
Okay. I got it. I know that.

851
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,010
Madam!

852
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,130
Oh?

853
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,190
How could you come here without notice?
The chairman is here.

854
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:06,100
It's not like that!
The chairman told me to come.

855
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:10,130
The chairman called you? For what?

856
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:13,220
He said that he wanted to discuss
something about investing in films.

857
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,760
Wait, why are you here?

858
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,060
He told me to stay here.
He said he has something to show me.

859
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,010
Oh, no!

860
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,170
Oh, no!

861
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:56,950
Say something.

862
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:00,730
I will decide what to do
with you after I hear it.

863
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,200
Open your mouth!

864
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,830
When it was just the two of you,
you were busy smooching!

865
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:11,990
Did you make a promise to not
open your mouths in front of me?

866
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:18,570
Mr. Chairman, please kill me.

867
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:21,900
Even though he threatened me,
using the movie...

868
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,730
I am worse than him!

869
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:28,840
I felt ashamed. I was afraid.

870
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,050
So I couldn't tell you. It's my fault.

871
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:36,640
I deserve to die.

872
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,830
Director Bong.

873
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,090
Yes?

874
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,520
Say something.

875
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:51,950
Mr. Chairman... it's...

876
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,520
It's not like that...

877
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,770
I just...

878
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,350
Is love...

879
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,410
Is love a sin?

880
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,450
What the heck...

881
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:25,800
Why is she asking us
to wait outside in the blistering cold?

882
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,600
Boss! Boss!

883
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,500
Geez.

884
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,570
What's this hunk of junk?

885
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:43,170
Boss, let's start with this.

886
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:46,720
Sung Goo, this truck is a bit...

887
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,740
You can't be picky.

888
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,790
Still, how can we sell
food in this truck?

889
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:53,240
Just trust us, Eun Ok.

890
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,470
- Fist bump!
- Fist bump!

891
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,150
Mr. Yoon!

892
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,140
Something bad has happened!

893
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,510
What's the matter?

894
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:04,930
Director Bong...

895
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:08,630
He's going to be killed!
You have to help save him.

896
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,710
Huh? What do you mean?

897
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:12,970
He said the chairman
was dragging him somewhere.

898
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:15,800
And then I heard a scream,
and the phone got disconnected.

899
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,540
Mr. Chairman... I did the wrong thing!

900
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,410
Please let me go!

901
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:31,640
You know what?

902
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,450
I haven't been fortunate
with women in my life.

903
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:38,930
I must have been cursed
when I kicked out my first wife.

904
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:41,810
When I liked someone,
Gi Bum didn't like her.

905
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:44,940
When he approved,
I got sick of her.

906
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,670
Some women even ran away with my money.

907
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:54,890
Young women, pretty women,
educated women, successful women!

908
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,900
I can't count how many women I've had!

909
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,960
Half of the people on Earth are women,
but I couldn't find anyone to love.

910
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:03,400
And then I met Madam Oh.

911
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,590
"She's the one!"

912
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:08,050
I knew that right away.

913
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:09,800
I never felt that way before!

914
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,350
"I can spend the rest
of my life with her."

915
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:19,400
"I'll laugh for her.
I'll cry for her."

916
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:21,720
That's how I wanted to live.

917
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,190
But... I wasn't the only one...

918
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,670
Who told you that you
could steal her heart?

919
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:29,320
That's your sin!

920
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:35,850
I don't care if she
likes me for my money.

921
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:39,890
I don't even care if she has a plot to
marry me, with my son as her accomplice!

922
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:45,040
Why would an amazing woman
like her live with an old man like me?

923
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,540
Do you know why I didn't
legally marry her yet?

924
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:54,590
I was afraid she might change.

925
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:59,750
I was afraid, once married, she might
divorce me and demand her alimony!

926
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,220
And recently, I decided...

927
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,810
"Okay, I'll give her a chance!
I'll give her what she wants!"

928
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,650
That's what I was going to do.

929
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:13,220
But you came out of nowhere!
How dare you?

930
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,280
I won't forgive you!

931
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,910
Wait!

932
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:21,260
Wait for me in hell.

933
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,390
I will join you later!

934
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:27,810
Mr. Chairman!

935
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:31,040
Mr. Chairman, please don't!

936
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:45,220
