1
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,950
Pretty nice up here, isn't it?

2
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,951
- Kermit?
- Huh?

3
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,759
What if we drift out to sea?

4
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,469
What if we're never heard from again?
What if there's a storm?

5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,553
- Or we get struck by lightning?
- That'd be neat.

6
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,394
Listen, nothing's gonna happen.
This is just the opening credits.

7
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,153
Oh. Where are they?

8
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,151
Wow!

9
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,631
- <i>"The Great Muppet Caper."</i>
- Nice title.

10
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,708
Whoo-wee!

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,394
I'd like to try this without the balloon.

12
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,358
- Try what? Plummeting?
- Yeah!

13
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,193
I suppose you could try it once.

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,236
- Kermit?
- Mm?

15
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,880
How long are these opening credits?

16
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,758
Just about another minute or so.

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,831
My ears are popping.

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,076
I wonder how far you
could plummet before you blacked out.

19
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,357
Well, don't try it, Gonzo.
We need you for this movie.

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,954
Sure is tempting.

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,635
- Kermit?
- Huh?

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,598
What does "BSC" stand for?

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,194
I don't know.

24
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,277
Gee, a lot of people worked on this movie.

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,830
This is nothing.
Wait till you see the end credits.

26
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,239
- Kermit?
- Mm?

27
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,278
- Are the credits over?
- Not quite.

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,790
Nobody reads those names
anyway, do they?

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,111
Sure. They all have families.

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,155
Ah.

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,435
That's it. The sky is clear.

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,354
So, OK. Well, now what do we do?
I mean, how does this movie start?

33
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,671
- Well, we just pull that rope.
- Yes, sir!

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,552
We're going down!

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,949
Heads up, below!

36
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,794
What a fantastic beginning.

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,232
<i>There'll be spectacle</i>
<i>There'll be fantasy</i>

38
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,790
<i>There'll be derring-do</i>
<i>and stuff like you have never seen</i>

39
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,236
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>Yeah. We're gonna be a movie</i>

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,278
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- <i>And me</i>

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,796
<i>There'll be heroes bold</i>
<i>There'll be comedy</i>

42
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,111
<i>And a lot of fuss</i>
<i>that ends for us real happily</i>

43
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,636
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>We can watch it all develop</i>

44
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,712
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- <i>And me</i>

45
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,156
<i>We'll take the world</i>
<i>and set it on its ear</i>

46
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,358
<i>Come on. Join in</i>
<i>We're gonna start right here</i>

47
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,510
It's OK. I landed on my head.

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,591
Come on!

49
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,272
Here, chicken!

50
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,591
Hey! Why, you...

51
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,238
Whoa!

52
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,790
Hold it!

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,952
- Go ahead, Kermit.
- Thank you. See, in this film,

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,635
me and Fozzie play crack investigative
reporters for <i>The Daily Chronicle.</i>

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,792
And Gonzo, he's our photographer.
And it's gonna be terrific.

56
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,993
Boy, I wish I were you people,
seeing this for the first time.

57
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,116
Wh?

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,117
- <i>There'll be crooks and cops</i>
- <i>There'll be villainy</i>

59
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,397
<i>But with us on call</i>
<i>we'll fix it all real easily</i>

60
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,109
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>Wow. It's gonna be terrific</i>

61
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,590
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- And me.

62
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,750
Argh!

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,155
Now, what we need, guys,
is an exciting photo story.

64
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,153
Right this way, young lady.
I'll take a picture of this chicken.

65
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,992
- Beautiful.
- That's great, Gonzo.

66
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,674
Yeah. Smile, chicky babe.

67
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,557
My jewels! That man stole my jewels!

68
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,029
Help! My jewels!

69
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,870
Look up. Hey, do you wanna
make the front pages or not?

70
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,837
Kermit, I got a great picture of the chicken.

71
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,750
Oh, good.

72
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,230
<i>There'll be mystery and catastrophe</i>

73
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,756
<i>But it's all in fun</i>
<i>You paid the money. Wait and see</i>

74
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,435
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>Is there any way to stop it?</i>

75
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,069
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

76
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,993
- <i>Everybody and</i>
- <i>Oh...</i>

77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,870
<i>Me</i>

78
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,952
How could you miss a story like that?

79
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,997
It was right under your noses,
practically bit you on the seat of the pants.

80
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,399
There's just no excuse.

81
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,552
I guess this would be the wrong time
to ask for a raise?

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,673
Raise? A raise?

83
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,995
I'll give you a raise!

84
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,759
Did you read these headlines? Huh?

85
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,628
"Jewel heist on Main Street."
And it's nice bold print, isn't it?

86
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,711
- Yes, it's very easy to read.
- Mm.

87
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,556
- Shut up now.
- Sorry.

88
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,791
"Lady Holiday's Jewels Stolen",
that's what it says in the <i>Times.</i>

89
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,000
And here's the <i>Herald.</i>
"Fashion Queen of London Robbed."

90
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,038
And last but not least...

91
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,514
...here's our cute little banner story.

92
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,512
"Identical Twins Join the <i>Chronicle</i> Staff."

93
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,068
Now, I ask you,
what paper would you buy?

94
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,473
- I read the one that has "Dear Abby".
- Bah!

95
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,957
Gee, Mr Tarkanian. We thought identical
twins working on a newspaper

96
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,429
- would make an interesting story.
- Yeah.

97
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,913
Well, it doesn't. Especially since
you two guys don't look anything alike.

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,878
Well, that's cos Fozzie's not wearing
his hat. Fozzie, put your hat back on.

99
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,032
Oh. Yes, sir. See?

100
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,790
Oh, yeah.

101
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,509
I can see it now. But that's still
no excuse for blowing a story.

102
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,434
- We'll do better next time.
- Next time? Next time?

103
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,750
What makes you think
there's gonna be a next time?

104
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,035
Well, if there isn't
it's gonna be a real short movie.

105
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,712
Look, the only reason I hired you two jerks

106
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,633
was because your old man
was a friend of mine.

107
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,031
Dad spoke well of you too.

108
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,272
Well, I'm as sentimental as the next guy.
That's why I don't want him to hear this.

109
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,635
You're fired.

110
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,315
- Take that thing down off the ceiling.
- Yeah, but, Mr Tarkanian...

111
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,039
- Gonzo.
- Check. Whoo-wee!

112
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,519
Won't you listen to reason, sir?

113
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,672
I'm not listening to anything
and I'm not giving you your job back.

114
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,479
I don't want you to give us anything.
We just want to go to England

115
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,790
and talk to Lady Holiday -
the woman who was robbed?

116
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,916
And we'll catch those jewel thieves for you.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,309
You see, all you have to do
is pay our way to London.

118
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,230
Oh!

119
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,073
Is that all I have to do?

120
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,196
Well, we could use
some new luggage for the trip.

121
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,918
Luggage?

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,549
- Now look, beat it. I got a deadline to meet.
- But how are we gonna get to London?

123
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,997
I'll tell you what, Fozzie, since you're such
an investigative reporter, you figure it out.

124
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,198
- I'm Fozzie.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. The hat.

125
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,352
Stop the presses!

126
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,877
Why? What happened?

127
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,474
I don't know.
I've always wanted to say that.

128
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,790
Look, you guys...

129
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,797
Oh, boy.
It must be 50 below in here.

130
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,836
You're lucky, you have fur.

131
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:48,597
No, no, no. You're the one with the fur.
Turn on your light and see for yourself.

132
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,272
Oh, yeah!

133
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,396
I keep mixing us up.

134
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,557
I think I'll read for a while.

135
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,398
- I wish I had a book.
- Hey, Kermit?

136
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,358
Can you reach the hostess call button?
I'm hungry.

137
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,034
They don't serve food in ninth class.

138
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,351
What?
$12 and you don't even get a meal?

139
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,999
Hey, could you guys keep it down?
I'm trying to watch the movie.

140
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,077
- Hey, somebody's coming.
- Maybe they're bringing hamburgers.

141
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,550
- All out for England!
- Oh, great, the plane is landing.

142
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,838
- The plane? Nah, the plane lands in Italy.
- Huh?

143
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,388
- You land in England.
- Whoa!

144
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,635
Kermmmmiiitt!

145
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,711
What's happening?

146
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,519
Whoopee!

147
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,478
Geronimo!

148
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,828
Glug!

149
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,956
For once the forecast was right.

150
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,713
It said it was going to rain cats and dogs.

151
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,031
- No, no. We're bears and frogs.
- And Gonzos.

152
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,715
Whatever you are, whoever you are,
welcome to Great Britain.

153
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,995
Great Britain?
We're actually in Great Britain!

154
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,231
Oh, no, we'll never get to England now.

155
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,039
You are in England, my furry friend.

156
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,635
This 'sceptred isle.
This jewel of the North Atlantic.

157
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,517
Oh, good. Well, we're going to London

158
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,273
and we were wondering
if you could recommend a nice hotel.

159
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,033
- Actually, a cheap hotel.
- How cheap?

160
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,588
- Free.
- That narrows the field a bit. Let's see.

161
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,797
"Places where you can park
your carcasses."

162
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,155
Bus terminals. River banks.

163
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,869
- The Happiness Hotel.
- Happiness Hotel? That sounds great.

164
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,191
What's wrong with bus terminals?

165
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,475
Well, thanks a lot for your help, sir.

166
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,673
Hey, guys, this is London.

167
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,479
Yeah, London!
We made it! Oh, boy!

168
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,357
- Is that the Eiffel Tower?
- Yeah!

169
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,431
- No.
- No, no.

170
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,912
- Hey, Kermit?
- Yeah?

171
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,958
- Are bears allowed in those fountains?
- What?

172
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,758
Are bears allowed in those fountains?

173
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,751
- No, I don't think so.
- I need a bath.

174
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,959
This is terrific.
Wow, look at the scenery.

175
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,669
It's very realistic.
Hey, what's the name of this river?

176
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,672
- I don't know.
- I think it's the English River.

177
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,034
Oh.

178
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,351
I'll take a picture of it.
Say cheese!

179
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,799
Did I get my elbow in the shot?

180
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,156
- Don't worry. It adds human interest.
- But I'm a bear.

181
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,073
- Anyone for the Happiness Hotel?
- Huh?

182
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,116
- Oh, Happiness Hotel!
- That's us!

183
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,634
- Yes, we want the Happiness Hotel.
- Yeah.

184
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,598
Argh!

185
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,674
Wow.

186
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,274
Boy, another crash landing.
That was terrible.

187
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,590
Well, we'll just have to do it again.

188
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,071
Oh, look. The Happiness Hotel.
What do you think, guys?

189
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,115
Wow.

190
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,591
If that's the Happiness Hotel
I'd hate to see what the sad one looks like.

191
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,119
- Excuse me?
- What?

192
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,509
We'd like a room.

193
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,511
Really?

194
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,239
Yeah, we'd like to check in.

195
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,551
Somebody's checking in!

196
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,029
Somebody's checking in?

197
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,039
<i>Oh. There's no fire in the fireplace</i>
<i>There's no carpet on the floor</i>

198
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,556
<i>Don't try to order dinner</i>
<i>There's no kitchen any more</i>

199
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,837
<i>But if the road's been kinda bumpy</i>
<i>and you need to rest a spell</i>

200
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,151
<i>Well. Welcome home</i>
<i>to the Happiness Hotel</i>

201
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,750
- Hey, how are you guys fixing to pay?
- What are our choices?

202
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,832
A, credit card. B, cash.

203
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,480
C, sneak out in the middle of the night.

204
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,638
We'll take C.

205
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,359
Very popular choice.

206
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,749
<i>If you got luggage keep it handy</i>
<i>but you're running out of luck</i>

207
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,389
<i>Cos the bellhops ain't too organised</i>
<i>and the elevator's stuck</i>

208
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,438
<i>Still if you don't mind friendly animals</i>
<i>and can learn to stand the smell</i>

209
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,149
<i>Well. Welcome home</i>
<i>to the Happiness Hotel</i>

210
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,674
You know, I may be mistaken,
but the bellhops look like rats.

211
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,035
You should see the chambermaids.

212
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,318
- <i>Welcome home</i>
- <i>Welcome home</i>

213
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,391
- <i>Welcome home</i>
- <i>Welcome home</i>

214
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,711
<i>No matter where you wander</i>
<i>you will never do as well</i>

215
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,395
<i>OK. The lobby's looking shabby</i>
<i>and it's got the wrong address</i>

216
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,836
<i>And the whole dang thing has</i>
<i>been condemned by American Express</i>

217
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,117
<i>Still the management is cheerful</i>
<i>though the whole joint's gone to hell</i>

218
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,591
<i>Well. Welcome home</i>
<i>to the Happiness Hotel</i>

219
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,834
- You guys live here?
- Yeah, but only between gigs.

220
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,310
So that means we've been here this time,
what, five years?

221
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,552
Yeah, but, like, OK, you know, our agent,
you know, like, he says, I mean, like,

222
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,155
things are really going to break
as soon as we get our new glossies.

223
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,796
Argh!

224
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,916
What's wrong with the drummer?
He looks a little crazed.

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,675
Aw, he's just upset about missing the
Rembrandt exhibit at the National Gallery.

226
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,228
Renoir!

227
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,398
- <i>Oh. There are bugs</i>
- <i>There are bugs</i>

228
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,436
- <i>And there are lice</i>
- <i>There are lice</i>

229
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,956
Sure, we have our little problems
but you'll never beat the price

230
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,396
- <i>You got every kind of critter</i>
- <i>You got every kind of pest</i>

231
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,995
But we treat 'em all as equals
just like any other guest

232
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,231
Though you're cleaner than the others
still, as far as we can tell

233
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,392
You'll fit right in to the Happiness Hotel

234
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,952
We'll fit right in to the Happiness Hotel

235
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,793
Say cheese!

236
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,994
You are all weirdos.

237
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,875
Ugh.

238
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,116
Oh, that's just fine right there.

239
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,436
Thank you.

240
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,960
Hey, not bad.

241
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,838
Are you sure we can afford this?

242
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,911
Hey, Kermit, I'm getting hungry.

243
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,195
- Call room service.
- There's no phone.

244
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,114
- That's OK. There's no food either.
- Come on, Rizzo.

245
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,873
Look, why don't we forget about food
and get a good night's sleep?

246
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,509
We have to get up early
to interview Lady Holiday.

247
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,832
Boy, I sure could use something
from one or more of the basic food groups.

248
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,995
We'll have breakfast in the morning.
Right now, let's just be thankful we're here.

249
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,953
Say, this is nice.

250
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,395
Can somebody
turn out the light?

251
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,071
Thank you.

252
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,079
This is Lady Holiday.
Milan speaking? Then put him on.

253
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,469
Oh, yes, darling. Yes, I'm fine.

254
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,109
I had quite a scare.
Thank God I wasn't hurt.

255
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,955
Of course my diamonds were valuable.
All my diamonds are valuable.

256
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,349
Now, darling, I want you
to call the United States and tell <i>Vogue</i>

257
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,954
they can't have the photographs
of the spring line until after the show.

258
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,797
I'm not too happy with some of the designs.
Still have to make some changes.

259
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,439
Well, I'm looking at three of the gowns now
and I can see horrendous mistakes.

260
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,875
Of course Paris should be notified.

261
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,236
Carla. The neckline on that gown
is too high, don't you think?

262
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,515
- I rather like the effect.
- Do you like looking like an ostrich?

263
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,716
- Of course not.
- And Marla.

264
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,518
Too many frills and furbelows.

265
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,831
I don't think we should strive
for the fantail pigeon look, do you?

266
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,469
And you, Darla. That outfit's the pits.

267
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,551
Loose where it should be tight
and tight where it should be loose,

268
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,834
like the folds on a turkey's neck.

269
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,516
Why would I design
such atrocious-looking clothes? Oh!

270
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,876
- I must be getting senile.
- <i>Yes. Lady Holiday?</i>

271
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,838
We have to make drastic changes
in the new line before the show tomorrow.

272
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,913
All my girls are going around
looking like barnyard animals.

273
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,760
Good heavens. Who are you?

274
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,836
My name is Miss Piggy and
I would like to be a high-fashion model.

275
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,991
Doesn't surprise me.
Seems to be the way we're heading.

276
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,914
I've always dreamed
of being a Holiday model.

277
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,913
I have brought my <i>je ne sais quoi</i> and
my portfolio all the way here to London

278
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,198
to see you, the one and only Lady Holiday.

279
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,954
- May I come in?
- Absolutely not.

280
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,991
- May I show you my portfolio?
- No.

281
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,436
Good. Here. You may open it.

282
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,517
Ah.

283
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,797
This is me reeking grandeur.

284
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,553
Being aloof.

285
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,200
Being demure. Ah.

286
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,952
Daring.

287
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,635
- Interesting range of emotions.
- You think so?

288
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,157
Well, as you can see from
this small sampling, modelling is my life.

289
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,913
It is my destiny. I shall accept nothing less.

290
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,470
I can offer you a job as a receptionist.

291
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,348
I'll take it! I'll take it!
Oh, thank you, thank you! Thank you!

292
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,078
Oh! Oh! Oh!

293
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,188
You won't be sorry, I promise. I can type,
I can take shorthand, I can make coffee.

294
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,238
- I can do it all.
- Sit.

295
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,915
- I can sit. I'm very good at sitting.
- Are you quite under control?

296
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,355
Mm, mm, mm, mm!

297
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,594
Now, I'll be lunching with my brother Nicky.

298
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,036
He's second in command here
and he's an irresponsible parasite.

299
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,792
But I had to bring him into the business

300
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,836
because he squandered
his half of the inheritance

301
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,390
and he has categorically no prospects.
Not that he's grateful.

302
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,438
He still gambles and incurs bad debts,
uses my charge accounts,

303
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,195
eats my food and borrows my cars
without asking permission.

304
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,794
And certainly he's not to be trusted.

305
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,111
I wouldn't even put it past him to try to steal
my most valuable and largest jewel,

306
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,350
the fabulous Baseball Diamond.

307
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,672
And I don't know why his bow ties
are always crooked.

308
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,912
- Still, in all, he is my brother.
- Why are you telling me all this?

309
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,956
It's plot exposition. It has to go somewhere.

310
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,077
Anyway, I want you
to answer the telephone while I'm gone

311
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,276
and straighten up the office.

312
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,316
Consider it done.

313
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,959
Everything's under control. Not to sweat.

314
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,878
Carry on. I'll be back in an hour.

315
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,230
Whee!

316
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,436
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

317
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,195
Oh, I am going to be a famous model.
Oh, I'm so happy for me.

318
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,159
Miss Piggy, you are on your way.

319
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,959
Where does Lady Holiday get off
calling me an ostrich?

320
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,396
We'll get even with Lady Holiday tonight
when we steal her necklace.

321
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,995
What are you going to wear
for the robbery?

322
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,034
Hi.

323
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,908
- Hi. Hello.
- Hubba hubba!

324
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,355
Excuse me, where's Lady Holiday's office?

325
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,795
- Round the corner, to the left.
- Oh. Thank you.

326
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,474
- Did you just give directions to a frog?
- I guess I did.

327
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,120
Smile.

328
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,270
Is that a new photographer?

329
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,112
Urgh!

330
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,836
- I think I'm stuck.
- Gonzo? Gonzo!

331
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,876
Gonzo. Gonzo.

332
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,951
Pull.

333
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,199
- Gonzo, are you OK?
- Oh, sure. It was just my nose.

334
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,874
Hey, you guys stay here.
I'll find Lady Holiday.

335
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,551
Yes, sir.

336
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,395
Hey, Fozzie. Come on,
get your nose in here. It's really fun.

337
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,432
Mr Holiday? Did you order
a gross of flowered socks?

338
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,196
Oh! What an honour.
You're all so wonderful.

339
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,909
Thank you for choosing <i>moi</i>
as model of the year.

340
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,039
Oh! I never dreamed
when I first began in this business

341
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,680
that I would reach such lofty heights.

342
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,955
Thank you! Thank you!

343
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,315
Excuse me.

344
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,840
So, what do you think
about the drapes, hm?

345
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,559
Personally, I'd rather see shutters. Yes.

346
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,349
And on this wall here...

347
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,030
Lady Holiday?

348
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,916
Lady Holiday?

349
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,431
Gee, are you OK?

350
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,830
I don't think I'll ever be the same.

351
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,354
- Pardon?
- Oh.

352
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,874
I mean, I don't usually fall like that.

353
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,475
I thought it was a very nice fall.
It was quite graceful, actually.

354
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,950
Oh, thank you, whoever you are.

355
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,031
My name is Kermit the Frog

356
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,238
and I've come all the way from America
to interview you for <i>The Daily Chronicle.</i>

357
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,470
Me? Why me?

358
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,551
Because you're Lady Holiday.

359
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,513
Oh. Oh.

360
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,319
Yeah, right. Reason enough.

361
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,152
Um...

362
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,798
You wanna help me
out of this wastebasket?

363
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,676
Oh.

364
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,432
- Oh, yeah.
- Now just pull.

365
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,273
OK.

366
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,635
- Harder.
- OK.

367
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,194
So... listen. Can I ask you
a couple of questions now?

368
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,113
No, no. Um... Not here.

369
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,078
So busy. So much to do.

370
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,913
Well, perhaps we could
have dinner tonight?

371
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,117
Yes. Fine. Swell. See you then.

372
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,873
I'll pick you up at your house.
It must be beautiful.

373
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,916
- I'm sure it is.
- Hm?

374
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,197
- I mean, sure it is!
- Yeah.

375
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,556
So, where do you live?

376
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,437
Um...

377
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,715
Guess!

378
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,030
Probably some highbrow street
somewhere.

379
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,159
Highbrow Street, absolutely right.
Highbrow Street.

380
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,950
How did you guess? Are you psychic?
But now, guess what number.

381
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,237
I don't know. Number 17?

382
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,515
Yes, all right. 17 Highbrow Street.

383
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,319
OK. I'll pick you up at, shall we say...

384
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,436
- eight o'clock?
- 5:30?

385
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,351
- 4:15?
- 9:20?

386
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,749
- Seven o'clock.
- OK. That was easy.

387
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,592
- Yes, easy.
- OK, well I'll see you later.

388
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,114
Yes. Eight o'clock.

389
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,475
- Seven.
- Seven, seven.

390
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,631
Well, um...

391
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,678
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

392
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,228
Adios, <i>mon chéri.</i>

393
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,272
Much obliged.

394
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,557
So, Kermit, tell me, what about
Lady Holiday? I mean, is she pretty?

395
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,191
Oh, yeah. Not at all what I expected.
Nice eyes, sturdy legs.

396
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,193
And it might have been my imagination,
but I think she found me attractive.

397
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,759
Oh. Taxi!

398
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,230
Well, of course she found you attractive.
It runs in the family.

399
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,517
Taxi! Taxi!

400
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,310
- I don't know why the cabs won't stop.
- Just leave it to me.

401
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,789
Taxiiii!

402
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,790
That's very effective.

403
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,075
Yeah, it's great when it works.

404
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,392
- Did you want me to stop or what?
- Thank you very much, sir.

405
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,710
Oh, you can call me Beauregard.

406
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,598
- Where are you guys going?
- The Happiness Hotel.

407
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,070
Oh, good, that's where I'm going.
How do you get there?

408
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,596
- Haven't you ever been there?
- Of course. I live there.

409
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,671
I just don't know how to get there.

410
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,877
- It's straight down this street.
- OK.

411
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,113
- OK. Good. Now just keep going straight.
- Will do.

412
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,279
It takes a while to get to know the town.

413
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,557
- How long have you lived in London?
- All my life.

414
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,392
How come you don't have
an English accent?

415
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,119
Hey, I'm lucky to have a driver's license.

416
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,432
- Hey, it's just up ahead there on the right.
- What is?

417
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,512
- The Happiness Hotel.
- Oh, yeah.

418
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,591
What's your room number?

419
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,830
Wh? I don't know.
We're on the second floor.

420
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,152
Oh, I'm sorry. I can only take you
as far as the lobby.

421
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,160
Whee!

422
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,680
You can never find a cab
when you need one.

423
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,638
Whoo-whee!

424
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,518
- Can we do that again?
- Well, thank you very much, Beauregard.

425
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,750
You're welcome.
Hey, how do I get out of here?

426
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,877
I suggest you make a U-turn.

427
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,520
Right.

428
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,312
- He's headed for the kitchen!
- Oh, no!

429
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,756
Well, looks like steering wheel soufflé
for dinner.

430
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,478
Again?

431
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,551
If you'll excuse me, I'm going out to dinner.

432
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,313
That's right. Kermit's got a date
with Lady Holiday.

433
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,029
- You don't have to tell everybody.
- Oh. Right.

434
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,078
Pops, don't tell anybody.
Kermit's got a date with Lady Holiday.

435
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,549
Kermit's got a date
with Lady Holiday?

436
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,552
Oh, wow. Wait till I tell
the guys in the band.

437
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,598
- Tell us what?
- Yeah, what's going down?

438
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,949
Kermit and Lady Holiday? All right!

439
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,276
Fozzie, this is all very embarrassing.

440
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,238
Kermit, don't worry.
It won't go outside this room.

441
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,992
Here is a Muppet news flash.
Kermit the Frog to date Lady Holiday.

442
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,674
Details at 11.

443
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,870
Smile.

444
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,519
Local poultry.

445
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,718
Boy, it's a good thing you didn't
tell everybody where Lady Holiday lives

446
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,870
otherwise they'd all
be camped on her doorstep.

447
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,191
That is just for you and me to know,
brother.

448
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,876
We are going to have ourselves
a time tonight. Wacka wacka.

449
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,952
- "We"? What do you mean "we"?
- The two of us. You missed a spot.

450
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,270
Anyway. When we get there tonight,
just act naturally.

451
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,920
No, no. Wait a second, wait a second.
It's when <i>I get there.

452
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,279
This is my date with Lady Holiday.
I'm going alone. So it's "me" not "we".

453
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,634
Oh.

454
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,917
I see. Fine.

455
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,355
Boy, I wish I had whiskers.

456
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,476
Of course, then I'd have to use a blade.

457
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,154
Kermit? Turn around.

458
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,869
Are you really
going to go without me tonight?

459
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,033
Well, Fozzie, I figure
this is something that I have to do alone.

460
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,998
No problem.

461
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,992
- Oh good. Just hand me my cuff links.
- Yes, sir.

462
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,355
<i>And straighten my tie</i>

463
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,115
<i>Just drench me in rich cologne</i>
<i>and don't ask me why</i>

464
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,076
<i>Go on and pluck me a boutonniere</i>

465
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,799
<i>You're moving up and walking on air</i>

466
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,759
<i>Steppin' out with a star and feeling high</i>

467
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,075
<i>Come polish my wing tips</i>

468
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,754
<i>And call for the car</i>

469
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,596
<i>I'll sweep her right off her feet</i>
<i>wherever we are</i>

470
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,110
<i>A satin collar and velvet vest</i>

471
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,430
<i>I never settle for second best</i>

472
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,149
<i>Steppin' out with a star</i>
<i>Sad times. Bye-bye</i>

473
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,674
<i>Have I got style?</i>

474
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,149
<i>Have I got taste?</i>

475
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:00,355
<i>On someone else. I swear.</i>
<i>This savoir-faire would be such a waste</i>

476
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,108
- <i>Come toss me my top hat</i>
- Yes, sir!

477
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,509
<i>I'm ready to fly</i>

478
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,957
<i>Busting into the upper crust</i>
<i>as easy as pie</i>

479
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,669
<i>Just watch my dreams come true</i>

480
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,035
<i>This is something I was born to do</i>

481
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,033
<i>Steppin' out with a star</i>
<i>That star is you</i>

482
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,629
- <i>Have you got class?</i>
- <i>Have I got class?</i>

483
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,995
- <i>Have you got chic?</i>
- <i>Have I got chic?</i>

484
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,756
<i>To think that you and me</i>
<i>were nobody. Why. Only last week</i>

485
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,592
Hey, guys!

486
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,752
<i>I'm ready to flyyyyyy</i>

487
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,671
- Kermit!
- At least I can try.

488
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,115
<i>Just watch my dreams come true</i>

489
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,430
<i>This is something I was born to do</i>

490
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,954
<i>Steppin' out with a star</i>
<i>Bye. Bad times</i>

491
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,349
<i>Steppin' out with a star</i>
<i>Hey. Good times</i>

492
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,228
<i>Steppin' out with a star and feeling high</i>

493
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,837
Yeah!

494
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,195
Well, how do I look?

495
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,355
Which one are you?

496
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,635
- I'm the one on the right.
- Oh.

497
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,508
Well, y... you look like you're gonna
have a terrific time.

498
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,114
Without me.

499
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,509
- Fozzie?
- What?

500
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,795
You can come.

501
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,632
- You mean it?
- Mm-hm.

502
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,075
Oh, boy!

503
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,993
Great news, gang. We can go!

504
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,194
Awfully disappointing weather today.

505
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,271
Hm?

506
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,079
The weather. Awfully disappointing today.

507
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,551
Is it, is it? Yes. Mm, yes, yes.
I know what you mean.

508
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,873
It was rather disappointing yesterday.

509
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,349
And the day before.

510
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,233
What is it, Neville?

511
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,190
Um...

512
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,633
Pig... um... climbing up
the outside of the house, dear.

513
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,755
Oh.

514
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,551
Next time they want stunts
they get a double.

515
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,235
The day before that
was awfully disappointing too.

516
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,958
Mm.

517
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,953
And of course the weekend was
perfectly frightful. Never stopped raining.

518
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,440
- Neville?
- Hm?

519
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,114
- Am I boring you?
- What, dear?

520
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,830
- I said, am I boring you?
- Boring me?

521
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,152
That's a good one.
I'm having the time of my life, dear.

522
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,030
Neville, did you say... a <i>pig</i>
was climbing up the outside of the house?

523
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,433
- Yes. Yes. Yes, I believe I did, yes.
- I thought so.

524
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,318
You'd have to look a long way
to find a chap

525
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,439
who was more... stimulated than I am, yes.

526
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,193
Oh, dear me, no, no, no.

527
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,156
The last time I was bored -
and never by you, my little armada...

528
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,435
- What was that?
- Just making a point, dear.

529
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,829
I mean, if I was bored I'd go out
and buy something, wouldn't I?

530
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,595
Like cheese or quails' eggs.

531
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,353
- Something like that.
- Yes, I suppose you would.

532
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,673
Yes, of course I would, dear. That's
the sort of spur-of-the-moment fellow I am.

533
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,796
What?

534
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,789
- What, dear?
- What would you buy if you were bored?

535
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,273
Ah! Uh...

536
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,599
A jar of calf's-foot jelly?

537
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,315
I'd like to come with you
and help you pick one out.

538
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,472
Oh, that isn't necessary, Dorcas.
There's no need for you to leave the house.

539
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,996
I wouldn't mind.
Haven't been outside for 12 years.

540
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,514
Well, the weather's
been most disappointing.

541
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,353
Still, there's no reason
for me to stay here all the time.

542
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,590
The children are gone, the pets are dead,

543
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,638
the butler's been discharged,
no one ever visits us.

544
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,675
That was the doorbell, Neville.

545
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,239
So it was.

546
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,790
- And the butler's dead?
- No, no, no.

547
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,634
The pets are dead.
The butler's been discharged.

548
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,711
Ah.

549
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,757
- I think one of us should answer it, Neville.
- Oh, do you?

550
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,834
Or we could both answer it.

551
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,912
Come, dear, I hardly think it's necessary
for both of us to...

552
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,275
I'll answer it!

553
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,596
I thought you said the pets were dead.

554
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,789
- Hello.
- Uh...

555
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,916
This is for you.

556
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,549
Oh, thank you. Shall we go?

557
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,155
You know, I've never been inside
a real ritzy English house before.

558
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,788
- Aren't you hungry?
- Sure, but we've got a few minutes.

559
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,519
OK. Let's take a few minutes.

560
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,875
- Say, nice place you got here.
- Yes. I practically stole it.

561
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,354
Let me show you around.

562
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,433
- Who was that guy back there?
- Oh. Just some sort of servant.

563
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,511
This, of course, is the drawing room.

564
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,433
Did you decorate this place yourself?

565
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,916
I'll just close the door.
It's very draughty.

566
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,150
There's a chair and some walls.

567
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,754
- A whirlwind tour, huh?
- Yes.

568
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,230
This is the bedroom and, uh... bath.

569
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,350
We have hot and cold running water.

570
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,955
There's probably a bathtub and everything.

571
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,913
Oh, here. I want to show you something.
This is the closet.

572
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,155
Nice. Dark but nice.

573
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,830
Ah. Sorry.

574
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,511
Don't think me rude, but is there,
in fact, anything I can do for you at all?

575
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,111
Um...

576
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,158
Yes. Yes, yes.

577
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,834
You may suggest a nice restaurant.

578
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,309
Ah. Well, there's the Dubonnet Club.

579
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,278
Actually that's not so much a restaurant,
more a supper club.

580
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,395
Ah.

581
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,314
Thank you, Jeeves. No time for cocktails.

582
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,709
Evening.

583
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,755
Why are you staring into the closet,
Neville?

584
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,798
You recall that pig I mentioned?

585
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,313
The one that was climbing
up the side of the house?

586
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,119
- That's the chap. That's the chap.
- Yes, I seem to recall that.

587
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,988
Well, he was in there just now,
along with a... a lizard.

588
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,275
I see. And what did they want?

589
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,318
Name of a good restaurant.
I told them the Dubonnet Club.

590
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,231
That's more of a supper club
than a restaurant.

591
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,992
Yes, well, I tried to tell them that.

592
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,595
- Don't blame yourself.
- No.

593
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,954
No.

594
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,119
Hey! There they are!

595
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,475
Kermit and his new flame.

596
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,313
- Hubba hubba.
- Ding ding!

597
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,558
You'll have to jump in the front seat.
The back seat's been quarantined.

598
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,838
Let's hit the road.
How about a little travelling music?

599
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,913
- For sure. A love song.
- Love song, love song.

600
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,595
Hit it!

601
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,752
<i>Give me my good friends</i>
<i>and play me my music</i>

602
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,070
<i>Yeah. Give me my night life</i>

603
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,359
<i>Talk me that guitar</i>
<i>and roll me that boogie</i>

604
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,829
<i>Yeah. Give me my night life</i>

605
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,673
- Are these your friends?
- Just the ones on the fenders.

606
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,552
<i>Sing me the good times</i>
<i>cos I need the feeling</i>

607
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,029
<i>Yeah. Give me that night life</i>

608
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,437
<i>Give me my night life</i>

609
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,590
<i>Whoo. Yeah</i>

610
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,749
<i>Give me my night life</i>

611
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,993
- They don't have to play this loud.
- That's OK. They don't mind.

612
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,997
<i>Sing me the good times</i>
<i>cos I need the feeling</i>

613
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,389
<i>Give me my night life</i>

614
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,469
<i>Give me my night life</i>

615
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,269
Boy, a classy place like this you'd think
they'd have pretzels on the table.

616
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,629
Well, what a delightful menu.

617
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,757
- What?
- Nothing. It's just sort of amusing

618
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,356
that the roast beef is the same price
as an Oldsmobile.

619
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,431
You come here often, Lady Holiday?

620
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,432
Oh, only on special <i>occasions.</i>

621
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,239
And this is very special, Kermie.

622
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,709
Waiter! Champagne, caviar.

623
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,475
Hey, hey, Kermit.
How are we gonna pay for this?

624
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,317
- You got about 1600 bucks on you?
- Hey, relax, Kermit. I'll take care of it.

625
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,912
Say cheese!

626
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,150
There you go, folks. Souvenir photograph.

627
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,232
Just gimme your name and address
and ten bucks.

628
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,434
Good evening, Lady Holiday.
Such a pleasure to see you.

629
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,354
- Thank you, Stanley.
- Why, what a lovely diamond necklace.

630
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,076
It is rather breathtaking, isn't it?

631
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,392
I thought it a little outré, but my brother
Nicky insisted that I wear it.

632
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,355
Your table, Lady Holiday.

633
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,556
Thank you, Stanley.
Give Stanley a tip, Nicky.

634
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,598
- For complimenting you on your necklace?
- No, because it is customary.

635
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,274
- I don't have any change.
- Then give him something bigger.

636
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,429
Bigger?

637
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,956
- I left my wallet at home.
- You left your wallet in college.

638
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,315
How about you, folks?
Souvenir photograph?

639
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,355
No thanks. No picture.

640
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,352
Aw, come on. It'll be a great memento
for you and your wife.

641
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,271
My wife isn't feeling very well.

642
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,794
That's too bad.
Maybe she should be at home.

643
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,235
My wife is at home.

644
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,118
Yes. Next table!

645
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,992
That caviar was yummy. Mwah!

646
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,755
Love those fish eggs!

647
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,071
- Uh, Lady Holiday?
- Oh. Yes?

648
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,276
Can we talk about the jewel robbery now?

649
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,193
Oh, Kermit. Let us not talk business.

650
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,910
Music is in the air, the night is young,
and I'm so beautiful.

651
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,674
- What jewel robbery?
- Your jewels. The ones that were stolen.

652
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,514
You know, you have lovely eyes.

653
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,749
You know, if you put enough sugar
in this stuff it tastes just like ginger ale.

654
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,557
Catch you later, Stanley.
Aren't you happy we're here?

655
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,712
I have grave doubts
about wearing these jewels.

656
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,916
I feel as if thieves
were breathing down my neck.

657
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,718
Thieves aren't breathing down your neck.

658
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,233
- I want to put them in a safe.
- No.

659
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,514
- Yes.
- Yes, I meant yes.

660
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,670
Why would I say no when I meant yes?

661
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,352
- Go and see Stanley.
- Go and see Stanley?

662
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,036
- Go and see Stanley immediately.
- All right. If that's what you want.

663
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,874
- And don't forget to tip him.
- Tip. Tip.

664
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,310
<i>The first time you see her</i>

665
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,790
<i>No bolt from the blue</i>

666
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,236
<i>Just something so quiet</i>

667
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,869
<i>Yet waiting for you</i>

668
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,396
<i>With no one to tell you</i>

669
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,631
<i>That you've got to go</i>

670
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,352
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

671
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,470
<i>The first time you see her</i>

672
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,950
<i>No magical change</i>

673
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,396
<i>No angels appearing</i>

674
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,439
<i>No dreams to arrange</i>

675
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,512
<i>Just warmer and colder</i>

676
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,036
<i>Than springtime or snow</i>

677
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,671
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

678
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,949
<i>And so you fall</i>

679
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,316
<i>And how complete it is</i>

680
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,678
<i>And for each moment that it lasts</i>

681
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,150
<i>How sweet it is</i>

682
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,676
<i>The first time together</i>

683
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,196
<i>How simple. How rare</i>

684
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,794
<i>And just when you thought</i>

685
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,317
<i>You'd forgot how to care</i>

686
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,790
<i>And though you feel much more</i>

687
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,316
<i>Than you dare to show</i>

688
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,599
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

689
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,950
Wow. She's fantastic.

690
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,318
<i>The first time you see her</i>

691
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,517
<i>No magical change</i>

692
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,831
<i>No angels appearing</i>

693
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,117
<i>No dreams to arrange</i>

694
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,237
<i>Just warmer and colder</i>

695
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,357
<i>Than springtime or snow</i>

696
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,479
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

697
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,028
What a great number!

698
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,719
Nicky?

699
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,916
That's my new receptionist
dancing out there.

700
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,468
- Which one?
- The pig.

701
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,156
- She's sensational.
- 45 words a minute. About average.

702
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,110
<i>And just when you thought</i>

703
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,957
- <i>You'd forgot how to care</i>
- <i>For the first time</i>

704
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,600
<i>For the first time</i>

705
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,399
A-ha!

706
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,912
<i>The first time it happens</i>

707
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,912
<i>The moment it happens</i>

708
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,037
<i>Then suddenly there's a whole new world</i>

709
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,714
<i>The first time it happens</i>

710
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,952
<i>The first time it happens</i>

711
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,029
<i>The first time it happens</i>

712
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,793
<i>You know</i>

713
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,150
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

714
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,755
Aieee!

715
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,035
Lady Holiday! What's happened?

716
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,874
- Was it you that screamed, "Aieee!"?
- She screamed right into my ear.

717
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,190
Of course I screamed.
Somebody's just stolen my necklace.

718
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,714
I told you this would happen.
That necklace was worth a fortune.

719
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,438
- Do something.
- What do you want me to do?

720
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,239
I spilled ketchup all over my cummerbund.

721
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,390
For God's sake. Straighten that tie.

722
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,234
It's Lady Holiday, her necklace,
it's been stolen.

723
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,788
"Lady Holiday"? But I thought...

724
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,758
Kermit. I think I've got a picture of the thief.

725
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,798
- Oh, great.
- Yeah!

726
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,871
But...

727
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,595
This is great, Gonzo. You popped the flash
just before the soup landed on his tie.

728
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,875
Yeah, well, photography's an art.

729
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,872
You gotta have the right film,
you gotta have the right exposure,

730
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,758
and you gotta scream
just before they get the food to their mouth.

731
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,879
What's going on in there? Lot
of folks out here want to use the rest room.

732
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,713
Well, we're developing these pictures.
We'll be out as soon as we finish.

733
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,075
- We're trying to catch a jewel thief.
- A jewel thief.

734
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,832
Well, catch him in another room.

735
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,276
People are dancing up and down
on one leg out here.

736
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,750
Hurry, Gonzo. There's gotta be a picture of
somebody taking Lady Holiday's necklace.

737
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,719
Well, I don't know.
I still think that pig took it.

738
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,519
- She wouldn't steal.
- Why not? She lied.

739
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,319
That's two different things. Besides,
she couldn't have stolen the necklace

740
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,516
because she was dancing.

741
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,390
That's right. There's that old adage: You
can't dance and steal at the same time.

742
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,313
No, that's "You can't walk
and chew gum at the same time."

743
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,154
Oh, no. I think it's "You can't pat your head
and rub your stomach at the same time."

744
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,037
What's the difference?
She didn't steal the necklace.

745
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,473
- I bet you I can do it.
- Do what?

746
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,869
Pat my head and rub my stomach
at the same time.

747
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,111
Big deal, anybody can do that.

748
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,389
Would you guys cut it out?
We're wasting time.

749
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,798
- Hey, here it is.
- What? What? What? What?

750
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,235
Look at that.
It's that guy sitting next to Lady Holiday

751
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,548
and those girls standing in the back.

752
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,393
It's probably the same gang
that pulled that first job.

753
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,117
Wow!

754
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,954
Yes, and we got them
with their hands in the cookie jar.

755
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,716
- What's going on?
- What is this, anyway?

756
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,030
Aw.

757
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,192
The cookie jar just busted.

758
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,870
- Look, Dad. There's a bear.
- No, Christine, that's a frog.

759
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,030
Bears wear hats.

760
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,354
How you doing, young fella?

761
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,510
OK, I guess.

762
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,989
Penny for your thoughts.

763
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,230
Well, it's a long story.

764
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,675
- But a familiar one, I bet.
- Mm.

765
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,513
Older than the hills.

766
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,559
I've been there, my friend.
I've been there and back.

767
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,837
You know, I see the way you're sitting here

768
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,992
and I see the way you've got your hand
around that little shoe, and that's all I need.

769
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,197
- I know your whole story.
- You do?

770
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,956
Absolutely.
I know exactly what happened to you.

771
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,508
- What?
- Well, I tell you, friend.

772
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,195
What happened was
you and your brother-in-law Bernie,

773
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,989
you cashed in your stock certificates
and your insurance policy

774
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,789
and you went out and bought
a dry-cleaning establishment.

775
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,919
Now another place opens up
down the street and it's charging less.

776
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,719
And they're getting the stuff out faster
because they got more help.

777
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,872
It's not your fault. Right?

778
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,315
All right. So Bernie comes to you, he says:

779
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,472
"I want you to buy me out."
He says he's fed up.

780
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,597
Well, your kids are growing up,
you never see 'em

781
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,274
and all of a sudden,
they're turning into juvenile delinquents

782
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,475
and your wife is saying to you:

783
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,189
"Listen, you care more about this
lousy business than you care about me."

784
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,590
And the equipment breaks down
and your sister moves in with you

785
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,353
because that jerk Bernie,
he went and joined the circus.

786
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,715
Well, you had it up to here, right?

787
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,950
You didn't know what to do.

788
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,828
So what did you do?
You did the only thing you could do.

789
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,911
You dumped the business for a song.

790
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,877
- And who did you sell it to?
- Who?

791
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,590
You sold it to that jerk down the street, that
slob that had been burying you for a year.

792
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,910
Then you took whatever money
you had left

793
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,912
and you sunk it
into the glass slipper business.

794
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,231
That's your story, my friend.
Not a happy one, is it?

795
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,671
You know, it's amazing.
You are 100 per cent wrong.

796
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,990
I mean, nothing you've said has been right.

797
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,310
Oh, yeah?

798
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,476
Well, how about this?

799
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,075
I hate to be rude,
but we're trying to do a movie here.

800
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,196
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

801
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,272
Oh, I didn't know that. Gee, I'm sorry.

802
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,749
Listen, one thing, son.

803
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,438
Would you like to buy a watch?

804
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,196
No.

805
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,312
Movie stars.

806
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,712
Get your filthy hands off me!

807
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,797
- I beg your pardon, young lady!
- Just keep your hands to yourself, turkey.

808
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,758
Hey, you.

809
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,072
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the fake Lady Holiday.

810
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,149
Hello.

811
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,510
"Hello"? Last night
you never even said goodbye.

812
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,990
Kermit, that was just silliness.

813
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,992
But you lied to me. You used me.

814
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,997
Oh, Kermit, please,
let me explain. Kermit.

815
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,390
- My name is Miss Piggy. I am a model.
- Yeah.

816
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,677
I only lied because I wanted to be with you.

817
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,718
Yeah, well, I saw the way
you were dancing with that guy last night.

818
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,155
- Oh, Kermit.
- Well, lemme tell you something.

819
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,519
Your dancing partner happens to be
a jewel thief. What do you think of that?

820
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,036
- You're jealous.
- I am not.

821
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,793
You are. You are, you are, you are, you are.

822
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,113
Kermit, I'm sorry.
Please don't go, Kermit. Please.

823
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,476
Please don't go. Kermit, please.
Oh, please, I'm sorry. Please.

824
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,391
- Piggy. Piggy, hold it.
- Please, please, please.

825
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,914
- Piggy. Piggy?
- Please, please, please.

826
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,956
- You're overacting.
- What?

827
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,315
You're overacting. You're hamming it up.

828
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,834
I am not. I am trying to save this movie.

829
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,990
Oh, yeah?
Well, save your performance instead.

830
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,755
- I am playing 800 different emotions.
- Well, try to play one of them right.

831
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,035
Oh, oh! I have a career of my own.

832
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,998
- I know all about your career, Pig.
- I don't need this lousy duck pond here.

833
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,718
- Sure you don't need a lousy duck pond.
- I'll just walk.

834
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,234
- OK, sure. Go ahead, walk. OK?
- Should I walk? Then I'll walk.

835
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,550
Walk! Go ahead and walk.

836
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,190
Oh, Piggy.

837
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,949
- Listen.
- I'm doing my best.

838
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,793
I know you are.

839
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,758
Piggy, I'm sorry.

840
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,435
- We gotta get back to the movie though.
- All right. All right, all right, all right.

841
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,476
Kermit, I'm sorry I left you
last night at the nightclub.

842
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,120
Well, that's OK, Piggy.

843
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,669
- Oh, Kermie.
- Oh, Piggy.

844
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,996
<i>Pretty day. Sunny sky</i>

845
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,675
<i>Lovely pictures dance in your eye</i>

846
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,594
<i>It all seems so right</i>

847
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,797
<i>It all feels so rare</i>

848
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,269
<i>Summer soft sudden breeze</i>

849
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,239
<i>Watch the wind play tag in the trees</i>

850
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,710
<i>The world is so bright</i>

851
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:31,033
<i>So perfectly fair</i>

852
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,510
<i>Lovers sing. Children dance</i>

853
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,070
<i>For a minute. We've got a chance</i>

854
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,069
<i>Why couldn't we fly?</i>

855
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,711
<i>I know we'd get by</i>

856
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,873
<i>Couldn't we fly?</i>

857
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,155
<i>Sunny sky. Pretty day</i>

858
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,028
<i>Just a push and we're on the way</i>

859
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,590
<i>Yes. Couldn't we ride</i>

860
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,673
<i>Side by side?</i>

861
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,631
Whoa!

862
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,189
Whoa!

863
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,197
"Look, Ma, no brains."

864
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,795
Hup. Whoo, Miss Piggy.

865
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,156
Whoa!

866
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,393
Wah! Oof!

867
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,115
<i>Why couldn't we fly?</i>

868
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,876
<i>I know we'd get by</i>

869
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,794
- <i>Sunny sky</i>
- <i>Pretty day</i>

870
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,793
<i>Just a push and we're on the way</i>

871
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,270
<i>Yes. Couldn't we ride</i>

872
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,194
<i>Side by side?</i>

873
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,912
<i>Couldn't we ride?</i>

874
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,158
Gangway! Watch it. Coming through.

875
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,435
She's wonderful. She's so wonderful.

876
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,592
She certainly seems to know
where she's going. It's time.

877
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,948
All right, everybody.
Keep it moving. Don't linger.

878
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,076
We just want to give them a hint,
a taste, a soupçon.

879
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,957
Appetisers not four-course meals.

880
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,474
Marie. I don't think we should chew gum.

881
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,636
Stephanie, those false eyelashes are
coming unglued. Those shoes are scuffed.

882
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,109
- I know where they are. I'll get them...
- Sorry.

883
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,317
Watch it, buster. Oh. Mr Holiday, I'm sorry.

884
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,277
Hello.

885
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,588
- Miss...
- Piggy.

886
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,829
- Miss Piggy?
- Right.

887
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,876
Of course.

888
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,838
Have dinner with me tonight.

889
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,275
Mr Holiday, really, I'm very busy.

890
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,079
- Could we meet just for a moment?
- Underwear, underwear, underwear.

891
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,913
Just one brief moment, Miss Piggy. Miss...

892
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,750
Hm?

893
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,434
Miss Piggy.

894
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,512
You're a very different-looking woman.

895
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,876
I'm so tired of the same type.
Those tall, thin creatures

896
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,191
with the long legs, the aquiline noses,

897
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,750
the teeth like pearls, soft skin.

898
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,355
Yeah, well, I can see why
that might make you sick to your stomach.

899
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,237
- Please now... Please...
- Miss Piggy.

900
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,232
No! Please! No. Please, please.

901
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,516
Don't put a door between us.

902
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,754
- Hi.
- Oh, Kermit.

903
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,355
I was looking for the men's room.

904
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,398
Kermit, I just want you to meet someone.
This is Nicky Holiday.

905
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,438
Mr Holiday,
this is Kermit, my special friend.

906
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,553
Oh.

907
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,194
Nice to meet you.

908
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,669
Well, excuse me.

909
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,598
- Need I say more?
- He's a frog, isn't he?

910
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,555
Yes.

911
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,230
Miss Piggy.

912
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,915
We could've had something
very, very special.

913
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,196
Now, I can't be responsible
for what might happen.

914
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,714
Yeah, well, uh...

915
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,189
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

916
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,589
I don't know why you love her like you do.

917
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,990
I don't know why. I just do.

918
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,116
Well, you'd better snap out of it, and fast.

919
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,634
We've got to plant the goods on her
to take the heat off us.

920
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,790
I know the plan.
I just wish there was another way.

921
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,792
It's the only way. Especially now
the cops are starting to ask questions.

922
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,509
OK, I'll do my job.
When I give the signal, you do yours.

923
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,831
Forgive me, Miss Piggy.

924
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,638
- Am I dressed right for this?
- You look fine, Fozzie.

925
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,836
Thank you.

926
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,435
And now,
without further ado,

927
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,478
roses, hyacinths,

928
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,632
lilacs and bluebells

929
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:29,679
- make up our first fashion bouquet.
- Ooh!

930
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:34,194
- Pretty nice lines, huh?
- Yes and the dresses aren't bad either.

931
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,953
Here's capricious Carla,

932
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,191
a dream in hyacinth-blue chiffon

933
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,717
with the classic allure
of the white pleated collar and cuffs.

934
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,075
The skirt, a flutter of godets,

935
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,516
all complemented
by the cloudy folds of blue

936
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,354
forming the perfect flower-framing hat.

937
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,193
<i>Fantastique.</i> And thank you, Carla.

938
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,989
- Pretty good-looking duds.
- I found the white pleated collar alluring,

939
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,834
but I was rather taken aback
by the flutter of godets.

940
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,239
Mm-hm.

941
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,749
And now here's delicious Darla

942
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,796
in a swirl of apricot silk

943
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,634
above a tight bodice
with a cleverly-draped décolletage.

944
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:22,600
Finishing with roses to match the
confection of flowers and silk on her head,

945
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,638
forming a teeny-weeny hat.

946
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,238
Oh. Ow! My knee. I think I've twisted it.

947
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,550
You all right? You've got to get up!
You've got to go on!

948
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,949
I can't go on!

949
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,349
Oh! You poor thing.

950
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,876
Oh, don't worry, Marla.
I'll stay right here with you.

951
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,635
You can't. You've got to go on in her place.

952
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,678
And now, the Lady Holiday
swimwear collection.

953
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,036
Hey, Waldorf, wake up.
Here come the bikinis.

954
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,793
Oh, boy. We'd better
synchronise our pacemakers.

955
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:07,796
A cloud of lavender starburst pleating
surrounds our next model.

956
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,792
Oh, I say!

957
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,277
<i>A miracle of spring</i>

958
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,432
<i>A miracle of beauty</i>

959
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:18,516
<i>Be dazzled by the magic of one smile</i>

960
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,558
<i>A vision of loveliness</i>

961
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,915
<i>A universe of charms</i>

962
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,518
<i>We'll never rest until you're in our arms</i>

963
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,998
<i>Daffodils. Miss Piggy</i>

964
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:44,436
<i>Whippoorwills. Miss Piggy</i>

965
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:50,914
<i>Everything that's lovely.</i>
<i>Warm and spring. Miss Piggy</i>

966
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,310
<i>Fantasy. Miss Piggy</i>

967
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,517
<i>Ecstasy. Miss Piggy</i>

968
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,398
<i>All that's fair or fine or wonderful</i>

969
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,790
<i>Or anything. Miss Piggy</i>

970
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:09,637
<i>Where does the rapture</i>
<i>begin and grow?</i>

971
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:16,592
<i>Where does devotion and passion go?</i>

972
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,956
<i>Happiness. Miss Piggy</i>

973
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:23,316
<i>One caress. Miss Piggy</i>

974
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,393
<i>All the world's ever wanted was you</i>

975
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,233
<i>A dream come true</i>

976
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:34,632
<i>Oh. Miss Piggy. It's you</i>

977
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:55,234
<i>Where does the rapture</i>
<i>begin and grow?</i>

978
01:06:55,320 --> 01:07:01,236
<i>Where does devotion and passion go?</i>

979
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,556
<i>Happiness. Miss Piggy</i>

980
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:08,757
<i>One caress. Miss Piggy</i>

981
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,958
<i>All the world's ever wanted was you</i>

982
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,554
<i>A dream come true</i>

983
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,878
<i>Oh. Miss Piggy. It's you</i>

984
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,678
<i>It's you</i>

985
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,997
<i>It's you</i>

986
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,794
Oh, Miss Piggy, are you OK?

987
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,510
Yeah, sure.
I was just looking for my contact lens.

988
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,154
Excuse me. Excuse me.

989
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,198
Oh, dear. Oh, you poor thing.

990
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,840
Excuse me. Here, put this on.

991
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,717
- You'll get a chill.
- Thank you very much.

992
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,074
- You all right?
- I don't know what happened.

993
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,230
I must've tripped.

994
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,629
Wait a minute. What's this?

995
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,190
I don't think these belong to me.

996
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,669
Do you recognise this?

997
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,672
That was my necklace.
But... where are the diamonds?

998
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,639
- Where are the diamonds?
- Miss Piggy stole my necklace.

999
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,395
- Miss Piggy, how could you?
- No! No! I don't know anything about it!

1000
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,677
Somebody must've put it... You!

1001
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,354
- It was you! Kermit was right there!
- Oh, no, no, no!

1002
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,954
You're a phoney! Yes you are.

1003
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:52,192
And you know what? You can't even sing!
Your voice was dubbed.

1004
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,874
Watch out, guys. Kermit!

1005
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,110
Don't worry, Miss Piggy.
We'll get you out of this.

1006
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,839
It just goes to show
you can't trust anybody.

1007
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,309
Excuse me, Lady Holiday,
will you be hiring any more pigs?

1008
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,198
Well, I shall certainly think twice about it.

1009
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,875
Kermit, find out if they'll let me
keep the costumes.

1010
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,713
What about your most famous piece of
jewellery, the fabulous Baseball Diamond?

1011
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,234
As from Monday,
the fabulous Baseball Diamond

1012
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,039
will go on permanent display
at the Mallory Gallery.

1013
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,398
I shall never have it either on my person
or in my possession again.

1014
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,198
That's right. It'll be in our possession.

1015
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,316
Tuesday at midnight
we'll go to the Mallory Gallery.

1016
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,233
The Baseball Diamond will be ours.

1017
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,159
<i>So there I was.</i>
<i>Backstage under a table.</i>

1018
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,789
I was doing a little photographic essay
on kneecaps,

1019
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,270
and I heard 'em planning to steal
the Baseball Diamond.

1020
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,349
Bummer.

1021
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,079
- So what's the plan, man?
- I already told you.

1022
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:48,278
Tuesday, midnight, at the Mallory Gallery.
That's all I know.

1023
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,476
You mean they're really gonna
try to steal the diamond?

1024
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,272
Quiet!

1025
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,635
"Look, Mother, it's my life, OK?"

1026
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,918
"So if I want to live on a beach
and walk around naked..."

1027
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,115
Oh.

1028
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,430
Now, if we wanna get
Miss Piggy out of jail,

1029
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,193
we're gonna have to catch
those thieves red-handed.

1030
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,156
Yes, Beau?

1031
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,789
What colour are their hands now?

1032
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,838
Now, we're about to embark
on a potentially dangerous mission.

1033
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,151
There could be physical violence,
there could be gunplay,

1034
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,754
and there's a slightest chance
that somebody might even get killed.

1035
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,991
So if anybody wants out,
now is the time to say it.

1036
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,672
- I'm out.
- Me too.

1037
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,273
- Ditto.
- Meep.

1038
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,557
Don't we have a gig around here,
or something or somewhere?

1039
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,234
Yeah, sorry. I got a dental appointment.

1040
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,515
It's like this, Kermit.
I have to go to work all day.

1041
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,560
Hold it!

1042
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,236
Shame on you.

1043
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:56,072
I thought we were in this thing together.

1044
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:00,597
I'm just as scared as you are,
but this has to be done.

1045
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:05,314
We don't want the bad guys to win.

1046
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,949
We've got to do this for... for... for justice.

1047
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,510
For... freedom. For... honesty.

1048
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,710
Boy, do I feel ashamed.

1049
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,519
Me too. I feel like two cents.

1050
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,514
- I'm back in.
- You can count on me.

1051
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,591
Oh, hey, I was only joking.

1052
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,911
Yeah, it'll be a lot of fun
to go out there and risk our lives.

1053
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,991
- Yeah!
- All for one and one for all.

1054
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,274
Yeah!

1055
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:36,831
At times like this
I am proud to be an American.

1056
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,793
Thank you. I knew I could count
on each and every one of you.

1057
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,111
Fozzie, are you OK?

1058
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,760
That took a lot out of me.

1059
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,877
OK. Now we don't have any time to waste,
so everybody gather round.

1060
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,758
And the first thing we have to do
is make our plans.

1061
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,592
- Right.
- Whoa!

1062
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,880
Or we could get some sleep.

1063
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,913
- Miss Piggy?
- What?

1064
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,355
Your lawyer is here to see you.

1065
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,079
Lawyer? I don't have a lawyer.

1066
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:24,958
Och, sure you do. Little green guy.

1067
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:31,398
Kermie! No wonder he hasn't come by
to see me. He had to finish law school.

1068
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,113
Oh, Kermit! Oh!

1069
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,919
Two minutes, pig.

1070
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,835
- Oh, Kermie. Oh, I've missed you so.
- Please. The name is Rosenthal.

1071
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,750
I'm your attorney.
That's the only way they'd let me in here.

1072
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,229
Oh, right.

1073
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,393
I've missed you so... Rosenthal.
It's been an eternity.

1074
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:05,357
- It's been 45 minutes.
- Time goes slow in the cooler.

1075
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,635
Well, I just want you to know
that we're gonna get you out of here,

1076
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,234
cos we're gonna catch those thieves
red-handed.

1077
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,880
What colour are their hands now?

1078
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,872
I don't think this is the time
for that type of humour.

1079
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:19,509
When you're in stir you take the laughs
when you can get 'em, Rosenthal.

1080
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,160
Yeah, well, anyway, just stay put

1081
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,834
because we've got a plan
and we're gonna prove you're innocent.

1082
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:28,310
You see, tomorrow night...
precisely at midnight,

1083
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,392
those thieves are gonna try to steal
Lady Holiday's Baseball Diamond

1084
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,833
from the Mallory Gallery.

1085
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,878
- And we're gonna stop 'em.
- Oh, Kermit, be careful.

1086
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,235
Don't worry
because I've got Gonzo and Fozzie

1087
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,551
and all our friends
from the Happiness Hotel to help.

1088
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,358
- Those clowns?
- Mm-hm.

1089
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,830
Great. I'll be stuck in the big house for life.

1090
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,718
"Big house"? Is that prison talk?

1091
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:55,272
Yeah, "big house", "squealer", "slammer".
That's the lingo we use here in the joint.

1092
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,033
Yeah. Well, you may talk tough,
Miss Piggy,

1093
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:02,238
but underneath I know you're still the same
beautiful, sensitive, vulnerable woman

1094
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,233
I was out with the other night.
The one who scarfed down all that caviar.

1095
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,469
You have such a way with words.

1096
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,835
I love you, Rosenthal.

1097
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,080
You're wearing my moustache.

1098
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:35,438
Yeah, well, you have mesh marks
on your face.

1099
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,237
- Glass cutter?
- Check.

1100
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,390
- Nylon rope?
- Check.

1101
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,199
- Computer deprogrammer?
- Check.

1102
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,111
- Stopwatch?
- Check.

1103
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,236
- Pocket laser?
- Check.

1104
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,880
- Infrared reflex?
- Check.

1105
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,473
- Portable detonator?
- Check.

1106
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,997
- Whoopee cushion?
- I think it's in the bus.

1107
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,311
- Rubber raft?
- It's got holes in it.

1108
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,597
Bag of chickens?

1109
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,911
- Fake vomit?
- It's on order.

1110
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,150
- Frisbee?
- Lost.

1111
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,958
- Pneumatic drill?
- Check.

1112
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,837
- Computer printout?
- Check.

1113
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,876
- Radar gun?
- Check.

1114
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,552
- Walkie-talkies?
- Check.

1115
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,272
- Wax lips?
- Man, I just had 'em.

1116
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:44,592
- Did you leave them in your other pants?
- I don't have no other pants.

1117
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,240
- Yo-yo?
- For sure.

1118
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,197
- Harpoon gun?
- That's you.

1119
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,794
Check.

1120
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,953
All right, team. Let's go for it.

1121
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,759
- Peanut butter?
- Animal ate it.

1122
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,957
Sorry.

1123
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,758
Well, Kermit,

1124
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,910
I guess that's it.

1125
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,230
All right, everybody.

1126
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,551
Let's go for it.

1127
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,596
Go for it!

1128
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,796
Beauregard.

1129
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,916
Back it up here.

1130
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,196
Sh. Sh.

1131
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,840
- OK. Quiet.
- Sh.

1132
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,832
OK. You guys
all got your disguises in place?

1133
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,558
Sh.

1134
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,835
Wow.

1135
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,992
- Wow!
- Sh!

1136
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,071
- I'm taking a picture.
- Sh.

1137
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,673
Rowlf, hand me the blowtorch.

1138
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:28,035
Blowtorch? Who said
anything about a blowtorch?

1139
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,759
I got some paper towels.

1140
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,354
How are we supposed to cut through
the bars if nobody brought stuff to cut with?

1141
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,796
I brought some hot mustard.
Maybe that'll eat through the bars.

1142
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,233
Eat through the bars!

1143
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,038
- Animal?
- What?

1144
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:44,159
Hey. Why don't you see if you
can eat through these iron bars.

1145
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,549
Eat through bars.

1146
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:59,034
- Doggy!
- The cops!

1147
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,479
Do you know where Lady Holiday's
Baseball Diamond is being kept?

1148
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:11,112
Funnily enough, I do.
It's at the Mallory Gallery,

1149
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:15,751
a virtually impregnable fortress,
many miles from here.

1150
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,628
- I only have a half an hour to get there.
- On foot? You'll never make it.

1151
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,550
- I know. How about a ride?
- You can read, I presume?

1152
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,790
"No passengers."

1153
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,475
Oh, couldn't you make an exception
for little old <i>moi?</i>

1154
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:32,199
Not even for little old <i>vous.</i>

1155
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,556
- Pretty please?
- No!

1156
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,154
I've tried to be nice.

1157
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,636
- Huh?
- Hiii-yah!

1158
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,513
Hey.

1159
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,990
- What's all the racket?
- What are you doing here?

1160
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:55,756
- A very brief cameo.
- Me too.

1161
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,076
Breaker one, this is Hamhock.
Do you read me?

1162
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:29,073
<i>Loud and clear. Hamhock.</i>
<i>This is Dirty Bird. What's your 20. over?</i>

1163
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,549
Well, good buddy,
we're westbound out of Highgate.

1164
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:33,756
Any smokies between me
and Blimeytown?

1165
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,513
<i>Negatory. Hamhock.</i>
<i>You're free and clear.</i>

1166
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,670
Ten-four, Dirty Bird. Much obliged.

1167
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,399
We got the hammer down and we gone.

1168
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,470
I never ordered no pepperoni.

1169
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:48,472
It's right here on the slip.
Medium pepperoni with double cheese.

1170
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,711
That's-a right. We don't-a
make them, we just-a deliver them.

1171
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,792
Somebody here called Pizza Twins,
and that's us.

1172
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,269
What's the name on that slip?

1173
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,515
Uh...

1174
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,160
- What's your name?
- Henderson.

1175
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:07,072
- That's it! That's the name on the slip.
- Ah!

1176
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,750
- But I hate pepperoni.
- I'll eat it.

1177
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,400
- Stand by, guys.
- Right!

1178
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,675
Ooh.

1179
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,236
'Ere. Just one moment.

1180
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,914
- Can I see that slip?
- Uh... uh... well...

1181
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,717
Actually, this is the wrong slip.

1182
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,633
That slip, sir,
you said it had my name on it.

1183
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,870
Oh, that-a slip.

1184
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,351
That-a slip we left at home.
But we got-a the pepperoni.

1185
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,000
- But I hate pepperoni.
- Hate pepperoni. Right.

1186
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:48,039
- How about you could feed it to the dogs?
- Yes. That's-a right. Here, sir.

1187
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:51,078
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.
Thank you very much, sir.

1188
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,430
What am I? A glutton for punishment?

1189
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,355
- Hey, Fozzie...
- Sh.

1190
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,715
Fozzie, how do we get in?

1191
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,793
- Why don't we just ring the doorbell?
- No, no, no. There's got to be another way.

1192
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,351
Well, you'd better think of it pretty quick.
Those dogs have nearly finished the pizza.

1193
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:35,638
- I know. The roof.
- Oh, man. No way we'll ever get up there.

1194
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,837
Phew.

1195
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:13,198
- So far I'm not having any fun.
- Let me talk to 'em.

1196
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,115
Woof woof. Woof woof.

1197
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:22,599
It helps to know a second language.

1198
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:27,512
It's nearly midnight.
What am I going to do?

1199
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,471
Hey! Hey, you! Hey!

1200
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,949
What an unbelievable coincidence.

1201
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,919
Now, this window probably
has an alarm system on it.

1202
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,232
My assistant Beaker will check it out.
Go on, Beaker.

1203
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:26,038
Very good, Beaker. Now it's perfectly safe.

1204
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:29,510
Oh, good. Animal, do your stuff.

1205
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,038
Sorry.

1206
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:52,238
There it is.
The fabulous Baseball Diamond.

1207
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,913
How are we
gonna get down there?

1208
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,877
I suggest we jump.

1209
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,428
Are you crazy?
That's about a hundred feet.

1210
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,590
I didn't say it was a good suggestion.

1211
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,353
Maybe we could jump partway.

1212
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:12,471
Oh, boy, what do we do now?

1213
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,677
We're just gonna have to go down there
and catch those thieves red-handed.

1214
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,672
What colour are their hands now?

1215
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:32,758
We'll just have to improvise. We'll make
a ladder out of whatever will hold us.

1216
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:37,197
Good idea. Here's the paper towels.

1217
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,517
I'm coming, Kermie!

1218
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,949
Well, you wanted excitement.

1219
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,311
Excuse me, I don't think
that belongs to you.

1220
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,633
Say cheese!

1221
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,309
Woman!

1222
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,550
Hey, nice catch, Animal.

1223
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:00,473
- Heads up, Lew.
- Over here, Rowlf! Yeah, got it!

1224
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,438
Hot potato! Keep away. Here we go.

1225
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,679
I got it. Thank you. Be careful, guys.

1226
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,990
Catch it. Get him!

1227
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,915
Still got a good eye.

1228
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,231
Welcome to the wild world
of Muppet sports.

1229
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,675
This is Louis Kazagger
with a play-by-play

1230
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,909
- of the game.
- Woman!

1231
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,719
And it looks like ladies' night
here at the gallery.

1232
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,633
- Peekaboo.
- Hey! Ba-ba-do-be-bop.

1233
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,678
OK. Here she comes, boy!

1234
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,195
Hey, way to chuck,
way to look, way to move!

1235
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:43,671
Popcorn, popcorn.
Get your red-hot popcorn.

1236
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,872
Popcorn, chicken?

1237
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,355
Woman!

1238
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,878
- Woman!
- OK, OK.

1239
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,794
Lew Zealand leads off the order
as we join the game.

1240
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:07,310
- Chuck it to me, Beakie baby.
- Pitchy witchy, Beaker.

1241
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,709
Pitcher, you couldn't hit
the front side of a barn!

1242
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,995
Picture of the pitcher.

1243
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,071
Wait for what you want, Lew, baby.

1244
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,388
Rah, rah, rah!

1245
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:18,233
Beaker goes into the windup.

1246
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:22,233
It's the pitch.
It's a high fly ball to Kermit the Frog.

1247
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,675
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1248
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,119
Hey, gimme that diamond, you crook.

1249
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,400
- Come on, guys. Get him.
- All right. Back off!

1250
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,558
But, Nicky, why are you doing this?

1251
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,632
Why am I doing this?
Because I'm a villain. It's pure and simple.

1252
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,154
Excuse me, Mr Holiday, sir.

1253
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,437
Would you let Kermit go? If you hold him
too long he'll just give you warts.

1254
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,796
Oh, no. He's coming with us.
Come on, girls. Let's get out of here.

1255
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,395
Hii-yah!

1256
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,551
Hiii-yah!

1257
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,914
Hii-yah!

1258
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,548
- Hii-yah!
- Ow!

1259
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,835
- Watch out!
- Miss Piggy!

1260
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,275
Yeah! Way to go!

1261
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,509
Ha ha ha ha.

1262
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,230
Bye-bye.

1263
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,278
- You were magnificent, Miss Piggy.
- I did it all for you.

1264
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,839
- Could I have just a moment?
- Thank you.

1265
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,070
<i>Por nada.</i>

1266
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,957
Oh.

1267
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,508
- I really did care for you, you know.
- I know.

1268
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,512
We could've had the world
on a silver platter.

1269
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:07,037
- That silver's turned to iron bars, Nicky.
- Don't hate me, Miss Piggy.

1270
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:10,556
Oh, I don't.
It's just that somehow along the road

1271
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:13,154
I found out the difference
between wrong and right.

1272
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,435
You're wrong...

1273
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,670
He's right.

1274
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:26,112
Would you believe it, Statler? They're
heroes. Now they're gonna be obnoxious.

1275
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,316
So what else is new?

1276
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:33,756
- Well, I say all's well that ends well.
- It doesn't matter to me as long as it ends.

1277
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,794
It was nice of the <i>Chronicle</i>
to pay for our flight home.

1278
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:47,316
Yeah, but a man should be treated
better than his luggage.

1279
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,914
Yeah, well, my luggage
was sucked out the door.

1280
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,992
Luckily my radio's frozen to my wrist.

1281
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:56,277
OK, guys. Everybody out for the USA.

1282
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,555
Oh, boy. How close are we?

1283
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,835
Oh, about 30,000 feet.

1284
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,195
- You mean?
- Yup.

1285
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,714
Happy landing!

1286
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,995
Whoa!

1287
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,310
Come on, carrot-top.

1288
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:25,150
- <i>We've had comedy</i>
- <i>We've had mystery</i>

1289
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:28,312
<i>We've had a real good time</i>
<i>and solved a crime real easily</i>

1290
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,915
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>I just can't believe they did it</i>

1291
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,231
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- And me!

1292
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:38,596
- <i>There was spectacle</i>
- <i>There was fantasy</i>

1293
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,990
- <i>Where we took a chance</i>
- <i>And saw romance end happily</i>

1294
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,036
- <i>In a movie</i>
- Oh, Kermie!

1295
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,394
<i>I just love a happy ending</i>

1296
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:49,075
- <i>One for everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

1297
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:52,311
- <i>Everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

1298
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,996
- <i>Everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

1299
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,753
<i>Everybody in the world</i>

01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,239
- And me.
- And me.

- And me.
- And me.

1302
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,872
- And me.
- And me.

1303
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,349
And me.

1304
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,715
- And me.
- And me.

01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:10,558
- And me.

And me.

1310
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:40,150
<i>Just warmer and colder</i>

1311
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:43,710
<i>Than springtime or snow</i>

1312
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:49,591
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

1313
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,956
<i>And so you fall</i>

1314
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:00,430
<i>And how complete it is</i>

1315
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:04,877
<i>And for each moment that it lasts</i>

1316
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,032
<i>How sweet it is</i>

1317
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:50,030
Wait a minute!
Wait! Hold it right there.

1318
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,190
Don't go home yet.

1319
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:54,236
Say cheese.

1320
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,116
I'll send you each a copy.
