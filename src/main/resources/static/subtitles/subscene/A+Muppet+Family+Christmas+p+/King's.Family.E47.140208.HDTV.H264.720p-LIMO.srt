2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,270
Yes, Subak, what is it?

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,090
Father, mom's hurt.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,960
What?

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,900
She fell down and we're at the hospital.

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,830
But why? Why wasn't she more careful?

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,190
How serious is it?
What did the doctor say?

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,140
She's getting x-rays and she hurt her back.

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,200
What?

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,900
That's not good!

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,940
Please hurry over.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,470
I can't come right now...

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,340
Make sure she gets through the tests okay,

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,170
and take good care of her.

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,470
If she needs to be hospitalized, help her.

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,530
And call me when something changes.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,030
I want mom!

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,630
I want grandmother!

19
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,070
You need to come right now. Hurry.

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,190
Okay, Minjung.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,060
How bad is it?
Does she need surgery?

22
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,230
No, it's a hairline fracture to the pelvis.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,000
Right here.

24
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,040
What do we do now?

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,660
We have to wait until it heals.

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,640
Does she need to be hospitalized?

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,800
It's up to you.

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,840
But there's nothing much we can do for her.

29
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,090
She needs to stay in bed until it heals.

30
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,690
I'm going home.

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,590
I'm not wasting money to stay here.

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,730
But it'll be more comfortable here for you.

33
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,470
But all I have to do is wait, right?

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,530
That's right.

35
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,340
Ouch, being here won't speed it up,

36
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,270
so I want to lie down at home.

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,540
Nothing gets done without me.

38
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,500
You can't mom, mom.

39
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,970
Don't worry about me.

40
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,440
Subak, go and bring the kids back.

41
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,270
How dare you feed my boy?

42
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,640
How dare you hold my child?

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,830
Aeji!

44
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,700
She just fell asleep.

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,760
Aeji's having a hard time, too.

46
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,070
Then why did you bring them here?

47
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,260
You're scaring the kids.

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,670
You...

49
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,390
Are you kidding me?

50
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,900
Don't mess with me.

51
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,340
I'm about to lose my mind,

52
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,060
so start packing.

53
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,370
I can't do that.

54
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,800
You want to pick a fight?

55
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,040
They are my kids.

56
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,560
And I'm taking them, so stay out of it.

57
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,660
But they are Minjung's kids, too.

58
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,390
You should talk to Minjung first.

59
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,300
What?

60
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,040
I don't believe this.

61
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,400
You think dropping his name will stop me?

62
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,590
Disgusting.

63
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,560
Give him back to me. I was feeding him.

64
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,090
Stop it!

65
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,260
How dare you try to win my kids over?

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,270
You think you can get them, too?

67
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,570
You're shameless!

68
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,090
Aeji, wake up!

69
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,260
Mom!

70
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,870
Aeji, carry this.

71
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,640
Let's go.

72
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,000
Hold on. Wait.

73
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,290
Minjung, you should come home.

74
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,040
He doesn't have to!

75
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,300
I'm taking my kids, so stay out of this!

76
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,470
You all stay out!

77
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,560
What should I do?

78
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,460
I'll be right there.
Don't let them leave.

79
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,560
You can't leave like this!

80
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,760
Then how should I leave?

81
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,240
Should I break everything up and beat you?

82
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,470
If you have a conscience, you can't do this.

83
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,630
You think you could become their mom?

84
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,030
Dream on!

85
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,770
Aeji and Jungji are my kids.

86
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,130
Let's go.

87
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,090
- Where's dad?
- Be quiet.

88
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,370
Why can't you even walk right?

89
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,690
Get up!

90
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,370
Oh, no.

91
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,940
Did you see?

92
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,000
Did you see what you did?

93
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,860
It must hurt.

94
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,100
Let's go home and put some ointment on.

95
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,570
Did you tell him to bring the kids?

96
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,440
Aeji can hear you.

97
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,960
Kids are smart so don't speak like that.

98
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,790
You're ashamed?

99
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,560
I'm not.

100
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,940
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

101
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,940
Aeji,

102
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,240
get on my back.

103
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,370
Where are the kids?

104
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,040
I took them home.

105
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,500
What are you doing?

106
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,060
Why did you take the kids?

107
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,500
Bring them out.

108
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,500
Did she tell you to bring them back?

109
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,970
She's really sly.

110
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,130
Sly fox who acts like she's an angel.

111
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,500
You don't know her.

112
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,470
Aeji!

113
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,660
Aeji's hurt.

114
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,340
Why? How bad is it?

115
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,730
Dad!

116
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,030
What happened?

117
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,900
I fell down.

118
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,260
- Does it hurt a lot?
- Yes.

119
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,960
My mom's hurt, too.

120
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,030
How?

121
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,870
Because of you. Because of you two!

122
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,000
She fell and cracked her pelvis chasing you.

123
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,690
She can't even move now.

124
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,030
Oh, Minjung.

125
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,200
Why did you take the kids?

126
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,330
How do you feel?

127
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,190
Who cares about how I feel?

128
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,830
How will you raise them?

129
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,960
It wasn't his idea.

130
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,760
It was hers.

131
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,660
She's saying she'll raise the kids

132
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,560
because she wants to have you,

133
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,260
but she'll only be a step mom.

134
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,500
I've seen some unbelievable things happen,

135
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,830
but I can't watch my precious grandkids

136
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,290
being raised by a step mom.

137
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,900
Their real mom is right here,

138
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,530
so how could I do that?

139
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,340
Enough said.

140
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,230
I'm raising the kids.

141
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,970
We should do as we agreed before.

142
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,130
You gave all of them to me, remember?

143
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,090
That was then.

144
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,440
Do you always keep your words?

145
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,260
Situations can change things.

146
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,830
I'm their mom, no matter how bad I am.

147
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't care if you get remarried.

148
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,630
Just let me keep the kids.

149
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,690
If not, I don't know what I'll do.

150
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,830
Go easy on him.

151
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,300
How can I go easy on him?

152
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,440
People might think you're fighting.

153
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,730
If we need to, we can fight.

154
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,660
I'm sorry I have to say it here,

155
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,690
but I can't let a woman like you raise them.

156
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,360
What did I ever do?

157
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,730
Subak.

158
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,560
Stop it! I can't even talk?

159
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,140
Shut up.

160
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,870
You're qualified to raise them.

161
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,530
How about you? You're qualified?

162
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,800
Subak!

163
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,640
Mom, you stay out.

164
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,340
You don't know anything.

165
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,990
I do!

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,630
Minjung, you should go.

167
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,870
Don't pay attention to what Subak says.

168
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,630
What's wrong with you?

169
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,540
Why don't we talk about this?

170
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,560
You think you're qualified?

171
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,060
You made her take care of your father and conspired to divorce me.

172
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,330
What right do you have?

173
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,590
Isn't that a crime?

174
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,170
You're out of your mind!

175
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,590
He's blaming me for everything here!

176
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,260
Be honest with me.

177
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,640
How did you feel?

178
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,400
When you tricked me into believing that?

179
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,600
Were you glad? Were you happy?

180
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,890
Subak, please.

181
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,800
Minjung, she's gone mad, so just go.

182
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,830
I made mistakes, but you did, too,

183
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,560
so let's call it even.

184
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:28,490
I'd rather die than hand my kids over to her.

185
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,530
You should be quiet.

186
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,500
Why should I be?

187
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,330
Subak.

188
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,670
Why do you keep cutting me off, mom?

189
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,670
I'm sorry you got hurt because of me.

190
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,190
Leave the kids here for now.

191
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,770
Your place is too cold for the kids.

192
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,190
I'm moving to an apartment.

193
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,140
Then take them after you move, okay?

194
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,190
Do it for me.

195
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,590
I'll take them after I move.

196
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,830
Forget it!

197
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,560
Ouch!

198
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,090
My whole body aches!

199
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,060
I should just kill you!

200
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,040
What's wrong?

201
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,730
You weren't looking at land, were you?

202
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,030
I can't believe how dense I was...

203
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,690
How can you cheat on him?
You're a mom!

204
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,690
I'm afraid the neighbors might find out.

205
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,230
You deserved what you got.

206
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,460
It wasn't like that.

207
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,960
Minjung knew about it really early.

208
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,190
If your father finds out, he'll go nuts.

209
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,900
You! Ouch!

210
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,470
Stop! What if your pelvis breaks?

211
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,130
Who cares about that?

212
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:09,500
I can't believe how shameless you are.

213
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,290
How can you scream at Minjung like that?

214
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,560
He cheated on me, too!

215
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,770
What?

216
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,740
Who are you?

217
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,260
You used to get horrible grades,

218
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,240
but look how calculating you are!

219
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,560
Why do you always talk about my grades?

220
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,860
I made a mistake, but he intended it.

221
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,990
And that's worse.

222
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,400
He knows about the other thing, too.

223
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,860
What other thing?

224
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,260
You know what.

225
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,240
I don't even want to talk about it.

226
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,160
He submitted the papers because of that.

227
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,460
How did he find out?

228
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,760
What do you think?

229
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,740
Was it Hobak?

230
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,660
She said no, but who else could it be?

231
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,960
How's mom?

232
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:12,960
Was it you?

233
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,130
What do you mean?

234
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,600
You told him, right?

235
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,890
Tell him what?

236
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,400
Even mom said that. Stop it!

237
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,440
It wasn't me.

238
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,900
Who else could tell him?

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,130
How's your mom?

240
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,190
Father.

241
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,140
Oh, dear.

242
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,370
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

243
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,870
This is my dream come true.

244
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,630
Lying on my back, having my husband feed me.

245
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,140
I'm going to enjoy this.

246
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,270
That mouth of yours is unbelievable.

247
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,400
I feel lost here.

248
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,170
You feel lost because I'm lying on my back?

249
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,900
How can we do anything now?

250
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,470
What about our meals?

251
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,670
Try taking care of yourselves.

252
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,560
What did the doctor say?

253
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,140
It's a hairline fracture, so she can't move.

254
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,800
Why didn't you check into the hospital?

255
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,740
I told her to do so, but she didn't want to.

256
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,440
Being hospitalized won't help me heal!

257
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,800
What about the money?

258
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,690
Who would take care of me?

259
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,230
I'd rather have Subak do it at home.

260
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,790
Quit your job and take care of your mom.

261
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,170
I already talked to my boss.

262
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,140
Anggeum, you're too old to run around!

263
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,900
Bong, you be careful, too.

264
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,500
Old people must be careful.

265
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,260
I'm sorry for being old.

266
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,940
I should just die.
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

267
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,590
How could you leave your post?

268
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,460
I was at the bathroom.

269
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,490
I've been standing here for over an hour.

270
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,890
I'm sorry. My wife got hurt.

271
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,640
Being a former vice principal,

272
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,870
I thought you'd be a hard worker.

273
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,360
This won't happen again.
I'm sorry.

274
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,540
Mom!

275
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,540
Hi.

276
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,440
How serious is it?

277
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,340
See for yourself.

278
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,190
Mom!

279
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,300
I'm not a spectacle.

280
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,140
How did it happen?
A hairline fracture?

281
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,970
I'm going to be pampered now.

282
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,630
Don't cry. This is great.

283
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,230
I'm so upset.

284
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,530
Why are bad things happening to us?

285
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,960
Mom, eat.

286
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,260
Oh, ouch...

287
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,160
- Is it hot?
- It is.

288
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,970
Give me a little bit at a time.

289
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,830
Hold on.

290
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,190
I can't work anymore.

291
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,830
I know.

292
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,990
I wanted to buy father a house.

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,030
I guess I'll have to win the lottery.

294
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:45,270
Why are these things happening now?

295
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,900
I should go.

296
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,640
It must be uncomfortable for you.

297
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,670
Actually...

298
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,400
Subak, I'm sorry.

299
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,690
Why should you be?

300
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,730
Why does it have to be her?

301
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,540
You're home.

302
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,460
At least I can say goodbye.

303
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,590
Goodbye.

304
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,190
Hold on.

305
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,040
You must hate me, but I want to tell you this much.

306
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,800
Nothing happened before the divorce.

307
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,960
I don't want to hear it.

308
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,370
But you believe your brother in law, right?

309
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,570
Remember what you told me?

310
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,600
He is a better person than your sister?

311
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,640
That was when I didn't know about this.

312
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,170
He never once tried anything with me.

313
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,100
I looked after his father,

314
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,460
but he just needed my help. That was it.

315
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,190
He was actually very cold to me.

316
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,030
He didn't even call me right after his divorce.

317
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,830
Please believe me.

318
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,570
I don't like hearing you defending him.

319
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,270
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

320
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,960
I should go.
Be happy with Sangnam.

321
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,100
Your father in law is hot tempered and loud,

322
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,100
but he's soft inside.

323
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,800
Try to get along with him.

324
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,070
Thank you for everything and I'm sorry.

325
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,000
Miho.

326
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,400
Mom!

327
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,490
Let's go.

328
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,600
Where are we?

329
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,070
Our home.

330
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,740
We'll live here until we move to the apartment.

331
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,230
Just the two of us?

332
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,830
No, with Mr. Ko.

333
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,440
And maybe his kids.

334
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,490
- Miho, is it okay?
- Yes, I'm glad.

335
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,790
But I didn't get to say goodbye.

336
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,730
You can do it later.

337
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,170
I only want one thing.

338
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,370
Just to be happy with Sangnam. That's it.

339
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,800
You have to brace yourself.

340
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,660
Sleep well and eat well.

341
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,030
You'll live here for a long time.

342
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,260
Oh, no...

343
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,530
I know how hard it must be for you.

344
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,170
Aunt moved out?

345
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,440
I heard what happened.

346
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,670
Are you sick?

347
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,760
Yes. My heart and my body.

348
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,460
I ache all over.

349
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,640
How could this happen?

350
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,270
Why does it have to be Subak?

351
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,260
I'm sorry it had to be Subak.

352
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,230
I heard thorns in your words.

353
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,590
My aunt didn't start it, I'm sure.

354
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,140
You have to believe it.

355
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,270
Did you say something to her?

356
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,530
Don't you think what you did was wrong?

357
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,890
How could you go after a married man?

358
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,640
He was married to my sister.

359
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,570
How could you break up their marriage?

360
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,400
How did it feel to see me every day?

361
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,670
Have you no conscience?

362
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,690
You said those things?

363
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,670
I wish I did,

364
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,490
but I couldn't.

365
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,400
I understand how you feel.

366
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,600
But I hope you don't hate my aunt.

367
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,600
You understand how I feel?

368
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,940
You shouldn't be so sure.

369
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,030
Even I don't know that, so how could you?

370
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,870
I've been relying on aunt,

371
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,640
and how it ended breaks my heart.

372
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,340
How will I live without her?

373
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,570
But I can't be on her side.

374
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,940
Even if she and Minjung had every right,

375
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,370
even if it was all Subak's fault,

376
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,540
I still have to side with Subak.

377
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,090
Because she's family.

378
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,840
My sister.

379
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,770
Aunt is the winner now,

380
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,460
and my sister lost.

381
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,730
Miho.

382
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,140
Mr. Ko.

383
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,940
I brought pizza.

384
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,440
Thank you.

385
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,730
Go wash your hands for dinner.

386
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,460
I'm happy to have Miho here.

387
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,140
It feels like the place is full.

388
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,770
That's because this is a tiny place.

389
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,560
Miho, I'm sorry you don't have your own room.

390
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,700
It's okay.

391
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,900
Mom and I've been roommates all this time.

392
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,400
I just hope you don't snore.

393
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,770
When we move, my kids will come, too.

394
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,090
That's okay. I'm glad.

395
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,600
I can take care of Jungji.

396
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,940
It's snowing.
Should we go and watch?

397
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,690
Let's go, mom.

398
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,360
Oh, my!

399
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,170
It's so pretty.

400
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,940
I get worried when it snows.

401
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,260
You're still a kid at heart.

402
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,670
Right.

403
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,760
If you start worrying over snow, you're old.

404
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,730
We're getting a lot of snow this winter.

405
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,230
Mom, it's so nice here.

406
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,440
Isn't it?

407
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,600
Minjung, isn't it weird?

408
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,570
When something good happens, it snows.

409
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,340
I thought of that, too.

410
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,500
Snow is very special for us.

411
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,040
One, two, three.

412
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,840
Mom, do they sell dads anywhere?

413
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,000
I wish we could buy us a dad.

414
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,370
How is your mother?

415
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,770
The same.

416
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,790
She's frustrated. And she nags.

417
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,990
I'm sure.

418
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,670
She's great at saying mean things.

419
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,260
Your doctor told you to be careful.

420
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,670
What could I do?

421
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,170
What do you mean?

422
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,800
Don't go to your mother's house.

423
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,530
She orders you around, so why do you go?

424
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,070
Tell her you're busy.

425
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,970
You're pregnant.

426
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,330
What's Subak doing?

427
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,900
She quit her job.

428
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,300
Ouch...

429
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,590
Should I rub your shoulders?

430
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,670
- Channel 5.
- Okay.

431
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,760
- It's boring. Channel 9.
- Okay.

432
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,760
- Channel 7. 
- 7?

433
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,670
Channel 7.

434
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,230
- That looks good.
- Okay.

435
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,300
Eat.

436
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,090
There you go.

437
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,460
- Head.
- Head?

438
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,730
There's no channel head.

439
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,900
Your head's in the way.

440
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,540
- Okay.
- Mmm.

441
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,940
- Ah!
- Okay.

442
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,140
Tada. Ah...

443
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,070
What are you doing?

444
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,670
Are you the remote control?

445
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,270
She's tired.

446
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,990
Even if she is!

447
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,830
How can the wife lie on her back

448
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,740
and order her husband to change the channels,

449
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,530
move his head, and feed strawberries to her?

450
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,490
I can't watch it anymore.

451
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,790
I feel sad because I have no husband.

452
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,760
You don't know anything.
She's preg...

453
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,990
She's what?

454
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,190
Huh?

455
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,790
Don't ask. You should already know.

456
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,590
What?

457
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,770
Pass.

458
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,630
Hobak, you shouldn't act this way.

459
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,570
You think you're special because you work,

460
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,270
but I went back to work after giving birth.

461
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,030
Mother, don't talk about the old days.

462
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,640
My grandmother and mother used to fight over that.

463
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,840
You're just like your mom.

464
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,840
You picked up her bad habits.

465
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,340
You talk just like your mom.

466
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,940
We are mother and daughter.

467
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,140
We are bound to be alike.

468
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,370
Mom, don't mind us and go to your room.

469
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,690
- Awful boy!
- Ouch!

470
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,790
You're making me want to get a husband!

471
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,690
Oh, this is nutty, nutty, nuts.
That stung.

472
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,840
Should I look for a man for you?

473
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,670
I don't really need that.

474
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,800
Don't.

475
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,960
Why not? Mother's pretty young.

476
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,330
Forget it.

477
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,840
Mom will live with us forever.

478
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,000
Right, mom?

479
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,670
You should live by yourselves.

480
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,570
Why do you want to include me?

481
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,900
- Noodles.
- Okay.

482
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,690
Here.

483
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,340
I brought you noodles, your highness.

484
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,730
It's been a while, right?

485
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,370
Say hi to the pot.

486
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,440
I don't want to.

487
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,440
It's old. Throw it away.

488
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,230
No.

489
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,640
This pot looks like you.

490
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,900
Me?

491
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,770
I can't throw it out because I love it.

492
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,590
That's you. Eat up.

493
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,090
You did a good job.

494
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,040
But about mother...

495
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,530
Stop it.

496
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,460
You know what I was going to say?

497
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,170
You want my mom to get married?
No, thanks.

498
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,490
Why not?

499
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,860
Mother's still young, so she should remarry.

500
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,270
She had a hard life raising you,

501
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,940
so she should live her life now.

502
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,530
I think she's interested.

503
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,960
I should've talked to her about it.

504
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,940
After Yeongdal got married, she became...

505
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,860
What?

506
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,970
I don't want you to talk about my mom.

507
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,170
How do you feel?

508
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,400
Why did you come home so late?

509
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,570
I meant to come home early,

510
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,870
but I had a lot of work.

511
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,600
You should come home early at a time like this.

512
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,400
Does it hurt a lot?

513
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,400
I'm lying here,

514
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,940
and I don't have to do anything,

515
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,990
so I want to relax and enjoy it,

516
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,830
but it's like torture.

517
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,800
It's more frustrating than painful.

518
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,530
When I was young, I healed quicker,

519
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,230
but now that I'm old, I'm useless.

520
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,790
Using the bathroom must be a problem.

521
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,590
It's more than a problem.

522
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:19,260
Having to wear a diaper is pathetic and humiliating.

523
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,790
I can't ask Subak to help.

524
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,860
You should. She should be glad to help.

525
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,040
She's my daughter, but I'm not comfortable.

526
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,190
I'm embarrassed and I feel sorry.

527
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,290
I feel more comfortable with you.

528
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,560
Can't you take some time off?

529
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,140
Isn't this spring break?

530
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,940
Well...

531
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,440
Remember? 
I'm working on a project.

532
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,460
Did you hear?
Old Geezer got fired.

533
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,940
- He did?
- Yes.

534
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,400
Says who?

535
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,600
Everyone knows.

536
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,840
He wasn't at the staff room.

537
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,540
We're getting a new vice principal.

538
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,090
I hope the next one's not like Old Geezer.

539
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,230
Father, where are you?

540
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,170
What do you think?
At school.

541
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,600
I know you're not at school.

542
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,460
Tell me where you are. Hurry.

543
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,460
Yes?

544
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,900
Give me my package please.

545
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,170
Okay.

546
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,830
Here it is.

547
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,900
Why couldn't you just bring it?

548
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,230
The guy before used to do it.

549
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,370
I told you several times.

550
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,270
I can't leave my post.

551
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,760
Unbelievable.

552
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,670
Your paycheck comes from my maintenance fee, so how can you say that?

553
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,390
Honey, what's wrong?
What happened?

554
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,570
He wouldn't bring the package up.

555
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,070
Why couldn't you do that?

556
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,800
It's hard to go up and down the stairs.

557
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,940
Mr. Wang!

558
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,460
Oh, uh...

559
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,000
It's been a while. 
How are you?

560
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,790
What happened?

561
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,960
You're the security guard here?

562
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,030
It just happened.

563
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,390
I didn't hear about your retirement.

564
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,040
It's about time. I'm pretty old.

565
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,990
It was too boring to just stay home.

566
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,230
Uh, okay.

567
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,840
Don't cry.

568
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,370
Dad.

569
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,300
You got fired?

570
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,990
I didn't, so don't let it bother you.

571
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,860
You don't believe me?

572
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,690
I do.

573
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:21,230
I respect you the most in this world.

574
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,230
Thanks.

575
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,940
Don't tell anyone, not when mom's sick.

576
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,300
Okay.

577
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,460
But isn't this too hard for you?

578
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,560
It isn't. It's actually fun.

579
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,730
Dad,

580
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,300
stay strong.

581
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,940
You have me.

582
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:55,640
I'll grow up quickly and take good care of you.

583
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,300
Ugh!

584
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,890
I can't eat anymore.

585
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,460
I can't even take a shower.

586
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,870
I feel too dirty to eat.
And I have indigestion.

587
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,800
Bring me a wet towel or something.

588
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,460
Don't get so angry.

589
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,290
I boiled some water.

590
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,670
Huh?

591
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,670
Did you use all the hot water?

592
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,690
Yes. I washed my hair.

593
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,230
Subak, my stomach seems bigger, right?

594
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,400
Didn't I tell you?

595
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,070
I won't talk to you if you call my name.

596
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,400
You're funny.

597
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,340
I'm your aunt and 5th in rank.

598
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,740
And you're below me.

599
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,330
That's enough.

600
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,170
You want me to beat the crap out of you?

601
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,990
I can't believe what you just said!

602
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,360
How dare you speak like that to your aunt?

603
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,600
Maybe I should teach you a lesson!

604
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,070
I've been keeping quiet until now.

605
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,200
What?

606
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,260
Be careful.

607
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,830
If I open my mouth, you're dead.

608
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,240
You...

609
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,090
What's going on?

610
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,460
Subak is being really rude.

611
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,140
And she orders me around.

612
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,100
What?

613
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,540
Huh? When did I do that?

614
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,330
Grandmother, I didn't.

615
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,840
Aunt, when was I ever rude to you?

616
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,870
What? You were!

617
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,190
You were glaring at me!

618
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,170
Oh, don't joke around.

619
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,340
Aunt, please do the dishes.

620
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,140
I'm so busy.

621
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,560
But she's pregnant.

622
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,240
Grandmother, you had babies, too.

623
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,770
Is sitting all day good for you?

624
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,030
Not really.

625
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,440
Right?

626
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,360
Aunt, please come out.

627
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,640
Don't work too hard.
Take it easy.

628
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,330
Just until Anggeum gets better.

629
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,530
Ugh.

630
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,800
My princess, what are you doing?

631
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,440
Calling me your princess is useless!

632
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,170
I'm more like a servant girl.

633
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,400
My princess is doing the chores?
Come out.

634
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,370
I'll get yelled at.

635
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,230
Even mother is on Subak's side.

636
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,440
Don, can you yell at Subak?

637
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,990
She orders me around and never calls me aunt.

638
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,960
She says, "I'll kill you!"

639
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,340
What?

640
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,260
How dare she!

641
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,630
Subak! Ugh!

642
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,900
Subak, can I see you?

643
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,090
Why?

644
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,060
Just come out.

645
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,090
What is it?

646
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,700
When I tell you to come out, just come out.

647
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,640
What?

648
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,860
Hurry up!

649
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,170
What is it?

650
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,490
Subak,

651
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,460
can you do me a big favor?

652
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,200
Think of how you're making me look here.

653
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:17,670
Yeongdal married me out of love,

654
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,340
so if you're mean, how could she live here?

655
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:25,600
Can you please treat her as your aunt?

656
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,030
But she doesn't deserve it.

657
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,400
That's why I'm begging here.

658
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,860
Subak, please?

659
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:37,790
Tell her not to disrespect me either.

660
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,300
Okay. I'll talk to her.

661
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,170
So please be nice to her, okay?

662
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,590
Subak, you're so pretty.

663
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,860
No wonder you were in the Miss Korea pageant.

664
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:55,630
Got it? You better do as I say!

665
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,170
Did you hear that?

666
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,900
Don, you're the best!

667
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:09,760
She'll respect you as her aunt.

668
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,090
So you should act like her aunt, too.

669
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,670
She's an adult, so treat her as one.

670
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,400
You're her younger sister's friend.

671
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,700
What should I call her?
Miss Subak?

672
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,840
Miss Subak sounds so funny.

673
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,900
My princess, got it?
I'm leaving.

674
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,030
If you're done here, fold the laundry, aunt.

675
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,530
Didn't Don talk to you?

676
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,840
He did.

677
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,640
That's why I'm calling you aunt.

678
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:58,530
I'm not glad to see you.

679
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,300
But it's not your fault.

680
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,600
It's your aunt's fault.

681
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,060
How could she break up a family like that?

682
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,990
She didn't. You're mistaken.

683
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,200
Are you defending your aunt?

684
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,370
Go. I don't want to hear it.

685
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,140
Mother, here.

686
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,440
Take care of yourself and get well soon.

687
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,760
What is it?

688
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,690
Uh...

689
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:15,070
Can I learn how to operate an excavator?

690
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,870
An excavator? Why?

691
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,440
I need to make money.

692
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:24,070
I'm going to get our house back.

693
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,740
You're still too young to make money.

694
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,440
I'm not.

695
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,400
Wait until you graduate from high school.

696
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,990
If you still want to then, I'll teach you.

697
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,030
You're in 9th grade right now.

698
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,590
Nobody will hire you.

699
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,760
And you're too young to get a license.

700
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,900
I understand how you feel,

701
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,800
so you should continue to study.

702
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,470
And don't worry about your family.

703
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,670
Mr. Bong,

704
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,630
the toilet's clogged.

705
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,760
What?

706
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,670
Jungji, chow time.

707
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,860
Subak, help.

708
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,290
Huh?

709
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,700
Why? Is something wrong?

710
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,070
My stomach's been hurting...

711
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,240
Oh, this is bad.

712
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,100
What do we do?

713
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,090
This is bad.

714
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,990
Help me get up.

715
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:29,990
Oh, no!

716
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,400
The doctor said not to move.

717
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,360
What do we do?

718
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,740
Why can't she do it?

719
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,840
Why can't she look after her own mom?

720
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:50,260
You cleaned after her, so she should do it.

721
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,200
Hobak, can you come right now?

722
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,070
Why?

723
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,990
Mom needs to go.

724
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,900
Oh...

725
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,760
Then you should help her.

726
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:01,360
I can't!

727
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,760
I can't leave her like that!

728
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,760
Oh, this is crazy.

729
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,860
Oh, boy...

730
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,400
Okay.

731
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,800
I'll be right back.

732
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,970
Okay.

733
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,730
Anggeum, are you sleeping?

734
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,500
Please leave.

735
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,530
The rice is so good. Try it.

736
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,490
I said leave.

737
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,630
What's that smell?

738
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,190
Oh, Jungji, did you go poo poo?

739
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,340
I said leave!

740
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,490
Just hold on.

741
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,900
Jungji, let me check your diaper.

742
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,490
Didn't I tell you to leave. Leave!

743
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,190
It's clean.

744
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,400
Then what's this smell?

745
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,670
Get out!

746
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,700
Subak.

747
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,040
Go in.

748
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,340
- Did you boil some water?
- Yes, I did.

749
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,260
You need a towel, right?

750
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,740
Oh, this is horrible!

751
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,500
Hobak, hurry, hurry!

752
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,440
Mom,

753
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,800
let me see you.

754
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,490
Oh, this is so sad.

755
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,990
This is so horrible.

756
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,190
It's okay. I'm your daughter.

757
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,400
Oh...

758
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,860
I can't believe this.

759
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,960
All patients are the same.

760
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,270
Go to the hospital and see for yourself.

761
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,260
You're a patient, so don't be embarrassed.

762
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,840
No one can live without pooing.

763
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,530
Hobak, water. Ugh...

764
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,460
Ugh...

765
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,860
You must relax.

766
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,460
I told you to be careful.

767
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,240
The fetus isn't very healthy,

768
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,470
so don't get stressed out or work too hard.

769
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,740
You have to take time off.

770
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,770
Do you have stomach trouble?

771
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,690
That's because you haven't eaten all day.

772
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,270
I thought I wouldn't get morning sickness.

773
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,400
How is your mother?

774
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,570
She can't move.

775
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,070
That must be hard on you.

776
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,860
Hi.

777
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,990
It's me.

778
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,090
Minjung, welcome.

779
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,440
You must be busy.

780
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,860
I wanted to check on you.

781
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,360
I wish I were dead.

782
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,360
It's like prison.

783
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:37,900
Mom, lunch.

784
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,740
Minjung, did you eat lunch?

785
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,940
Not yet...

786
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:45,840
Subak, get Minjung some lunch. Hurry.

787
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:49,240
- It's okay.
- It's not. Hurry.

788
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:58,530
Minjung, I'm sorry.

789
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,670
What Subak did,

790
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,440
I know nothing can make up for that.

791
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:07,260
It's my fault. Can you please...

792
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,900
I don't want to talk about it.

793
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,670
I hope you get well soon.

794
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,860
You got hurt because of me and I'm sorry.

795
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,030
Goodbye.

796
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,400
Oh...

797
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,240
Don't do it.

798
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,100
It's done. Stay and eat.

799
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,730
Jangbi, let's go.

800
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,840
Let me finish this up.

801
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:47,340
Who did you go drinking with last night?

802
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,760
Somebody.

803
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,470
A woman?

804
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,340
I haven't been dating for a while now.

805
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,940
I met a friend.

806
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,030
Which friend?

807
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,170
Gwangbak's father?

808
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,340
Yes.

809
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:02,370
Things aren't working out for him.

810
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,860
What do you mean?

811
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:07,460
Should I tell you or not?

812
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,600
I think you should know.

813
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,840
You,

814
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,240
what did you do with the holiday bonus?

815
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,270
Excuse me?

816
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,190
The holiday bonus Sangnam gave you.

817
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,800
Did you spend it or put it in the bank?

818
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,370
He got a bonus?

819
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,230
I don't know anything about it, father.

820
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,700
You don't?

821
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:42,940
He didn't give it to you?

822
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,760
Father, you're home?

823
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,870
Come with me.

824
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,840
What is it?

825
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:51,840
The bonus.

826
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,340
What are you doing?

827
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,490
Okay!

828
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,090
Did you know?

829
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,460
About what?

830
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,570
About Gwangbak's family losing their house.

831
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:14,970
How did you find out?

832
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,740
Why didn't you tell me?

833
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,940
I didn't want to worry you.

834
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,990
What did you do with the holiday bonus?

835
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,990
Excuse me?

836
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,800
Did you give it to them?

837
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:26,530
Gwangbak's mother's sick, so I did.

838
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,940
I knew it.

839
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,170
You're sneaking money to them now?

840
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,630
It's not like that.

841
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,730
My mother in law got hurt, so I thought...

842
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,870
What did you say when you got married?

843
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,030
You said you won't give any money.

844
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,840
But this is a special circumstance.

845
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,740
Gwangbak's father quit his job, I heard.

846
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:47,900
What?

847
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,370
His family doesn't know but he's working as a security guard.

848
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:54,090
I shouldn't have let you marry her.

849
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:00,400
Really?

850
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:01,760
Shh.

851
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,670
Oh, poor father.

852
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,470
Subak, you didn't know?

853
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,270
I didn't.

854
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:13,230
He goes to work every morning,

855
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,100
so nobody knew.

856
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,130
I can see why he kept it a secret.

857
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,670
Poor father...

858
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,030
He's pretending to go to school.

859
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,460
I'm sure he feels miserable.

860
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,070
How sad? What do we do?

861
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,990
We can't cry.

862
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,460
Let's pretend we know nothing.

863
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,600
Let's wait until he tells us.

864
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,940
- Father.
- Father.

865
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,400
What are you doing out here?

866
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,990
We were waiting for you.

867
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,590
Father, you must be tired.

868
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,190
He's not! He sits all day at school.

869
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:54,470
Right. All he does is scold the bad students.

870
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,970
Or is it bad teachers?

871
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,300
Gwangbak, why are you here?

872
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,070
I came to check on mom.

873
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,670
You shouldn't come here so often.

874
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,840
Hobak, thank you.
You must be busy.

875
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:11,140
It's okay.

876
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,260
Father, I've boiled some water. Go wash up.

877
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,090
Okay.

878
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,940
Father, I should go.

879
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,700
- I'm leaving.
- Okay.

880
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:19,840
Hobak, thank you.

881
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,140
- Don't worry about it.
- Bye, father.

882
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,760
- Be careful.
- Okay.

883
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:23,960
Go.

884
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,100
Father, let's go in.

885
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,600
Don't.

886
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,960
I didn't boil that for you.

887
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,470
Let me use some.

888
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,540
Then you should boil your own water.

889
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,760
You're so mean!

890
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:44,170
I have a bad temper.

891
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,800
So I'm mean to those who deserve it.

892
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:50,340
You act like you're the queen of this house,

893
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,490
but I won't let you get away with that.

894
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,940
Oh, my!

895
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:59,030
So? Why don't you go tell grandmother?

896
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,070
Is there some hot water?
Mom needs a bath.

897
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,870
- Use this.
- Okay.

898
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:08,770
Subak, I'll get you for this!

899
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,670
I was nice because I felt sorry for you!

900
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:18,640
Did you hear?
She's driving me mad.

901
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,330
Even she is being disrespectful.

902
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,340
Did Minjung drop by?

903
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:28,860
He felt badly, so he came to check on mom.

904
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,060
What did he say?

905
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:36,440
He won't talk to me.
He won't even look at me.

906
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,870
Why don't you go see her, then?

907
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:46,960
Talk to her, woman to woman,

908
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,940
and tell her how you feel. Who knows?

909
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:51,990
You have two kids.

910
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,260
Oh!

911
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,360
Cold.

912
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:31,970
What's that?

913
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,100
A chair.

914
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,900
I found it at the recycling bin. It's like new.

915
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:37,900
Where are you going with that?

916
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,340
Hobak's parent's house.

917
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,900
I'm bringing this for her mom.

918
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,940
I think this could help her sit up.

919
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:45,240
As if she'd appreciate it!

920
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,340
You closed the shop already?

921
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:50,400
I'm going to get Yeongdal at the sauna.

922
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:51,740
I'll be back.

923
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,540
I wish you took such good care of me, too!

924
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,990
I'll find something nicer for you later.

925
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,600
Oh, mom, this is really comfortable.

926
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,530
When your back feels better, you can sit here.

927
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:09,670
Did you find it somewhere?

928
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,900
Yes, at my apartment complex.

929
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,800
I thought you could use it.

930
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,260
Good for you.

931
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:20,460
Now you'll rummage through all trash cans.

932
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,040
I'm not using that.

933
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,260
Who knows where it came from?

934
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:26,860
But it's clean.

935
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:29,900
It's better to sit on this than the floor.

936
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:31,490
Of course. Let me sit.

937
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,560
Oh, this is nice!

938
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,640
It's awesome, mother.

939
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,170
Then you should take it.

940
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,340
But his back is fine.

941
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:47,490
Too fine. That's how the baby...

942
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:51,900
You were made for each other.

943
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:55,200
Why couldn't you buy me a new one?

944
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:58,600
I don't want things people threw out.

945
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,090
Wash the blankets before you go.

946
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,290
Make some side dishes, give Jungji a bath,

947
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:05,370
and make dinner for your father.

948
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,190
Mother, you should tell Subak to...

949
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,490
Okay, mom.

950
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,340
Where's Subak? 
I didn't see her.

951
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:15,170
She had to go somewhere.

952
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,490
Thank you for coming.

953
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:31,090
I came here to beg.

954
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,560
Ms. Oh,

955
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:36,640
can you please give him back to me?

956
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:39,870
I'm so sorry.

957
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:45,190
I acted like that because I was cornered.

958
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,630
I can't live without Minjung.

959
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,790
I was stupid before,

960
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:55,700
so I didn't know how important he was.

961
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:03,470
But now that I've lost him, I know.

962
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,440
I want to start again with him.

963
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:12,630
You know he won't abandon his kids.

964
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,960
You're a woman, too...

965
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:18,440
Can you please be more understanding?

966
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,470
I'm sorry.

967
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:26,530
There's a reason why I can't back down.

968
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,100
What reason?

969
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,490
But you have nothing on him.

970
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,440
I have two kids.

971
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:37,470
What reason could top that?

972
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,240
I'm begging you.

973
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,000
I'm so sorry.

974
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,730
I was bad to Minjung,

975
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,870
and I was bad to you.

976
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:52,560
I'll be grateful for the rest of my life.

977
00:53:55,350 --> 00:54:00,940
I came here tonight to let you know where I stand.

978
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,900
Please don't call me anymore.

979
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:09,340
And please know that I have a good reason.

980
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:10,470
Goodbye.

981
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,070
Ms. Oh, Ms. Oh!

982
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,240
Ms. Oh...

983
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,670
Mom.

984
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,570
It's cold. Why are you out here?

985
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,600
I was waiting for you with Mr. Ko.

986
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,090
Where were you?

987
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,030
Out.

988
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,570
I met someone.

989
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,340
Mom, something's fishy.

990
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,530
I know.

991
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,230
Then call the police, why don't you!

992
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,270
Let's go in.

993
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:48,130
Let's go in. It's cold.

994
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,900
Oh, man!

995
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,800
The more the think about it, the angrier I get.

996
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:56,740
Why do you have to do everything?

997
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,600
Who else could do it?

998
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,190
Subak!

999
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:03,540
Let her favorite daughter take care of her.

1000
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,190
Why should you do it?

1001
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,040
What has your mother done for you?

1002
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,460
Why do you have to clean up after her?

1003
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,970
This is nuts.

1004
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,470
You have no feelings?

1005
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,670
Oh, I don't. That's why I live with you.

1006
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,090
You...

1007
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:21,360
Your mother is shameless. And Subak, too.

1008
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,440
What have they done for you? Nothing!

1009
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:25,400
Subak can't do it alone.

1010
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,200
She has to raise the kids and run the house.

1011
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:30,700
She's gotten better.

1012
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:33,370
She couldn't even wash her own undies before.

1013
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,260
Unbelievable.

1014
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:36,840
I talked to the director.

1015
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:39,740
I'm taking the afternoons off for my mom.

1016
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,340
But you're pregnant.

1017
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:43,030
You didn't tell her that?

1018
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,690
What for?

1019
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,140
- Tell her.
- Stop it.

1020
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,440
Should I tell her?

1021
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:48,970
It'll only be a few weeks.

1022
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,470
She says I make her feel comfortable.

1023
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,540
Only when she needs help, right?

1024
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,460
When she's fine, she turns to Subak,

1025
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,770
but when she needs help, she turns to you!

1026
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,730
I don't believe this.

1027
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,500
That's your problem.

1028
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,760
You think you're the only one who can help.

1029
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:05,960
The Earth can rotate fine without you.

1030
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,500
You think it would stop if you weren't here?

1031
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,460
I did think it would stop.

1032
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,700
I can't believe you're laughing.

1033
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,570
I'm going nuts here.

1034
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,760
Nothing better happen to you, okay?

1035
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:20,360
What's gotten into you?

1036
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,690
I can't believe you're worried about me.

1037
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,400
Oh, I feel chilly.

1038
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:26,470
Get me another blanket.

1039
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,530
Aren't you catching a cold?

1040
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,990
I don't know.

1041
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,460
This is bad.
You can't even take medicine.

1042
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,170
Oh, now I hate Subak!

1043
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,700
Ask anyone.

1044
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,040
Why would you have to go there and

1045
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,860
do all the work when your mom never loved you?

1046
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,530
Subak's funny.

1047
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:53,030
Why can't she clean her dear mom's poop?

1048
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,190
You shouldn't go there.

1049
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,970
Let them take care of themselves.

1050
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,940
Who cares if she poos on herself?

1051
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:59,360
Don't be.

1052
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:02,490
Be nice if you want a pretty baby.

1053
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,840
Don't let anything happen to the baby, okay?

1054
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:06,200
This is nuts.

1055
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,840
Where is it?

1056
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,600
Father, are you looking for something?

1057
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,460
Yes. I don't see any hallabong oranges.

1058
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,240
You ate the last one a few days ago.

1059
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,540
I did?

1060
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:21,460
I think some side dishes are missing, too.

1061
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,570
Your aunt's absence is showing.

1062
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:27,870
Did you take them to your parents?

1063
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:29,090
Excuse me?

1064
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,190
If you didn't, forget it.

1065
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:41,940
Oh, my! Bong!

1066
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,760
Where are you coming from/

1067
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:49,460
Mother wanted some roasted sweet potatoes.

1068
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,940
How are you, Mrs. Park?

1069
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,970
Not good.

1070
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,770
Please tell her to stop bothering Yeongdal.

1071
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,530
I mean your eldest daughter.

1072
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,070
I almost went to beat her up.

1073
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,100
She won't let Yeongdal use hot water,

1074
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,360
so I had to take her to the sauna.

1075
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:07,440
I'll talk to Subak.

1076
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,400
Mom, later.

1077
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:12,440
When later? I should say it now.

1078
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:15,170
How can she make Yeongdal work when she's pregnant?

1079
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,800
What if something goes wrong?

1080
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:20,740
She's in no place to act that way!

1081
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:24,330
She lost the house, got divorced because she had an affair...

1082
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,170
What did you just say?

1083
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,840
Oh, mom!

1084
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:33,600
It's not like I made that up.

1085
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,170
Dad, you're home.

1086
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,900
Did you have an affair?

1087
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:45,860
That's why he divorced you?

1088
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:47,900
Father!

1089
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:54,100
- Oh, no!
- Let's go.

1090
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,130
- Father! Father!
- Come with me.

1091
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,760
Father!

1092
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,900
Father.

1093
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:08,570
I'm sorry.

1094
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,940
I'm really sorry.

1095
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,590
Get on your knees! Right now!

1096
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,560
What are you doing?

1097
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:24,760
Hurry!

1098
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,730
Beg him for forgiveness.

1099
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:36,100
Beg for forgiveness in front of me.

1100
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:42,470
I'm sorry, Minjung.

1101
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:47,590
Please forgive me.

1102
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,860
I'm sorry.

1103
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:02,630
I did a bad job raising her.

1104
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,670
Everything is my fault.

1105
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,300
I'm begging you to forgive me.

1106
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,090
Don't do this. You can't do this.

1107
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,190
No, this is my fault.

1108
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,740
Don't do this, please!

1109
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:26,400
When you were getting divorced,

1110
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:30,200
I suspected it was Subak's fault,

1111
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,570
but I never thought it could be that.

1112
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,530
We deceived you when you got married.

1113
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:44,740
At that time, I was conflicted.

1114
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:51,470
Should I tell you or keep my mouth shut?

1115
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,670
I made a cowardly choice.

1116
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:00,300
I prayed you'd never find out,

1117
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:03,600
and when time passed, I forgot about it.

1118
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,760
This is the kind of person I am.

1119
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:11,990
I'm ashamed to face you and the world.

1120
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:17,170
I can't believe I was a vice principal...

1121
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,570
Please forgive my idiot daughter.

1122
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,240
Do it for me, please.

1124
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,240
You were caught cheating on your husband!

1125
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,140
You're driving me crazy!

1126
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,360
You think it's easy to deal with you?

1127
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,760
Excuse me, there!

1128
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:33,070
How do you know if he's a good man?

1129
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,530
Please take pity on me.

1130
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:36,860
I'll be good to you!

1131
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,170
- You came.
- I heard you were sick.

1132
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,260
Thank you for coming.

1133
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:41,840
How can you blame my aunt for everything?

1134
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,100
How can you say that?

1135
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,260
Why didn't you come home?

1136
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:45,340
I worked until morning.

1137
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:46,640
I didn't know you could lie.

1138
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,790
This is all your fault!

1139
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:49,670
Let's talk outside.

1140
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,700
Let go of me!

1141
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,370
Divorce my son!

1142
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:54,670
Ouch, oh, Sedal!
