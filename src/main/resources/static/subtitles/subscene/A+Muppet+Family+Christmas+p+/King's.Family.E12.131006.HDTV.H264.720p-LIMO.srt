2
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,520
From now on call me "honey."

3
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,390
Honey?

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,050
Of course.

5
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,840
You want us to be lovers.

6
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,490
You want us to be lovers.

7
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,810
We can't be too formal if we're lovers.

8
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,140
If you don't like it, forget about it.

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,640
Fine.

10
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,280
I've never called anyone "honey" before.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,890
I never had anyone call me that either.

12
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,390
I thought you were married.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,050
She's older.

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,780
She's older?

15
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,720
How did you meet?
I bet it was interesting.

16
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,520
It wasn't interesting at all.

17
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,420
My life became a mess when I met her.

18
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,690
Outside that is "no comment."

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,950
Tell me. What kind of lover will you be?

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,610
You must have something in mind.

21
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,440
I want to try everything lovers do.

22
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,990
Let's call it a dating game.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,920
By everything, you mean...

24
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,550
Don't get ahead of yourself.

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,710
What do people do on dates?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,020
They eat, drink coffee, and see a movie.

27
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,820
They drink coffee, eat, and see a movie.

28
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,390
They see a movie, eat, and drink coffee.

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,080
They see a movie, drink coffee, and eat.

30
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,990
And sometimes they go on a trip.

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,990
Go to good restaurants, see movies,

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,640
go to the theme park, drink draft beer,

33
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,140
and take a train to somewhere.

34
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,840
That's what I want to do.

35
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,410
I went to the States when I was 15.

36
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,610
I couldn't do anything a young girl does.

37
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,780
Including dating.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,790
I lived as my dad's little puppet.

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,550
I had no freedom.

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,850
I lived like a princess under my dad's watch.

41
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,820
With no friends.

42
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,640
How sad.

43
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,990
Everyone has heartbreaking stories to tell.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,920
I have mine, you have yours.

45
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,310
I got hooked by an older woman when I was young and look where it got me.

46
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,120
We have a lot of similarities.

47
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,950
There's only one thing different.

48
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,220
You're loaded, I'm not.

49
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,280
But don't get caught.

50
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,610
Women have a sixth sense.

51
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,640
I can't stand things getting messy.

52
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,210
Don't worry.

53
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,640
My wife's so dense, she has no idea.

54
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,240
She doesn't even know you're a woman.

55
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,340
She doesn't even know she's one.

56
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,580
You didn't tell her?

57
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,180
She didn't ask.

58
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,320
[Ugly Pumpkin]

59
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,250
Who is it?

60
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,350
Don't worry about it.

61
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,580
Call me "honey."

62
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,320
Hey!

63
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,990
Honey?

64
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,790
Again.

65
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,050
Honey.

66
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,850
Again.

67
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,390
Honey!

68
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,490
Again.

69
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,090
Honey!

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,040
This is nuts!

71
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,250
How can she say it like that?

72
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,640
In front of everyone, the kids, too.

73
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,490
That's how my mom talks.
You know that.

74
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,550
My parents never talked to me like that.

75
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,940
She's going to get worse.

76
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,080
Can you talk to her?

77
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,680
You can't live here if you react like that.

78
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,790
You can't be picky when things are this bad.

79
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,380
Who is it?

80
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,010
Gwangbak? Uncle?

81
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,420
That darn cat!

82
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,090
It's a cat?

83
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,720
Yes, I think so.

84
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,050
But it meows weird.

85
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,220
Oh, Mr. Ko.

86
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,240
Yes.

87
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,380
I'm sorry to be calling so late.

88
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,310
Mr. Wang, let me just say one thing.

89
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,080
Please take good care of my son.

90
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,490
I should thank you.

91
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,680
They moved in today.

92
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,790
I won't give him a hard time, so don't worry.

93
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,220
Good night, Mr. Ko.

94
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,590
Yes.

95
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,290
Let's talk.

96
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,790
I need to sleep.

97
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,180
How can you sleep?

98
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,050
I have to.
I have to go to work early.

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,490
You have no pride?
You have no shame?

100
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,950
You don't feel upset about Sedal?

101
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,740
Stop that.

102
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,450
Why should I stop this?

103
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,820
You don't care about how others feel!

104
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,050
You don't care if your wife is going nuts,

105
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,340
as long as you feel comfortable.

106
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,380
Yes, I feel comfortable.

107
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,590
Living with my in laws is very comfortable!

108
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,820
Why are you yelling at me?

109
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,850
You think I'm happy?

110
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,490
I'm trying to convince myself this is better than the basement efficiency,

111
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,540
that I can working without worrying about you,
so how can you start nagging again?

112
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,810
Why can't Sedal have his day?

113
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,350
It looks like he's finally doing well,

114
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,850
so why can't you be happy for him?

115
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,820
Are you a saint?

116
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,450
You might be able to do that,
but it's driving me crazy!

117
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,710
Don't go crazy.
Hold on for just 3 years.

118
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,290
Let's depend on your father to feed us.

119
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,580
I can get back on my feet in 3 years.

120
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,010
There you go again!

121
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,010
People these days don't starve to death!

122
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,510
Getting fed isn't the most important thing!

123
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,040
This is what I hate about you!

124
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,110
You felt nothing watching Sedal?

125
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,540
Even Hobak is acting like she's better than us, and you don't feel upset?

126
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,210
How can you not get upset?

127
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,450
You can't let everything bother you.

128
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,420
Don't pay attention to it.

129
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,740
Pretend you didn't hear or see it.

130
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,820
Why would I do that?

131
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,920
Because I'm living with your parents!

132
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,040
So that's what I'm going to do.

133
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,110
Let me sleep! Please!

134
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,410
I need to sleep to go to work tomorrow!

135
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,240
Leave them alone.

136
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,590
I didn't know what noise complaint meant,

137
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,740
but it's not just apartments who have it.

138
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,410
He knows you and I are downstairs,
so how can he yell like that?

139
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,880
Our daughter's voice is louder.

140
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,350
He made her cry!

141
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,550
Why should...

142
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,140
Hey!

143
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,440
Oh.

144
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,110
Why don't you go up?
She's crying.

145
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,280
She's crying because she's angry.

146
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,410
Talk to Subak.

147
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,380
Tell her not to nag Minjung.

148
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,590
She has good reasons for nagging him!

149
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,050
He deserves every bit of it.

150
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,040
They settled down now.

151
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,790
You must act like an adult from now on.

152
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,880
If he were my son,
I wouldn't have done it.

153
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,940
I did it because it's Subak,

154
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,240
so be nice to Minjung.

155
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,690
Imagine Subak living with her in laws.

156
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,640
Why are you laughing?

157
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,180
Don't laugh in the middle of the night.

158
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,950
It's Sedal.

159
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,610
My Sedal made me laugh for the first time.

160
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,490
How could you transfer to Sedal so quickly?

161
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,040
He's not a bus.
I didn't transfer.

162
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,910
You used to go my Minjung, my Minjung,

163
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,240
and now it's my Sedal, my Sedal?

164
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,320
What would mother say?

165
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,790
She wouldn't say anything.

166
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,410
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo...

167
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,940
Why you little!

168
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,990
What?

169
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,380
Mother would've said that.

170
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,780
I know how to impersonate her, too.

171
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,610
Why are you home so late?

172
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,410
Be quiet.

173
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,510
Do you know what money tastes like?

174
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,910
The taste of money, the power of money.

175
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,840
I went from just Sedal to "my Sedal" tonight.

176
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,490
This is the power of money.
Did you know?

177
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,040
Stop talking nonsense and go to bed.

178
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,550
You wouldn't know anything.

179
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,040
You saw nothing, heard nothing.

180
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,240
I feel sorry for you.

181
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,140
Huh?

182
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,220
What are you doing?
Go to bed.

183
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,920
The moon is so bright.

184
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,010
What?
Did the moon say something to you?

185
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,810
No way.

186
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,790
I feel bad for you for waking up in the middle of the night, sitting out here.

187
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,240
And I feel bad for you who can't sleep.

188
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,350
Are you upset because of Goof-off?

189
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,440
You must be.

190
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,010
You were inseparable, but now he has a job.

191
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,210
Now you have to suck up to your friend.

192
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,740
Stop that.

193
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,510
Why you little!

194
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,640
He married Hobak by hanging out with you.

195
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,440
So why can't you do the same?

196
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,790
Oh, mom! Stop that.

197
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,340
I'm furious as I am.

198
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,010
You're furious?

199
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,740
I'm going crazy here.

200
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,090
Oh, I should just die.

201
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,010
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

202
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,680
Mother, did you sleep well?

203
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,240
No, I didn't.

204
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,550
Your fighting kept me up.

205
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,240
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:54,310
If your wife is mad, you should try to make her feel better, not get upset!

207
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,040
You should learn to be careful here.

208
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,210
You have no respect for me or my husband.

209
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,090
Oh, and those cats!

210
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,920
What are you doing?

211
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,450
I'm looking for water.

212
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,690
You can't find water?

213
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,610
It's right here!

214
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,950
Come with me.

215
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,780
Take this outside.

216
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,180
We have to take out the recyclables today.

217
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,590
Okay.

218
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,090
You can't even lift that?

219
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,780
I'll take it out, mother.
Go inside.

220
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,580
And take the trash outside, too.

221
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,990
Okay.

222
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,680
Good morning.

223
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,950
Shouldn't you be heading out?

224
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,850
After I take these out.

225
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,320
- Are you exercising?
- Yes.

226
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,820
Did you have breakfast?

227
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,190
I'll get something at work.

228
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,210
Why didn't you make breakfast early?

229
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,190
Why?

230
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,920
Minjung went to work on an empty stomach.

231
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,040
You can't work without having breakfast.

232
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,490
You want me to make him breakfast?

233
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,280
I'm already tired of doing it for you.

234
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,320
Why should I get up earlier to make breakfast for my son in law?

235
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,240
I can't believe you just said that.

236
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,010
I wasn't telling you to do it.

237
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,720
I'm asking you to make Subak do it.

238
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,320
Go wake her up.

239
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,110
She can't get up early in the morning.

240
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,110
What?

241
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,640
He'll get something at work.

242
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,280
He won't starve.

243
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,880
People eat better when they work.

244
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,510
Don't tell him to do chores.

245
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,680
He goes to work really early.

246
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,240
Did Minjung say something?

247
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,240
You know he didn't.

248
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,220
Put yourself in his shoes.

249
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,740
If he was your son, would you do the same?

250
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,810
If he wants to live here,
he must help out.

251
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,840
He can't act like he's a guest.

252
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:42,680
Neither you nor uncle will do it,
so Minjung has to. Don't you agree?

253
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,920
My son Minjung,

254
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,740
forgive your father for

255
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,190
not being able to help you out more.

256
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:23,280
Picturing you use this A-frame

257
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,990
breaks my heart.

258
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,450
I raised you as my precious son,

259
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,780
but I feel like I've put

260
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,310
the heaviest load on your shoulders.

261
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,340
But son,

262
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,910
if you thought of what happened as a chance,

263
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,620
not as hardship, it'll be easier to handle.

264
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,750
Every father in the world did so.

265
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,310
Son,

266
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,340
I hope one day you'll be able to

267
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,410
get rid of this A-frame.

268
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,320
Let's see, a good restaurant.

269
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,610
Let's make it really amazing.

270
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,690
It's me. Come. I found a good restaurant.

271
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,650
Okay.

272
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,340
Make sure you look pretty.

273
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,680
Oppa Gangnam style.

274
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,350
I don't deal with ugliness.

275
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,810
I already have an ugly one at home.

276
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,850
Here.

277
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,410
What are you doing?
I want a bite.

278
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,510
Here.

279
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,920
Oh, can't you see I have a big mouth?

280
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,350
This piece is way too small.

281
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,340
Mmm, now we're talking.

282
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,210
Good job.

283
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,950
You dig me, don't you?
Say, "Honey!"

284
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,390
Honey!

285
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,780
I'm taking you to a good restaurant.

286
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,780
Okay?

287
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,240
Okay.

288
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,280
Just do as I say.

289
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,920
You'll become happy.

290
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,590
I'm great, right?

291
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,140
Hello.

292
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,090
Sit down.

293
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,740
Lovers wipe chairs for each other?

294
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,110
I'm doing it because I'm a great guy.

295
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,420
- What is it?
- Did you...

296
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,240
steal money from your director?

297
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,580
What?

298
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,220
Oh well.

299
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,310
You don't have the guts.

300
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,680
Whatever you're doing right now, can you

301
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,540
ask your director to let me do it, too?

302
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,880
Loser, I'll see you later.
Drinks on me.

303
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,190
Who was it?

304
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,590
It was Loser.

305
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,220
He thinks he and I are the same. Ugh.

306
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,720
Would you like to come over to my house?

307
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,220
What did I do?

308
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,650
Look what you did to me.

309
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,850
You drove my friends away.

310
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,580
That girl is your friend?

311
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,720
A man and a woman can't be friends.

312
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,810
How many times do I have to tell you?

313
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,840
You're tiring me out right now.

314
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,780
So what are you saying?

315
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,420
Let's take some time off.

316
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:46,220
Do you want to break up with me?

317
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,420
I told you I'd let you do anything, right?

318
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,780
So you should let me have this one thing.

319
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,720
Don't you agree?
You're older than me.

320
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,040
You're four years older,

321
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,740
so you should let me have this.

322
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,340
Am I wrong?

323
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,540
Forget about it.

324
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,340
Why should we?

325
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,440
Do you understand what I said?
Answer me.

326
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,990
I understand.

327
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,420
Are you upset?

328
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,420
I don't know.

329
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,050
Don't be upset.
I'll be better to you.

330
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,720
Here.

331
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,040
Here.

332
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,450
You can be so cute.

333
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,390
This is why I can't break up with you.

334
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,050
How adorable.

335
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,350
Daebak!

336
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,040
What are you doing?

337
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,510
Nothing.

338
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,720
We had a fight and made up.

339
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,890
You guys fight?

340
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,850
I wouldn't. She's a kid.

341
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,610
How could you even think that?

342
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,180
Your friend has a problem again?

343
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,740
Daebak's listening.
Let's talk later.

344
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,950
He wouldn't know what we're talking about.

345
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,990
My friend thinks he's a player.

346
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,810
He's an expert at playing games.

347
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,740
He makes her feel really anxious,

348
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,950
not calling her,

349
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,780
and he's seeing other women.

350
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,310
He is a player.

351
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,580
He is.

352
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:37,540
You want to know how to make a player yours/

353
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,690
Yes. How do you do that?

354
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,240
You have to label him as yours.

355
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,280
Yes?

356
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,550
Are you busy?

357
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,650
How's your writing coming.

358
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,220
Not very well.

359
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,610
You need experience to be a writer.

360
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:15,220
You should travel, meet people, meet men.

361
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,150
Are you seeing anyone?

362
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,490
Can I introduce someone to you?

363
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,340
Is it formal?

364
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,040
Don't think of it as that.

365
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,720
Think of it as a blind date.

366
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,920
I'm not interested.
I have work to do.

367
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,190
Next time, father.

368
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,120
I can't afford to.
I don't even have a job.

369
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,110
I really missed Korean food.

370
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,750
They have Korean restaurants in China.

371
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,420
I couldn't go because I was on business.

372
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,650
This hit the spot.

373
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,450
And now for the present.

374
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,080
I told you not to buy me anything.

375
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,990
Present.

376
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,080
You told me to come back safely.

377
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,310
Right.

378
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,240
I do what I'm told.

379
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,390
If you asked for a brand name handbag,

380
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,720
I would've gotten one.

381
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,280
Was that a mistake?

382
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,110
Oh, no.

383
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,050
Thank you for coming back safely.

384
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,310
Jangbi, it's me.

385
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,040
My daughter's not interested in marriage.

386
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,450
They won't get married now!

387
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,240
Tell her to meet him first and decide.

388
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,490
She quit her job to become a writer,

389
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,650
so she's just too preoccupied.

390
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,490
I guess it's not meant to be.

391
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,990
But he's a really nice man.

392
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,120
But what can we do?
She's not interested.

393
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,740
Okay.

394
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,450
She's not interested?

395
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,990
But I was so excited.
How disappointing.

396
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,220
Father!

397
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,010
You must be tired.
How about dinner?

398
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,220
I ate.

399
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,580
Miho, how were things?

400
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,740
Sangnam.

401
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,390
Okay.

402
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,040
You're back.

403
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,610
Yes.

404
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,090
This is for you, Miho.

405
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,640
Wow.

406
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,650
This is for you, aunt.

407
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,550
You didn't have to.
You must have been busy.

408
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,910
It's a Chinese silk scarf.
Take a look.

409
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,190
- It's pretty.
- Isn't it?

410
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,950
I thought it would look good on you.

411
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,490
This one's for you, father.

412
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,650
It is?

413
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,790
How do I look?

414
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,190
You look like a movie star.

415
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,920
Once I dreamt of becoming an actor.

416
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,240
Whatever. Father, what about my gift?

417
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,190
Well, she said no.

418
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,620
She turned me down?

419
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,990
She's not ready to meet a man.

420
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,950
She must be busy.

421
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,510
Whoever she is, it's her loss.

422
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,190
She can't be that busy.

423
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,950
She must have time to date.

424
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,780
She doesn't know what she's missing

425
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,140
because she hasn't met you.

426
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,590
I guess it's not meant to be.

427
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,740
How disappointing!

428
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,990
What?

429
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,780
Why you little...

430
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,840
He finally came back from China.

431
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,140
He gave me the best gift.

432
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,420
I don't think I can sleep tonight.

433
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,040
Where are you?

434
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,280
Home.

435
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,240
I saw the picture.
What was the gift?

436
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,840
I went to the airport to greet him.

437
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,180
You did?

438
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,890
Did he ask you or you just went?

439
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,010
He asked me.

440
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,150
We had dinner and I got my gift.

441
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,080
Did he propose to you?

442
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,510
Propose?

443
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,310
You said he'll propose after his trip!

444
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,420
Women these days are pathetic.

445
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,350
They put too much meaning into the proposal.

446
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,110
And they don't even know what it means.

447
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,240
They complain about their husbands not
proposing even after they're married.

448
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,740
They're totally nuts.

449
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,110
How did they get married in the first place?

450
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,050
Anyway, did he or didn't he?

451
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,410
It's a secret.

452
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,220
So he didn't!

453
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,490
It's a secret.

454
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,990
Hey!

455
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,080
Why are you screaming?

456
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,540
I'm just curious.

457
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,640
You're so impatient.

458
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,350
If it happens, I'll tell you first.

459
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,990
No thanks! I don't what to know!

460
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,040
She's green with envy!

461
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,950
I need to crush that woman.

462
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,780
You don't like being proposed to?

463
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,310
But everyone does it.

464
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,610
I said that to annoy her.

465
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,920
She was really upset the other night.

466
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,740
I'm sure she never had a real boyfriend.

467
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,490
She isn't much to look at.

468
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,120
Why isn't she getting surgery?

469
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:25,190
Mom, I'm going to get the most romantic

470
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,320
proposal and post it all over online.

471
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,410
Even President Obama will see it.

472
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,920
Even Obama?

473
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,450
He's only a few steps away.

474
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,810
People are so weird these days.

475
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,380
They don't need to tell everyone,

476
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,890
so why do they advertise everything?

477
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,450
Didn't he bring you a gift?

478
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,420
No. He said he would've, had I asked him.

479
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,950
He's all words.

480
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,190
How could he come empty handed?

481
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,490
I was a bit disappointed.

482
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,310
Why didn't you say something?

483
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,840
I didn't want to scare him off.

484
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,740
I made sure I didn't show my feelings.

485
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,310
What if he's rich but stingy?

486
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,240
He can't be.

487
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:07,780
I heard some rich people
don't know how to spend money.

488
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:13,890
I know someone who owned several buildings,
but never spent any money and just died.

489
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,150
His children fought over the inheritance.

490
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,240
Oh, no.

491
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,580
A man should know when to spend money.

492
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,490
If he keeps that up, break up with him.

493
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,040
You don't want a stingy man.

494
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,110
I'm home.

495
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,580
Where are the girls?

496
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,080
With mom.

497
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,390
We should sleep with them.

498
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,890
Can you do it?

499
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,550
Do you know how many times Jungji wakes up?

500
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,040
It must be hard for mother.

501
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,990
I think you should take care of them.

502
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,580
They girls like her more than they like me.

503
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,220
When can I see their faces, then?

504
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,650
I can't see them in the morning,

505
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,050
I can't see them when I get home.

506
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,780
You never cared about them before.

507
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,640
You were too busy with your company.

508
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,350
I saw them sleeping every night.

509
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,080
Have them sleep in this room from now on.

510
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,340
You have their pictures in your cell phone.

511
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,280
Don't be too picky.

512
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,220
Ugh, what is this?

513
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,890
I can't even pay to get this done anymore.

514
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,740
It's crazy.

515
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,620
I was in the Miss Korea pageant.

516
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,490
You have no time to miss the girls.

517
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,920
You should focus on making money so I can enjoy my life again.

518
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,190
Who's there?

519
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,890
Was it that cat again?

520
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,450
Maybe I should put out a trap.

521
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,220
Mother.

522
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,790
What are you doing?

523
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,450
I'm trying to make dinner.

524
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,120
You didn't have dinner?

525
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,680
I missed my timing.

526
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,380
I'll clean up.
Do go to bed.

527
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,390
You go to bed.

528
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,720
Instead of making a mess, try to help out.

529
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,740
Did you make that cat noise?

530
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,620
Excuse me?

531
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,520
It wasn't me.

532
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,820
It wasn't you?

533
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,740
The cat sounded just like you.

534
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,090
I heard it and I thought it was weird

535
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:25,220
because it sounded very much like me.

536
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,950
It came from behind the kitchen.

537
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,290
There are lots of stray cats these days.

538
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,090
I've seen them in every neighborhood.

539
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,890
They move around in packs.

540
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,450
All over the place.

541
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,850
Aunt, are you asleep?

542
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,180
No, I'm not.

543
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,580
What is it?
Are you hungry?

544
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:50,780
No. Did you see a yellow shirt in my bag?

545
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,720
I washed it. Why?

546
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,450
No, I thought I had left it in China.

547
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,490
Okay. Go back to bed.

548
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,720
Aunt.

549
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,220
Yes?

550
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,990
Were you crying?

551
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,280
No, I wasn't crying.

552
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,820
It's because you woke me up.

553
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,640
You must be exhausted. Got to bed.

554
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,410
Hello, grandmother.

555
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,890
You're Sedal's mom.
Where are you going?

556
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,540
I was coming to your house.

557
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,180
Why doesn't Anggeum come to the meetings?

558
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:36,080
Things at home are too complicated.

559
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,410
Should we be friends?

560
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,240
Excuse me?

561
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,690
Our sons are friends, so we should be, too.

562
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,220
You're right.

563
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,750
This is the butcher's daughter's wedding invitation.

564
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,390
My friend, please give this to Anggeum.

565
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,720
It'll cost you.

566
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,750
I could take you out.

567
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,810
I was just kidding.

568
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:01,010
We had a feast thanks to your son.

569
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:04,520
He brought a bunch of meat and fruits.

570
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,490
Who?

571
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,640
You have more than one son?

572
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,240
You mean Sedal?

573
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,580
Yes, mother.

574
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,680
I can't believe you.

575
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,610
Excuse me?

576
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,290
You controlled my son and changed him!

577
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,120
You only think of your parents?

578
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,620
I don't know what you're talking about.

579
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,020
Oh, I'm sure you do!

580
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,250
I know you two planned this!

581
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:43,920
Even if Sedal wanted to take care of your
parent's first, you should've told him no.

582
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,880
Didn't you learn any manners?

583
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,990
You're older than him so you should be more mature!

584
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,040
You should know who comes first.

585
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,620
I should come first!

586
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,080
You don't have any respect for me at all.

587
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,850
Is it because I don't have a husband?

588
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,350
Excuse me, mother, what are you talking...

589
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,420
Stop it!

590
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,490
Mother.

591
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,850
Sintong, Bangtong, dad's home.

592
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,220
- Oh, pizza!
- It's pizza!

593
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,520
Boys, shouldn't you say hi to me first?

594
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,790
Where did you get the money?

595
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,520
Eat, eat. Eating is living.

596
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,120
Don't plan anything for Sunday.

597
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,040
We're going to an amusement park.

598
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,040
Amusement park! Amusement park!

599
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,540
Yes! Yes!

600
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,120
Don't jump. They'll hear you downstairs.

601
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,650
Kids are supposed to jump. Don't nag.

602
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,340
Jump, jump.

603
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,720
No. I told you not to jump.

604
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:46,520
I'm walking on my toes.

605
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,850
We shouldn't have moved here.

606
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,620
Take that to your room.

607
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,320
You're on a roll.

608
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,640
Where did you get the money?

609
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,950
I got a bonus.

610
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,580
The director really likes me.

611
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,350
Don't waste it all.

612
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,650
It's a credit card.

613
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,220
I heard from Gwangbak.

614
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,990
You bought stuff for my parents?

615
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,140
It felt really good.

616
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,990
Wash up. Let's go to your mother's house.

617
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,590
Huh?

618
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,140
Honey, are you busy?
I had fun last night.

619
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,110
Let's go to an amusement park next time.

620
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:57,540
Mom, dad got a weird text.

621
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,040
Don't play with dad's phone.
Put it back.

622
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:02,640
Someone called dad "honey."

623
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,510
It's spam. Put it back.

624
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,250
Subak, after you moved in,
your mom and dad look peaceful.

625
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,820
I feel better.

626
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,150
Daebak, did you think about your dream?

627
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,280
Yes.

628
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,050
But there are so many things I want to do.

629
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,010
Someone became unemployed doing that.

630
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,250
What happened to your dream?

631
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,720
I'm working hard on it.

632
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,040
Your dream isn't important.

633
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:36,310
It's better to have a job everyone envies.

634
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,810
That may be right,

635
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,620
but I'm sad I never realized my dream.

636
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,790
And disappointed.

637
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,350
What was your dream?

638
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,120
You became a vice principal.
That's enough.

639
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,040
Was it to become the principal?

640
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,720
No.

641
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,490
I liked teaching,

642
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,640
and I feel proud about my job,

643
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,910
but I had a different dream.

644
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,410
What was it?

645
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,510
I'm not telling.

646
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:04,120
Tell us.

647
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,580
Don't laugh.

648
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,720
Singer.

649
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,410
What?

650
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,720
Singer?

651
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,040
Father, are you serious?

652
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,680
Incredible.

653
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:21,040
You get 20, 30 points at karaoke,

654
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,140
so how could you?

655
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,550
But that was my dream.

656
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:30,720
My father didn't like it, so I couldn't pursue it.

657
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,540
Oh, father, thank you.

658
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,490
If you had quit your job,

659
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,580
we would've been ruined.

660
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,140
Now I remember.

661
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:43,010
Your father beat you up because of that.

662
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,020
I remember something, too.

663
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,750
Was it when I gave birth to Daebak?

664
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,520
The hospital tried to call your father,

665
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,450
but he was nowhere to be found.

666
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,520
After I gave birth all alone,

667
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:00,590
he appeared at the hospital,

668
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:04,140
saying there was an emergency at school.

669
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:09,520
But later I found out that he was on that singing contest show.

670
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,790
He was?

671
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,420
Incredible.

672
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:21,120
I almost didn't find out, but mother told everyone that your father passed the first round.

673
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,720
So? What happened?

674
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,290
What do you think? He failed.

675
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,490
He failed.

676
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,680
Look.

677
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:18,640
Bastard. Sons are worthless.

678
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,340
I don't have a son.

679
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,750
Oh, am I your daughter, then.

680
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,920
Oh, who made Madam Park Salla mad?

681
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,240
Who was it? Who?

682
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,050
Forget it.

683
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:31,410
Your in laws did nothing for you!

684
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:36,390
They treat you like dirt,
and you bought them gifts?

685
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,790
And you forgot about your mom?

686
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,220
I didn't forget about you.

687
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,350
Bring them, hurry.

688
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:50,120
These are from the department store.

689
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,950
They're different from the local store ones.

690
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,040
And the beef is top grade domestic beef.

691
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,950
Have you even seen them?
Madam Park Salla?

692
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,540
Stuff yourself with this, thinking about me.

693
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,450
Where's Yeongdal?

694
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,250
She'll be home late.

695
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,510
I felt sad.

696
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,820
I felt like I had no son.

697
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,680
It was like they stole my son from me.

698
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:17,950
Look at Subak's husband.

699
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,040
When he was rich, he acted like their son!

700
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,950
Don't worry, mom.

701
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,810
My one and only love is you.

702
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,220
Trust me, okay?

703
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,310
I went there to show my mother in law that she can't be mean to me anymore.

704
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,220
You shouldn't have.

705
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,680
You should've come here first.

706
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,490
You're siding with me?

707
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,410
If Sintong and Bangtong did the same to me,

708
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,510
I'd be really disappointed too.

709
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,390
I'm glad you know.

710
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,890
Oh, mom, you were upset?

711
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,220
From now on, I'll put you first.

712
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:54,220
If you and her mom fell into the river,

713
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:59,010
I'd save you and watch her get carried away by the currents.

714
00:45:59,030 --> 00:45:59,890
Really?

715
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,850
Of course.

716
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:06,840
It'd be fun to watch her float down the river together!

717
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:11,080
You save your mom.

718
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:16,320
No, let her favorite Subak save her and you come with us.

719
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,140
Oh, my darling son.

720
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,810
Having luck at the beginning means nothing.

721
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,350
When it comes to life,
you must wait until the end.

722
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,040
All the luck Minjung had has come to you!

723
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,720
Absolutely!

724
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:36,580
Anyway, stick close to the director.

725
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:39,810
That's what I'm doing now.

726
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,950
Mom, you're all better now.

727
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:52,080
You must mark him as yours.

728
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:54,720
Your teeth.

729
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:55,990
I brushed them.

730
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,110
Your gift.

731
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,450
Oh,

732
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,350
thank you.

733
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,580
I'll think of you whenever I put it on.

734
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,580
You don't have to.

735
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,990
Whenever you put it on is a bit...

736
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,180
Will you buy another one when it runs out?

737
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,590
That's not hard,

738
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,620
but where did you learn that?

739
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,420
What do you mean?

740
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:34,140
It wasn't that bad.

741
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,080
You never dated, have you?

742
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,510
What do you mean?
How old do you think I am?

743
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:42,850
I've done everything other people do.

744
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:47,080
Alcohol works wonders in romance.

745
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,890
As a thank you for your gift,

746
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,250
I'll buy you dinner.

747
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,180
No, buy me a drink.

748
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,220
I can see you want to go drinking.

749
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,890
When men drink, they think all women are beautiful.

750
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,720
Have some beer.

751
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:30,490
Cheers.

752
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,390
But I have to drive.

753
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,450
You can call a designated driver service.

754
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,220
I'll pay for that.

755
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,180
Cheers.

756
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,310
Slow down.

757
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,290
No bottoms up?

758
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,820
I want to drink slowly.

759
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,910
You can't do that!
I drank all of mine.

760
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,410
Hurry.

761
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,040
Don't I look prettier than before?

762
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,540
No.

763
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,120
That's weird.

764
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,390
Hurry up and drink.

765
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,740
I knew you were impatient,

766
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,250
but I didn't think you'd drink like this.

767
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,840
Oh, I'm out of breath.

768
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,080
So? I look pretty, right?

769
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,450
No.

770
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,650
How much does he have to drink?

771
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,490
- Mom.
- Yes?

772
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,850
That grandfather's looking at you.

773
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,850
Why is he looking at me?

774
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,150
Because you're pretty.

775
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:10,450
No way.

776
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:14,220
We're walking in a line, so we look weird.

777
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,450
I'm too old to be pretty.

778
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,680
Did you like it when I said you're pretty?

779
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,040
He wasn't looking at you.

780
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:20,910
Hey!

781
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,840
Why you little!

782
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:25,350
Hey! Stop right there!
Why you little!

783
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,990
Oh, the apartment looks really nice.

784
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,180
This is our apartment.

785
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:31,410
Look.

786
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,610
Oh!

787
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:37,180
I went grocery shopping so bring something.

788
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,640
You go grocery shopping now?

789
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,220
I like spending money.

790
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:44,410
You worked so hard to buy an apartment.

791
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,840
Your dream came true.

792
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,150
Yes. I need to prepare for retirement now.

793
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,580
- Yes.
- Hobak,

794
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,490
can I go play with the boys?

795
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,040
Sure. Go to Sintong's room.

796
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,950
I'll bring you something to eat.

797
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,350
Grandpa, can I play with your phone?

798
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,890
Mine doesn't play any games.

799
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,780
Didn't you feel anything?

800
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,350
What do you mean?

801
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,350
Lonely old man.

802
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,390
How dare you! Ugh!

803
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,020
A man has to have a dream.

804
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,020
What are your dreams?

805
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,920
No answer?
That means you don't have any.

806
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,910
A dreamless life is like a cheese-less pizza.

807
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,240
If there's no cheese, it's not good.

808
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,020
I know.

809
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,520
So tell me.

810
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,320
- You first.
- You first.

811
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,720
Oh, uncle, I got it.

812
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:38,620
What is it?

813
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:39,850
Buying my own house.

814
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,450
Your dream is to buy a house?

815
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,250
Yes, I want that.
My mom did it, too.

816
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,220
Me! Me! I have a dream too.

817
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:48,410
- What is it?
- Lonely old man.

818
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,580
Ugh!

819
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,580
You want to be like your grandfather?

820
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:53,140
Pick something different.

821
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,010
Retirement planes?

822
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:59,750
Retirement plans.

823
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,320
What's that?

824
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,080
I don't know. Just pick it.

825
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,240
Mom said she's doing it.

826
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,820
All adults do it.

827
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,540
Then I want that. Retirement plan.

828
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:12,240
Fine. Sintong, yours is buying a house,

829
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,190
and Bangtong, yours is retirement plan.

830
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,510
You both have dreams now, okay?

831
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,050
So you must work hard for your dream.

832
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,990
- Okay?
- Yes, uncle.

833
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,220
Yes! Buying my own house.

834
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:25,580
Yes! Retirement plan.

835
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:28,410
Oh? But how should I work for it?

836
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,110
Really hard.

837
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,120
Cat noise?

838
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:38,810
Yes, he swore it wasn't him,
but the "meow, meow" sounded like him.

839
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,280
Why would he do that?
It's not attractive.

840
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,450
Why couldn't he just tell me what happened and apologize?

841
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,120
I should catch him in the act.

842
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,240
Bottoms up.

843
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,310
Men these days are cowards, right?

844
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,240
Why?

845
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,650
They're too scared to kiss.

846
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:23,140
They're afraid of sexual harassment.

847
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,720
Funny.

848
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,950
That's a valid concern.

849
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,620
You need confirmations these days.

850
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:33,890
No, no. I'm not like that.

851
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,250
Kissing out of love isn't sexual harassment.

852
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,850
Not kissing is sexual harassment.

853
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,190
I feel sexually ashamed when that happens.

854
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,280
That makes sense.

855
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,540
I'm not a rookie.

856
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,240
So don't worry.

857
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,190
What am I worrying about?

858
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,950
Things like sexual harassment.

859
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,540
I'm not like that.

860
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,120
I don't have to worry?

861
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,310
We agreed to do this, okay?

862
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,280
Don't change your words later.

863
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,040
Shh!

864
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:28,180
Yes, father.

865
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:31,740
We need to fix the bulldozer tonight.

866
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,320
It takes too long if we call a mechanic.

867
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,640
Let's fix it with Jangbi.

868
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,240
Okay. I'll be right over.

869
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,420
Let's go.

870
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,040
Bye.

871
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,080
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

872
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:05,990
Bye.

873
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,050
Bye.

874
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,240
Mom.

875
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,120
Who was that?

876
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,640
Nobody.

877
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:23,540
Then why were you waving at that truck?

878
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,040
Did you drink?

879
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:27,410
A bit.

880
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,780
I don't believe you!

881
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,650
Now you're dating a truck driver?

882
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:34,280
It's not like that.

883
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,590
Why did you quit your teaching job?

884
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:40,580
You used to get doctors, judges and lawyers.

885
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:44,510
Now you're getting a truck driver.

886
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:47,120
What if you never find a good husband?

887
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:50,540
Everyone knows your father here!

888
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:52,010
Mommy! Mommy!

889
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:53,250
Stop right there!

890
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,720
She was crying?

891
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,390
Yes.

892
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,250
Is something going on with her?

893
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,990
There must be something going on,

894
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,390
but I could never ask.

895
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,350
Why don't you talk to her and find out?

896
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:28,790
Hey, munchkin!

897
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,850
What is it?
Is something wrong?

898
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,120
She failed again.

899
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,750
Did you tell her to go drinking?

900
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,050
How did you know?

901
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,490
I read the same books you read.

902
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,490
She needs something powerful.

903
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,220
Can you think of anything?

904
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:49,490
I can't find it here.

905
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,890
I have the answer.

906
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,580
You do? What should she do?

907
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,540
It's not easy for me to say this to you.

908
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:13,350
That man. Your first love.

909
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:17,580
If you can't get over him, let's find him.

910
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,120
Daese.

911
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,420
I know how you feel.

912
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,880
I know you've been crying.

913
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,850
And I know why.

914
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,120
I know how it feels.

915
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,450
You were together for 7 years,

916
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:34,040
and you broke up right before your wedding.

917
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,990
I can never forgive her for

918
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,290
what she did to you.

919
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,350
Don't hate my sister so much.

920
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,920
She brought Sangnam into this world.

921
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,510
She ruined two families.

922
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:49,720
My family and yours.

923
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:51,950
She ruined my life

924
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,750
and she ruined your life, too.

925
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,690
And Sangnam.

926
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:59,410
I'm sure she's being punished somewhere.

927
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:02,140
I hate her, too.

928
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,490
But so much time passed,

929
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:10,310
and I've accepted it as fate.

930
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,510
Why don't you look for him?

931
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:16,320
I'm sure you can find him if you wanted to.

932
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,450
Should I look for him?

933
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,850
No.

934
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:21,040
Don't bother, Daese.

935
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:23,580
I broke his heart.

936
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:27,180
I'll explain to him why you had to leave him.

937
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:29,040
If he finds out it wasn't your fault...

938
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:30,620
Don't, Daese.

939
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,720
What we had is over.

940
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:36,310
What can we do after all these years?

941
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:40,790
I don't want to open old wounds.

942
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,720
Please don't mention him to me again.

943
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,020
Yes.

944
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:16,050
It's about Gwangbak.

945
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,410
Can you find a man for her?

946
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,140
I'm not doing that!

947
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,820
I'm fine with anyone who has a good job,

948
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:27,280
a future, and ability to support his family.

949
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:30,720
And it'd be nice if he's good looking.

950
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:34,850
You know how pretty my daughters are.

951
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:38,850
And we're talking about my third daughter.

952
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,950
She's the best looking one of all.

953
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,810
Mom.

954
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:44,350
And he should have money, too.

955
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,750
See if you can find someone.

956
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,050
I'll buy you a dress.

957
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,180
Bye.

958
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,620
Nobody has everything!

959
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,850
No trucker!

960
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,950
I'm not going, Madam Lee Anggeum!

961
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,410
Don't be crazy!

962
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,880
Be honest.

963
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,620
Is Gwangbak really the best looking one?

964
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,550
You had work done.

965
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:07,510
Gwangbak is all natural.

966
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:08,950
Mom!

967
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:16,140
- What is it?
- I found the solution.

968
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,450
You did? What is it?

969
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,450
Excuse me! Excuse me!

970
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,810
What's up?

971
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:26,110
Let's go fishing.

972
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,520
Fishing?

973
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:30,890
Yes, night fishing.

974
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,310
Okay. Let's go fishing.

975
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,010
I'm not sure what I'll catch.

976
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:45,290
Subtitles by KBS World

977
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:53,780
I left breathless from running around all day, in search of love, in search of life

978
01:01:53,780 --> 01:02:02,200
Beneath the skies of Seoul I get closer to my dreams

979
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:10,710
Both love and friendship coexist under the sky

980
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,820
Each day passes by differently from the last

981
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,640
I'm furious, that's why.

982
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:16,280
The beauty salon woman,

983
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,220
she's acting like she owns the world.

984
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,990
Why did Minjung have to make a delivery just then?

985
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,490
He came to that restaurant?

986
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,640
I'm leaving.

987
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:25,780
Just like that?

988
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,290
How long have you been sitting here?

989
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,690
- What?
- We didn't have any fish stew.

990
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:30,810
And we didn't kiss.

991
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,720
Let's save it for a special occasion.

992
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:34,720
How dare you yell at my son?

993
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:37,120
If he makes a mistake, I can scold him.

994
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:39,040
I have a right to, don't you think?

995
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:40,390
Grandmother, what's wrong with you?

996
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,390
How dare you yell at her?
She's my mom.

997
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,720
Your mom yelled at my mom first!
