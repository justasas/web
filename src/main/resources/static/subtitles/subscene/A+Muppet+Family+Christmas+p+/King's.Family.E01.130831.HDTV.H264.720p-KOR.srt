00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,250
Be careful. Don't get caught.

3
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,510
I'm actually petrified.

4
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,990
Should I just come clean?

5
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,840
There's no need to expose yourself.

6
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,500
Let's put it off as long as we can.

7
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,330
Okay.

8
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,510
[Wang Bong] 

9
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm never playing Go-Stop again. 

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,560
Old bats! 

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,550
Why don't you die already! 

12
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,540
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo. 

13
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,850
[Put Yourself in Others' Shoes] 

14
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,830
Oh! 

15
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,130
What are you doing? 

16
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,580
Oh, you startled me. 

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,330
Why can't you knock? 

18
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,730
Knock? Yeah, right. 

19
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,980
Come to my room. 

20
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,020
Do you know what day it is today? 

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,350
I don't believe this. 

22
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,290
The day of your father's memorial service! 

23
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,200
I did mark the calendar... 

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
You're so dim. 

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,050
What good would marking the calendar do? 

26
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,120
You should mark it in your brain! 

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,860
How come you only have one eyebrow done? 

28
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,750
Are you going out? 

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,610
I have a private fund meeting. 

30
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,540
Don't forget to go grocery shopping because of your meeting. 

31
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,030
I've been doing it for dozens of years. 

32
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,610
You know your late father in law is picky, don't you? 

33
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,730
Buy the fifty dollar yellow corvina, and... 

34
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,580
Fifty dollars? 

35
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,430
That's not much!
It's only once a year. 

36
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,060
Make some pancakes and dumplings my son likes. 

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,700
Why are you making that face? 

38
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,820
You don't want to do it? 

39
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm not loving it. 

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,920
Blame yourself for not having any daughters in law. 

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,210
Come to think of it, you're pretty pathetic. 

42
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,270
You have no daughter in law to cook for you. 

43
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,560
You look awful. 

44
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,040
And you look great because I cook for you. 

45
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,130
Right. I'm lucky, I know. 

46
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,030
You better watch out today. 

47
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,810
Your luck is really bad. 

48
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,790
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo. 

49
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,510
She has a knack for getting on my nerves. 

50
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,350
You have bad luck, so you look awful. 

51
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,350
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo. 

52
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,020
I guess you could call that a gift. 

53
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,950
Hello? Yes. 

54
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,960
Unemployment what? 

55
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,020
Unemployment benefit? What's... 

56
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,940
Hello? Yes, I'm Wang Gwangbak. 

57
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,320
You didn't go to school? 

58
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,460
I'm sorry, but you're not qualified for unemployment benefit. 

59
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,650
Couldn't you have called me on my mobile phone? 

60
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,980
Your mobile phone was off,
so I called your home. 

61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,510
Why would you be so kind? 

62
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,550
Fine. Goodbye. 

63
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,520
Why would you ask for that unemployment thing? 

64
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,700
It's not for me.
Mom, I'm late. 

65
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,450
Mom, your eyebrow, 
don't forget the other eyebrow. 

66
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,740
Hey, 

67
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,950
be honest with me. You're not... 

68
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,420
I'm not what? 

69
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,820
You're spinning this into something weird again. 

70
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,880
I asked because of someone else at school. 

71
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,840
You've been acting suspicious lately. 

72
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,850
And what's with the dog sounds at night? 

73
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,130
I'll tell you someday. 

74
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,850
You have a blind date Saturday! 

75
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,730
The treatment went well, 
but you need to be careful for a while. 

76
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,600
Bean sprouts. 

77
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,500
Next is meat, meat. 

78
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,140
- This, this, this.
- Okay. 

79
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,740
Oh, that woman.

80
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,730
She's going to try to crush me again by bragging away.

81
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,020
I can't take that again!

82
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,360
Her bragging days are over. 

83
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,870
How so? 

84
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,790
Gwangbak. 

85
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,060
What about Gwangbak? 

86
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,300
Charge, charge! 

87
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
Crush them! Crush them! 

88
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,110
Don't! No! 

89
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,840
To the left, left, left! 

90
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,190
Yes! Hey! You go in!
Hey, what are you doing? 

91
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,680
I'm coming! 

92
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,940
Nice! 

93
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,640
Get rid of it! 

94
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,700
Yes! Hey, it worked! 

95
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,450
[Have a nice day!] 

96
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,430
Got any money? 

97
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,850
Of course not. 

98
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,030
This is insane! 

99
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,060
Where are we off to? 

100
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,960
I don't know. Do you? 

101
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,310
Those who give orders,
those who follow them. 
That's the societal problem these days. 

102
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,290
That's what they say. 

103
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,250
I wish I was the one giving the orders. 

104
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,620
I know. 

105
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,750
What's life?
If you don't own, you rent. 

106
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,910
You're either unemployed or have a part time job. 

107
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,450
I majored in English lit not knowing what it was. 

108
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,380
I majored in law and now I'm a law abiding citizen. 

109
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,650
Hey! Madam Park Salla. 

110
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,040
Where are you off to? 

111
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,280
Hello. 

112
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,810
I'm not going to get in trouble. 

113
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,170
I'm going to be trouble! 

114
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,330
You're not kids anymore! 

115
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,960
When did these become kids' shoes? 

116
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,220
I don't know. 

117
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,890
Wow. 

118
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,960
How cool. 

119
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,880
Who owns a car like that in our town? 

120
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,310
Move closer to them, real close. 

121
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,740
Honk at them, too. 

122
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,830
Real close, so they can see. 

123
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,430
Oh, look at that car!
I don't believe it. 

124
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,960
Do you see them?
I Just love this! 

125
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,460
Mom, you're funny. 

126
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,840
Preparing for the memorial service will be hard. 

127
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,620
Should I send my housekeeper later? 

128
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,620
It's okay. I have Hobak. 

129
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,540
Sorry I'm late. 

130
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,000
My daughter wants to say hello. 

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,170
How have you been? 

132
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,510
- How pretty!
- She's so pretty. 

133
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,260
Thank you. 

134
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,070
I'll pay for your meal, so please enjoy. 

135
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,290
How nice of her. 

136
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,340
She is so generous. 

137
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,680
Your daughter's the only person who drives a car like that around here. 

138
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,550
She just bought a car, but replaced it again! 

139
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,590
I heard your eldest son in law treats you so well. 

140
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:52,820
They say if you love your wife,
you love her family as well! 

141
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,390
So of course he treats me so well. 

142
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,770
Of the two son in laws,
which do you like better? 

143
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,480
Oh, you have to ask? 

144
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,890
My second son in law doesn't even try. 

145
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,610
He's an unemployed bum. 

146
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,620
She's here, she's here. 

147
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,840
Why are you so quiet? 

148
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,570
Were you talking about me behind my back? 

149
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,710
- No!
- We wouldn't. 

150
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,900
If your son is a bum,
don't let him get married. 

151
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,020
You'll be ruining the life of someone's daughter. 

152
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,330
Mother in laws these days are out to get their son in laws. 

153
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,270
The world is coming to an end. 

154
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,470
Wait until you get a son in law. 

155
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,780
In the past, I used to be proud of myself, 

156
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,260
but now, I'm proud of my children. 

157
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,630
When your children do well, you look great, don't you? 

158
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,840
- Right.
- Yes. 

159
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,300
Your third daughter's next in line, isn't she? 

160
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,590
So many people are asking me about her. 

161
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,770
Doctors, judges and prosecutors. 

162
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,100
Teachers are very popular these days. 

163
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,980
She's meeting one this Saturday. 

164
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,810
He's a successful dermatologist. 

165
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,890
How nice! 

166
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,430
Your son in law can give you a face lift! 

167
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,440
She hasn't even met him. 

168
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,060
Don't count your chickens before they hatch. 

169
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,940
I'm sure it'll work out great. 

170
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:21,000
Should we start a face lift fund and ask my son in law to give us a discount? 

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,100
- Yes!
- Let's do that. 

172
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,570
I heard lots of doctors are losing their jobs. 

173
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,640
Are you planning on opening up an office for him? 

174
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,530
What? 

175
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,710
My daughter has a great job, so why would I? 

176
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:38,290
To be frank, if your eldest daughter hadn't gotten plastic surgery, she wouldn't be that pretty. 

177
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:43,440
And Gwangbak isn't all that pretty, either, so why would a successful doctor want to marry her 

178
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,190
when she was fired from school? 

179
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,070
What are you talking about? 

180
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,530
She said she was fired from school. 

181
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,380
No, no way! 

182
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,360
She went to work this morning. 

183
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,720
Didn't you know? 

184
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,090
She's been hanging out at a cafe down the street,
and everyone knows that already. 

185
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,530
And you call yourself a mother? 

186
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,040
Right, I saw her yesterday. 

187
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,810
She was hanging out there. 

188
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,240
Oh, my. 

189
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,820
She didn't even tell her mom? 

190
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,790
Why would anyone quit a teaching job? 

191
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,920
Those are my shoes! 

192
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,870
Don't forget your groceries. 

193
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,510
Slow down. You'll trip and fall. 

194
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,930
Would you like to try that on? 

195
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,550
I don't need to. 

196
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,260
I know my body very well. 

197
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,270
I'll take this. 

198
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,990
Ma'am, 

199
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,650
do you have another credit card? 

200
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,650
Why? 

201
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,820
- Yes, mom?
- Where are you? 

202
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,050
At school, of course. 

203
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,050
At school my butt! 

204
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,630
Oh! Oh, no... Oh, no... 

205
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,310
Oh! I'm sorry! 

206
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,710
Oh no, I'm so sorry. 

207
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,890
You! 

208
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,370
Oh, no! Oh, no! 

209
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,150
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, hi. 

210
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,070
Oh, it's the geezer. 

211
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,400
Mr. Vice Principal, 

212
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,790
the ball... 

213
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,740
Ugh... 

214
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,920
What is it? 

215
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,760
Come home right now. 

216
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,850
Why? Did something happen to mother? 

217
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,670
No, it's your daughter! 

218
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,230
Gwangbak. 

219
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,450
Why are you home so early? 

220
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,030
Your mom called. 

221
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,410
Did she find out? 

222
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,640
I'm sorry. 

223
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,200
You should've been more careful. 

224
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,930
I have to go back to work before lunch. 

225
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,880
I'm going to say I didn't know. 

226
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,710
That's not fair! 

227
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,260
How's that not fair?
I want to live, too! 

228
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,680
Let's do rock paper scissors. 

229
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,790
Look before you throw. 

230
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,800
I'm not having a good day. 

231
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,710
Why you little!
Come over here! 

232
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,630
Mom, 

233
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,950
sorry. 

234
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,240
If you're sorry tell me what happened. 

235
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,010
Why did you get fired? 

236
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,530
I didn't get fired. 

237
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,800
You didn't get fired? 

238
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,310
Did you quit? 

239
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,780
Why? 

240
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,720
Why would you quit a teaching job? 

241
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,220
She wants to become a writer. 

242
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,820
A writer? Bah! 

243
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,000
You've gone totally nuts! 

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,310
How can you become a writer when you can't even write? 

245
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,170
But I can!
I've written a few magazine articles. 

246
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,690
When did you quit your job? 

247
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,030
A month ago. 

248
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,720
It's been a month? 

249
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,100
So you lied to me every morning and went to that cafe instead of going to work? 

250
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,350
I don't believe this! 

251
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,210
Oh, go easy on her. 

252
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,050
You hit harder than anyone I know. 

253
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,570
You stay out of this. 

254
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,870
I told you you'd have an awful day. 

255
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,870
Mom, I'm going to become a writer. 

256
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,260
It's my dream. 

257
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,540
I'm going to become world famous, lie Psy. 

258
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,870
Mom, you've heard of Harry Potter, right? 

259
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,290
Helicopter? 

260
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,690
Air plane, air plane! 

261
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,370
Why would you take a helicopter when there's the air plane? 

262
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,270
Anggeum, she doesn't mean the chopper. 

263
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,920
It's Harry Potter. 

264
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,800
What's that? 

265
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,570
Helicopter or whatever it is, I don't care. 

266
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,620
Do it while being a teacher. 

267
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,330
How can she write while being a teacher? 

268
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,950
Why not? 

269
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,230
You can sleep less and write! 

270
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,390
That should be easy! 

271
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,950
It's not that easy. 

272
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,460
Writing is a very difficult process. 

273
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,530
Mom, I'm sorry I didn't tell you first, 

274
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,530
but I'm not good at teaching. 

275
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,550
I became a teacher because dad's a teacher,
and I thought it'd be a nice job for a woman. 

276
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,290
Getting up early is really hard,
and I'm not the teaching type. 

277
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,210
What am I going to do with you, huh? 

278
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,090
Can't you see how everyone in the country is dying to become a teacher? 

279
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,270
It's not everyone in the country. 

280
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,380
Have you forgotten how everyone became envious when you became a teacher? 

281
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,380
It wasn't everyone. 

282
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,410
When will you become that writer thing? 

283
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,780
You answer her. 

284
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,870
I don't know. You'll need luck. 

285
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,270
It's kind of impossible. 

286
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,620
That's so sad. 

287
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,870
I'll make it happen as soon as possible. 

288
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,060
Quit! 

289
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,350
Oh, man! 

290
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,100
Put yourself in Gwangbak's shoes. 

291
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,760
Afraid of you finding about it, 

292
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,020
she couldn't even eat for the last month and lost so much weight. 

293
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,700
Why would you do it if you're so scared! 

294
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,700
Wait a minute, you knew about this, didn't you? 

295
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,970
Huh? 

296
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,630
Uh, no. 

297
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,590
Did dad know about it? 

298
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,670
Well, actually... 

299
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,220
I'm sorry, dad. 

300
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,210
Oh, man... 

301
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,780
How could you? 

302
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,140
When your daughter goes mad and starts talking nonsense, 

303
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,060
you should be telling her right from wrong! 

304
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,260
Instead, you lead her down the wrong path? 

305
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,400
Must you be so cruel? 

306
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,150
She says it's her dream! 

307
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,600
Stop torturing him. 

308
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,230
Why are you torturing my child when it's your child's fault? 

309
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,130
I'm not holding the memorial ceremony. 

310
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,470
- What?
- She's not doing the ceremony. 

311
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,670
How dare you! 

312
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,400
Mr. Ko! 

313
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,050
The creditors were here. 

314
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,390
What do we do? 

315
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,430
That hurts! 

316
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,170
Ouch. 

317
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,520
What are you laughing at? 

318
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,310
Why you little... 

319
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,760
Let me go! That really hurts. 

320
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,500
Then be quiet and follow me. 

321
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,430
It hurts, let me go, let me go. Ouch. 

322
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,800
Let's talk, man to man. 

323
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,660
Why do you walk around during class? 

324
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't you get tired? 

325
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,790
I don't really get tired. 

326
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,430
Bring your parents in for a conference. 

327
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,160
It'd be better to just talk to me. 

328
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,420
I can't have a conversation with you! 

329
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,080
I can talk to you just fine. 

330
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,710
You're aging your teacher! 

331
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,170
He's been old! 

332
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,220
He's been old? 

333
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,650
I can't believe you said that! 

334
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,680
You can't talk to him. 

335
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,340
It's impossible to communicate with him! 

336
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,750
Go. 

337
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,000
Bring one of your parents tomorrow! 

338
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,310
Don't get your hopes up. 

339
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,430
Mr. Kim, 

340
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:10,550
you shouldn't use physical punishment like pulling the ear or hitting with the attendance book. 

341
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,410
It's not easy for him. 

342
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,570
You try talking to him for five minutes. 

343
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,670
You'll go mad. 

344
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,850
A kid like that, the parents are the problem. 

345
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,770
We shouldn't blame the kid. 

346
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,770
It's the parents' fault. 

347
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,880
Wait for me! 

348
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,750
Guys! 

349
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,560
Guys! Wait for me! 

350
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,130
Do you have a death wish or something? 

351
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,760
You drink it. 

352
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,460
I'm so sorry! 

353
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,030
It won't be easy for you to get all of that by next week. 

354
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm not worried. I have you. 

355
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,180
I'm an old man now. 

356
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,470
Too bad your dad got hurt at a time like this. 

357
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,050
I know. He's being a huge crybaby about it. 

358
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,710
There they go again. 

359
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,060
They look like a motorcycle gang. 

360
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,310
Leave them be. They're pretty violent. 

361
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,670
Even calling the police doesn't work. 

362
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,440
Go easy on them! 

363
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,770
Hey, you! 

364
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,660
Stop that! 

365
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,770
Hey, I said stop it. 

366
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,330
What if I can't stop? 

367
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,050
Hey. 

368
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,130
What is this? 

369
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,230
I got humiliated! 

370
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,610
Why are my credit cards suspended? 

371
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,340
You can't use them for now. 

372
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,940
My company's in trouble. 

373
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,870
But I'm going furniture shopping with my friends tomorrow! 

374
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,100
But we just got new furniture. 

375
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,920
That was two years ago! 

376
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,430
Shopping's great for taking your mind off things. 

377
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,200
If I can't get a new husband,
I should at least get a new bed... 

378
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,000
That's enough! 

379
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,180
You don't have to yell. 

380
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,800
Grow up, please. 

381
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,300
How can you... 

382
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,450
What brings you here? 

383
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,450
When was the last time you visited father? 

384
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,870
Don't beat around the bush. 

385
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,070
It's been a year since mom passed away. 

386
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,230
If one of them passed away first, 

387
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,790
you said you'd take care of the other. 

388
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,970
I went to father's house last week, 

389
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,820
and he's aged so much in just a year. 

390
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,730
He said he should get a dog or something... 

391
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,770
He's getting a dog? 

392
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,350
He doesn't even like dogs, 

393
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,040
so imagine how lonely he must be to say that. 

394
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,580
Do they own you? 

395
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,980
How can you say that? Own me? 

396
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,680
My friend saw you at a barbecue restaurant. 

397
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,580
You were laughing and having barbecue with your in laws! 

398
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,350
I wasn't laughing. 

399
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,400
How can you laugh and eat at the same time? 

400
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,850
You went on vacation with your in laws. 

401
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,430
Have you ever taken our parents on vacation? 

402
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,010
You were always too busy for them. 

403
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,220
We think we lost you. 

404
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,040
I hate your wife but I hate you even more. 

405
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,360
If you'd gotten your bearings straight,
this wouldn't have happened. 

406
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,190
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault. 

407
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,350
If you know that, fix it. 

408
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,890
Take care of father. 

409
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,290
I will, but... 

410
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,370
But what? 

411
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,540
Do you need to get your wife's permission? 

412
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,230
Actually, I'm not really... 

413
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,090
You're not really what? 

414
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,680
You're the richest of all four siblings. 

415
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,350
The rest of us gave up everything for you. 

416
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,070
When you wanted to sell father's land to expand your business,  

417
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,240
we didn't object because you're the eldest. 

418
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,820
I'm barely making ends meet, but if it weren't for my in laws, I would've taken father in. 

419
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,670
I will take care of father. 

420
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,840
You could've called instead of spending money on coming here. 

421
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,840
Stop worrying about that and take father in this week. 

422
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,240
If you don't, I'm going to bring him to you. 

423
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,090
Mom's first memorial service is next week. 

424
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,040
You do the ceremony at your house. 

425
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,310
I'm so bored, I'm going nuts. 

426
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,540
Nutty, nutty, nuts. 

427
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,010
I'm going nuts. 

428
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,430
Wang Don, come out and play! 

429
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,060
Loser, come out and play. 

430
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,070
Loser! 

431
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,650
Loser's not home! 

432
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,890
Loser? Did you call me loser? 

433
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,220
Uncle, bring out the dishes... 

434
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,520
- Grandmother, I'm here.
- You're late! 

435
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,330
I came straight from work. 

436
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,180
I can't believe my mother in law. 

437
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,080
Why would she say something like that? 

438
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,210
Like grandma said, it was worse than the Korean War. 

439
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,450
Oh, my back. 

440
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,440
Thank god it's grandfather's memorial service. 

441
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,660
Why are you just standing there? 

442
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,740
You came early. 

443
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,970
Why don't you take a day off? 

444
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,200
Mom can't do all this alone. 

445
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,450
Hobak isn't a daughter in law. 

446
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,220
Why would she take the day off to help? 

447
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,110
You don't have a job,
so why couldn't you help? 

448
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,830
Subak can't help. 

449
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,810
She doesn't cook.
She'll just be in the way. 

450
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,610
It's her good fortune. 

451
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,010
It's all thanks to Minjung. 

452
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,200
It was her fortune to have found a husband like him. 

453
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,640
So get yourself a good husband. 

454
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,280
Why am I talking to you?
I hate you! 

455
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,940
Oh, mommy. 

456
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,390
Let me go.
Get out of my sight. 

457
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,960
Huh? This must be new! 

458
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
How pretty!
Who bought you this? 

459
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,350
Who do you think? 

460
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,120
There's only one person who buys me clothes in this family. 

461
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,780
I wonder what she does with all the money she makes... 

462
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,510
Why would you pull something like that? 

463
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,920
You broke mom's heart. 

464
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,340
She was humiliated at the private fund meeting. 

465
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,590
I'm going to become a writer. 

466
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,060
Shut up! I'm not finished with you! 

467
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,500
After that's done, clean the fish and steam it. 

468
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,010
And season these vegetables. Hurry up. 

469
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,320
Stop chatting and get back to work! 

470
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,810
Your grandfather is probably starving. 

471
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:03,650
You're all such useless girls! 

472
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,680
Why couldn't you be sons? 

473
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,070
Grandma! 

474
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,780
They're a motorcycle gang. 

475
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,040
Why would you follow around gang members? 

476
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,030
They don't even want you. 

477
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,560
Because I'm bored. 

478
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,630
You're bored? 

479
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,650
Do your parents know about this? 

480
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,170
I don't think so. 

481
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,140
Do you have a girlfriend? 

482
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,470
You do! 

483
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,860
What's your dream? 

484
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,940
Dream? 

485
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,730
What do you want to do? 

486
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,730
What do you want to become? 

487
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,140
If you can't answer in 5 seconds,
you don't have one. 

488
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,650
You don't want to become a celebrity, do you? 

489
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,370
I'm not a child.
What do you take me for? 

490
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,050
Lots of kids want to become a star. 

491
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,050
I'm not interested in stuff like that. 

492
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,470
That's boring. 

493
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,840
If you don't want a boring life, 
you must have a dream. 

494
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,730
When you have a dream, you don't get bored. 

495
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,170
You don't get bored? 

496
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,930
Then I'll think about it. 

497
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,980
Not something your parents want, 
but what you want. 

498
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,110
Because you own your life. 

499
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,630
In other words, 

500
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,820
it's okay to make parents cry if it's for the sake of your dream. 

501
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,510
Do you understand what I mean? 

502
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,140
Start. 

503
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,440
Okay. 

504
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,900
But my son's missing. 

505
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,460
[Rude Ugly Hag] 

506
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,880
- Hello?
- I'm going to kill you! 

507
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,530
How dare you? 

508
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,930
You should come home before the sun goes down! 

509
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,760
Do you even know what day today is? 

510
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,770
You must be itching to get it! 

511
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,020
I have a baseball bat right here! 

512
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,490
Where are you? 

513
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,920
Tell me before I beat you up. 

514
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,540
Are you at an internet cafe again? 

515
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,480
No, this is a Chinese restaurant. 

516
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,160
Hello? 

517
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,600
Isn't this Wang Daebak's mobile phone? 

518
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,360
It is, but... 

519
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,280
Who was that? 

520
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,070
She's a rude, ugly hag. 

521
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,910
I'm in the 7th grade, so leave me alone. 

522
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,030
As if that's a title! 

523
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,440
- Come with me!
- I'm in the 7th grade! 

524
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,610
Let's bow. 

525
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,170
Honey, this is nothing compared to what I used to make for you, 

526
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,170
but what else can we do? 

527
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,370
It doesn't look like much, 

528
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,570
but it sure was expensive, 

529
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,340
so enjoy your meal. 

530
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,400
Have a grand feast in your afterlife! 

531
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,870
Please make sure no ill fortune comes our way. 

532
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,490
The other kids couldn't make it because they live in China and America. 

533
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,890
So don't be all upset over it. 

534
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:54,400
Honey, make sure our eldest son is healthy and find a wife for our youngest son. 

535
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,010
His sister in law won't stop picking on him. 

536
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:06,060
Honey, you know Bong is the best son in the world, don't you? 

537
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:12,450
He brings me back to life whenever I get sick, 

538
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,390
he always does that. 

539
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,740
He won't let me come and meet you. 

540
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,330
And our youngest son. 

541
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:29,580
I'm so grateful you gave him to me before leaving. 

542
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,760
Oh, he plays cards with me. 

543
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,670
He's the only one who spends time with me. 

544
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:40,180
If you hadn't given him to me before you died, 

545
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,230
I don't know how I could've... 

546
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,240
- Grandma.
- Yes? 

547
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
You should tell us about your pregnancy. 

548
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,600
Huh? 

549
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,910
You'd never believe it. 

550
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:58,860
I was old and I didn't know I was pregnant, 
and my stomach started getting big. 

551
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,540
Your grandfather was really sick and he kept asking, 

552
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,910
"What's wrong with your stomach?" 

553
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,230
So I said, 

554
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,670
"I have no idea. I don't know." 

555
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:12,540
We forgot what we did and blamed it on constipation. 

556
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:17,300
It was so much trouble, worse than the Korean War. 

557
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,540
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo. 

558
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,150
Heat up the soup and bring some out! 

559
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,380
Coming! 

560
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,420
Sis, do the dishes later and come eat with us. 

561
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,750
I'll just finish this up. 

562
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,030
I'll have to do it sooner or later. 

563
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,090
Okay. 

564
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,750
Uncle, I need to talk to you. 

565
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,750
I get scared whenever you say that. 

566
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,110
I mean, why wouldn't you let my husband get a job? 

567
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,170
He said that? 

568
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,070
He said you told him not to because you'd be bored. 

569
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,170
You won't have anyone to hang with. 

570
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:48,000
Heo Sedal! I can't believe he said that. 

571
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,370
And you believe him? 

572
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,120
You were made for each other. 

573
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,570
Eat up. Not leaving scraps is a way to save. 

574
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,010
Mother, you eat, too. 

575
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,200
I will. 

576
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,450
Where are your husbands? 

577
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,450
Why aren't they here? 

578
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,220
They're all busy. 

579
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,480
Even so! 

580
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,080
You have to feel sorry for your father. 

581
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,820
He has nobody to do this for him. 

582
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,940
He has me. 

583
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:20,370
Oh, I forgot all about you! 

584
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,270
You're not the only woman who had a son at an old age. 

585
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,760
I've suffered, too. 

586
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,490
Giving birth at an old age must run in the family. 

587
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:29,020
Why don't you have one, too? 

588
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,790
Don't! It's too much trouble. 

589
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,110
Just raise the two you have right now well. 

590
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,410
Oh, don't worry. 

591
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,810
I almost died trying to lose weight after giving birth. 

592
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:39,490
It wasn't you!
Money did it for you. 

593
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,170
Why couldn't you get dental implants for your only grandma with that money? 

594
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,640
My teeth are so bad I can hardly chew. 

595
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,320
You have problems with your dentures? 

596
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,150
No. 

597
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,150
Why would you ask your granddaughter that? 

598
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,280
You have a son right here. 

599
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,950
I'll get you new ones. 

600
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,660
Tell her that after you actually do it. 

601
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,570
Yes, sir. 

602
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,850
Uncle, have some beer. 

603
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,060
Your face changes every time I see you. 

604
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:12,780
I could hang your pictures and call them the Evolution of Wang Subak, Before and After. 

605
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,640
What do you mean?
She's always been pretty! 

606
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,840
She was even in the Miss Korea pageant. 

607
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,460
- She got eliminated.
- In the preliminaries. 

608
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,090
To be frank, Hobak is better looking than Subak. 

609
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,410
She's far more useful. 

610
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,200
Don't say that. 

611
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,520
We owe a lot to Subak. 

612
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,090
It's not Subak!
It's all because of my son. 

613
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,670
Subak bought us that TV, 

614
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,830
bought us a new kimchi fridge last year, 

615
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:39,620
and she got us a bidet. 

616
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,510
She's been taking good care of us. 

617
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,210
There's someone here who won't even buy us $1 undies. 

618
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,900
They sell undies for a dollar? 

619
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,160
They even have ones that are 50 cents. 

620
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,010
Hobak's husband doesn't make money like Minjung does. 

621
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,750
It's the thought that counts, not the money. 

622
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,520
What's Sedal been up to? 

623
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,190
Is he ever getting a job? 

624
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,900
He keeps avoiding me. 

625
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,970
He came over earlier, saying,  

626
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,170
"Loser, come out and play." 

627
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,140
He asked your uncle out without saying hello to me. 

628
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,810
How dare he! 

629
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,950
How is my son a loser? 

630
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,530
He's the loser. 

631
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,320
She ruined her own life. 

632
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,560
Why was she in such a hurry to get pregnant? 

633
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,990
She fell for his looks. 

634
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:27,040
Hobak likes handsome men. 

635
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,570
But he's not handsome! 

636
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:31,510
He's all dark, with eyes all bulging out. 

637
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,430
If she thinks he's handsome, he is. 

638
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,240
The problem is that she's the only one who thinks that. 

639
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,860
Why couldn't she get a job and help her family out a bit and let me find a husband for her. 

640
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,240
It was so humiliating for me to listen to people talk about  

641
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,270
her getting pregnant before getting married. 

642
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,520
Nobody respects a girl who gets pregnant before getting married! 

643
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,540
That's why she's living such a pathetic life. 

644
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,560
That beauty salon woman used to suck up to me before, 

645
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,350
but now that we're in laws, she belittles me! 

646
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,750
Why would you bring that up now? 

647
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,090
It's because I'm so frustrated! 

648
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,900
Why can't she be more like her older sister? 

649
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,920
Don't mind her. 

650
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,410
She's just upset. 

651
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,330
She doesn't hate you. 

652
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,550
But this happens every time she sees me, every time. 

653
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,550
It's already been 10 years. 

654
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:39,710
This is all because I'm poor. 

655
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,360
It's all because of money. 

656
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,990
Daebak, Haebak. 

657
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,130
I'm sorry for being friends with someone like him. 

658
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,950
You didn't force him on her! 

659
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,330
Don't treat your brother in law so badly. 

660
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,700
He might be young, but he's still your brother in law. 

661
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,800
You can't say that. 

662
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,650
I was too busy taking care of him to take care of my own children. 

663
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,700
It's your fault he turned out this way. 

664
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,360
What? What did you say? 

665
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,340
You cherished him, calling him your "precious son," 

666
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,730
and you spoiled him. 

667
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,770
Bong got him jobs, but he couldn't last a month. 

668
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,940
It's hard on Bong, too, you know? 

669
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,670
That's enough.
Are you drunk? 

670
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,200
I'm not drunk!
I only had one beer. 

671
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,250
I'm not going to keep this bottled up. 

672
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,760
Fine, go ahead. 

673
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,360
You think you did a better job at raising your children? 

674
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,570
When I fled from North Korea during the war 

675
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:50,350
and started selling pancakes, I did pretty well. 

676
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,930
I never lost money. 

677
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,000
As for children, one's  a vice principal, 
one's unemployed. 

678
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,550
That about evens out, don't you think? 

679
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:00,040
When I count Subak and Hobak, that evens out too! 

680
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,780
Raising children isn't a business, so stop it. 

681
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,250
Your mom started it! 

682
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,390
He'll be forty soon! 

683
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,620
How will he ever get married? 

684
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,340
After mother passes away,
we'll have to take care of him! 

685
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,050
You have a young child, too,
so don't be so mean! 

686
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,230
Who knows what will happen to Daebak? 

687
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,350
That's why I'm not spoiling Daebak. 

688
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,950
I'm afraid he'll turn out like his uncle. 

689
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,420
What? 

690
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,980
Turn out like him? 

691
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,790
I said stop it. 

692
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,170
Why are you yelling at me? 

693
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,810
I'm not making this up, you know! 

694
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,040
Grandma, why are you picking on mom? 

695
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,670
Mom has every right to say that! 
She's worried about uncle. 

696
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,950
Oh, you're ganging up on me? 

697
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,960
I don't believe this! 

698
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,810
This is worse than the Korean War! 

699
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:48,820
Honey, why did you give me Don? 

700
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,710
Your daughter in law is being so mean to me! 

701
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,810
I can't live like this, honey! 

702
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,610
Oh, honey! 

703
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,730
Oh, honey... 

704
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:06,570
Oh, honey... 

705
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,100
I should die already! 

706
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,390
I have nothing to live for! 

707
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,390
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo. 

708
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,020
Stop saying that. 

709
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,350
What's wrong with her?
Is she sick? 

710
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,690
She's not sick. 

711
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,670
She's old. 

712
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,320
I'll yell at her later. 

713
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,170
She'll yell at you! 

714
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,530
Be careful. 

715
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:37,290
When you quit your job, she'll come after you. 

716
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,410
I won't let her. 

717
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,810
She gets scared when I glare at her. 

718
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,410
As if she's a cuckoo bird, 

719
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,130
she laid her egg in my nest, 

720
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,300
and look how she treats me! 

721
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,390
She thinks she's old and frail? Yeah right! 

722
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,800
And she says she wants to die?
What a joke! 

723
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,920
What's wrong with you? 

724
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,540
Today's my father's memorial service! 

725
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,400
Imagine how my mother feels right now. 

726
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,850
Sure! I'm the worst woman in the world, I am. 

727
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,510
Oh, you startled me. 

728
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,840
You're here! 

729
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,900
Why aren't you going in? 

730
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,730
I was waiting for you, so I can go in with you. 

731
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,180
You're late. 

732
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,860
I'll take these in for you. 

733
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,420
I'm here. 

734
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,400
Oh. 

735
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,100
My precious Minjung.
Welcome, welcome. 

736
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,530
- Hello.
- You came. 

737
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,320
You're late!
Everyone's been waiting for you. 

738
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,010
Don't be such a nag. 

739
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:41,030
I'm sure he was busy with work. 

740
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,950
The memorial went well, so don't worry. 

741
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:48,340
You must be hungry.
Get him some food. 

742
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,640
It's okay. I already ate. 

743
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,630
You did?
Oh, then forget about it. 

744
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,360
I haven't eaten yet. 

745
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,330
Why did you come so late? 

746
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:58,250
It's not like you have a job. 

747
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,140
And what are you wearing? 

748
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,520
It's so obvious your mom didn't teach you any manners. 

749
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,510
Get him some food. 

750
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:09,210
Minjung said he's okay.
Why bother? 

751
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:10,200
- Mother.
- Yes? 

752
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:10,920
Here. 

753
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,650
Oh, grandfather will be very happy. 

754
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,070
Would you like a drink? 

755
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,800
I saved a yellow corvina for you, Minjung. 

756
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,590
Oh, I'm so happy. 

757
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,270
"My precious Minjung, my precious Minjung." 

758
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,240
Whose am I?
Not hers, obviously. 

759
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,690
Nutty, nutty, nutty, nutty, nuts! 

760
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,120
Oh, man! 

761
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,200
I'm never going to your house again. 

762
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,910
It's not my house.
It's my parents house. 

763
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,310
Right, your parents house. 

764
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,500
They don't respect me at all! 

765
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,130
You need to act respectable to be respected. 

766
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,560
Don't you feel anything when you see Minjung? 

767
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,180
What am I supposed to feel? 

768
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,690
I feel persecuted. 

769
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:26,460
What else am I supposed to feel? 

770
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,450
I put your suit out for you. 

771
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,010
Why didn't you wear that? 

772
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,560
If you can't make money, 
at least be well mannered. 

773
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,050
I'm not the type to make money. 

774
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,330
What do you want from me? 

775
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,000
The become the money making type! 

776
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,360
Then you stop going to your parents house. 

777
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,200
They treat you so badly!
Why do you bother? 

778
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,510
I just don't understand you! 

779
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,180
Man. 

780
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:53,170
Man, this is nuts. 

781
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:03,740
You're right. I don't understand myself, either. 

782
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,090
Why do I bother going over there? 

783
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,420
Were you looking at father's picture? 

784
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,690
So I don't forget his face. 

785
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,240
I want to say hello to him when I see him in heaven. 

786
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,840
Anyway, Bong,  

787
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,040
what should I say when I see father? 

788
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,430
I think it'd be really awkward. 

789
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:44,070
Father will feel awkward, too, for he's never met you. 

790
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,170
Even if it were awkward, 

791
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,630
if I said, "Dad, hello. 

792
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,470
It's really nice to meet you," 

793
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:54,290
then, would he recognize me? 

794
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:57,490
I'm sure he will. 

795
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,310
Would you like to have a drink with me? 

796
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:05,690
Me? 

797
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:06,960
Yes, you. 

798
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:16,350
Mom, mom. 

799
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:17,500
Oh, mother. 

800
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,220
Open your eyes. 

801
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,190
Mother, look at me. 

802
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,620
What's wrong? 

803
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,060
Bong's calling me. 

804
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,000
- So?
- What do you mean, so? 

805
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,560
He'll yell at me again. 

806
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,050
If I don't come back in 10 minutes,
come and rescue me. 

807
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,160
Gosh! You're on your own. 

808
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,040
I'm so sleepy. 

809
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,180
- Sit down.
- Okay. 

810
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:08,000
I feel such sadness whenever I see you. 

811
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,230
You were born after father died, 

812
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,890
so you were never held by father. 

813
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,520
You're like my own son. 

814
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,160
You were born after Subak and Hobak were born. 

815
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,450
I've raised you like my own. 

816
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:23,980
I know. 

817
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,490
Anggeum nursed me because mom couldn't do it. 

818
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:30,660
But is that true? 

819
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,960
I've never witnessed it. 

820
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,520
Me neither. 

821
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,400
I'm sorry, Bong. 

822
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,180
Mom and Anggeum fight all the time because of me. 

823
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,210
And I'm embarrassed to face my nieces and nephew. 

824
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:47,060
If you're embarrassed, stop acting like a loser. 

825
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,410
A man should never act like a loser. 

826
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,530
How many years do you think mother has left? 

827
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,500
She must see you get married and have children. 

828
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:03,230
If mom dies, 

829
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:05,370
it would be really awkward for me. 

830
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,120
Awkward isn't a word you use in that situation. 

831
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:44,120
Open the door.
I know you're not sleeping. 

832
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,880
You must be exhausted.
Go to bed. 

833
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,320
You've never won any awards at writing not even as a kid! 

834
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,010
You'll never be a writer! 

835
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:53,650
Some people are late bloomers! 

836
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:55,270
I've worked for a magazine before. 

837
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:58,450
How dare you! Open it! 

838
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,980
Seeing my face now will make you even madder. 

839
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,970
You'll wake Haebak. 
She's such a hardworking student! 

840
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,030
She needs her rest. 
You'll wake Haebak. 
She's such a hardworking student! 

841
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,460
She needs her rest. 

842
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,230
You, how dare you... 

843
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:10,210
What are you doing?
Let's go downstairs. 

844
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,700
Let me go.
I need to settle this tonight. 

845
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,690
You can settle it tomorrow. 

846
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,320
Let me go! 

847
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,250
Man. 

848
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,220
There's no use. 

849
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,010
You know how stubborn Gwangbak is. 

850
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,690
She really wants this, so let her give it a try. 

851
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,770
She's almost thirty and now she's unemployed. 

852
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:39,620
I can't let this happen. I'll kill her. 

853
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,530
Hey! 

854
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,190
Oh my! 

855
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,820
Request to leave school. 

856
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,630
I'm going on a search for my dream. 

857
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,360
Goodbye. 

858
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,070
Hey, Wang Daebak! 

859
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,630
What's wrong with your family? 

860
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,650
Not a day goes by without trouble. 

861
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,890
What if things are the same after I marry you? 

862
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:15,890
You're going to marry me? 

863
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:17,890
Of course. 

864
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,100
Anyway, Daebak, 

865
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,380
what's going on with you these days? 

866
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,200
You won't reply to my text messages. 

867
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,220
I've been busy. 

868
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,860
Are you seeing another girl? 

869
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,270
Give me your phone. 

870
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,290
Acting like this will just drive me away. 

871
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,830
Fine, I respect myself too much to do this. 

872
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,830
I won't dwell on you. 

873
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:42,390
But you have to hang out with me today. 

874
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:44,390
I have to go. 

875
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:45,460

Miho, would you like me to give you a push? 

878
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,860
For real? 

879
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,970
Daebak, this is so great! 

880
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:00,850
Are you into me? 

881
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,020
I am! 

882
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,860
Daebak, you like me, don't you? 

883
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:07,340
- I'm not mad!
- Oh, my! 

884
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,910
Daebak, I'm going to kill you! 

885
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,610

Hey. 

888
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,630
I did it. 

889
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,910
What? 

890
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:35,100
You told me to make my parents cry. 

891
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,070
They'll be crying their eyes out. 

892
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,070
What did you do? 

893
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,070
I'm not going to tell you. 

894
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,070
Hold on. 

895
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,270
Hold it right there! 

896

Why are you acting like this is you first day? 

897
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:56,450
At this rate, you won't be able to go home tonight.

Yes.

he's gone completely wild.

you'd have had no chance to have him!

You're older regardless! 

1015
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,800
He eats more than I do. 

1016
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,020
And he has snacks and even late night snacks. 

1017
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,900
If you counted the serving sizes, 
he'd be 10 years older.

And I don't like you going through my kitchen.

Sometimes, I'm too busy to clean up,

00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,840

Yes. Can I talk to you later?

Oh, you're home. 

1036
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,270
I didn't like the way it looked,
so I got it done again. 

1037
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:42,360
It's my last time.
I won't touch my nose again. 

1038
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,010
It'll be dangerous if I do. 

1039
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:47,050
Oh! Remember my friend Seo Gija? 

1040
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,020
She had a big barbecue restaurant in Gangnam. 

1041
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,120
We went there a few times. 

1042
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,650
She went bankrupt and had to sell her restaurant and her house, 

1043
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:57,130
and now she lives in a basement apartment. 

1044
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,370
Oh, that's so sad.
I couldn't handle that. 

1045
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:02,580
I'd rather die if that happened to me. 

1046
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:19,920

01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,270
She'll come back for her stuff. 

1049
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:24,440
What? 

1050
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,210
You have to run the house from now on. 

1051
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:29,350
I can't run the house!
I have two kids! 

1052
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:31,060
You must be mad. 

1053
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:35,970
Yes, I am mad,
so you should get it together. 

1054
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,800
Why are you doing this to me? 

1055
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,760
I can't! I've never even done dishes,
not even once growing up! 

1056
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,380
You know that! 

1057
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:45,560
Oh, my nose. 

1058
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,840
Go. 

1059
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,010
Is that him? 

1060
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:31,400
Hey! Stop! 

1061
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:37,680
It's me, Choi Sangnam. 

1062
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,950
Really? 

1063
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,460
Find her. 

1064
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:45,930
I said I don't care how much money it takes! 

1065
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,530
Find her. 

1066
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,580
Understand? 

1067
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:53,760
Hey! Stop! 

1068
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,230
Stop right there!

1070
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,000
Did a war break out? 

1071
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,260
Subak, Hobak, Gwangbak, Haebak! 

1072
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,650
What are you good for? 

1073
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:30,000
Why are my children always quitting? 

1074
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,370
Sedal won't help, so I've been trying so hard to save every penny... 

1075
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,900
I'm not going to think of you as my daughter! 

1076
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,610
Ugh! How could anyone love you? 

1077
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:40,750
I feel really bad, so I can't say hello properly. 

1078
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,650
Why don't we go to a police station? 

1079
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,380
You said you wanted to go to a police station. 

1080
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,820
I think I've seen you before. 

1081
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,440
That's way too obvious. 

1082
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,110
I saw something weird today. 

1083
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:51,540
Why? What was it? 

1084
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,920
Isn't that your brother in law? 

1085
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,500
Do you know what next Saturday is? 

1086
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,140
I told you, my mom's 60th birthday. 

1087
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,230
It's my mother's first memorial service. 

1088
01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:59,450
Can't we do it another day? 

1089
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:00,100
What's this? 

1090
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,060
Tell your father to come and eat.
