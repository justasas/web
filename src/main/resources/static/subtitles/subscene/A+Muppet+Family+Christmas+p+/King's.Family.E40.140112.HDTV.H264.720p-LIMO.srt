2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,150
The deeds to the house.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,490
The deeds, the deeds!

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,640
Where are the deeds to the house?

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,840
Bong! Oh, Bong! Oh...

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,640
Oh, why aren't they here? Huh?

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,190
Why aren't the deeds here?

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,390
Where were you?
We're a mess here.

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,340
Why?

10
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,520
The deeds to the house are gone.

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,940
Subak!

12
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,780
Subak!

13
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,840
Subak! Hey! You!

14
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,810
Uncle, uncle, let me go.

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,110
He'll kill me. Father will kill me!

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,580
This isn't right!

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,690
- Let go! 
- Come here.

18
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,140
- Let go! 
- Hey!

19
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,640
- Let go!
- Come here!

20
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,910
Come here! Bong! Come!

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,350
Come here!

22
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,140
Let go! Let me go!

23
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,190
Bong! Anggeum! Ugh.

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,490
She tried to run. It was Subak!

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,020
No! I know nothing! I know nothing!

26
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,240
You! It was you!

27
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,410
You sent me to the sauna that time.

28
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,950
You stole it then, didn't you?

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,220
Where is it?
Where are the deeds?

30
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,920
What do we do? What do we do?

31
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,320
She stole from you!

32
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,850
Where are the deeds?

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,950
Father, father, hold on.

34
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,790
I'll get them back. 
It must be a mistake.

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,190
This is wrong.

36
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,280
He said he'll double it for me.

37
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,990
He said it'll be just $100,000.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,490
It's not the whole house.

39
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,110
I'll go and get them back.

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,840
Mom, I'm sorry.

41
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,450
Father, forgive me.

42
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,550
I'll go and get it right now.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,850
Bong!

44
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,850
Oh, Bong!

45
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,250
My money!
What about my money?

46
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,910
Just wait, I'll get it all back, mom.

47
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,350
You and I should just die!

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,850
Ugh! Anggeum! Anggeum!

49
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,090
Oh, this is crazy.

50
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,180
Who is it?
Who did you give it to?

51
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,420
Oh, there you are!

52
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,890
You're in on this together!

53
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,190
- Right!
- Let's beat her up!

54
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,780
Don't do this!

55
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,220
We're victims, too! We are!

56
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,490
Stop it!

57
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,550
Don't you dare touch her!

58
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,180
We look like a family.

59
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,380
We do.

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,290
Mom, wake me up early tomorrow.

61
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,020
Get everything ready before you go to bed.

62
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,310
And pick out your clothes, too.

63
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,790
Miho, are you going somewhere?

64
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,310
I'm going to camp.

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,050
Mom, I'm going to the bathroom.

66
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,310
She has no siblings,

67
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,340
so I send her to every camp there is.

68
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,850
Good. She is very vibrant and was raised well.

69
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,820
You did a great job raising her.

70
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,490
That's not so. She helped me out a lot.

71
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,490
I made it because of her.

72
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,010
Minjung, thank you.

73
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,840
For what?

74
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,180
For taking your time to be here.

75
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,710
Miho looks very happy.

76
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,440
It's nothing compared to what you've done for me.

77
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,340
Why didn't you get married again?

78
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,920
I'm sure lots of men hit on you.

79
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,990
I'm not that popular.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,610
I know.

81
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,890
How can I, when I have a kid?

82
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,490
But it's not easy for a young woman to be a single mother.

83
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,940
Tell him. He should know Miho's his.

84
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,780
Minjung.

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,090
Yeah?

86
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,520
I have something to tell you.

87
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,280
What is it?

88
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,120
Minjung, don't go into shock...

89
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,010
I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't.

90
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,580
Why are you hesitating? Just tell me.

91
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,580
Minjung, actually...

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,940
Hold on.

93
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,240
Hello?

94
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,790
Minjung.

95
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,550
Where are you?
Can you come here?

96
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,350
Things are crazy here.

97
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,420
What happened?

98
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,940
Your father in law might die!

99
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,640
What?

100
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,420
Okay.

101
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,310
Sunjeong, I have to go to my in law's.

102
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,080
Why? What's wrong?

103
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,450
It must be urgent.

104
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,210
I have to go. I'm sorry.

105
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,740
It's okay. Go.

106
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,140
Quiet down! Quiet!

107
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,490
He was convicted 7 times!

108
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,990
He stole over ten million dollars!

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,510
They don't know if they can catch him.

110
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,790
What do I do?

111
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,050
Even if he's caught,

112
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,220
we won't get our money back!

113
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,420
I can't believe I fell for this!

114
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,650
My money! Where's my money!

115
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,750
Please catch that bastard!

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,090
Father! Father!

117
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,650
Honey.

118
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,450
Where's Subak?

119
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,550
Mom!

120
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,090
You!

121
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,390
Father.

122
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,580
I'm going to kill you.

123
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,610
Father.

124
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,610
Don't stop him! 
Don't stop Bong!

125
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,610
She's not his daughter! She's not!

126
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,990
I knew she'd ruin this family someday!

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,490
Let Bong do what he wants!

128
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,180
You!

129
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,940
Father, father.

130
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,550
How could you do this?

131
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,680
You know what this house means to us!

132
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,810
You know that!

133
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,950
With your father's paycheck,

134
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,880
I saved every penny I could and even worked

135
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,840
as a street vendor and bought this house.

136
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,180
How could you lose it like this?

137
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,790
How could you do such a thing?

138
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,890
How could you?

139
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,350
What do we do?

140
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:01,550
We're going to be homeless now.

141
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,780
Oh, where do we go?

142
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,680
Where will everyone go?

143
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,950
What were you doing?

144
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,450
You didn't know she was stealing the deed?

145
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,890
This is all your fault!

146
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,810
You let your daughter run wild!

147
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,190
Like mother, like daughter!

148
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,890
Yes.

149
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,110
Like mother, like daughter.

150
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,850
You and I should die.

151
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,350
- Mom. Mom. 
- Die!

152
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,240
Subak, hurry up and go upstairs.

153
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,740
You and I should die!

154
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,090
Let's go and die!

155
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,350
Mother!

156
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,590
- Mother!
- Mom!

157
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,110
- Carry her on your back!
- Me?

158
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,350
Let me.

159
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,790
Hurry.

160
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,810
- Mom.
- Mother!

161
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,990
Mother.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,010
- Oh, Bong!
- Bong!

163
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,010
Oh, Bong.

164
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,510
It's an emergency!

165
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,350
- Here.
- Here, here.

166
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,220
- Please take care of her.
- This way.

167
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,990
Bong!

168
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,220
Bong.

169
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,320
Bong, Bong, take this. Take this.

170
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,090
Here.

171
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,490
Mom, we're in big trouble.

172
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,690
Don't tell your mom just yet.

173
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,990
Okay.

174
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,720
Oh, what am I supposed to do now?

175
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,610
My mind is blank.

176
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,010
Hobak, is there anything we can do?

177
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,640
Is there anything, Minjung?

178
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,380
Oh, so there isn't.

179
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,940
What will we do?

180
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,650
What if they all want to move in with us?

181
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,310
This is nuts.

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,850
- Mom.
- Mother.

183
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,820
- Where am I?
- At the hospital.

184
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,740
You passed out, so Minjung carried you.

185
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,850
Let's go.

186
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,380
But you need this fluid.

187
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,910
Mother, you should stay for this.

188
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,580
My insides are burning up,

189
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,450
so how can I just lie down here?

190
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,950
- Get ready for my funeral.
- You can't!

191
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,890
- Mom!
- Mother.

192
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,840
My wife.

193
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,090
I think I married well.

194
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,790
You do?

195
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,040
My mom.

196
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,110
I'd resented her all my life,

197
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,540
but you helped me let it all go.

198
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,710
And because you're good to her,

199
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,420
I'm very happy.

200
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,590
I'm glad you're happy.

201
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,240
But I can't bring myself to call her "mom" yet.

202
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,490
You will, in time.

203
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,220
I hope this happiness lasts a long time.

204
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,090
I've never been this happy before.

205
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,240
Mother, it's me.
Will you please come over?

206
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,280
If you're good to your wife,

207
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,040
your wife will be good to your family.

208
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,780
Jangbi, what do women like?

209
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,040
Designer handbags.

210
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,280
Besides that.

211
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,340
- Money.
- Jangbi!

212
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,490
I'm serious.

213
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,940
They pretend to be happy about flowers.

214
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,490
I'll be back.

215
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,590
How much is it?

216
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,920
It's the best I can do.

217
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,390
Hah!

218
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,690
I must look like a fool to you!

219
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,050
Do I look like a beggar?

220
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,540
I'm your husband's mother.
Your mother in law.

221
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,440
You don't get it?

222
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,490
You think I came all the way here to get a measly $5,000?

223
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,350
You think I'm that easy?

224
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,010
You think you can get away with $5,000?

225
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,040
When I asked you for $50,000?

226
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,040
You think I'm a joke?

227
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,490
You call me mother, mother,

228
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,280
but you have no respect for me.

229
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,910
It's not like that, mother.

230
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,490
I don't understand why you're doing this.

231
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,320
Why can't you understand?

232
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,190
You must be really stupid.

233
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,950
This couldn't be any simpler.

234
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,240
How did you teach your students?

235
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,540
You're a college graduate!

236
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,040
How can you be so dumb?

237
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,010
Mother, you can say anything you want,

238
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,740
but if you want Sangnam and me to be happy,

239
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,990
I don't get why you would do this to me.

240
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,090
I guess you don't want this.

241
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,740
When will you give me the rest?

242
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,540
I can't give you anymore.

243
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,380
What?

244
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,720
Even if I had it, I wouldn't give it to you.

245
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,550
This is the last time.

246
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,510
What?

247
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,740
Sangnam and I promised not to give gifts.

248
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,010
But I gave you $5,000 behind his back.

249
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,010
And I gave you another $5,000.

250
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,680
That's $10,000.

251
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,920
For me, that's a lot of money.

252
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,490
I can't give you anymore.

253
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,090
You're pretty bold.

254
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,690
Which tea house did you work at?

255
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,690
So this is how you want to handle this?

256
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,090
If I put my mind to it...

257
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,550
Please stop.

258
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,990
You can't threaten me.

259
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,510
I'm very disappointed in you.

260
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,510
Sangnam was happy to get you back,

261
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,990
so how can you do this to him?

262
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,240
I'm begging you.

263
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,850
Please think of Sangnam.

264
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,380
I want to respect you as my husband's mother,

265
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,410
but to be honest, I can't do it.

266
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,910
If you keep this up, I'm going to tell

267
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,880
father or aunt and top you from coming here.

268
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,180
What?

269
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,590
This is my son's house!

270
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,090
You don't deserve to be a mother.

271
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,380
Please leave.

272
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,140
I don't deserve to be a mom?

273
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,850
No. You don't.

274
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,090
Please leave.

275
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,990
I never want to see you again.

276
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,540
And I won't call you mother.

277
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,780
Stop it!

278
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,090
Oh, my, Sangnam!

279
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,050
I know I'm not good enough,

280
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,340
but how could she treat me like this?

281
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,720
My heart is pounding and I can't talk.

282
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,490
How can this be?

283
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,240
I won't come here again.

284
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:47,010
I only wanted to see my daughter in law.

285
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,990
- Mother, that's not true!
- Stop it.

286
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,540
Go upstairs.

287
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,810
- Sangnam, it wasn't...
- Go!

288
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,720
Sangnam, Sangnam.

289
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,110
Sangnam, I'm leaving.

290
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,240
I'm okay.

291
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,380
I guess I deserved that.

292
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,790
I just want you to be happy.

293
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,850
I'll call you.

294
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,820
- Sangnam.
Not another word.

295
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,680
It wasn't like that.

296
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,150
I'm disappointed in you.

297
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,490
Just listen to me.

298
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,420
There's no need. I heard everything.

299
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,950
Sangnam.

300
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,450
I was there. Don't make any excuses.

301
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,810
I thought you'd be different.

302
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:09,190
I thought you'd understand how my mom hurt me.

303
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,380
And we just started to make up.

304
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,890
Had I known you were like this,

305
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,420
I wouldn't have told you about my mom.

306
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,280
She brought me into this world.

307
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,240
You can't mistreat her like that.

308
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,650
If you couldn't respect her as my mother,

309
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,890
at least you could be polite.

310
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,790
Don't you owe me that?

311
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:42,580
Denying my birth mother is denying me.

312
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,120
Hobak.

313
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,220
Now?

314
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,520
What happened?

315
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,150
What?

316
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,120
Gwangbak.

317
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,290
What do we do, Hobak?

318
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,280
Mom.

319
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,890
What do we do?

320
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,850
What should we do about this?

321
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,610
Mom.

322
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,220
I'm sure Subak didn't want this.

323
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,780
She was trying to make money.

324
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,110
Ugh...

325
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,190
Don't even bring up Subak.

326
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,890
If it weren't for the others, she'd be dead.

327
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,290
How come she didn't know he was a fraud?

328
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,780
How could she steal the deeds to the house?

329
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,690
She's out of her mind!

330
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,890
She's 38 years old, for goodness sake!

331
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,220
Oh, I can't blame anyone.

332
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,690
I'm the one who raised her.

333
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,850
Mom, mom.

334
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,490
The number you dialed is not in service.

335
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,030
The number you dialed is not in service.

336
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,470
Subak.

337
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:55,330
I wish I was dead.

338
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:01,260
What do we do? What do I do?

339
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,700
Hobak, don't tell my mom.

340
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,940
Okay.

341
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,940
I got the pork.

342
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,570
Then make the kimchi stew.

343
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,060
Me?

344
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,940
Should I call Minjung?

345
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,840
No, it's okay.

346
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,690
I'll do it this time.

347
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,870
This is nuts.

348
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,040
I'll make it perfect.

349
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,340
Jungji, yes.

350
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,190
Have some more.

351
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,290
Here, kimchi stew.

352
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,970
Sedal made this. He's become a pretty good cook these days.

353
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,290
There's pork in it. It looks good.

354
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,740
Father, have some.

355
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,640
Hurry up. Father, eat.

356
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,040
Mom, here.

357
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,470
Why should I bother eating?

358
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,200
We have nowhere to go.

359
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,590
But we're all fine and that's a good thing.

360
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,240
What if someone got hurt or sick?

361
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,640
This is better than that.

362
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,990
You can buy another house.

363
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,700
Another house?

364
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:32,440
But this house is like my life.

365
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,100
Buying a house isn't easy.

366
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,130
It look us our whole lives to buy this house.

367
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,490
So don't just blurt out whatever you think.

368
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,900
This house is like my life.

369
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,300
It can't be as important as your life.

370
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,260
Your life is far more precious.

371
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,260
What Hobak is saying is since we're all...

372
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,670
Be quiet.

373
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,070
You're both useless.

374
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,240
You don't care because you're fine.

375
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,590
Daughters are useless.

376
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,360
Go.

377
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,070
Why did you come here to begin with?

378
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,740
Mom, calm down.

379
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,530
I don't need you either!

380
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,200
You saw what happened to us!

381
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,740
Forget about your dream and study again!

382
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,040
Please.

383
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,590
Please be quiet.

384
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,890
My mind is going wild, so be quiet.

385
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,700
Mother, I'm sorry.

386
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,400
Why should you be?

387
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:51,400
I did a bad job raising my children.

388
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,740
It's all my fault.

389
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,290
Eat.

390
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,240
Hobak, do you have any money?

391
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,840
No?

392
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,760
Don't they have to move?

393
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,290
They have to hand the house over.

394
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,090
Yes.

395
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,960
Should I talk to my father in law?

396
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,240
To see if he can give us a loan?

397
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,470
Don't.

398
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,260
You shouldn't say things like that.

399
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,560
People who ask for loans are the worst.

400
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,260
But our parents are...

401
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,200
Still, you can't.

402
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,360
He won't lend you money, even if you asked.

403
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,340
And you just got married.

404
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,370
I'd be upset if I were him since he doesn't even like you.

405
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,400
Don't tell anyone about what happened.

406
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,200
They'll think less of us.

407
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,700
What do we do about the house?

408
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,990
We'll figure something out.

409
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,970
You have some money, don't you?

410
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,470
Yes.

411
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,530
I shouldn't have given that $10,000.

412
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,290
Who?

413
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,830
Nobody.

414
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,290
I gave  mom some, and that's gone, too.

415
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,830
Who knew this would happen?

416
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,790
I'll try my best.

417
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,700
But you just bought an apartment.

418
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,740
I'll talk to my boss.

419
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,490
Oh, I shouldn't have bought that apartment.

420
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,360
Let's start searching tomorrow.

421
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,440
Okay.

422
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,640
I shouldn't have quit school.

423
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:41,840
If I had my job, it wouldn't be this bad.

424
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,760
Let's not dwell on the past.

425
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,930
What are you doing?

426
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,370
I was getting kimchi.

427
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,140
For instant noodles?

428
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,170
Yes.

429
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,570
You didn't have dinner?

430
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,890
I did, but I'm hungry.

431
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,370
Where's your wife?
Why are you making it?

432
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,870
She's not here.

433
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,100
And she didn't tell you?

434
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,460
She's upset at me.

435
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,100
What?

436
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:39,030
What's the use of sitting here all night?

437
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,360
She's right.
You should go home.

438
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,700
Go.

439
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,490
Oh...

440
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,200
I'm sorry I can't help.

441
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,100
You being here was enough for me.

442
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,490
I'll take Jungji with me.

443
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,590
How will you take care of him?

444
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,830
Minjung, I'll take care of him.

445
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,990
She and I will take care of him.

446
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,830
There are chores, and mother's sick,

447
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,290
so I'll take him for a few days.

448
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,970
Father.

449
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,940
Where were you?

450
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,470
I...

451
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,700
Were you at your parents house?

452
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,840
No, I wasn't.

453
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,740
You told me not to go there.

454
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,260
I had some things to take care...

455
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,740
Things?

456
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,870
How can you just go out without a word?

457
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,740
I'm sorry.

458
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,090
This will never happen again.

459
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,340
You keep doing the same thing over and over.

460
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,240
I feel nervous all day because of you.

461
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,700
I worry about how you'll piss me off again.

462
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,200
And how I'm supposed to deal with it.

463
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,170
It's like I'm at war with you.

464
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,800
Why do I have to go through this?

465
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,090
Especially after that letter you wrote?

466
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,530
You know how hard your husband works?

467
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,760
I do.

468
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,170
Then how could you do this?

469
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,530
He works from 6 am to 6 pm every day.

470
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,670
Even if he eats 3 meals a day,

471
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,940
he still gets hungry at night.

472
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,940
How could you let him eat instant noodles?

473
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,940
I'm sorry.

474
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,940
And you're giving him the silent treatment?

475
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,470
Why are you mad at him?

476
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,940
Don't you know  how stressful it is for a man

477
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,030
if his wife is home, all mad at him?

478
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,790
He wasn't himself today at work, and this was why.

479
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,330
What if there was an accident?

480
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,790
Working with heavy equipment is dangerous!

481
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,200
You're unbelievable!

482
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,930
Is there money in there?

483
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,740
It's empty.

484
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,740
I'm going to talk to my boss.

485
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,070
You were least loved growing up,

486
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,390
but now, you're their greatest hope.

487
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,990
You're acting like their firstborn.

488
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,790
Do your parents know this?

489
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,440
I'm not looking for appreciation.

490
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,530
I'm doing this because it's my duty.

491
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,990
Gwangbak's going to help. too.

492
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,140
I can't believe what Subak did.

493
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,040
I didn't want to stop your father before.

494
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,700
- What's going on?
- Excuse me?

495
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,660
Your parents called you over.

496
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,370
Yeongdal called, but she hung up on me.

497
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,370
We had dinner together.

498
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,840
Is Yeongdal doing okay?

499
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,860
Yes, she looked fine.

500
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,940
She didn't even say hi to me.

501
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,370
She's not being pushed around?

502
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,200
They are treating her like a princess.

503
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,640
She doesn't do a thing.

504
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,440
Her mother in law is spoon feeding her.

505
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,600
She should.

506
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,690
They all should treat her like a princess.

507
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,470
But the good days are over.

508
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,900
- What?
- Huh?

509
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,370
It's nothing.

510
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:26,440
This is nutty, nutty, nuts.
Nutty, nutty...

511
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,370
Don't wait for me.
I'm pulling an all niter.

512
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,570
Subak, wait.

513
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,600
Meeting you again made me so happy.

514
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,830
This is too worn, so I can't give you much.

515
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,490
And this is a knock off.

516
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,900
A knock off?

517
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,800
It's an imitation.

518
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,030
Mom, here.

519
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,740
I sold my handbag.

520
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,570
I wish I had more things to sell,

521
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:11,360
but that was the only one I had.

522
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:17,800
Mom, I'm sorry.

523
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,940
I did a horrible thing.

524
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,290
Mom, try some of this.

525
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,530
I'll make rice for dinner later.

526
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,390
I don't want anything.

527
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,670
You're the only one who can save us now,

528
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,770
so you have to study again, judge.

529
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,930
Subak,

530
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,240
I poured water in, so give it 3 minutes.

531
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,640
I can't eat anymore.

532
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,370
You think you deserve to eat?

533
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,540
You still get hungry?

534
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,700
I don't want to see you, so get out!

535
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,590
Your mom and dad are dying now,

536
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,330
and you're sitting here eating?

537
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,790
You're shameless, aren't you?

538
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,430
- How dare you sit here?
- Grandmother.

539
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,740
If you weren't here, we'd be trouble free!

540
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:08,660
Everything happened because of you! Get out!

541
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,740
Go somewhere and die or something!

542
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,290
I can't believe her!

543
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,370
What is it, Hobak?

544
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,370
Father, we found a house.

545
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,870
Can you and mom come and have a look?

546
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,900
You did?

547
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,860
Gwangbak and I found one.

548
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,100
It's not that nice, but come anyway.

549
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,160
Okay. I will.

550
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,270
Father.

551
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,540
Is it here?

552
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,400
Yes. Go in.

553
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,060
You can move in right away.

554
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,290
Have a look.

555
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,070
Okay.

556
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,740
It's not the best...

557
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:06,790
We won't be able to find anything nicer.

558
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,560
They don't have anything available.

559
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,390
If you have money, you could get one.

560
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,360
We'll put new wallpaper up tonight.

561
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,740
I'm sorry, father.

562
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,160
Nothing else was available right away,

563
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,090
and we didn't have that much money.

564
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,500
Thank you.

565
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,790
We're sorry we couldn't find a better house.

566
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,970
Mom, we're sorry.

567
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,700
It's okay.

568
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:54,600
I was worried about where to live,

569
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,900
but thanks to you two, I'm relieved.

570
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,260
Thank you, really.

571
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,870
Hobak.

572
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,540
Yes, Minjung.

573
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,640
What happened?

574
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,240
We found a place and signed the lease.

575
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,430
They're moving in tomorrow.

576
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,530
Good.

577
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,670
I'm sorry. I wish I could help.

578
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,390
It's okay. Thanks for asking.

579
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,790
But you don't need to do anymore.

580
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,600
I'm really sorry.

581
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:51,700
I think uncle called because he didn't know what to do.

582
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,240
Goodbye, Minjung.

583
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,160
If you're done with that, make barely tea.

584
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,740
Did you hear me?

585
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,640
Huh? Oh, you said something?

586
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,790
It's okay. I'll do it.

587
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,060
Let's talk.

588
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:24,000
I heard about last night.

589
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,340
I don't think your father in law slept well.

590
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,760
I'm sorry.

591
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,970
You're smart, so I thought you'd be wise.

592
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,200
I heard you went out without telling anyone.

593
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,930
That's bad manners.

594
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,970
You should say where you're going.

595
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,240
And you made Sangnam eat instant noodles.

596
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,790
His father really hates that.

597
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,740
I'm sorry.

598
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,600
And you're not speaking to each other?

599
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,100
It's just you two here.

600
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,830
So when you fight, you must make up quickly.

601
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,740
Don't let me or your father in law find out.

602
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,060
That's why living with your in laws is hard.

603
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:09,470
If you couldn't do it, you shouldn't have moved in.

604
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,890
And you shouldn't make mistakes.

605
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,200
I won't.

606
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,740
How can you be fighting already?

607
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,500
Sangnam didn't come home last night, right?

608
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,640
He had to work.

609
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,790
Sangnam has always slept at home.

610
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,740
I wanted to make things easier for you,

611
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,390
so I scolded Daese and Sangnam,

612
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,930
but I don't think I should've done that.

613
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,830
Sangnam is a very considerate person.

614
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,100
He's never done this before.

615
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,970
I don't know what you did,

616
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,100
but if it's your fault, apologize to him.

617
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,290
Don't make things awkward for everyone.

618
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,100
I will.

619
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,440
And don't cry so often.

620
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,970
When someone has given you advice,

621
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,330
you should take it. Why would you cry?

622
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,160
You're making me look bad here.

623
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,360
Did I say anything wrong?

624
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,100
No, I'm sorry.

625
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,670
This is our last meal here.

626
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,990
Don't cry, mother.

627
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,740
Things happen.

628
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,240
Let's eat.

629
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:21,100
I remember when we first moved here.

630
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:25,600
I was so happy we were able to buy a house.

631
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:30,870
We sent rice cakes to every neighbor.

632
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,640
When was that?

633
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:39,160
I was in 8th grade.
Subak was in 9th grade.

634
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,130
Haebak and Daebak weren't even born.

635
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,330
I was in 7th grade.

636
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,970
Things went so well after we moved here.

637
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,790
I had Haebak and Daebak.

638
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,490
It was a very lucky house for us.

639
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,400
We didn't even have room before then.

640
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,630
Remember, Hobak?

641
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:02,060
There were only two rooms,

642
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:06,430
so we all share one room with grandmother.

643
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,430
I slept next to Bong and Anggeum.

644
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,200
Right.

645
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,390
I was so happy when we moved here.

646
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,630
And mom and I had our own room.

647
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,830
You did? That's so interesting.

648
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,540
Gwangbak and I became friends in middle school,

649
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:34,000
and visiting this house was so much fun.

650
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,200
There were so many people,

651
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,830
and everyone went wild over food.

652
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:45,860
Grandmother saying "The Korean War was nothing compared to this!

653
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,770
and Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo" was so funny.

654
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:54,570
Father, we'll be fine in the new house.

655
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:57,930
My father's in heaven right now.

656
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,160
Right.

657
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,630
The new house will be small.

658
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,670
Why don't you go back to your mother?

659
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,060
I won't.

660
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,170
She won't.

661
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,470
We want to stay together, Bong.

662
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,890
Cold! Hey, stop!

663
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,240
Come here! How dare you!

664
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,660
Hey, be careful, be careful.

665
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,530
I envy you.

666
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,900
Yeongdal, go home if you don't want to help.

667
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,000
Don't yell at my wife!

668
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,700
This is nuts.

669
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,970
Yeongdal, bring me that broom.

670
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,530
Don't. Even I don't have her do anything.

671
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,370
Heo Yeongdal.

672
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,440
Okay.

673
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,760
Here.

674
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,970
Hobak, what's taking you so long?

675
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,160
Hurry up and finish that!

676
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,700
Loser, she's my wife.

677
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,140
She's my niece.

678
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,290
I need help.

679
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,140
- Okay!
- Okay!

680
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,290
- Man...
- Man...

681
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,240
She was talking to me, not you.

682
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,890
- Not true, Goof-off.
- Right.

683
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,140
Good job! Ask me, not him, if you need anything.

684
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,290
This is nutty, nutty, nuts!

685
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,060
You said you'd respect me!

686
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,830
When?

687
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,470
Whoa! I can't believe you!

688
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,330
When you asked for my permission!

689
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,990
I don't remember.

690
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:34,600
Loser! You!

691
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,930
Why you little! Come here! Come here!

692
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,600
Why are you hitting me?

693
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,030
Let me go!

694
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,370
Hey! Stop!

695
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,430
Just pack what we need.

696
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,990
We'll send the rest to storage.

697
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:47,740
Good job, Bong.

698
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,900
You too.

699
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,290
Did you say goodbye to every corner?

700
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,160
I don't think I can say goodbye.

701
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:37,990
My eyes keep tearing up.

702
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:45,330
We fixed every corner of this house.

703
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:51,270
When we first moved here,

704
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:58,300
it needed a lot of fixing up.

705
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:04,060
The front door, every windowsill,

706
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:07,430
the floors...

707
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,130
We oiled them and painted them.

708
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:18,290
We polished them and scrubbed them.

709
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:25,100
It was our house, so it didn't matter.

710
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:27,900
We just couldn't believe this was ours.

711
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,860
We thought it was a dream come true.

712
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:38,000
Remember when we hung the doorplate up?

713
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:47,030
Hanging that plate up with your name on it,

714
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,700
I thought the hard days were finally over.

715
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:55,240
I couldn't believe it.

716
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:59,890
We had finally bought a house.

717
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:09,170
Remember how hard we cried that night?

718
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:26,240
Will I be able to hang this up again?

719
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:34,100
The kids say we can start again,

720
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:39,670
but I'm over 60, so how can I?

721
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:47,660
I won't ever have my own house again.

722
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,560
I'm too old to get a job.

723
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:55,760
I wouldn't even be hired as a housekeeper!

724
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:05,030
If we were young, we'd have time,

725
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:10,270
but we're nearly at the end of our time.

726
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,300
And that breaks my heart.

727
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:21,290
I wish this happened when I was younger.

728
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,700
Now that my house is gone,

729
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,540
there's no joy left in the world.

730
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,390
My knees are giving in.

731
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:43,470
I don't think I can stand up again.

732
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,660
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

733
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,970
This is nuts.

734
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,530
Keep going, a little more.

735
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:33,940
Are we there yet?
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

736
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,160
I should put this here.

737
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,200
Hold on.

738
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,970
- Hey, hey, hey. 
- Be careful.

739
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,970
Oh, give it to me.

740
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:48,700
Let it go.

741
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,830
Oh, hold on.

742
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,660
I'll see you again, Salla.

743
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,290
Goodbye, Daese.

744
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,030
- I'll call you.
- And text me, too.

745
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:24,790
I'm fine.

746
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,740
I think we're settled in, Bong.

747
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,540
We're a big family, so that didn't take very long.

748
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,140
Why don't you spray some water here?

749
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,870
Good job, everyone.

750
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,240
Mother, good job.

751
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:48,740
Let's try to do our best here.

752
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,540
Here.

753
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,070
Here.

754
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,500
Let's put our hearts together.
We can do it!

755
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:00,470
We can do it! We can do it! We can do it!

756
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,240
Father,

757
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:06,640
my stomach's been growling like crazy!

758
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:09,100
You must be hungry.
Mother, are you hungry?

759
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:11,640
I've been starving to death!

760
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,370
Should we order something?

761
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,100
Yes, let's order some Chinese.

762
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:16,370
- What should we order?
- Noodles!

763
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,370
- I want...
- Fried rice.

764
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,540
- Fried rice.
- Noodles?

765
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,070
Black bean noodles?
Noodle soup?

766
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,530
Hey, how can you put your hearts together

767
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:28,940
when you can't even agree on the menu?

768
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,790
It's black bean noodles for everyone, then.

769
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,660
- Loser.
- Is this the Chinese place?

770
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,790
It's so small we can't even sit together.

771
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,740
It's suffocating.

772
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,790
I like sitting this close together.

773
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,030
Me too.

774
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:47,200
I can see everyone's faces better. It's nice.

775
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,540
More love comes from smaller homes.

776
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:51,340
Right, mother?

777
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:55,290
I can't believe my ears!

778
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,260
Don't steal my lines.

779
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,300
Maybe I should've made some rice.

780
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,370
You're supposed to eat this when you move.

781
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:07,560
It's actually not that bad.
It was fun.

782
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,590
How should we decide on the rooms?

783
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:19,400
- Rooms? 
- It's me.

784
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,200
Huh?

785
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,370
Oh, Minjung, welcome.

786
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,970
- Oh, Jungji.
- Get that for him.

787
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,430
I'm sorry, baby.

788
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,970
Oh, yes, yes.

789
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,830
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

790
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:34,700
How precious.

791
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,830
It's a bit shabby, huh?

792
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:44,260
But Hobak and Gwangbak did a good job.

793
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:50,200
I didn't even see you taking Jungji.

794
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:52,930
How did you make deliveries with a kid?

795
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,430
I'm not doing that anymore.

796
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,530
The how will you support yourself?

797
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,870
I'm running my old company again.

798
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,240
Huh?

799
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:04,390
The creditors didn't like the man they hired,

800
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,830
so they asked me back.

801
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:11,030
It's not mine yet, but after 3 years,

802
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:13,200
they'll give it back to me.

803
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,540
Oh, Minjung!

804
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:20,270
That's great news. The hard days are over.

805
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,840
Good for you.
Congratulations.

806
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,740
Minjung's the only lucky one.

807
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,000
Minjung, come by often.

808
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:40,740
I'm very sorry for leaving my children here.

809
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,530
Thanks. I'll take it.

810
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,940
I'll come and take them when I can.

811
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,830
You should get back together with Subak.

812
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,490
You should see her before you go.

813
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,700
I should go.

814
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:01,390
Right. It's cold. Go.

815
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,760
The living room is too cold.

816
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:15,100
Women, big room, men, small room.

817
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,740
Man...

818
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,030
Ugh...

819
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,440
Go.

820
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,560
Oh, boy.

821
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,140
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

822
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,140
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo!

823
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,130
Mother, are you asleep?

824
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,600
No!

825
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:42,290
We can't do this to the newlyweds.

826
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,160
I can't sleep.

827
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:45,970
Yeongdal.

828
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,060
How can we sleep like this?

829
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,100
I know. What can we do?

830
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:51,700
Oh, boy.

831
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,660
Oh, my baby.

832
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,600
Oh, boy.

833
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:06,100
There's no room!
Go sleep with your uncle.

834
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:14,700
Uncle.

835
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,590
Come here, Daebak.
Sleep with me.

836
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,900
Father, this is wrong.

837
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,990
I agree with you.

838
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,200
Who suggested this?

839
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,290
Mother should sleep in the room.

840
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,970
Bong, I can't sleep with you out here.

841
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,790
We don't have to sleep together.

842
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,700
What do we do then?

843
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,030
Oh, cold.

844
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:59,670
Uncle's cold, too.

845
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,640
What?

846
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:16,870
Ouch! Who was that?

847
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,170
Oh, that Yeongdal!

848
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,470
What is it?

849
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,830
I can't believe this.

850
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,330
This is all your fault!

851
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:37,490
You caused misery for the whole family.

852
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:40,600
Because of you, the family's ruined!

853
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:44,440
First your ruin Minjung, and now your father!

854
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,470
I don't want to see your face!

855
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,370
Grandmother, stop.
It's hard for her, too.

856
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:54,440
No, it's not!
She does whatever she wants.

857
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,200
You drove Minjung into bankruptcy,

858
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:01,290
and now look at him!

859
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,640
After he divorced you, things got better.

860
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:10,740
Your mean personality caused all this!

861
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,270
Grandmother.

862
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,970
How dare you sleep here? Get out!

863
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:28,560
I hate everyone who breaks my son's heart.

864
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:30,790
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo...

866
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:31,240
I'll get the house back, no matter what.

867
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,270
I won't come back before that.

868
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,740
Father, please forgive me.

869
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:35,890
Where is she?

870
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,360
She won't come back without money.

871
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,200
You threw her out!

872
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,200
What?

873
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:43,200
How can you make my daughter live here?

874
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:44,970
Mrs. Park, calm down.

875
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,370
You stay out!

876
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,790
What's going on?

877
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,140
Apologize for what you did.

878
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:50,770
My son's on my side.

879
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,470
So don't get cheeky.
