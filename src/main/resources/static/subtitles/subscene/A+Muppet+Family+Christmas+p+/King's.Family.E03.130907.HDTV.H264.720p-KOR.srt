2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,290
What's this?

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,680
Black bean noodles.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,160
I know what it is.
Why did you order this?

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,870
It's for father.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,870
What?

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,870
Tell your father to come and eat.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,140
It's been a year since his last visit.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,910
It's the first time since mother's death.

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,010
How can you just order him noodles?

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,300
And it's not even special noodles.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,810
How much was the dinner you just had?

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,860
He's my father, my father!

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,590
But there's nothing to eat at home!

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,400
The housekeeper is gone and I can't cook!

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,410
You could at least make an effort!

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,420
Have you ever cooked a meal for my father?

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,660
Even if you don't know how to cook,
can't you at least feign to make an effort?

19
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,840
Why are you yelling at me?
Why?

20
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,650
Stop it, please.
Why are you doing that?

21
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,650
Don't fight.

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,800
All I need is some rice.

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,640
I said stop.

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,410
It's father's fault, too.

25
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,750
Why couldn't he call us ahead?

26
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,240
How can he just show up out of the blue?

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,320
But this is his son's house!

28
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,380
I'm not comfortable!

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,350
You're uncomfortable?

30
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,460
Deal with it because we have to live with him.

31
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,290
What did you say?
Live with your father?

32
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,170
Yes, starting right now.

33
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,330
You don't want to live with me?
What is it?

34
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,030
I did everything I could for your family.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,570
Why can't you do this one thing for me?

36
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,220
You might think he's an embarrassment,
an aged country folk, but he's my father.

37
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,040
He's still my father.

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,170
He brought me into this world and raised me.

39
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,340
He made me who I am!

40
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,810
I did my best, too.

41
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,000
I sent him money monthly and on holidays.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,760
What more do you want?

43
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,750
I'm your wife.

44
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,460
So how can you bring him without consulting with me first?

45
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,980
Ask anybody.

46
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,790
Who'd welcome such a situation?

47
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,080
You just said that you're my wife, right?

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Yes, so what?

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,010
This is what being married means?

50
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,630
This is...

51
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,900
- It was a woman before...
- This is Kim Siyeon.

52
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,680
You sound so young.

53
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,870
Living youthfully will do it!
Enjoy life!

54
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,210
She's really funny.

55
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,770
Don't you dare tell anyone!

56
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,340
Oh, I'm going nuts.

57
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,250
What's wrong with you?

58
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,580
Ugh, I should keep my mouth busy.

59
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,770
Isn't there anything to munch on?

60
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,600
Mom, are there any snacks?

61
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,130
Anggeum!

62
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,860
- What is it?
- Fry them some dumplings.

63
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,100
Mom...

64
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,430
It's okay, Anggeum.

65
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,920
Being well-fed is very important.

66
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,420
I shouldn't have to ask you to get snacks for my young son.

67
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,170
I don't believe how dense you are.

68
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,020
To be frank, he's not so young.

69
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,740
I know. Don't bother, Anggeum.

70
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,450
I'm serious, I'm okay.

71
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,310
Sedal, I want to talk to you before you go.

72
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,970
Just fry me two.
Don't fry too many.

73
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,970
Hey, I'm leaving.

74
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,090
- Hey, watch that.
- The mood is...

75
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,860
- I'm home.
- Oh, you're home!

76
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,440
- Daebak, did you eat?
- Yes.

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,000
What did you eat?

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I grabbed something with my friends.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,080
You should always get a proper meal.

80
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,260
Eating is saving, you know?

81
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,840
Hi, Daebak.

82
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,320
Hello, there.

83
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,370
Uncle, aren't you wasting time?

84
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,890
I have plenty of time, so I'm not wasting it.

85
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,720
It's because you don't have a dream.

86
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,950
Sedal, what's your dream?

87
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,380
Rich man.

88
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,910
No need to ask.
What else could be there?

89
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,080
At least Sedal has a dream, even though it's impossible, so why don't you have one?

90
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,530
Is it becoming a lonely old man?
That's possible.

91
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,780
Why that little...

92
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,600
A lonely old man?
How dare you?

93
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,480
You should grow up!

94
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,930
Don't tell your sister in law I fled.

95
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,180
Tell me what you've been dying to tell me.

96
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,140
You must keep it a secret.

97
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,280
Or your niece will murder me.

98
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,450
Okay.

99
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,110
For real?

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,220
Oh, no! This is really bad.

101
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,160
Why didn't they clean up after themselves?

102
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,900
Why do I always have to do it? Man!

103
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,830
Anggeum, I'll do it.

104
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,720
Where's Sedal?

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,300
I guess he left.
He didn't even say goodbye.

106
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,070
What are you doing?

107
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,250
- Get out.
- After I do this.

108
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,610
Get out right now!

109
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,630
Go, uncle.

110
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,430
Mother, you shouldn't be like that.

111
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,250
Men these days must help with the chores.

112
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,120
You raise your boy that way, for I won't stand it.

113
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,120
His own nephew doesn't respect him,

114
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
and now you want him to do the dishes?

115
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,480
Mom!

116
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,070
It's Subak. How nice!

117
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,670
Anggeum, your favorite daughter is here.

118
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,770
Mom, let's go.

119
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,800
How dare you treat him like this?

120
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,270
He's supposed to become a great man,
so treat him properly, understand?

121
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,270
Supposed to be?

122
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,750
Shouldn't he already be?

123
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,010
Did you have a fight with grandmother?

124
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,510
She didn't even say hi.

125
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,550
I don't want to talk about it.

126
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,200
Why are you here?
Your kids went to bed.

127
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,920
Where's father?

128
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
At his class reunion.

129
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,510
- Today?
- Yes.

130
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,430
My sister in law brought him.

131
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,690
I won't live with my father in law.

132
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,990
That old man must be crazy.

133
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,480
Why would he come just because his daughter brought him?

134
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,090
Living with a single father in law is hard!

135
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,670
I know.

136
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,080
Don't tell father.
He'll yell at me.

137
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,180
I was sitting at the playground until now.

138
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,780
Let me give you a tip.

139
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,600
Don't fall for me.

140
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,180
I hate it when women cry.

141
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,640
Nutty, nutty, nuts! Man!

142
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,850
You didn't tell uncle, did you?

143
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,500
It nearly drove me mad holding it in.

144
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,950
Oh, I'm so worried I can't sleep.

145
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,110
You can't be worried about Minjung.

146
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,570
I'm worried he might ask for a loan.

147
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,780
Don't you lend him money.

148
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,180
I don't have any to lend.

149
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,160
He never paid attention when I asked for a loan.

150
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,650
I bet he didn't see this coming!

151
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,800
Life can be mysterious,

152
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,030
interesting, delicious, funny,

153
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,080
lame, crazy, awkward.

154
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
You're really enjoying this, huh?

155
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,160
They're family.
How can you be so happy?

156
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,000
I am happy, so what?

157
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,490
To be frank, I'm a pretty handsome man.

158
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,010
But I'm always compared to him.

159
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,450
His eyes are bulging out, too!

160
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,930
So why does your mom always pick on me?

161
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,170
But Minjung's fair skinned and handsome.

162
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,960
He's not dark like you!

163
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,120
Turn the lights off.

164
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,870
This is nuts.

165
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,370
Turn the lights off.

166
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,530
For me, it doesn't matter if they're on.

167
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,340
Leave me alone. I'm tired.

168
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,580
I should look for a husband for Gwangbak.

169
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,820
Someone with eyes bulging out.

170
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,800
That'd be so funny.

171
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,620
Three sons in law with eyes bulging out.

172
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,470
With googly eyes.
Looking here and there.

173
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,040
74, 75.

174
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,550
Hey! Who's there?

175
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,550
To me, my father's the most important.

176
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,530
If we fall into the river,
I'd save him first.

177
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,760
You take care of him!
It's your duty!

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,030
Why is Subak sleeping here?

179
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,590
She came to get the kids but decided to stay.

180
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,130
What is it?

181
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,410
Of all my classmates,
I'm the most successful.

182
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,310
They must all be losers.

183
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,660
Middle school vice principal is the most successful?

184
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,820
It's not about the money.

185
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,180
Having a job at my age is really lucky.

186
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,810
The others are all unemployed.

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,690
You don't have that many years left.

188
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,000
On top of that,

189
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,290
they're still living with their children.

190
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,890
They call them kangaroos or salmon.

191
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,840
What's that?

192
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,790
Kangaroos are the children who are adults but single and living with their parents.

193
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,500
We have one, too.

194
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,190
A kangaroo inside his sister in law's pouch.

195
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,470
How about the salmon?

196
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,810
Those who are married but have moved back into their parents house.

197
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,470
Salmon return home to spawn.

198
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,880
At least salmon spawn, but children return to take advantage of their old parents.

199
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,210
We're lucky we don't have any salmon.

200
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,920
Don't be so sure.

201
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,910
Look at how Sedal is doing.

202
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm afraid of Hobak wanting to move in here.

203
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,060
Of course, I would never let her.

204
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,550
Hobak would never do that.

205
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,500
She's quite capable of making a living.

206
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,840
I hope I have a long life.

207
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,940
At least until Daebak gets on his own two feet.

208
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,810
Subak said she'll take care of Daebak.

209
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,960
But he's my child.

210
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,440
Subak's rich.
She can take care of him.

211
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,260
Besides, he's her little brother.

212
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,690
Then why are you mean to Don?

213
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,430
He's my brother.

214
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,210
Well, that's that and this is this.

215
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,600
You always turn on me like this.

216
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,910
Go to sleep!

217
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,710
Sangnam's not here.

218
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,580
And Mr. Yang's excavator's broken.

219
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,350
Okay. I'll be right over.

220
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,520
Sangnam's not home?

221
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,710
He said it's his friend's birthday.

222
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,650
He probably slept over at a friends after drinking.

223
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,310
Don't worry, Daese.

224
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,740
I'm not worried, but he's never done this before.

225
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,160
Even if he's wasted, he doesn't miss work.

226
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,380
Are you keeping something from me?

227
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,360
No, what would I hide from you?

228
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,790
Do you still keep in touch with her?

229
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,360
No, I haven't been for a while now.

230
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,170
I don't even know where she is now.

231
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,060
Even if you find her, don't tell Sangnam.

232
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,460
I don't care if you see her,
 but not Sangnam.

233
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,260
But what if he runs into her somewhere...

234
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,810
I said no.

235
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,520
She's your sister, so you can see her, but not my son.

236
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,070
I don't want to hurt him.

237
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,040
He's only just recovered.

238
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,590
Don't you understand?

239
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,030
I do.

240
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,850
Of course I do.
I feel the same way.

241
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:46,100
If you mess things up for Sangnam,
I'll never forgive you.

242
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,950
Hello?

243
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,690
Father!

244
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,940
Minjung, I'm going home.

245
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,440
Don't worry about me.

246
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:35,190
I'm more comfortable at my own home.

247
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,450
I didn't come to burden you.

248
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,740
I just missed you.

249
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,150
That's why I came up with Minsuk.

250
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,720
So don't fight because of me.

251
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,140
Take care of your family.

252
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,880
I can still manage on my own.

253
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,650
If I get really bored, I'll get a dog.

254
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,910
Minjung,

255
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,740
I'll hold your mother's memorial services until the day I die.

256
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,870
I won't let my daughter in law do it.

257
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,600
Goodbye.

258
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,090
You don't look so good.

259
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,340
Whatever's going on, don't skip meals.

260
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,660
Take care, son.

261
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,310
Father...

262
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,940
Father...

263
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,310
Anyone home?

264
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,050
Careful. You'll get hurt.

265
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,640
Parcel service.

266
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,690
Yes, I'm on my way.

267
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,570
You're home right now?

268
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,810
Okay.

269
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,750
This is number 102.

270
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,820
I'm sorry.

271
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,620
Excuse me, but where's number 103?

272
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,250
It's over there.

273
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,460
Pardon?

274
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,620
Yes.

275
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,410
Yes, I'm on my way.

276
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,490
You're home, right?

277
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,980
Hey, I called go 3 times, right?
I scored.

278
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,400
Oh you poor thing!
Hand over the money.

279
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,560
- No, no!
- Hey! Hey!

280
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,500
Why you little...
Hey! Stop right there!

281
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,280
Why are you running around like kids?

282
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,600
My Minjung, you're not hurt, are you?

283
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,240
- Oh...
- Are you hurt? Oh, no.

284
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,190
Uncle, are you okay?

285
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,960
Why don't you look where you're going?

286
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,280
What if your uncle broke his bone?

287
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,760
I'm sorry.

288
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,890
But that was uncle's fault, not Minjung's.

289
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,550
Oh, what brings you here?

290
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,660
You didn't have to bring anything.

291
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,210
- Come and sit down.
- Okay.

292
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,970
The kids...

293
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,950
Jungji's napping and Aeji's at kindergarten.

294
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,530
Would you like something to drink?

295
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,900
I'm okay.

296
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,380
I heard your father came?

297
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,860
He left.

298
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,030
He did?

299
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,390
Good! Subak couldn't take care of him.

300
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,590
Why not?
Subak's the eldest daughter in law.

301
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,520
She should, eventually.

302
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,560
But right now, the kids are young,
and Subak can't run the house.

303
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,630
You will have a say if you take care of your in laws.

304
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,210
I don't know about that, but she will someday.

305
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,510
But living together would be uncomfortable for both parties.

306
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,810
I'm not at a place where I can bring him in.

307
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,100
Oh, that's great news.

308
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,650
That's not great news.

309
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,700
Well, there's something I must tell you.

310
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,740
What is it?

311
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,990
I don't think you should.

312
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,000
Well...

313
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,610
What's wrong with you?

314
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,470
Just thinking about it is funny.

315
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,470
There was someone who looked just like him.

316
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:26,580
I went to the market and saw a parcel service man who looks just like Minjung.

317
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,020
That's not Minjung. No way.

318
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,370
Of course not.

319
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,940
You might feel offended, but he looked just like you, from the back and even the voice.

320
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,160
There are many people who look alike.

321
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,830
Looking alike doesn't mean anything.

322
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,990
What if Subak married a man like him?

323
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,670
Don't you agree, my Minjung?

324
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,440
Huh? Yes, well...

325
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,580
Why am I sweating?

326
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,780
Oh, you said you want to tell me something?

327
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,170
I know what that is.

328
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,940
Excuse me?

329
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,360
The parcel service, I know.

330
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,570
If Sedal knows, I know.

331
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,370
I should tell her but I can't.

332
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,180
I understand.

333
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,180
Cheer up.

334
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,020
I've never even had a job,
but you've always run your own business.

335
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,310
What's life?

336
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,090
If you don't own, you rent.

337
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,750
You're either unemployed or have a part time job.

338
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,340
Hey, Madam Park Salla!

339
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,680
How come there's nobody here?

340
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,790
I'm so frustrated.

341
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,530
The new beauty salon stole my customers.

342
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,690
This is not good.

343
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,660
Want me to take my guys there and teach them a lesson?

344
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,450
You can't even teach your wife a lesson.

345
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,300
It's not that I can't but that I won't.

346
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,020
I feel sorry for her ugly face.

347
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,140
She's not just ugly.

348
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,780
She's too stingy.
Worse than Scrooge.

349
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,820
Sedal, why don't you talk to her?

350
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,230
You know she can't be persuaded into anything.

351
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,220
That only worked once for me.

352
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,620
When she got pregnant with Sintong.

353
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,340
You didn't persuade her.
She seduced you!

354
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,400
Thinking about that makes me mad.

355
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,640
There were so many rich girls after you,
but you went and fell for that ugly girl!

356
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,060
I know.

357
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,110
I'm going nuts.

358
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,130
Sis!

359
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,620
I'm here.

360
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,860
This is so nice.

361
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,770
You'll need a few dresses.

362
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,810
Dresses?

363
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,640
They are a must when you go on a cruise.

364
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,930
There'll be parties at night.

365
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,270
I'll buy you a few.

366
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,440
Oh, my!

367
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,170
That'll turn my friends green with envy.

368
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,570
I'll be the only one to go on a cruise in this town.

369
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,340
I need to lose this belly to fit into a dress.

370
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,130
What's up?

371
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,420
She wanted to talk, so I told her to come.

372
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,500
Sit.

373
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,550
Can we go out?

374
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,320
Say it here.
What is it?

375
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,860
Let's go out, Subak.

376
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,930
Why? Talk here. Is it a secret?

377
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,990
It's about mom's birthday.

378
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,940
I'll pay for it, so you don't have to do it.

379
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,090
Why? Why would you do it?

380
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,840
Because I want to.

381
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,730
I've never heard such nonsense in all my life!

382
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,730
Is it because I yelled at you?

383
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,610
I can't throw a huge party like Subak.

384
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,210
We can do that for your 70th birthday.

385
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,850
Let's make this one simple.

386
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,460
What's wrong with you?

387
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,030
Just do what Hobak says.

388
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,380
Mom, let's do that.

389
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,310
We can't do a hotel buffet,

390
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,710
but we can go to a nice Chinese...

391
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,710
No!

392
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,130
Let's do that, Anggeum.

393
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,180
Don't be like this.

394
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,100
Why don't you just pitch in, then?

395
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
Listen to Hobak.

396
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,840
You stay out of this!

397
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,240
You don't even know what's going on.

398
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,720
But I do, unfortunately.

399
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,650
Why are you doing this?

400
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,830
Don't ask why.

401
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,240
Just do what Hobak says.

402
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,830
Hobak never spends her money unwisely.

403
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,230
I know.

404
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,090
So I need to know why.

405
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,580
I already made reservations at the hotel.

406
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,730
Cancel them.
Don't lose the down payment.

407
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,400
Listen to Hobak.
Don't blow the money.

408
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,720
You stay out of this!

409
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,370
Right! Why do you keep butting in?

410
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,830
I have good reasons.

411
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,210
When someone says something, listen!

412
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,940
Why do you have to nitpick?

413
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,940
You're not in the situation to do that!

414
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,440
Uncle!

415
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,570
My situation?
What do you mean by that?

416
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,910
Oh, man!

417
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,380
Was it Sedal?
Uncle, let's go.

418
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,150
- Tell me!
- Yes, tell us, uncle.

419
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,280
Uncle...

420
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,350
They'll find out anyway.
Let's tell them.

421
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,630
Your dear Minjung went bankrupt and lost his company.

422
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,330
So how can you afford a hotel or a cruise?

423
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,070
Oh, I can't believe I had to say this.

424
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,810
- Subak.
- Sis.

425
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,980
Be careful.

426
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,820
The doctor says you're healthy for your age.

427
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,980
Okay.

428
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,490
Be careful.

429
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,820
- Only two more trips to the doctor's.
- Okay.

430
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,160
Parcel service.

431
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,350
I left it with the guard like you asked.

432
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,130
Thank you.

433
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,550
- Yes?
- Why is your phone always busy?

434
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,800
Tell me what happened!

435
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,260
Your company went bankrupt?

436
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,260
Come home right now!

437
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,620
Subak, don't yell.
Let's talk tonight.

438
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,030
Why are you so busy?

439
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,930
You don't have a job, so why?

440
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,930
I am very busy.

441
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,030
I'm hanging up.

442
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,840
Let's talk later.

443
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,160
I said let's talk later.

444
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,290
What are you going to do?

445
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,880
I have to use them today!

446
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,440
I'm very sorry.
I'll pay for them.

447
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,480
That's not the problem!
Oh, this is crazy.

448
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,650
I can't believe my luck.

449
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,350
What are you doing?

450
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,590
Let's have another kid.

451
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:44,330
Sintong and Bangtong went on a camping trip with their taekwondo group,

452
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,840
so it's a great opportunity.

453
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,680
Sit down.

454
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,520
Opportunities like this don't come often.

455
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,020
So don't say no.

456
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,950
Oh, I think it just might work!

457
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,520
Are you getting excited too, honey?

458
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,890
Did mother tell you to convince me?

459
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,130
How did you know?

460
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,970
Oh man!

461
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,820
Ouch, it hurts.

462
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,660
I'm not how I used to be.

463
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,060
My bones are making sounds.

464
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,300
I think I need to get some meat in my diet.

465
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,140
Let's pay for my mom's birthday party.

466
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,710
Feed me meat instead with that money.

467
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,710
We should do this one as a daughter and a son in law.

468
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,920
If you have that kind of money, lend it to my mom.

469
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,750
She's offering to pay interest.

470
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,750
I don't have that much money.

471
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,590
Let's do it, okay?

472
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,300
Mom! Mom!

473
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,700
- What is it?
- Come over.

474
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,650
She won't budge.

475
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,480
Oh! Stop it!

476
00:30:58,930 --> 00:30:59,900
That hurt!

477
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,360
Why do you always beat him up?

478
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,880
I'm just playing with him.

479
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,120
That might actually kill him.

480
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,010
Would you be happy if someone beat your son?

481
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,420
I knew you'd get in trouble.
Yell at her!

482
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,940
You should change your tone first.

483
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,800
The way you talk to him is so rude.
And you always beat him up.

484
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,500
You should know better.

485
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,570
Your father's a teacher!

486
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,790
I'm sure you're the only wife who gives $3 a day to her husband for allowance.

487
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:37,220
He might be younger,
but he's your husband.

488
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,740
Did you hear that?

489
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,930
I didn't beat him up.

490
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,860
I saw you many times!

491
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,390
I saw it too.

492
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,290
Don't you know how lucky you are?

493
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,490
You're living with a younger husband.

494
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,470
You should get a mean mother in law

495
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,310
and experience hell to know how lucky you are.

496
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,800
She'll never get it.

497
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,570
I know, I'm dense, so I don't get it.

498
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,220
Why did you call me over?

499
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
You need to listen to her.

500
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:16,070
I want to pay for my mom's birthday party.

501
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,920
Subak was going to but something happened.

502
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,850
I heard she went bankrupt.

503
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,000
Serves your mother right for belittling Sedal.

504
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,380
I thought you don't have any money.

505
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,090
How would you throw a party?

506
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,490
It won't be a party, per say.

507
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,290
We're just going to have lunch and send her on a trip to Jeju-do Island.

508
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,290
Nice!

509
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:41,810
You wouldn't listen when I asked you for a loan, but you'll go all out for your mom.

510
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,510
She's got 4 daughters,
so why are you doing it?

511
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,150
Please let me do this.

512
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,520
I'll do the same for your 60th birthday.

513
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,200
You can't do the same thing for her!

514
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,050
You have to do something even better for her!

515
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,050
Let's see how well you do when you get married!

516
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,250
- Where are you going?
- My mom's house.

517
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,630
Father found out, too.

518
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,970
Hey, I'm coming, too.

519
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,830
I can't miss a show like this one!

520
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,650
Oh, man...

521
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,810
Tell us what happened.

522
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,380
She says she doesn't know anything.

523
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:22,510
When something like this happens,
he should first tell his wife, but instead,

524
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,900
he let her find out from someone else!

525
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,500
Hobak and Sedal found out first.

526
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,650
Yes, I saw him first.

527
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,650
I have quick eyes.

528
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,450
So that's why they're bulging out.

529
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,910
Oh, what now?
How will you make a living?

530
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,400
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

531
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,710
Don't worry mom.

532
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,760
Business owners always have a backup plan.

533
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,420
What do we do about your birthday, mom?

534
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,430
I made reservations and sent invitations already.

535
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,430
That's not what's important here.

536
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,430
Call him.

537
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,450
He won't answer my calls.

538
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,680
You don't have to throw a big party!

539
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,970
60th birthday isn't very special these days.

540
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,770
Grandmother, you stay out of it.

541
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,260
Minjung, it's me.

542
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,770
If you're not too busy will you come over?

543
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,050
Even if he's busy, he should still come!

544
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,640
- Minjung.
- Minjung.

545
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,180
You look awful.

546
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,410
He lost weight, so his eyes are bulging out even more than...

547
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,660
Minjung.

548
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,180
Come and have a seat.

549
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,660
You should've told us sooner!

550
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,070
You sure can keep a secret.

551
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,360
Tell us what happened.

552
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,390
I'm sorry.

553
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,390
What happened?
What did you do?

554
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,740
How can you go bankrupt?

555
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,970
What about my mom's birthday party?

556
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,250
How am I supposed to face my friends?

557
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,580
You be quiet!

558
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,850
Why are you yelling at her and not him?

559
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,370
Subak's the one who's going crazy now!

560
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,840
It's Minjung!

561
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,420
He's right.

562
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,880
It's Minjung and then Subak.

563
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,980
Then it's mother, then father, and then...

564
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,820
Tell us.

565
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,660
I got loans and expanded my business,

566
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,780
but things turned bad and I couldn't make the payments.

567
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,780
I had to file for bankruptcy recently.

568
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,350
I had to sell the company and the factory, too.

569
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,950
As long as you don't have debt, you're fine.

570
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,190
I have a bit left to pay back,
and I'm talking to the creditors right now.

571
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,710
We have debt?

572
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,760
What am I going to do?

573
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,860
Oh, my poor daughter!

574
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,720
Sis, get up, get up.
Come with me.

575
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,710
Oh, no... Oh, no...

576
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,700
What do I do...

577
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,310
He'll overcome this so don't worry.

578
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,210
He's not the type to let this get the best of him.

579
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,030
This is crazy!

580
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,740
How did we go bankrupt?

581
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,250
What do I do now?

582
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,800
It's not easy to make a come back after going bankrupt!

583
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,550
And you're not young!
What about Subak?

584
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:45,420
I raised her like a princess.

585
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,810
Running a business has its ups and downs.

586
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,810
Bring us some drinks.

587
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,490
How can you drink at a time like this?

588
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,710
I can.

589
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,600
I'm too frustrated to make you anything.

590
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,110
Leave us.

591
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,860
Why should I leave?

592
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,550
Don't let this get you down.

593
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,050
Life is long. These things happen.

594
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:42,830
Losing money is losing little,
but people think they lost everything.

595
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,830
They let themselves be ruined.

596
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,930
But I believe in you.

597
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,940
Thank you, father.

598
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,460
How can you believe in him?

599
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,880
Why didn't you teach him?

600
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,980
What do I know about running a business?

601
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,620
You should because you're a vice principal.

602
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,500
How could you teach students?

603
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,400
You don't even deserve an answer.

604
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,290
What will you do now?

605
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,310
I'm going to try everything.

606
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,710
Minjung,

607
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,450
why didn't you prepare something beforehand?

608
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,170
You have a wife and two kids.

609
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,440
You leave...

610
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,080
When did you all come in?
Leave us.

611
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,150
Don't leave.
We all need to know.

612
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,650
We all need to hear this.

613
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,350
He's down as it is!
Don't be that way!

614
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,930
You should try to comfort him.

615
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,400
He doesn't deserve comforting.

616
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,220
Do you have any plans?

617
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,690
I'm trying something out right now.

618
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,160
What is it?

619
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,500
Parcel service...

620
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,130
Huh?

621
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,710
He's doing parcel service.

622
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,240
When they ring your bell,
you drop everything and answer the door.

623
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,420
That kind of thing.

624
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,810
Parcel service?

625
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:05,940
So you're the man I saw at the market!

626
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,150
My, I can't believe you!

627
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,530
You didn't say anything when I laughed!

628
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,010
What do we do now?

629
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,010
Anything but that!
It's embarrassing.

630
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,360
Embarrassing isn't the issue.

631
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,730
What do I tell my friends?

632
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,730
How will I face the neighbors?

633
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,250
How can you be delivering parcels?

634
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,780
Lots of people do it.

635
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,110
Subak, what's done is done.

636
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:43,640
Like your father said, things happen.

637
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,910
I'm still young and healthy.

638
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,400
I just need you by my side.

639
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,930
- Honey...
- Don't.

640
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,920
Let me hold you.

641
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,350
Subak, don't get mad.

642
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,670
Let's work together to...

643
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,810
Stop it! Seriously!

644
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,170
No, no!

645
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:11,740
I married a businessman,
not a parcel service guy.

646
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,820
I was in the Miss Korea pageant, so how...

647
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,090
How can this be?

648
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,820
Let's sell this house.

649
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,500
Let's sell the house and open a restaurant.

650
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,680
I'll run it.

651
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,060
I can run it, so you stay out of it.

652
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,580
I'm pretty, so I'll attract lots of customers.

653
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,590
I can do that really well.

654
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,390
- This house...
- Let's do that, okay?

655
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,150
Opening a restaurant isn't easy.

656
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,760
Making money isn't easy at all.

657
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,920
Then what do you want me to do?

658
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,960
Don't leave like that!

659
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,470
You always go out without saying a word!

660
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,960
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

661
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,480
Are you really my wife?

662
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,790
How can you be so cruel?

663
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,470
What did I do?

664
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,830
How could the first words out of your mouth be that you're embarrassed?

665
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,870
Can't you be worried for me?

666
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,520
Can't you ask to see if I'm okay first?

667
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:47,550
Or tell me that you'll be by my side no matter what?

668
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,800
I sold my parents land but I lost it all.

669
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,630
Can you just imagine how I must feel?

670
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:05,770
I have to hold onto something and start again, but I have nothing to hold on to.

671
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,870
I'm the one who wants to die.

672
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,230
I sat by the river and thought about it.

673
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:30,570
I thought about jumping in,
but because of you and the girls, I couldn't!

674
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,300
Did you know?

675
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,310
Mom!

676
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,900
Mom...

677
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,900
I'm worried about Subak.
I feel bad for Minjung, too.

678
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,080
What if they get divorced?

679
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,570
Oh, no...

680
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,390
Subak can't live without money.

681
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,640
Women are all the same.

682
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,070
- You, too?
- I'm a woman, too.

683
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:05,580
Women and money can't be separated.

684
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,580
I don't like women like that.

685
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:13,540
I like money, but I like you more, for now.

686
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,540
At a time like this, you must study harder.

687
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,730
If you study hard and get a good job...

688
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,530
Okay. Darn it.

689
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,290
Stop hanging out with your friends.

690
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:26,060
Stop it. You nag too much.

691
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,800
Daebak, I'm not getting a job.

692
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,180
I'm going to be a housewife.

693
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:38,600
Daebak, grow up fast so I can marry you.

694
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,780
Stop suffocating me.
I'll grow up eventually.

695
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:45,310
Why can't we grow up fast, huh?

696
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,970
Miho!

697
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:48,970
Mom!

698
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,060
Daebak, I'm going.

699
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,820
Go home and study, okay?

700
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,020
I'll check on you later.

701
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,830
If you go anywhere else, I'll kill you.

702
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,520
Go ahead and kill me!

703
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,190
People these days all want to become government workers or get high paying jobs.

704
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,910
Even though it's not easy to get them.

705
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:09,910
There are so many unemployed people,
but they still don't want 3D jobs.

706
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:15,170
Most people want white collar jobs,
so how did you choose this line of work?

707
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:18,300
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

708
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,770
I am interrogating you.

709
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:25,020
First, if you're healthy, there's no cutoff age,

710
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,790
and the job depends on my skills.

711
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:31,100
You can always find a job in this field.

712
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,520
For a man, this line of work is pretty good.

713
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,810
If everyone went to college and got desk jobs,

714
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:39,480
what would become of this country?

715
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,610
Us young people must change how we think.

716
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:47,700
And renew how society views blue collar workers.

717
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:53,580
You're saying this line of work must become desirable for the future of our country?

718
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,720
I thought you were a party girl, but you're smart.

719
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,720
Same here.

720
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,490
When do you feel most proud about your job?

721
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,460
When I save people at accident sites.

722
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,900
Oh, really?

723
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,810
When there's an accident,
the fire department calls us.

724
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,290
We rush over there...

725
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:22,930
Wow.

726
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:31,860
Digging through the debris and saving people,
is both thrilling and rewarding.

727
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,860
That's amazing.

728
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,060
Are you married?

729
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,620
No, not yet.

730
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:40,150
You just yelled "Yes!" in your head, right?

731
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,280
Pass.

732
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,120
Do you currently have a girlfriend?

733
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,070
Currently?

734
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,390
I haven't found one for fall of 2013.

735
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,190
You answered like a player.

736
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,090
But seriously, I've seen you somewhere.

737
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:55,940
That's such a lame pick up line.

738
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,130
Which elementary school did you go to?

739
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,310
- Sinsangdo.
- Middle school?

740
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,310
- Guksabong?
- That's odd.

741
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:03,440
How about high school?

742
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,020
Ask me which hotel I frequent.

743
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:05,860
Maybe you slept with me.

744
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,280
You're not my type.

745
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,560
Or we passed each other in the hallway.

746
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,860
Here's a realistic question.

747
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,310
How much is your income?

748
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,830
It depends on the job.

749
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,150
I make a decent living, of course.

750
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,500
I know some people who went to good schools,

751
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,060
had good jobs but are learning to drive excavators.

752
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,710
Oh...

753
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,120
What kind of heavy equipment can you drive?

754
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,850
Most people focus on one thing.

755
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,700
It's hard enough to get one license.

756
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,420
But thanks to my father, I learned it early.

757
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,420
So I can operate almost everything here.

758
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,760
As well as I would a woman.

759
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,150
Oh, boy.

760
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,130
Get in.

761
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,470
- Me?
- I'll drive you to the gate.

762
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:56,050
Okay.

763
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,870
Excuse me...

764
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,410
The stitches have healed.

765
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:41,450
If you hadn't bumped into anything,
it would've healed faster.

766
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:46,330
Ugh, I've lost sleep over that.

767
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,800
That's better.

768
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,540
I felt embarrassed seeing a urologist.

769
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,750
And I couldn't tell everyone I met that I got hurt at a construction site.

770
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,240
Be careful.

771
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,910
That's a bad place to get hurt.

772
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,930
I know. It could be lethal.

773
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:11,580
Maybe I should wear protective gear.

774
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,530
Should I put a bowl over it when I work?

775
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,140
- Just be careful.
- Oh, it's tight.

776
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,940
Oh, my!

777
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,130
Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, no...

778
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,010
Oh, man...

779
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,510
Why are you so clumsy?

780
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:38,520
What do you have against me to do this again?

781
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,720
Me?

782
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,160
You don't remember me?

783
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,290
I'm not sure...

784
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:47,120
Are your eyes for decoration?

785
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:53,040
I was going to let it go,
but my doctor told me to be careful,

786
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,620
so I was real careful, like this.

787
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:01,490
I was really, really careful!

788
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,800
This is the third time you did this to me.

789
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:05,800
I didn't know.

790
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,530
But why are you yelling at me?

791
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,840
How can I help it?

792
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,440
You didn't even apologize properly.

793
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,940
How can you be so rude?

794
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,170
I'm sorry.

795
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,430
- Pay up.
- Excuse me?

796
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:26,200
I had to see my doctor for one more week,
so you must pay for that.

797
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,580
Says who?

798
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:30,320
There's no evidence!
That's ridiculous!

799
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,830
Why is it ridiculous?

800
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,530
Then let's go see my doctor

801
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,140
and find out for yourself.

802
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,800
Find out what? Unbelievable.

803
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,170
Hey! Hey!

804
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,110
Hey!

805
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:49,140
I'm sorry. I don't know what you take me for, but I'm not that naive.

806
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:52,830
There are people who cause accidents on purpose and swindle people for money...

807
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,000
What? Swindle for money?

808
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,620
If you don't want me to think that, stop this.

809
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,680
Try this again, and I'm calling the police.

810
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:11,070
Sunjeong, get me a cold drink with ice.

811
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:11,960
Okay.

812
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,640
Wow.

813
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,310
How can I get her?

814
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,610
She's unbelievable.

815
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:20,000
You ran into that rude person again?

816
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,950
Yes, she must hang out there.

817
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:24,320
She kept saying she didn't do anything.

818
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,350
She's not careful and has no manners.

819
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,320
I hope you don't marry a girl like her.

820
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,780
It's a woman?

821
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,780
You can't even call her a woman.

822
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,790
Don't you ever bring a girl who talks back to introduce to me.

823
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,230
I'd never meet a girl like that.

824
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,360
Daese, here.

825
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,150
Mark my words.
I'm going to make her pay.

826
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,450
I feel sorry for her.

827
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,820
I know.

828
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,330
Ugh.

829
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,330
Can me. I have a question.
I'll pay you 50 cents.

830
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,260
I'll only answer 50 cent worth.

831
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,920
You said you live with your aunt?

832
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,650
Why do you?
Isn't that uncomfortable?

833
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,340
There's a reason.

834
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,520
I can't comment on that.

835
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:05,320
When did your mother pass away?

836
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:07,580
She's not dead.

837
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

838
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,280
You said your father's in the same business?

839
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,710
It must be nice to work with your father.

840
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,140
Not really.

841
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:22,030
He knows everything, so I can't fool him.

842
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:26,400
But you asking me all these questions makes me feel like I'm being interrogated.

843
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,980
Can I interrogate you now?

844
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,480
No, you can't.

845
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,950
That's not fair!

846
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:56,650
Your grandmother is amazing.

847
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,440
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

848
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:01,830
Our names end with "Bak,"

849
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,950
Subak, Hobak, Gwangbak, Haebak.

850
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,350
And the youngest is Daebak.

851
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:06,160
Yes.

852
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,650
You know how the third daughter is always the prettiest?

853
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:12,030
I'm the third daughter.
You can tell, huh?

854
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:16,060
That means the others are really, really ugly.

855
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:20,480
No! Subak is extremely pretty.

856
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,890
Hobak's also pretty and so is Haebak.

857
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:25,750
But of course, I'm the prettiest.

858
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:28,750
We should hang up!

859
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,510
Oh, my ear feels hot.

860
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,660
This isn't an interrogation.
It's torture.

861
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,730
My arm hurts, too.

862
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:40,370
We talked for 1 hour and 23 minutes and 40 seconds.

863
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:43,320
Who called?
Oh, I'm paying for this.

864
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,460
I'll take you to dinner when I get paid.

865
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,540
You have to get up early, don't you?

866
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,760
You're very understanding.

867
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,810
Laborers must sleep well and eat well.

868
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,420
On regular schedule.

869
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,760
Oh, another strength of blue collar jobs.

870
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,460
They're healthy in mind and body.

871
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,530
I won't leave that out.

872
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:03,260
I had a good laugh thanks to you.

873
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,990
But I shouldn't because something's up.

874
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:08,670
I heard from Daebak about your eldest sister.

875
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,010
You should try to lighten things up.

876
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,130
Have good dreams.
Good night.

877
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,650
Good night.

878
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,370
Father, take the rest of the week off.

879
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,260
I can take care of everything.

880
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,350
Mr. Park's excavator's fixed, so he's back.

881
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:40,030
But we have to fix a few pumps and transmissions, so it'll cost us.

882
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,250
But it only happens every few years.

883
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:44,460
Yes, I'll come home for lunch later.

884
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:48,030
Let's start the day with happy thoughts!

885
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,530
Safety first!

886
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,990
We need to weld the excavator booms.

887
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,560
A few of them have cracks in them.

888
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,380
When you weld the buckets, check them.

889
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,120
Okay.

890
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,210
You don't have to worry.
He's good.

891
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,050
You're lucky to have a son like him.

892
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:16,960
He's still a kid.

893
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,440
Father!

894
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:23,270
When you first came to my shop,
you were a little boy with a runny nose.

895
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:27,020
Like this!

896
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:31,750
Are you dating someone?

897
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,790
Where did you get such weird info?

898
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:36,050
You have a girlfriend?

899
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,510
No, auntie.
I would've told you if I did.

900
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:40,510
I saw you talking on the phone really late.

901
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,920
And you were laughing, too.

902
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,110
We were talking about work.

903
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,870
I haven't seen you like that in a long time.

904
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,300
Was it a woman?

905
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:50,970
I'm not interested in her.

906
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,420
So it was a woman.

907
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,310
I don't care for her.

908
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,690
I wish you'd get yourself a girlfriend!

909
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,460
If she doesn't feel right, stop it.

910
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,090
Don't hurt a woman for no reason.

911
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:05,680
You know you have player's blood in you.

912
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,720
Because you took after me.

913
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,290
I'm actually a bigger player than you.

914
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:10,920
I'm always working on it.

915
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,920
I can't take this anymore.

916
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,970
How can you take this every day?

917
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:17,760
I'm forced to take this.

918
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,760
- Would you like some more soup?
- Yes.

919
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,040
- More.
- It's delicious. You're the best.

920
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:44,330
Mom.

921
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:45,960
Why are you here?

922
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:47,940
I thought Subak would be here.

923
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,140
You're taking care of the girls?

924
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:52,520
How can Subak take care of them?

925
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,160
Why? Do you even feel bad for her?

926
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,040
About what?

927
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,160
Why didn't you let Minjung tell her?

928
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,380
Why did you have to tell everyone?

929
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:07,140
I don't understand you sometimes.

930
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,970
There's nothing to understand.

931
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:12,060
I was just talking about your birthday...

932
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,780
Enough. Stop talking about it.

933
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,000
You don't have to do it, so don't worry.

934
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,600
She can't even eat and I understand why.

935
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,840
Her world is falling apart.

936
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:45,350
I made some pine nut porridge.

937
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,270
If you knew this,
why didn't you tell me?

938
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:53,080
You should've warned me.

939
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,160
Minjung said he was going to tell you.

940
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,910
Were you and Minjung in on it together?

941
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,960
How can you say that?

942
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,630
Mom's mad because I told her,
you're mad because I didn't tell you.

943
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:06,260
Everyone hates me.

944
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,690
I'm sorry, Subak.

945
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:10,860
You should eat.

946
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,080
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

947
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,280
- Subak.
- Be honest with me.

948
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:21,310
You're happy to see me like this, right?

949
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,860
- Are you crazy?
- Yes, I'm crazy.

950
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,730
Bring me someone who wouldn't go crazy in this situation!

951
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,220
I know. I know this is hard for you.

952
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,730
So calm down.
Don't think too much.

953
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:38,020
You have to think about the girls...

954
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,010
Get out.

955
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,690
I don't need this from you!

956
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:43,080
Who do you think you are?

957
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,220
Get out!
Take this and get out!

958
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:08,590
Don't do this to me.

959
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,600
What did I ever do to you?

960
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:15,510
Did I pray for Minjung to go bankrupt?

961
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:20,700
I'll let this slide because I know how you feel,

962
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,130
but still, it's too much to endure.

963
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:29,020
What did you have to endure?

964
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,900
I've always been discriminated against!

965
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,320
Ever since I was little, I endured it all!

966
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:40,920
Mom only loved you!

967
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,460
She was always Subak this, Subak that!

968
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,290
I can't stand it!
I'm so sick of it!

969
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:53,440
You don't know how hard it was for me, do you?

970
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:57,120
How could you?
You were so loved!

971
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:02,940
But do you know how I must have felt growing up, being hated?

972
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:20,920
What about me?

973
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,750
You think you never hurt me?

974
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:26,700
You've hurt me too, you know.

975
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:29,530
Hurt you?

976
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:31,540
Me?

977
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,840
You did.

978
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,130
How did I ever hurt you?

979
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,840
Tell me. What was it?

980
01:02:49,690 --> 01:03:02,700
Subtitles by KBS World

981
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,810
That. I would never forget that. Never.

982
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:08,750
- But you!
- I said stop!

983
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,990
You better take that one to the grave.

984
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:15,280
Do you know how proud and respectful he is about his job?

985
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,680
You don't want to work, do you?

986
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,210
No! Not with you!

987
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:19,580
This is how we're celebrating my birthday?

988
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:22,380
Why did you come?
Go deliver your parcels!

989
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,080
Don't you feel bad for father?

990
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:29,450
Imagine how lonely he must be in his house.

991
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:32,680
How could you not tell me anything?

992
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,370
How could you betray me like this?
