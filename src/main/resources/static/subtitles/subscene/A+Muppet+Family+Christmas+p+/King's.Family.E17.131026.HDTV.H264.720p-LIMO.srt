00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,200
Welcome, Mr. Ko.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,090
Do you have a quiet room?

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,460
Come this way.

5
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,200
Minjung, eat.

6
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,240
You eat, too.

7
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,130
Don't cry.

8
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,060
I won't.

9
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,670
I have no right to cry.

10
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,070
I won't cry.

11
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,800
It's been about ten years, right?

12
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,140
Yes.

13
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,470
A little over ten years.

14
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,770
Minjung...

15
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,430
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,140
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,770
It's all in the past.

18
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:19,240
To be honest, for a few years after you left me, I really hated you.

19
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:26,900
I kept swearing to myself that I was going to make you pay.

20
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,040
But not now.

21
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,600
I found out about the real reason.

22
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,860
How did you find out?

23
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,530
By trying to find you.

24
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,890
It was because of your family and not because you fell out of love.

25
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:54,570
I found out how you had to marry a rich old man because of your family.

26
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,800
But I'm relieved because you seem happy.

27
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,570
But envious, too...

28
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,640
Your husband,

29
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,570
he was different from what I heard.

30
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,800
My husband?

31
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,540
The man who buys all those things.

32
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,470
Huh?

33
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,590
Oh...

34
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,770
He buys things off shopping channels,
and most of them are for you and your kids.

35
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,490
He didn't seem that old,
and he actually looked like a nice guy.

36
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,200
Uh, well...

37
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,390
I was joking about being envious of him.

38
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,490
I'm glad you're happy.

39
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,040
And I was doing quite well until recently.

40
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,900
I know. I heard about how successful you were.

41
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:58,830
After you left me, I worked my butt off.

42
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,000
I didn't even sleep.

43
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,970
You left because I was poor.

44
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,240
The only way of revenge was to become a success.

45
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:23,440
So I worked really hard,
thinking I'd run into you someday.

46
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:33,190
But now I'm embarrassed for running to your house with diarrhea.

47
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,670
It was just so...

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,800
I didn't want us to meet like that.

49
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,130
I wanted it to be like in the movies.

50
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,560
That was really bad.

51
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,170
It wasn't.

52
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,360
It could happen to anyone.

53
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,990
Things just don't work out the way you plan.

54
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:09,340
I was so embarrassed that I was going to switch my delivery route.

55
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,530
I look old, don't I?

56
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,990
No, you look the same.

57
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,560
I'm the one who got old.

58
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,460
You look just like you used to.

59
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,440
Maybe because time has been kind to you.

60
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,040
Thank you for saying that.

61
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,560
When did you get married?

62
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,740
A few years after you did.

63
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,490
You got married, so why couldn't I?

64
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,560
Good for you.

65
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,560
Any kids?

66
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,690
A daughter and a son.

67
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,740
They must be adorable.

68
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,540
If they take after you, they should be.

69
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,140
I must have some pictures.

70
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,240
She's so pretty. She looks like you.

71
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,170
And your son is a spitting image of you.

72
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,600
She must be your wife.

73
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,240
She's pretty.

74
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,540
How did you meet?

75
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,140
We met through a matchmaker.

76
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,760
We got married 3 months after we met.

77
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,770
How many kids do you have?

78
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,790
One daughter.

79
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,300
Show me her picture.

80
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,040
I don't have any pictures on me.

81
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,560
Maybe another time.

82
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,740
It's funny how things work out.

83
00:06:53,750 --> 00:07:00,630
They say people who are meant to be together end up together.

84
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,090
But if you do nothing, you don't.

85
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:09,060
You have to reach out and go looking for that person first.

86
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,330
Remember? We went looking for each other.

87
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,140
You're right.

88
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,160
Anyway, how can you call me your sucker?

89
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,670
What's wrong with sucker? It's really nice.

90
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,190
It means I'm not a special person.

91
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,190
Shh! It's because you're a sucker for me.

92
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,990
- Are you upset?
- Yes.

93
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,300
Give me your phone.

94
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,570
What?

95
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,170
Arrogant bulldozer?

96
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,560
But you are arrogant.

97
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,240
Happy?

98
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,240
[You're a sucker for me]

99
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,560
What's this?

100
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,770
You don't like it?

101
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,100
We're both suckers.

102
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:15,840
From now on, I'll make sure you never feel lonely, with lots and lots of love.

103
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,670
If you don't, I'll get mad.

104
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,430
You're

105
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,570
a sucker for me.

106
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,300
You're a sucker for me.

107
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,240
Hey, sucker!

108
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,790
This is pretty.

109
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,740
Would you like one of these?

110
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,290
Yes, sucker. Let's buy one for each other.

111
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,070
Hey, sucker, did you get home safely?

112
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,890
We just said goodbye, so why did you call?

113
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,740
Because I have something to say.

114
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,740
What is it?

115
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,840
I couldn't tell you in person, so I called.

116
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,700
I have a lot of emotional baggage,
and I might hurt you sometimes because of it.

117
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,170
Like this time.

118
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,830
I'm prepared.

119
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,700
Let me help you get over them.

120
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,940
As for your mom,

121
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,240
just forgive her.

122
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,660
She brought you into this world.

123
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,160
So forgive her for your sake.

124
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:24,330
If you do, I'll work even harder so you can get over the pain.

125
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,540
I won't play any games,

126
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,530
and I'll do whatever you ask me to.

127
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,690
I'll work part time and treat you to dinner.

128
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,740
Just dinner?

129
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,740
I'll buy you dessert and drinks, too.

130
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,990
But I like it when women play games.

131
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,490
Bye!

132
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,940
Ouch.

133
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,740
Stop doing that.

134
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,070
Hey, knock!

135
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,360
Incredible!

136
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,990
Oh, that hurt.

137
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,740
Why did you try to find me?

138
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,440
To get you back.

139
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,130
I worked really hard.

140
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,490
So I could get you back.

141
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,440
But

142
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,540
I was too late.

143
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,760
Minjung, what are you doing?

144
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,490
Nothing, Daebak. Go to bed.

145
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,670
I'll pretend I never had you,

146
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,830
so you pretend you don't have a mother.

147
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,100
Don't ever come back here.

148
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,970
Let's see how well you do.

149
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,130
Hobak.

150
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,200
You met her? Did she apologize?

151
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,340
Why did you take me?

152
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,130
It's better to have more people.

153
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,930
I could've beat the crap out of her.

154
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,940
You couldn't have.

155
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:35,860
The moment I saw her,
I knew I couldn't beat her.

156
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,800
I shouldn't have met her.

157
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,690
Her whole body reeked of money.

158
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,290
But money isn't everything!

159
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,530
You have something money can't buy.

160
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,930
You're his wife and you're a mother.

161
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,200
So what?

162
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,040
I can't use them as weapons.

163
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,260
I don't want to use time I spent with him and my kids as weapons.

164
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,940
It may be pathetic, but they're my pride and joy.

165
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,440
Gwangbak,

166
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,540
like our family motto,

167
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,740
I put myself in Sedal's shoes.

168
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:23,660
If a rich handsome young man told me he was in love with me, could I say no to him?

169
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,240
Could I say no to the lifestyle

170
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,600
that I've never experienced before?

171
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,530
I'm not sure if I could.

172
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,060
I'm no match for her.

173
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:42,540
I gave him $3 a day and belittled him saying, "You're unemployed!"

174
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,360
"You don't need money!"

175
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:53,590
But she gave him a $100,000 credit card and told him to use it as he pleased...

176
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,430
Hobak.

177
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,790
Stop it.

178
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,070
Director, did you ask for me?

179
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,470
Your wife came to see me.

180
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,170
Excuse me?

181
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,740
You didn't know?

182
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,600
She's such a freak.

183
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,970
Why does she do that?

184
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,100
I told you I don't like messes.

185
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,360
We're not even in a relationship.

186
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,600
I'll take care of it.

187
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,130
What did she say?

188
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,960
To let you go.

189
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,200
She asked you to let me go?

190
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,070
What did you tell her for her to come here?

191
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,700
I didn't tell her anything.

192
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,540
I just asked for freedom.

193
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,860
It's so weird.

194
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,840
I feel like giving it a try.

195
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,940
Let's reopen our contract.

196
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,340
Take the car key and the credit card.

197
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,400
It felt really weird.

198
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,590
I thought nobody would be interested in him,

199
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,130
but when someone was,

200
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,200
he seemed more handsome,

201
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,530
and I got jealous.

202
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,170
I don't want to lose him.

203
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,090
But I don't know what to do.

204
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,660
I don't know what I can do.

205
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:54,290
I want revenge and I want to beat the crap out of Sedal.

206
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,830
Oh, I feel like a crazy woman.

207
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,190
Do whatever you feel like doing. Go ahead.

208
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,530
I'm not sure if he had an affair.

209
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,060
They didn't have an affair?

210
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,530
It doesn't look like it.

211
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,030
I think it's about money.

212
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,060
He became a different person.

213
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,530
It was scary.

214
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,030
He's not the man I used to know.

215
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,470
How can money change a man so much...

216
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:27,640
I've had all kinds of troubles before,
but this is the toughest one.

217
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,440
That woman isn't the problem.

218
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,570
The problem is us.

219
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,140
I am.

220
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,800
I was too indifferent to him.

221
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,790
I only thought about making money

222
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,470
and providing a better life for the boys.

223
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,530
I heard even the densest of women

224
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,470
notice these things right away,

225
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,630
so I must be beyond hopeless.

226
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,970
Even Sintong and Bangtong noticed it,

227
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,470
but I wasn't interested in my own husband.

228
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,240
I was just focused on money.

229
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,390
So I can't blame him for going after money.

230
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,170
I was all about money too.

231
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,970
Even when my mom called me stingy,

232
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,530
I was still focused on making money.

233
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,530
But money isn't everything.

234
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,670
How can I be so clueless?

235
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,490
Don't blame yourself.

236
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,640
You were trying to make a living.

237
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,400
When the boys were all grown up,

238
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,940
I thought Sedal and I could play golf

239
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,290
and go on trips together.

240
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,030
But this is too hard, Gwangbak.

241
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,760
What am I supposed to do?

242
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,700
These are for you.

243
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,870
Sunglasses?

244
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,470
They are the hottest ones.

245
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,440
I know that.

246
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,760
Okay.

247
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,790
How do I look?

248
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,290
Look for yourself.

249
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,200
This is nuts.

250
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,790
They cover my bulging eyes. Crazy cool.

251
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,330
We're going to play golf later. Get ready.

252
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,470
Me too?

253
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,990
You should play golf, don't you think?

254
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,530
Golf?

255
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,970
Why you little...

256
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,760
Hey! Goof-off, you stop right there!

257
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,200
Stop following me!

258
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,860
Sedal! Come here. Let's talk.

259
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,070
I don't want to. Go home!

260
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,490
Sedal!

261
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,560
Heo Sedal!

262
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,470
This is nuts.

263
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,440
Uncle!

264
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,700
Loser.

265
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,140
What did you say?

266
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,790
Why didn't you answer your phone?

267
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,130
Why should I?
I have nothing to say.

268
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,990
Take those off, bastard!

269
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,700
Uncle.

270
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,990
We don't need any words.

271
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,640
He deserves a beating. Take those off!

272
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,940
Loser, you always turn to violence.

273
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,490
Goof-off, I can't believe this...

274
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,200
Calm down, uncle.

275
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,400
Sedal, I didn't come here to yell at you.

276
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,370
- So?
- Just hear me out.

277
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,870
You know what kind of life Hobak's had.

278
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,700
We were all against the marriage,

279
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,600
and she had a really difficult life trying

280
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,190
to raise your sons while working.

281
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:32,030
You know her life was a constant struggle,
and that was why she might have been a bit indifferent.

282
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,560
But she really regrets it.

283
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,360
She's sorry she treated you like

284
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,740
a child and belittling you for not being

285
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,200
able to get a job and everything else.

286
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,470
She regrets it?

287
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,030
Yes.

288
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,760
Tell her it's too late.

289
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,360
She thought if she worked hard and made money, everyone would be happy.

290
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:04,400
After the boys are all grown up,
she was going to play golf with you and travel abroad.

291
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,260
Hasn't she heard of the man who starved himself to go to a feast and ended up dying?

292
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,330
Sedal,

293
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,760
Hobak is in a lot of pain right now.

294
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,470
She only looks tough on the outside.

295
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,760
You know that better than anyone else.

296
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,470
She cried a lot.

297
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,440
But she's done it to herself!

298
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,060
Don't you feel anything after hearing that?

299
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,490
Your niece is really impossible.

300
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,560
That was what I felt. Happy?

301
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,160
You bastard!

302
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,030
Let go of me.

303
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,670
I'm going to beat the crap out of him.

304
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,430
What did you say?

305
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,970
Sedal, calm down.

306
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,260
Uncle, you go over there!

307
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,430
Sedal,

308
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:05,970
I came to see you today to let you know how Hobak feels and to ask you to think things over.

309
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,600
You must think about Sintong and Bangtong.

310
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,240
I didn't do anything wrong,
so why should I?

311
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,140
Did I cheat on her?
Did I beat her?

312
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,340
I just want to be free.

313
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,740
I asked her to stay out of my business.

314
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,170
Is that so hard?

315
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,490
A married man asking his wife to stay out of his business is nonsense.

316
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,630
I know that woman's your boss,
but for you to hang out with her like that is...

317
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,400
You're just like Hobak.

318
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,570
I can't communicate with you.

319
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,900
Heo Sedal!

320
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,240
How dare you!

321
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,290
Uncle!

322
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,740
- You're an animal!
- Uncle!

323
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,700
Oh, uncle!

324
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,330
- You're here.
- Yes.

325
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,560
Did you have lunch?

326
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,890
I ordered in.

327
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,300
I haven't heard you whistle like that in a while.

328
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,090
I was whistling?

329
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,740
You do that when you're happy.

330
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,170
What's up?

331
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,490
It's a secret.

332
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,030
Is it a woman?

333
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,330
I'll tell you later.

334
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,430
I'm going to check out a used excavator.

335
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,700
Should I come along?

336
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,240
Let me look at it first,
and if it's nice, I'll call you.

337
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,060
- See you later.
- Okay.

338
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,200
I'll see you there.

339
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,200
I'll see you there.

340
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,870
Really? Oh!

341
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,800
The time has finally come.

342
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,700
Make him fall for you and set a date.

343
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,990
There's no time to waste.

344
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,700
Wasting time is stupid.

345
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,970
I got it, mom.

346
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,100
My life is finally going to change.

347
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,690
And yours, too.

348
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,840
Mom, I will make you proud.

349
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,890
That's my girl!

350
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,030
You didn't answer my calls or reply to any of my texts. I was really worried.

351
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,890
You were on a business trip?

352
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,340
Sort of.

353
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,200
Thank you for coming back safe and sound.

354
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,260
I missed you.

355
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,400
Sangnam, did you miss me, too?

356
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,700
I'm not the type who can say that in person.

357
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,970
Let's get something delicious. My treat.

358
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,140
I'm actually busy today. But here.

359
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,800
Is this for me?

360
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,070
Can I open it?

361
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,890
Open it at home. There's a card inside.

362
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,200
A card?

363
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,760
Oh, my! Oh, my...

364
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,670
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lee.

365
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,340
I keep doing this whenever you pass by.

366
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,030
I'm sorry.

367
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,390
You seem very happy, Mrs. Park.

368
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,600
My daughter's getting married.

369
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,640
She is?

370
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,870
What does he do?

371
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,200
He's a businessman.

372
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,900
He's young, but he runs his own business.

373
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,670
She's going to be very rich.

374
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,530
Everyone owns a business these days.

375
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,490
He's going to propose to her today.

376
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,530
You my not know what "propose" means, huh?

377
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,790
Ugh...

378
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,390
My husband is a vice principal!

379
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,240
Of course I know!

380
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,330
We'll be sending out wedding invitations.

381
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,660
What is Gwangbak going to do?

382
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,170
When she hits thirty, no one will want her.

383
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,340
She shouldn't have quit teaching.

384
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,830
That's complete nonsense.

385
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,430
Who knows what's going to happen?

386
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,200
Mom! Mom!

387
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,670
Tada!

388
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,030
Oh, my!

389
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,560
Is this a luxury brand handbag?

390
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,130
It's not just any luxury brand.

391
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,800
This is "the" luxury brand handbag.

392
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,990
Let me hold it.

393
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,290
I should hold it first.

394
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,630
Oh, wait your turn.

395
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,600
Oh, my! This is perfect.

396
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,790
Don't you agree, Mrs. Lee?

397
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,360
I'm not interested in stuff like that.

398
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,870
Why didn't you ask Subak to buy you one before when she had money?

399
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,270
I have lots of handbags like that at home.

400
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,900
I just don't carry them around.

401
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,400
Look, Mrs. Lee.

402
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:26,440
You never know how life will turn out.

403
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,940
Yeongdal wasn't good in school,

404
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,030
but a man gave her a luxury brand handbag.

405
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,700
Let me have it.

406
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,990
How do I look, mom?

407
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,030
You look nice, but I look nicer with it.

408
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,030
Give me this and ask him to get you another one.

409
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,240
Later. It's too early for that.

410
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,170
You can tell him you lost it.

411
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,470
He needs to earn points from me.

412
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,490
Right. You're so clever.

413
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,490
Mrs. Lee, would you like to hold it?

414
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,530
Yeongdal, give that to her.

415
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,490
It's okay. I don't like stuff like that.

416
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,090
Try it. You won't get another chance.

417
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,290
Oh, my!

418
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,330
It's the bag that makes a person!

419
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,860
You look beautiful.

420
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,600
How does my fortune look today?

421
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,290
You have to wait.

422
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,760
I have to go to work. Hurry.

423
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,400
Why you little!

424
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,240
Oh, I asked someone to read your fortune,

425
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,090
and she said there's divorce in your future.

426
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,530
- Uncle will get a divorce?
- Yes.

427
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,860
Mom, I'm not even married.

428
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,770
Oh, right. I should show her...

429
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,470
Mom, calm down.

430
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,600
That means I will get married someday.

431
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,290
That's good, then.

432
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,240
Right, uncle. Ultimate optimism.

433
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,490
You should be crying, not laughing!

434
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,200
Why?

435
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,340
Yeongdal's getting married.

436
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,900
She's lying.

437
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,260
She's not.

438
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,530
Some man gave her a luxury brand handbag.

439
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,940
I saw it with my own eyes.

440
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,740
Oh, she got a luxury brand handbag?

441
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,700
What kind? Was it one of the new ones?

442
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,560
I'm not sure.

443
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:21,260
But I couldn't believe my eyes.

444
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,490
They were all bragging about it.

445
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,260
How could you let Yeongdal beat you?

446
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,240
Did she meet someone else already?

447
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,060
Maybe she found some idiot from somewhere.

448
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,130
Men give presents like that these days.

449
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,800
How come you didn't meet one of them?

450
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,090
Not all men are like that.

451
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,130
It's only a few idiots who have gone mad.

452
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,100
I know.

453
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,560
Why didn't you show up for your date that day?

454
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,970
Subak, you're no help either!

455
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,060
Why didn't you give me one of your bags?

456
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:54,430
You let the creditors take them instead.

457
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,530
Daughters are useless.

458
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,790
You never bought me a luxury brand bag!

459
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,670
Hold on, mom.

460
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,740
I'll buy you one in every color when I become a writer!

461
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,640
Shut up!

462
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,030
Why don't you buy me a bag, too?

463
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,130
Mom, not you too.

464
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,270
I just don't get women.

465
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,260
Why don't they just marry the bags?

466
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,290
Ugh.

467
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,130
It's so pretty, isn't it?

468
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,360
So, when are you getting married?

469
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,330
Right.

470
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,200
Here it is.

471
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,470
What is it?

472
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,490
A card.

473
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,030
He told me to read it at home.

474
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,840
So? Did he ask you to get married?

475
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,670
What does it say?

476
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,630
Mom...

477
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,400
Thank you for seeing me.

478
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,670
This is a parting gift.
I hope you like it...

479
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,200
"Parting gift"?

480
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,430
What do I do?

481
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,790
You're a good person,

482
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,990
but you're not right for me.

483
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,200
I hope you meet someone nice.

484
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,140
He dumped me, right?

485
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,500
Why did you get dumped?

486
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,090
What happened to your bag of tricks?

487
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,430
Oh, this is so sad.

488
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,990
Other men ask to give their presents back when you break up

489
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,760
but this one gave you a break up present.

490
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,030
Oh, how sad!

491
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,030
Oh, this came out all wrong.

492
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,630
I can't believe this!

493
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,760
Sunjeong, I'm getting a package today.

494
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,440
You are?

495
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,700
Why do you sound so happy?

496
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,600
It's not yours this time.

497
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,600
No, I didn't mean it like that.

498
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,890
You have a crush on the parcel service guy?

499
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,140
I'll see you later.

500
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,570
Oh, right.

501
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,740
Yes, Daese?

502
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,900
Is Sangnam seeing someone?
Mr. Ju told me.

503
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,600
I think he is but I'm not sure.

504
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,240
But this time it looks serious.

505
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,830
I'm getting curious.

506
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,130
He'll tell us when he's ready.

507
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,640
I hope it's someone nice.

508
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,600
Don't worry. You should trust Sangnam.

509
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,890
Don't forget about the package.

510
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,940
Okay.

511
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,860
You must be tired.

512
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,700
Sign here.

513
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,530
Minjung, hold on.

514
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,560
I have to go.

515
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,060
Just a second.

516
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,700
I made some sandwiches.

517
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,790
You have to eat on the truck, don't you?

518
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,740
I'm not sure if I can take this.

519
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,290
Don't worry about it.

520
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,790
I made them just for you.

521
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,100
Where's your husband?

522
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,190
He's at work.

523
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,370
Was everything okay that day?

524
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,270
Did you sleep well?

525
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,400
Yes.

526
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,870
I couldn't sleep that night.

527
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,400
It felt a little weird.

528
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,930
I'm not sure if this was a good thing.

529
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,990
Anyway, I'm glad you're living in such a nice house.

530
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,000
I hope I'll be able to make you feel the same...

531
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,570
You'll get back on your feet.
I believe in you.

532
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,000
You still have that hairpin?

533
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,040
Of course.

534
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,140
You gave it to me.

535
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,540
It looks bad. Don't wear it.

536
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,790
Your husband will be offended if he knew.

537
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,600
Sunjeong...

538
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:26,990
Let's be friends.

539
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,290
- Friends?
- Yes.

540
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,640
I should go.
Thanks for the sandwiches.

541
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:51,130
Minjung, whenever you feel hungry or have to use the bathroom, drop by.

542
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,830
I'm always home.

543
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,390
I'll be waiting.

544
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,370
Bye.

545
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,540
- My heart is pounding.
- Mom.

546
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,700
Hurry up.

547
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,770
Hurry, before Subak comes home.

548
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,400
Mom!

549
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,630
Where is the stroller?

550
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,470
Ask uncle.

551
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:07,100
Uncle, uncle! Uncle, wake up.

552
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,940
Uncle!

553
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,030
Oh, man.

554
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,790
Uncle, wake up!

555
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,030
Where's the stroller?

556
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,870
It was grandmother, wasn't it?

557
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,290
Where is it?

558
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,260
Uncle, wake up!

559
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,640
Ugh.

560
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,640
Why is he pretending to be dead?

561
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,540
He's actually pretending to be dead!

562
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,940
Oh, I can't believe my eyes.

563
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,740
Lift him up.

564
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,830
One, two.

565
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,260
Ugh!

566
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,430
- Oh...
- Seriously.

567
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,890
Where are you going?

568
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,240
I'm just out on a walk.

569
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,330
What do you call that? A drive?

570
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,440
Yours looks like it should be thrown out.

571
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,470
Is that new?

572
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,270
Of course, it is.

573
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,400
My son bought it for me.

574
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,090
I have two more at home.

575
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,140
Two more?

576
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:11,060
Yes, so I have three.

577
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,330
One for the market, one for meeting friends,

578
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,870
and another for going to the senior center.

579
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,200
They are lined up in the yard.

580
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:21,040
Ask your son to buy you a new one.

581
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,040
You don't want to be seen with that old thing.

582
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,100
I'll see you later.

583
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,200
Oh, that looks so good.

584
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,870
I haven't seen you in a while.

585
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,140
Would you like some?

586
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,640
Yes.

587
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,700
I brought my stroller here.

588
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,240
You can load it in here.

589
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,090
Hurry up and load it.

590
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,240
Okay.

591
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:01,940
Grandmother!

592
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,030
Oh, no.

593
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,500
Wasn't that your grandmother and Subak?

594
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,540
Oh my...

595
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,000
She could put that in the stroller.

596
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,300
I feel bad for your grandmother.

597
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,540
Ugh.

598
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,540
I wish Subak's husband cheats on her instead.

599
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,040
Do you know Minjung?

600
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,170
No, I never met him.

601
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,240
I think Subak deserves it.

602
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,270
What's going on with Hobak?

603
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,000
I don't know.

604
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,540
Shouldn't you teach him a lesson?

605
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,840
How can I do that?

606
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,560
Your family should go to him and beat him up.

607
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,390
I've seen it done on TV dramas.

608
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,740
I hope you can beat him up someday.

609
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,000
I know.

610
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:01,140
Are you still hanging out with that girl?

611
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,740
At school, yes.

612
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:06,430
Who flirts with whom first?

613
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,260
Sometimes I do, sometimes she does.

614
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,200
Wait, that sounded weird. It's not like that.

615
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,560
Why are you flirting with her?

616
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,740
Sometimes she gives me snacks.

617
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,640
Don't eat them.

618
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,540
Why not? They're good.

619
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,770
Don't just eat anything she gives you.

620
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,300
If you do, I'll kill you.

621
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,140
Miho!

622
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,440
Hi!

623
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,990
Come play with me.

624
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,170
Okay.

625
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,240
I'll see you later.

626
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,740
- Who are you?
- I'm Miho's friend.

627
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,500
Miho's busy, so go away, little boy.

628
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,200
Miho, let's play some other time.

629
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,240
Is he a classmate?

630
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,040
He's the class president.

631
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:01,140
I don't talk to vice presidents.

632
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,040
- Are you close?
- Very.

633
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:07,600
He brings me lots of snacks, too.

634
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,240
Don't eat them.

635
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,330
I hate two timers.

636
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,470
Go home and study!

637
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,430
I'll check on you later.

638
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,130
Thanks.

639
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,060
Oh hey, Miho!

640
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,930
Where's Daebak?

641
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,560
He came home just now and is studying.

642
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,660
I wonder what's gotten into him.

643
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,430
Well,

644
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,760
I'm meeting that guy again.

645
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,970
Really? That's great!

646
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,770
I owe it all to you, Miho.

647
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,670
It worked out because of your advice.

648
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,130
What should I do next?

649
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,040
You must close the deal.

650
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,500
Make sure he's yours.

651
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,500
How?

652
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,170
I'll tell you what I did.

653
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,040
You were head over heels in love with him,

654
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,040
and you went and got him.

655
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,700
How awful! I didn't go and get him.

656
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,000
You did.

657
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:35,300
- No way.
- Let's eat.

658
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,600
You must make him jealous.

659
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,270
That's the best way.

660
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,660
What is it?

661
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,530
I keep getting calls.

662
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,670
Answer it.

663
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,360
Maybe later.

664
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,290
Who was it?

665
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,660
Some guy I met before.

666
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,360
Some guy?

667
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,500
Why is he calling now?

668
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,640
I don't know.

669
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,870
It's obvious.

670
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,270
I'm sure he's just bored.

671
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,800
That may be true,

672
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,470
but he keeps asking me out.

673
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,140
And you're going to see him?

674
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,440
What else could I do?

675
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,470
He keeps texting me, saying he'll die if I don't see him.

676
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,000
I can't believe you.

677
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,140
You're going to see him?

678
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,100
Even though you're not interested in him?

679
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,060
Women are like that.

680
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:34,200
We get interested when men are interested in us.

681
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,060
He keeps saying he'll take me out for barbecue.

682
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,200
What should I do?

683
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,240
He wants to take you out for barbecue?

684
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,290
I love barbecue.

685
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,600
I think I should give him a chance.

686
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,240
What should I do?

687
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,100
You can have barbecue at home.

688
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,200
I can take you out.

689
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,330
But I don't know how to say no.

690
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,160
What should I do?

691
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,990
What do you mean? Don't meet him.

692
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,300
Did you say yes?

693
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,830
- Yes.
- When is it?

694
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,760
Tomorrow at 7:00 pm.

695
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,970
Where?

696
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,160
At the barbecue place down the street.

697
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,740
Tomorrow  evening at 7, down the street.

698
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,170
Why is the food so salty today?

699
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,090
Can I get some water?

700
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,470
Yes, mom. What is it?

701
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,040
Let's play cards.

702
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,260
But I'm working right now.

703
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,770
Let's play one round.

704
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,400
I can't even take out the stroller!

705
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,130
I'm so upset.

706
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,000
Yes! I scored!

707
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,100
That's three points and you owe me a point.

708
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:04,330
Oh, you didn't get three points.

709
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:08,870
5 points and 3 points, that's 20 points.

710
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,270
Give it to me!

711
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,940
No!

712
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:17,030
You have no respect for your mom, huh?

713
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,100
Let's play one more round.

714
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,940
- I have to go.
- What?

715
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,260
Mom, thank you.

716
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:27,000
How can you win money and just leave?

717
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:30,170
Oh, he's useless.

718
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,030
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

719
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:36,770
Aeji.

720
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,890
This is the rain. Say it.

721
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,290
- Rain.
- Oh.

722
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,830
And

723
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,970
this is the grass.

724
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,140
Grass.

725
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,330
Good girl.

726
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:59,060
Learn this so you can play with me.

727
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,370
- For money.
- Okay.

728
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:07,240
Grow up quickly and play with me.

729
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,830
Nobody will play with me.

730
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,990
I'm so sad.

731
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,870
I should just die.
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

732
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,290
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

733
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,770
Let's do it again.

734
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,940
What's this?

735
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,930
Rain.

736
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,630
Good! You're so smart.

737
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,830
- Grandmother!
- You startled me.

738
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,390
This is crazy. What are you doing?

739
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,860
I can't believe this. Come with me.

740
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,700
Nice shot!

741
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,890
It's been a while. What do you want?

742
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,830
I'm not going back. That's the result.

743
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,990
I'm happy here for the first time in my life.

744
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,200
You know what?

745
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:18,160
Talk to my dad because he made me marry you.

746
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,560
Did you see that? Did you?

747
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:24,930
It went really far. Really far.

748
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,290
Why would you hang this here?

749
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,740
It's pathetic.

750
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,700
This is your problem.

751
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,390
It's better to forget and move on.

752
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,760
- I'd like to pay for them.
- Okay.

753
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,660
Please sign there.

754
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,790
Okay.

755
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,500
You took them back?

756
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,500
Why? You deserve them.

757
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:47,470
"Chasing money's made me lose my husband.
Why did I live this way?"

758
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,770
I thought so I was just going to buy them,

759
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:56,430
since I'm the one who earned the money, but I couldn't.

760
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,560
I'm so stupid.

761
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:00,140
I am stupid.

762
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,970
Does Sedal come home?

763
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,600
At least he comes home.

764
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,700
How do you feel?

765
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,830
You must eat well and sleep well.

766
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,240
Don't get stressed out.

767
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:17,860
Good night, Hobak.

768
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,830
Okay.

769
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,640
Father.

770
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,800
Was that Hobak?

771
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,700
Yes.

772
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,330
Is something wrong?

773
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,140
No, it's nothing.

774
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,600
She's stressed about work, I think.

775
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,290
Go inside, father.

776
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:41,390
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

777
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,630
How am I supposed to go on living?

778
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:46,200
Why should I even bother?

779
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:50,870
I should just die.
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

780
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,870
You should pay more attention to your grandmother.

781
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:57,440
Like how?

782
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:00,870
She wants a dog.

783
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,600
Imagine how lonely she must feel.

784
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,600
I'm not taking care of a dog.

785
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,370
I'm already too busy.

786
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,970
I'm not asking you to take care of it.

787
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,370
mother says she'll take care of it.

788
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,330
I bet she said that.

789
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,200
But I'll have to do it.

790
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:19,740
My friend has a dog, and I thought about getting one, too,

791
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,100
but it's a lot of work.

792
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,330
It's just like raising a child.

793
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,560
Feeding it, clothing it, cleaning up after it,

794
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:27,490
walking it, and bathing it.

795
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,700
Mother can do all that?

796
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:34,700
She'll play with it for a while and call me when it poops.

797
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:37,100
Right. Grandmother isn't lonely at all.

798
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:40,300
She goes to the senior center, plays go-stop with uncle, watches TV...

799
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,330
How dare she!

800
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,030
Let grandmother take the stroller out.

801
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,070
She never needed it before,

802
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:51,870
so why is she acting like that?

803
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,270
I can't do that.

804
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,700
Jungji has to ride it,

805
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,700
but grandmother goes to the market with it,

806
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,430
soiling it with vegetables and stuff.

807
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,860
So how can I put my baby in it?

808
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,400
How much was it?

809
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,160
When Jungji grows up a little,

810
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,130
she can push it around.

811
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,490
Why won't you let Aeji play with her?

812
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,240
Mother can take care of Aeji.

813
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,040
I don't believe you!

814
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:17,770
You should hear our side of the story.

815
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,470
She was teaching that little thing cards!

816
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,390
Telling her the names of the cards!

817
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,490
She said they should play for money.

818
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,130
But we learned it from our grandmothers, too.

819
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,670
As long as it doesn't turn into gambling,

820
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,700
playing cards with family is okay.

821
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:41,270
Playing that with grandmother is good.

822
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,500
Right, yes.

823
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,270
But uncle already does.

824
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,640
Why would a six year old gamble?

825
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:53,170
Must you beat mother at cards?

826
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:54,700
How much did you win?

827
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,700
A dollar and forty cents.

828
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:57,970
Give that back to her.

829
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,040
Mother says she won't talk to you.

830
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,830
You should've let her win.

831
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,890
Why would you make her mad by beating her?

832
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,990
But mom likes it like that.

833
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:09,400
When she gets upset, she asks to play again.

834
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,060
You know how she is.

835
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,870
She hates losing,

836
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,270
but when she always wins, she gets bored.

837
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,470
Whoever's free, take good care of her.

838
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,000
Don't ignore her.

839
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:22,740
She's not a child.

840
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,040
Why would we take care of her?

841
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,300
When you get old, you become a child.

842
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,260
What should we do? Play hopscotch?

843
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,770
Mother, please come out!

844
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,070
Let's play house.

845
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,660
She's sleeping.

846
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,940
You want to bet? I'm sure she's listening.

847
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,990
Your father's going to play with grandmother.

848
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:44,770
The meeting's over, right?

849
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,830
I'm home.

850
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,490
- Oh, hi.
- You're late.

851
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:53,390
Oh, my daughter, you must be hungry.

852
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,160
Here.

853
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,990
Oh, you must be hungry.

854
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:04,640
Eat slowly. You might get indigestion.

855
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:06,830
It's just around the corner.

856
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,490
How do you feel?

857
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:12,500
I'm sure you'll do really well.

858
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,840
Where are you going to apply?

859
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,390
Law school, of course.

860
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,790
We need a judge or a prosecutor in the family.

861
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,240
Stop talking about that.

862
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,630
Haebak should decide, not you, mom.

863
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,240
I thought you were going to be successful,

864
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,290
but look at you now. Nice going.

865
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,330
Who knows?
I might become a famous writer.

866
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,700
Shut up!

867
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,640
Why can't all my children be like Haebak?

868
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,060
She's so smart, she's so good.

869
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:42,490
I'm a lucky woman.

870
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:46,600
Kids like her always stab in the back.

871
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,400
How dare she?

872
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,200
You can't even write!

873
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,370
Here.

874
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,060
Oh.

875
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,870
You should try to change his mind.

876
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,800
You're home early.

877
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,390
Wait by the door around the time I come home.

878
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,290
Hey!

879
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,760
What's that?

880
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,800
Can't you tell? Golf clubs.

881
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,790
You never bought me anything like these.

882
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:42,290
Water.

883
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,290
Okay.

884
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,130
Ugh.

885
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:55,870
Here.

886
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,240
Why did you take this out?

887
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,870
I don't feel anything for you.

888
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:07,290
Stretched out t-shirts and my old undies suit you the best.

889
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,740
So stop trying to make it work.

890
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,740
Pack me lunch tomorrow.

891
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,600
We're going to see the autumn leaves.

892
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,200
All of us?

893
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:20,500
Not you. Me and the director.

894
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:22,240
They haven't changed colors yet.

895
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,500
Don't worry.

896
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:26,570
Me going there will change the colors.

897
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,260
There's nothing money can't buy.

898
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:36,440
When I get there, the leaves will get scared and start changing colors.

899
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,090
What should I make?

900
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,770
Why are you making that face?

901
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:42,890
Why?

902
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,530
I'm not going out there to have fun.

903
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,440
This is work related.

904
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,930
I'm getting paid,

905
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,790
so I must do what my boss tells me to do.

906
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,200
You love it when I get paid.

907
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,700
You said your dream was for me to get a job

908
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:57,140
and bring home a paycheck every month.

909
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,640
What should I make?
Rice rolls? Sandwiches?

910
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,940
I don't want boring things like that.

911
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,470
Write these down.

912
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,060
Go.

913
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,290
Don't make me repeat myself.

914
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,970
Go.

915
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,400
Pancakes, shabu-shabu.

916
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,290
Don't misspell them, okay?

917
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,930
It's shabu-shabu.

918
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:31,560
Marinade some beef, glass noodles,

919
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,530
sushi, and some fritters.

920
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:36,700
Oh, including vegetables and shrimp,

921
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:40,370
and potatoes, sweet potatoes, and stuff.

922
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,290
Some sweet and sour pork, dumplings,

923
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,260
and I saw you making pizza before.

924
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,240
Oh, and pork cutlets.

925
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,830
Sintong and Bangtong love them, so don't

926
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,370
forget, so I can think of them when I eat it.

927
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,970
That's it.

928
00:56:57,010 --> 00:57:00,390
Shabu-shabu and marinated beef would be difficult to eat outdoors.

929
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,860
I'll make the rest.

930
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:08,630
The director hates kimchi because it smells, so don't put any of that in.

931
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,800
I'm going to sleep in the living room,

932
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,990
so you can sleep here, feeling lonely.

933
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,470
I have a question.

934
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,790
Do men usually cheat on their wives?

935
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:31,470
I don't know because I'm not married yet.

936
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,770
Some do, and some don't.

937
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,470
Doesn't the same go for women?

938
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,160
I'm sure.

939
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,590
But let's say

940
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:42,540
some rich woman appears in front of you.

941
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,800
Would you fall for her?

942
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,030
Me? I don't fall for money.

943
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,370
If she were extremely sexy, maybe.

944
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,790
Is it about your brother in law?

945
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,990
It's not about my family.

946
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:58,840
Don't worry.

947
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,140
When she runs out of money, he'll come back.

948
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:04,040
What if she's really rich?

949
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:06,040
Hey, sucker, listen carefully.

950
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:09,040
A relationship based on money doesn't last.

951
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:13,240
Money is extremely attractive,
but that's all there is to it.

952
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:15,270
Really?

953
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,770
That actually made me feel better.

954
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,500
Sangnam, you sure know a lot of things.

955
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,770
There are more things I don't know about.

956
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,540
It's not like I'm really old.

957
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:27,600
You were good in school, weren't you?

958
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,890
I did read a lot of books.

959
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,430
Are you drinking something?

960
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:37,370
Coffee from the tumbler my sucker bought me.

961
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:41,000
I'm not using mine.

962
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,800
I don't even know where I put it.

963
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,890
Huh?

964
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,430
You better know!

965
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:51,060
Let's go on a golf trip to Southeast Asia.

966
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,740
I don't practice.

967
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:56,640
I've been playing it for 10 years, so I don't need to.

968
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:00,940
Okay. Let's play a game sometime.

969
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:04,200
This is nutty, nutty, nuts.

970
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,200
You went grocery shopping?

971
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,700
Make it good!

972
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:20,100
What's that?

973
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:22,300
What do you mean?

974
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,560
That.

975
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,700
Oh, I got some medicine.

976
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:27,390
I have a headache.

977
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,200
I'm sure you do.

978
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,500
Don't I have any red socks?

979
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:15,400
Huh? Red socks?

980
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,430
Why are you all startled?

981
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,500
Make sure they're delicious,

982
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:22,570
so my director would like them.

983
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:23,930
She asked me why I live with you,

984
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:26,090
and I told her it's because you're a good cook.

985
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:28,240
Go and get ready.

986
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:39,060
Right, red socks.

987
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,240
Uh, okay.

988
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:42,400
Okay.

989
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,030
What's wrong?

990
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,700
Drink it.

991
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:00,930
No.

992
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,030
You have a long day ahead of you, so drink.

993
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:09,790
You doing this won't change my mind.

994
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,160
So stop making useless effort.

995
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,630
Just do what I ask and ignore me.

996
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,500
It tastes...

997
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:31,270
Why? Does it taste weird?

998
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,290
If it's weird, don't drink it.

999
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,470
Did you mix something in here?

1000
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,700
I didn't!

1001
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:43,100
It's a combination of vegetables.

1002
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:45,830
It must taste weird.

1003
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,830
It's incredible.

1004
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,270
Keep making this for me from now on.

1005
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,970
This is so good that I'm going nuts.

1006
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:39,380

1007
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,830
Oh, uncle!

1008
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,160
She's eating the same food we're eating.

1009
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,330
Don't lay a finger on me.

1010
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,390
This is attempted murder.

1011
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,860
Don't go. I'm sorry.

1012
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,500
Why do you think I did that?

1013
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,040
I'm a woman, too.

1014
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:56,770
What? You know it's me!

1015
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,800
Don't eat that. Come out this instant.

1016
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,330
What are you doing? You have no manners.

1017
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,790
It wasn't me, Anggeum.

1018
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,140
I can't believe you're lying to me.

1019
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:07,900
If you were my son, I would beat you.

1020
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,160
Go ahead!

1021
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:12,860
Let's see how well you do without us!

1022
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,330
Let's leave this darn house.

1023
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,240
What are you two planning on doing?

1024
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,500
I haven't given any thought yet.

1025
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:22,770
How dare you? Who do you think you are?

1026
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,170
You know what you deserve?
