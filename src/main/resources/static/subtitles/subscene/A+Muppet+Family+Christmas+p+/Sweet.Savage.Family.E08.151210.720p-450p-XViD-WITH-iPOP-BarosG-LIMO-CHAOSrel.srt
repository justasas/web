3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,350
Yoon Sung Min!

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,140
You turned in a blank test paper

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,150
turned off your phone,
and skipped cram school.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,840
How dare you come home?

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,730
Should I leave?

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,970
You've gone insane!

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,040
What's wrong with you?

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,610
Aren't you going to college?

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,790
I'll take care of it.
Leave me alone.

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,850
I'm your mom.
That's why I can't leave you alone.

13
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,840
I can't forgive you this time!

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,390
Forgive me?

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,470
Do you have the right to say that?

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,230
I have the right because I'm your mother.

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,900
I gave birth to you, and I raised you!

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,350
Only an innocent mom can say that.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,630
Honey!

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,830
How dare you? Did I not
ask you not to do this?

21
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,090
Is this all you are?

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,040
Why are you crying, like a baby?

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,660
Are you doing this for me to see? Huh?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,760
Answer me!

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,970
Sung Min!

26
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,190
Oh, my...

27
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,100
What was that noise?
Are they fighting?

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,420
You didn't hear the shocking news?

29
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,460
Yoon Sung Min, our family's pride,
turned in a blank test paper.

30
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,660
What? Is that true?

31
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,480
Ma'am, it's going to fall off!

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,840
Ah...

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,510
Why the heck did he do that?

34
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,530
Any sign of Sung Min?

35
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,630
What's gotten into him?

36
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,440
Well... actually...

37
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,600
Somehow, Sung Min found out.

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,100
It turns out, he wanted
to have a paternity test.

39
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,500
What?

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,250
Oh, no...

41
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,540
Honey, hurry up.
We need to find Sung Min!

42
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,960
Okay.

43
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,570
<i>The customer's phone has been turned off.
Please leave a voice message.</i>

44
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,340
His cell phone is off.

45
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,440
How could he be so immature?

46
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,640
Hello?

47
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,120
- <i>Sir, this is Hyun Jee.</i>
- Who?

48
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,810
<i>Hyun Jee, Sung Min's friend.</i>

49
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,160
Hyun Jee?

50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,510
Yes.

51
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,640
Wait a second.
I'll put my mom on the phone.

52
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
It's Sung Min's dad.

53
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,230
It's me, Tae Soo.

54
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,310
Hyun Jee was talking to
Sung Min on the phone.

55
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,460
He didn't sound good,
so she went over to see him.

56
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,420
And he was in really rough shape.

57
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,010
He took an Advil and fell asleep.

58
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,370
Let Eun Ok know.

59
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,160
So he's at your place?

60
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,750
Okay, I'll be there soon.

61
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,100
Why don't you let him sleep here tonight?

62
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,650
He finally just fell asleep.
He's sick, let him sleep.

63
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,140
Okay.

64
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,150
I'm sorry for imposing on you.

65
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,270
But yes, please, let him stay there.

66
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,570
Okay then.

67
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,500
What's going on?

68
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,560
Why should Sung Min stay at her house?

69
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,070
Bring him home right now!

70
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,520
He has a fever. He took some
medicine and just fell asleep.

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,500
Let him stay there for tonight.

72
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,210
Honey!

73
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,530
Nothing good will come out of it
if you two see each other now anyway.

74
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,920
If my mom finds out,
the whole family will be in turmoil.

75
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,530
Stay strong. You need
to pull yourself together.

76
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,380
That's the first step in this process.

77
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,840
Okay?

78
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,400
Oh, man.

79
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,750
Oh! You're up?

80
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,550
Good. Now you have the temperature
of a normal human being.

81
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,230
Are you feeling okay?

82
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,450
Do you remember how you got here?

83
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,370
What was that medicine?

84
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,100
Why do you take it so often?

85
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,280
We were talking about you.

86
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,650
Drink some water.

87
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,780
Mom said you should
drink water to keep hydrated.

88
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,410
Come on!

89
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,600
Geez, who knew my first love
would be such an pathetic man?

90
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,970
So...

91
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,520
Do you feel better, now that you've
hurt your parents and ran away?

92
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,410
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

93
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,520
I'm being serious.

94
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,020
My dad is not my birth father.

95
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,370
Mom deceived me for 18 years.

96
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,670
But you're telling me to act cool?

97
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,140
Now that you say it like that,
I guess it makes sense.

98
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,100
Listen.

99
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,320
This has helped me get through
tough times in the past.

100
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,550
<i>As you know, this test was very
important for his transcript.</i>

101
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,480
<i>Turning in a blank test
is really damaging.</i>

102
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,530
Sometimes particularly exemplary students
rebel like this due to stress.

103
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,900
The way you take action,
as his mother, will be very important.

104
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,050
Do Kyung.

105
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,330
It's me.

106
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,740
Can you do me a favor?

107
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,640
Let's just talk, without causing a scene.

108
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,180
It won't take long.

109
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,840
I understand why you are upset.

110
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,120
Regardless of whether or not you can
forgive me, there isn't much I can say.

111
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,610
That being said, are you going to let all
of the effort you've put in, go to waste?

112
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,920
What benefit did you gain from
turning in a blank test paper?

113
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,560
Sung Min, let's be reasonable here, okay?

114
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,450
All you care about is my grades.

115
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,980
Wouldn't it be right for you
to give me an explanation first?

116
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,820
Don't you think that you should tell me
who my birth father is, or what happened?

117
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,590
I know you're upset.
I know you're confused.

118
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,470
But can't you understand that I had
my reasons for keeping this from you?

119
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
That's your business.

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,740
You don't care about my feelings.

121
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,460
Yoon Sung Min!

122
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,660
Hey!

123
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,110
Hey!

124
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,800
Is this really how you're going to act?

125
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,860
I'm having a hard time
keeping up with you!

126
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,770
Hey! Ah--

127
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,240
That's why I told you not to follow me.

128
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,400
How much more time are you going
to waste acting like a child?

129
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,590
Whether he's your birth father
or not, you live with him.

130
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,040
Since you were born,
he's protected you and loved you.

131
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,190
You've had a good life!

132
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,100
Do you know how secure
that should make you feel?

133
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,970
Can't you just let it go
and only think about that?

134
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,670
I'm about to go crazy because I can't!

135
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,190
Then what was the point
of telling me all of that?

136
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,670
You should have agonized all by yourself!

137
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,840
You're right.

138
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,760
I'm regretting that now!

139
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,100
I told you everything about me

140
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,870
while you can't even tell me
about your secret medicine.

141
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,240
Hyun Jee!

142
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,170
Hyun Jee! Baek Hyun Jee!

143
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,620
Hyun Jee!

144
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,610
Hyun Jee!

145
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,840
What happened?
What's wrong with her?

146
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,250
Out of nowhere, she just
started having trouble breathing.

147
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,050
I turned around for a moment,
and she was on the ground.

148
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,660
What did the doctor say?

149
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,920
He said that she's stabilized,
and that she'll be okay.

150
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,040
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

151
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,420
You. What did you do to Hyun Jee?

152
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,760
Don't do that. It's not his fault.

153
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,560
He just said that it is!

154
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,010
Say something.

155
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,630
What did you do, that she had
to go to the emergency room?

156
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,810
Gi Bum! It's not his fault. Let him go.

157
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,240
Sung Min!

158
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,410
What happened?
Is Hyun Jee okay?

159
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,190
She's okay. Take Sung Min home now.

160
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,990
No, you can't!

161
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,040
Hey, how did you raise your boy, huh?

162
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,790
Don't make a scene!

163
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,110
If you don't want to know the issue,
then you can keep acting that way.

164
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,090
The doctor said she'd be okay.

165
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,620
Her mom said it wasn't your fault.

166
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,090
If anyone is at fault...

167
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,340
it's me.

168
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,380
As for me...

169
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,240
If my children suffer...

170
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,320
All the blame falls on me.

171
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,770
Because I didn't lead a proper life,
my children are getting punished.

172
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,590
Even though I know that,
I still don't live the right way.

173
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,220
That's why I feel ashamed,
and that's why I'm sorry.

174
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,630
Dad...

175
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,880
They say blood is thicker than water.

176
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,670
But do you know what's
even thicker than blood?

177
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,090
When I think about you, Sung Min...

178
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:58,100
I feel something overflowing,
deep down and through my heart.

179
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,650
To me, whatever that is,
it feels thicker than blood.

180
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,100
That's the truth.

181
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,970
Dad...

182
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,910
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,840
I was wrong.

184
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,190
That's not true.

185
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,500
Geez.

186
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,340
You're still a baby.

187
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,170
When will you grow up? Huh?

188
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,030
She's taking psychiatric medication?

189
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,720
For what? Why?

190
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,670
Calm down. You'll wake Hyun Jee up.

191
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,450
So hurry up and tell me.

192
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,710
You know she's been
training to be a singer.

193
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,300
I was told she did since sixth grade.

194
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,890
The competitive environment
was too much for that little thing.

195
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,780
She didn't even say anything about it.

196
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,060
Eventually, she began
suffering from anxiety disorder.

197
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,020
Don't worry too much.

198
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,120
She's taking medicine.
She's getting treated.

199
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,220
And she's been much better
since we came here.

200
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,560
What dosage did they give her?

201
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,070
What's the company? What's the name?

202
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,870
Who's the CEO?

203
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,800
I'll take my guys
and teach them a lesson!

204
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,090
You are hopeless.

205
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,000
Why do you think I kept this from you?

206
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,600
What do you think Hyun Jee
needs the most during this time?

207
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,500
Rest! And parents on whom she can rely.

208
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,360
But see what you're trying to do.

209
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,860
What can you achieve with your fists?

210
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,450
A father like you can't help.

211
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:59,960
I was just... upset to hear
Hyun Jee was sick.

212
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,410
Can I ride along when Hyun Jee
goes to see her doctor?

213
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,590
I would like to give her a ride at least.

214
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,430
Let me know when she goes.

215
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,790
When did you wake up?

216
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,930
Did you fight with Dad?

217
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,370
No.

218
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,350
I was just trying to calm him down.
He was very upset to hear about you.

219
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,150
He has to be upset.

220
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,390
You didn't tell him everything, right?

221
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,770
No, I just told him it was due to stress.

222
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,560
Mom, I just...

223
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,840
I don't want him to ever
know what happened.

224
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,720
Okay.

225
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,530
Lord, if you ask me...

226
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,400
what sin have I committed...

227
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:33,590
My biggest sin is that even though
I loved Do Kyung and Hyun Jee

228
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,850
I let them leave. I didn't protect them.

229
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,140
Oh, how I hate myself so much.

230
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,350
But...

231
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,820
I want to change my ways...

232
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,650
so that I can get
Do Kyung and Hyun Jee back.

233
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,120
If you ask me again,
what my biggest sin is...

234
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,780
What you are doing now is a sin.

235
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,450
Pardon?

236
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,750
You should keep it quiet in the church.

237
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,690
Okay.

238
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,640
Welcome back!

239
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,600
My grandchild!

240
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,700
Look how thin you are!

241
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,570
Welcome back! All is good,
as long as you're back.

242
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,160
I'm sorry for making you worry.

243
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,190
Don't say that!

244
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,050
You must have been really stressed out!

245
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,320
You turned in a blank paper and ran
away from home? You're pathetic!

246
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,900
I told your mom to not stress you out.

247
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,230
So take it easy! Come here!

248
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,950
What's all this? Is this a party?

249
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,450
Sung Min,
I made spicy rice cakes for you!

250
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,880
And Grandma and I bought the pizza!

251
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,040
It must be nice!
Everyone worried about you!

252
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,850
Eat up before the food gets cold!

253
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,480
You should sit down too.

254
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,880
Grandma, the way you
pronounce "stress" is wrong.

255
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,130
Who cares? Just eat up!

256
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,380
This is all mine!

257
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,050
- Okay. Eat up.
- Looks yummy!

258
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,900
I didn't think that I could
keep it a secret forever.

259
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,860
I was going to tell you...

260
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,390
Right around the time you got married.

261
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,410
Everything you want to know is in here.

262
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,420
Good night.

263
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,740
Not that... two red bagels
and two Americanos.

264
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,150
Boss, you look tired.

265
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,410
I couldn't sleep at all
last night. I was so upset.

266
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,090
Did something happen?

267
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,610
How can I sleep well when I can't
protect my wife and daughter?

268
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,910
Bub Gyu, I will get back
together with Do Kyung.

269
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,590
Geez, the chairman won't leave you alone.

270
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,180
I have to face him someday.

271
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,400
I'll have a good plan.
He won't be able to say much.

272
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,710
I'm going to die from running!

273
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,650
I said he wouldn't sell the house.
Why are you still sending people over?

274
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,340
I don't care. Bye!

275
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,300
Is your house still up for sale?

276
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:04,070
The chairman is too much!

277
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,080
He's trying to control you with that!

278
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,030
Boss, you said that you
were meeting him today.

279
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,320
Don't beat around the bush.
Be frank with him!

280
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,800
It'll backfire for sure!
You know how he is.

281
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,700
It's better to kneel down and beg--

282
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,740
Hey! Boss doesn’t deserve
that kind of humiliation!

283
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,610
- That's not important at this point.
- Then what?

284
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,200
Be quiet.

285
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,400
I'll take care of it.

286
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,820
Cheers!

287
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,870
Your script was so good,
I wanted to treat you to dinner.

288
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,360
But then, Director Baek
said that I should do it right.

289
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,280
That's why I prepared this.

290
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,450
I wanted to brag about
your grilling expertise.

291
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,170
Isn't this nice, Madam Oh?

292
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,690
It was a great idea, Mr. Chairman.

293
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,720
I was going to invite the
hard-working staff over anyway.

294
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,060
What do you think, Dad?

295
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,010
Since I became the CEO,
the script got so much better!

296
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,800
You don't worry about a thing,
and just enjoy the show.

297
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,850
Don't get ahead of yourself.

298
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:14,670
We finally have a good script,
all thanks to the chairman.

299
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,350
We couldn't have even started this
movie without you, Mr. Chairman.

300
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,710
We came this far because of your support.

301
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:26,240
Truly, we need someone
like you to support us!

302
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,650
I didn't do anything,
but I feel good, huh?

303
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,300
I haven't seen a script
as good as this one

304
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,650
since Moon Hee's Black Stream.

305
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,890
Our hero, Director Bong! Eat up!

306
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,500
Thank you. It looks good.

307
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,130
Oh!

308
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,940
Why? Is the meat bad?

309
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,400
No. It's so delicious,
I was caught off-guard.

310
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,880
As for me, the ending was a bit crazy.

311
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,110
Is it right that a guy who ran away with
a gangster's wife gets to live happily?

312
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,610
What about it?

313
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,410
I thought that was the best part!

314
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,940
What do you call that...
fantasy! It's got fantasy!

315
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,090
Director Yoon has an
eye for good scripts.

316
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,640
The victory of a man
who risked his life for love!

317
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,760
That is so touching!

318
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,940
Don't you agree?

319
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,350
Yes... ah. Ah, ah.

320
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,710
Yes... ah. Yes.

321
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,740
It can happen in a movie.

322
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,600
But not in real life.

323
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,020
What would happen
if it were a real story?

324
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,050
Dad, what about these?

325
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:06,210
Geez, aren't they so plump?

326
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,540
Oh, geez, Director Bong!

327
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,080
I'm sorry. I was too worked up.

328
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,880
He'd be lucky to have his life spared.

329
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,510
Here!

330
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,220
We are out of alcohol.

331
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,410
I'll bring some from your study.

332
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,230
I'll go with you.

333
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,910
I'm a bit curious.

334
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:50,160
I'd love to take a look
at your book collection.

335
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,290
Man, he's definitely a writer.

336
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:11,090
Seriously! Why did you
do that to me, Madam?

337
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,300
What? You came here following me.

338
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,820
I came here to tell you to stop.

339
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,040
Didn't you see him?

340
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,880
He cut it off... and then...

341
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:28,190
The sacrifice of the green pepper and the
tomatoes made me realize something...

342
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,030
Which is... life is valuable.

343
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,620
Do you really want me to die?

344
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:39,850
Then... what about the Napoleon and
Josephine analogies in the script?

345
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,060
That was exactly our story!

346
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,190
Of course, you inspire me!

347
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,610
That's why I was able to
complete the script in the first place!

348
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,770
However, this isn't the time...

349
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:56,100
to follow our impulsive emotions.
It's time to be reasonable!

350
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,850
You completed a script because
of the inspirations I gave you.

351
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,700
Are you saying you don't need me anymore?

352
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,910
That's not what I'm saying.

353
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,780
I don't even know what I'm feeling!

354
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,250
Mr. Chairman, please take this.

355
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,320
Huh?

356
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,990
I put the meat, the sauce,
and my respect together in the wrap!

357
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,940
You worked hard grilling the meat.

358
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,730
I can't eat it, I have indigestion.

359
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,650
Oh...

360
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,140
Tae Soo, you're being so obvious.

361
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,590
What?

362
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,940
Dad, let him live in that house.

363
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,140
I can't watch this. It's so sad.

364
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,330
You really suck at sucking up!

365
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,490
By the way, you should
come downtown sometime.

366
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,950
There's a new restaurant
that you'll really like.

367
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,680
I want to take you there.

368
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,310
What do you want?

369
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,180
It's not like that.

370
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,680
Let's have dinner with Do Kyung.

371
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,110
Speak Korean when you're supposed to.

372
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,830
Worry about those calculations later.

373
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,540
Don't be like that.

374
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,410
You've been like that long enough!

375
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,330
Be quiet. Stop drinking.

376
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,980
There's nothing to drink!

377
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,430
Are you distilling your own liquor?
Where the hell are they?

378
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,870
Producer Lee, go check the study.

379
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,250
Sure.

380
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,680
Really, why are they taking so long?

381
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,090
Director Bong!

382
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,760
Oh, Producer Lee.

383
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,430
What are you reading?

384
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,460
I showed him a very good book.

385
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,240
We'll be there soon.
Can you take the drinks?

386
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,490
Why don't we all go together?
They're waiting.

387
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,670
No, you go first. We'll be there soon.

388
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,650
Okay. Come soon.

389
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,230
What should we take?

390
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,710
Hey... that one.

391
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,000
Okay.

392
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,570
Oh my...

393
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,950
Please stop! We almost got caught!

394
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,510
You started, Director Bong!

395
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,600
Who did? I did?

396
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,560
Geez, I'm sorry.

397
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,740
I'm the emotional type.
I tend to get excited.

398
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,030
What should we do now?

399
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,670
Oh geez.

400
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,450
I have no idea. What I do know,
is that we shouldn't do this.

401
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,070
You're so interested in
other people's business.

402
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,340
But you're so indifferent
to your own granddaughter!

403
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,840
Do you know why
Hyun Jee came back? Do you?

404
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,310
If you're drunk, then go to sleep!

405
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,740
I'm not saying this because I'm drunk.
I can't hold it in anymore!

406
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,530
- What's wrong?
- You stay out!

407
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:41,360
I will get back together with Do Kyung.

408
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,160
I will live with Do Kyung and Hyun Jee.

409
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,830
Gi Bum, stop it.

410
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,150
You stop talking about the
house already! I'm sick of it!

411
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,290
What? Why didn't you read it?

412
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,100
Aren't you curious as to
who your real father is?

413
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,880
I am curious... very much so.

414
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,900
And?

415
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,540
Mom's diary will be like Pandora’s box.

416
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,290
I wish I never found out
in the first place.

417
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:19,090
Even that was too much for me.

418
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:23,260
If I open her diary,
I don't think I'll handle it well.

419
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:29,640
And the bottom line is...
I only have one father.

420
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,880
Oh, Yoon Sung Min.
You're cool as a cucumber.

421
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,540
You've become mature overnight!

422
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:43,060
Just a few days ago, you were a crybaby!

423
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,350
I got it.

424
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,820
Anyway, let's not feel
sorry for each other.

425
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,150
For what?

426
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:52,410
You know my secret.
I know your secret.

427
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,830
We're even.

428
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,590
I'm not sure if you know this.

429
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,010
My nickname is,
"Handsome man with good looks."

430
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,000
I will help you.

431
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,690
I won't make you upset,
and I will help you feel at ease.

432
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,580
So what's your point?

433
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,740
Are you apologizing, or are you saying
you'll stay with me as my wonderful man?

434
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,820
What?

435
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,620
Tell me. Is this the first time you’re
telling a girl that you like her?

436
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,480
What are you talking about?

437
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,320
You paid extra attention to
your clothes and your hair today.

438
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,040
You came here before me
and set the table with sweets.

439
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,940
More importantly, you are babbling--

440
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,350
Not true.

441
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,940
This isn't my first time.

442
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,630
Are you telling me you like me then?

443
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,180
I have to go somewhere.
You stay here and think about it.

444
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,090
Geez.

445
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,310
In a movie?

446
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:06,620
Yes, I think you are
perfect for the character.

447
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,300
"A mysterious cafe owner."

448
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,180
It's one of the lead roles.

449
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,140
Dad, it's a mistake.

450
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,920
I watched her movies. She's really bad.

451
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,740
Hey... my daughter?

452
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,890
You are hurting my feelings.

453
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,880
I guess I was too honest, huh?

454
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,190
Yes, that was mean.

455
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,440
Regardless, you should star in the movie.

456
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,700
Hyun Jee, you make music for the movie.

457
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,950
What music?

458
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,680
The original soundtrack!

459
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,880
I look forward to it.

460
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,100
Really?

461
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,210
Do you think the CEO of a movie company
is just joking around with his daughter?

462
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:53,250
I'll make your dreams come true!
Just tell me what you want!

463
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,240
The Sun? The Moon?
I'll get them for you! Just tell me.

464
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,410
You don't seem to believe me.
Should I get the moon?

465
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,520
What?

466
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,380
He took her to the hospital
for her treatment today.

467
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,670
I don't think Lee Do Kyung
accepted his offer for the role yet.

468
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,680
I was nervous about this...

469
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,360
What an idiot!

470
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,600
Yes, Mr. Chairman?

471
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,270
Sure. I'll call you later.

472
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,820
Yes.

473
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,680
Would you take a look at this.

474
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,800
Director Yoon!

475
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,300
What brings you here, Officer Seo?

476
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,420
Who were you talking to?
You never answer my calls.

477
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,780
I was worried about your daughter.
I called you many times.

478
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,190
A woman answered.

479
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,390
"The customer cannot answer his phone.
Please leave your message."

480
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:52,680
Don't worry about my daughter.

481
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,020
Nothing happened.

482
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,180
Really? That's a relief.

483
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,440
A father who worries about
his daughter coming home late

484
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,270
is either a policeman or a gangster.

485
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,900
They both have many enemies.

486
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,520
That's why I'm not married.

487
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,580
I want to focus on my police work.

488
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,470
Bro... I'm a bit busy. I have to go.

489
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,490
I wish I were busy too!

490
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:23,100
I'm jealous of these
busy guys, running around!

491
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,490
By the way, you know what?

492
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,560
A guy called me and said he was
Mr. Son from the movie company.

493
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,460
Do you know what Son Se Woon said?

494
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,800
He said he would bring me
a big blessing next week.

495
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,660
He told me to wait until then.

496
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,730
Okay! Then you should wait, right?
Keep on waiting!

497
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,150
Do you think that I'm joking?

498
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,890
He asked me for the new address
of the production company.

499
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,050
If he calls you, let me know.
Don't go alone.

500
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,670
Of course. How will he come?

501
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,530
Will he fall through the clouds,
or blow in with the wind?

502
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:08,360
Geez, are you saying he'll show up
like Son Oh Kong, because he's Son?

503
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,410
Isn't that Yoon Tae Soo?

504
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,850
Who's the guy next to him?
He looks familiar.

505
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,470
I think that's Officer Seo.

506
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,350
That's right.

507
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,640
Why are they talking?
I don't like it!

508
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,280
Get struck by lightning!

509
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,140
What is this?

510
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,810
Open it, first.

511
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,930
Mr. Chairman, isn't this
the title to the house?

512
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,100
I know how you feel, Tae Soo.

513
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:56,440
Honestly, compared to what you've done
for me all these years, this isn't much.

514
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,290
You must have been worried a lot.

515
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,790
I had no idea how much
you were thinking about me.

516
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:09,490
I'll work even harder for you
from now on, Mr. Chairman.

517
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,940
You're already doing a good job.

518
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,910
Don't say that.

519
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:19,610
You're giving me a house.
There's nothing I can't do for you.

520
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:23,340
If you need anything done,
please, just give me your orders.

521
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,750
Actually, there is one thing.

522
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,480
What is it? Consider it done!

523
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:35,970
It's not a big thing. There won't be
any blood on your hands for this one.

524
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,950
There's someone I need to send far away.

525
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,510
I don't want Lee Do Kyung to live here.

526
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,520
Pardon?

527
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,900
I want her to be gone from Daejeon.

528
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,650
As soon as possible.

529
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:59,030
Do Kyung, are you going back to acting?

530
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:03,330
I told you. I haven't decided yet.

531
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:07,150
Look at her. She won't budge.

532
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,070
You're making us jealous.

533
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,680
Okay!

534
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,360
"You mind your business."

535
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,550
"You humiliated me."

536
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:23,270
"I'll take it off if you tell me to."

537
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,200
"Bok Gil!"

538
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,780
"Bok Gil's Mama! He's eating
stuff off of the ground!"

539
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,540
"Bok Gil's Mama!"

540
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,070
That's right!

541
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,390
Can you get me a role too?

542
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,750
Back in school, I was in an acting club.
Make my dreams come true!

543
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,960
Huh? Huh?

544
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,150
Okay, I will ask him.

545
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,150
Nice!

546
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,920
Everyone in One Heart
could be in the movie!

547
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,900
That's great!

548
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,400
Hey.

549
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,800
Doesn't the director decide the cast?

550
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,170
He may be the CEO,
but he's a bit out of line.

551
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,940
He's not a tyrant.

552
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,920
You don't know this field.

553
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,150
The CEO has a lot of
control over the movie.

554
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,930
Tae Soo, who is the film's
primary investor, didn't say anything.

555
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:17,110
That's because Gi Bum has all
the power to make decisions.

556
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,920
I heard that they are
equals in what they do.

557
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,160
Well, Gi Bum has someone
who has his back.

558
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,420
You mean the chairman?

559
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:32,440
Speaking of him,
does he know what's going on?

560
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,360
Won't he be upset when he finds out,
just like he was regarding the election?

561
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,590
Is that what you want?

562
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:44,440
It's not that. I just don't you
to spill cold water all over it.

563
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,000
Cold water?

564
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,830
Do you hate me being in
the movie that much?

565
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,640
Why are you fighting again?
We have yummy chicken here.

566
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,470
Please just enjoy the chicken.

567
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,570
Try the drumstick.

568
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,110
- Get that out of my face.
- Okay.

569
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,750
Oh?

570
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:10,750
<i>Ladies of One Heart,
please come tonight at 7 p.m.</i>

571
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:14,150
<i>Choong Shim Pictures and
One Heart will have a joint gathering.</i>

572
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:17,100
<i>Baek Gi Bum from Choong Shim Pictures.</i>

573
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,070
Welcome, everyone!

574
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,640
We are here today

575
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,100
to announce Choong Shim Pictures'
first movie, "The Man with Two Faces"

576
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,570
and to congratulate
Lee Do Kyung on her lead role!

577
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:38,330
I'm paying for everything at this party!

578
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,190
Please enjoy the food and drinks,
and everyone have a great time!

579
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,850
Thank you!

580
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,170
Put your hands together!

581
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,320
Casting?

582
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,400
I'm not sure. Let's wait and see.
Nothing is confirmed yet.

583
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,430
Thank you.

584
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,900
We're going to start the night
with Do Kyung's song.

585
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,460
Actress Lee Do Kyung!

586
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,550
Don't do that!

587
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,440
Please come up to the stage!

588
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,980
Don't be shy. You're going to
be in a movie soon! Come on!

589
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,480
I said I didn't decide yet.

590
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,810
It's decided! Come to the stage! Come on!

591
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,800
Wow!

592
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,450
Kyung Mee, should we do it together?

593
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,500
Go ahead.

594
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,110
Shall we?

595
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,760
Then how about the three of us?

596
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,870
Eun Ok, come out!

597
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,800
- I don't want to.
- Hey!

598
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,870
Eun Ok, please help her!

599
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,800
I said I don't want to!

600
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,190
- Ho Soo High!
- I don't want to!

601
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,560
I don't want to!

602
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,500
Please help Do Kyung!

603
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:50,270
Kim Eun Ok! Kim Eun Ok!

604
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,670
Kim Eun Ok!

605
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,560
This woman...

606
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,090
Geez, it hurts!

607
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,780
Lee Do Kyung has incredible
passion and amazing talents!

608
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,790
I look forward to your movie!

609
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,730
Wow!

610
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,740
- Good job.
- Let's toast!

611
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:10,450
To our new movie, and to
Lee Do Kyung's success!

612
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:14,280
Cheers!

613
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:19,270
You were awesome.

614
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,890
You're making me blush.

615
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,200
Who's blushing?

616
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,940
You're going to be in a movie soon!

617
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,630
Don't you need to discuss
casting with the director?

618
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,380
Geez, I'm the CEO here.

619
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,900
This is what I'm supposed to do.

620
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,790
Do you know a good salon?
Should I look around for you?

621
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:45,150
You need a new car. Oh, no...

622
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,550
You need a manager.

623
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:50,110
No, should you sign the contract first?

624
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,860
Geez, casting you has
given me a lot of work.

625
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:12,210
I dedicate this song to you!

626
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,840
<i>My dear, Do Kyung, whom I adore the most!</i>

627
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:27,040
<i>There isn't anything
I can't do, if you want it.</i>

628
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,550
<i>I'll get the stars from the sky for you.</i>

629
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,440
<i>Can I see you outside really quick?</i>

630
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,600
What's up? Do you have something to say?

631
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,250
Boss will be mad if he
finds out I told you this.

632
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,370
But I can't hold it inside anymore!

633
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:54,590
Why? Did something happen
to Tae Soo again?

634
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:58,690
The chairman presented the papers
to your house to Tae Soo.

635
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,010
He said he'd give it to him if Tae Soo
kicked Lee Do Kyung out of Daejeon.

636
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,150
What?

637
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,110
He said the house issue was resolved.

638
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,600
This is so damn frustrating.

639
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,440
He gets calls from
the realtor all the time

640
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,900
warning that he's sending
people over to look at the house.

641
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:37,530
<i>My dearest, Do Kyung!</i>

642
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:03,310
Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman!

643
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:06,130
Your daughter in-law is here!

644
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,650
What brings you here?

645
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:13,550
I heard your housekeeper quit.
So I brought you some side dishes.

646
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:16,850
You didn't hear that a new
housekeeper is coming tomorrow?

647
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:17,950
Oh...

648
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:23,100
This big house needs help every day.
We can't ask Madam Oh to suffer this way.

649
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,250
Should I fix your lunch?

650
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,920
No, thanks. Madam Oh isn't here.
And I'm not hungry.

651
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,130
I talked to her on the phone.

652
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,250
She won't be happy if
you start skipping meals.

653
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:40,180
Give me ten minutes.
I made nutritious rice too.

654
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,450
There's a fire in their house.

655
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:47,050
Both the husband and
the wife are going crazy.

656
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,930
<i>[To Director Bong: I'm thinking...]</i>

657
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,830
Miss, please bring me
two glasses of wine.

658
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,220
Let me see.

659
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,750
Nice.

660
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:24,050
What's going on?

661
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:37,870
Mr. Chairman, what brings you here?

662
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:41,550
You humiliated me!

663
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,510
Oh, man! Did you have a nightmare again?

664
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,230
No...

665
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,380
What's wrong?

666
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,540
What are you doing this to me?
I don't want to die!

667
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,100
Life is valuable.

668
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:14,490
Huh?

669
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,830
I need to go. I need to run away.

670
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:27,400
I need to write a new one! This is trash!

671
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,300
Burn it! Burn it!

672
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,960
What? Are you kidding me?

673
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,500
The story is not realistic!

674
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,820
Does it make sense that he runs away
with the wife of the head of a gang?

675
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,810
The first thing he should do
is run away from that woman!

676
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:45,250
I'll lock myself up in my house
for a week to rewrite the script.

677
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,740
If anyone asks, tell them I'm not here.

678
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,630
Please do that, Joon Seok, okay?

679
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:54,850
Thanks.

680
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,260
You better come to work tomorrow!

681
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,650
I won't!

682
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,510
Oh, Madam Oh!

683
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,660
Welcome home!

684
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,120
I told you not to come.
But you're still here?

685
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,710
I was going to leave after I fixed dinner
for the chairman and finished cleaning.

686
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:16,060
How was your book club meeting?

687
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,320
You said there was an artist guest today.

688
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,410
I used to do that kind
of thing in college.

689
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:26,650
A guy I liked wanted to
be a movie director.

690
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:30,130
It's all in the past.

691
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:32,630
Did you eat dinner? I brought eel--

692
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:33,940
Are you kidding me?

693
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,180
Do you know what time it is? Dinner?

694
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:41,790
Eel? I don't hate anything in life
as much as I hate eel.

695
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,230
Oh?

696
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,690
Huh?

697
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:48,940
You're still here? You said you
would leave after you set the table.

698
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,370
I was just about to finish up cleaning.

699
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:52,810
What are you doing here?

700
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,420
Why are you here getting scolded?

701
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,630
It's not that--

702
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,800
Oh! Did Tae Soo send you?

703
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,780
He's worried he might lose the house.
But he's using his wife?

704
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,370
Shame on him!

705
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,080
I'm not here because of that.

706
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,500
Leave immediately. I want to rest!

707
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,160
Don't do this. Please go home.

708
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,340
Tae Soo, you should come get your wife.

709
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,130
Eun Ok.

710
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,220
I'm sorry.

711
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,620
I'm sorry.

712
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:38,000
That was an idiotic decision.

713
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,260
Don't say that.

714
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,610
You didn't do anything wrong.

715
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:52,140
Geez, who are the people
living in these condos?

716
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,910
They look even taller today.

717
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,330
I got 30 college kids to open
bank accounts within a week.

718
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:17,830
One million won is too much.
Just give them 800,000 won.

719
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:21,610
If one of them argues,
then give them one million won.

720
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:23,950
You should be fair to everyone.

721
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,180
Okay. Then give them your money.

722
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,570
Oh, I'm sorry.

723
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:31,820
Stand up! We're here to make money, okay?

724
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,930
- Yes, Boss!
- Sit.

725
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,660
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

726
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:39,500
Who are you?

727
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,970
You can't see? We are the police.

728
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,560
What brings you here, Officer?

729
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,230
Would I be here to pick up those dishes?

730
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:52,190
I heard you were selling ghost
bank accounts to college kids.

731
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:53,630
You give them one million won?

732
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:57,530
What do you mean? I didn't hear anything
about that. Do you guys know anything?

733
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:58,650
I don't.

734
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:03,880
Geez, your hearts are darker
than those black noodles.

735
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,560
We're here because someone reported you.

736
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,950
Arrest them.

737
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,840
Hey, stop there!

738
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,720
Don't do that!

739
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:44,850
Geez...

740
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,900
What's the matter?

741
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,420
You couldn't sleep at all last night.

742
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,180
It's nothing.

743
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,440
I'm doing my best for you.

744
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,630
But I'm sure I'm lacking in many ways.

745
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:19,050
If you hate me or resent me,
don't forgive me! Just hit me.

746
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,700
With this.

747
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:31,420
My goodness! A gold ax?

748
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,500
It's pure gold. So don't
hit me too hard, okay?

749
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,910
You totally scared me! You're naughty!

750
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,660
Was I naughty? Then I'm bad!

751
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,120
Okay, you can hit me.

752
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,650
Oh, my goodness! Stop it.

753
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:59,660
Mr. Chairman, I have something
I want to do for you.

754
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:02,630
The script needs changing.

755
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,420
The chairman wants to see you.

756
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,840
Sir, Director Bong is here.

757
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:19,760
Okay, sit down.

758
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,710
Mr. Chairman, why did you want to see me?

759
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,860
Please save me! Mr. Chairman! I--

760
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:38,000
You save me.

761
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,210
Pardon?

762
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:45,540
Well, it's important
that the movie succeeds.

763
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,100
But the success of my personal life
is important as well.

764
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,290
What do you mean?

765
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:54,510
There's a writer who can
help you with your script.

766
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:55,670
A writer?

767
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:59,120
She's a genius writer, who loves books.

768
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,280
Madam Oh.

769
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:06,560
What's wrong?

770
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:11,190
Wow, Director Bong,
you came here yourself?

771
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:13,940
Mr. Chairman, why did you do that?

772
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,130
I just wanted to give him my opinion.

773
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,770
Oh, no. Words can change when
they pass through many mouths.

774
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,810
You should tell him in person,
so that your words don't get twisted.

775
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:25,980
Don't you agree?

776
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,040
Of course I do.

777
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:32,120
Mr. Chairman, you are the man
who makes things happen!

778
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,730
I'll get back to what I was doing.

779
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,880
Call me if you need me.

780
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,110
Please take me with you, Sir.

781
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:42,670
Please take me!

782
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:48,700
I'm trying to help you make a good movie.

783
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,460
Listen to the writer, and work hard.

784
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,540
Please think again! Please!

785
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,690
Why are you doing this to me?

786
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:08,680
With one word, I can make
your movie, or your life...

787
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,810
disappear like smoke.

788
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:17,540
Do you want me?

789
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,100
It's rude to ask a question
when you know the answer.

790
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:25,540
Director Bong, you found your
creative energy because of me, right?

791
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,670
Yes, that's true.

792
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:33,380
Do you know how amazing it is
to find someone you can talk to?

793
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:37,610
I'm not saying that we
should have a romance.

794
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:40,750
I'm simply saying we should help
with each others' intellectual needs.

795
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,880
Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 3 p.m.

796
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,710
Meet me right here.

797
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,100
Right here?

798
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:52,130
The chairman is literally holding
a sword, just outside that door!

799
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:54,270
It's quiet inside the eye of the storm.

800
00:56:54,750 --> 00:57:00,020
This thrill will give you
even more creative energy!

801
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:05,610
Your movie, and you and I,
need a perfect scenario!

802
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,490
<i>I don't want Lee Do Kyung to live here.</i>

803
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,860
<i>I want her to be gone from Daejeon.</i>

804
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:35,520
<i>I'm at the movie production office.
Can I see you here for a moment?</i>

805
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,660
Do Kyung!

806
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,360
Do Kyung?

807
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:48,470
I am Cho Dong Chool, you bastard!

808
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:57,860
How dare you act that way here?

809
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,840
Bastard!

810
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,770
What have I done so wrong to you, huh?

811
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:08,040
You can't get enough of me, huh?

812
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,330
You bastard!

813
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:12,320
What are you talking about?

814
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,100
You!

815
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:18,490
I know you told the police everything!

816
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:23,130
Because of you, all of
my guys got arrested!

817
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:25,090
Bastard!

818
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:32,000
I won't leave you alone anymore.

819
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,340
A mouse can bite through
a cast if he's cornered!

820
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:40,850
Geez.

821
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,880
Tae Soo.

822
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,610
Oh, Do Kyung.

823
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,890
Tae Soo.

824
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,820
Tae Soo.

825
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:59,410
She has nothing to do with me.
Let her go and talk to me.

826
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,940
Don't make me laugh.

827
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:04,690
If you want to save her, kneel.

828
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:06,390
Kneel!

829
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,900
Now!

830
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:11,910
Tae Soo.

831
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:14,670
I'll do it.

832
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:17,910
I'll do it. So you let her go now.

833
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:19,510
Let her go.

834
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:39,470
Hey, hey! Do it again! Kneel down again!

835
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:42,110
Do it again! Now!

836
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,030
You bastard!

837
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:55,100
He's nothing! How dare he?

838
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,110
Kneel down again!

839
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:00,850
What was that?

840
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,390
Tae Soo.

841
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,970
What have I done?

842
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:51,690
Do Kyung!

843
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,440
What happened?

844
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,760
I did that, Gi Bum.

845
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,930
What?

846
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:00,620
He came for me and then held her hostage.

847
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,400
Bastard!

848
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:12,220
Honey!

849
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,910
What happened?

850
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:17,230
Eun Ok!

851
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,860
Honey!

852
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,870
No!

853
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:27,690
He's not breathing.

854
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,920
Could it be...

855
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:33,040
What have you done?

856
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:37,320
Let me see.

857
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:41,110
What are you looking at? CPR!

858
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,170
Tae Soo, do the CPR!

859
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:46,190
Me?

860
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,240
- Now!
- Now!

861
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,780
Hurry up!

862
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,190
Geez, I'll do it!

863
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:08,610
Do Kyung, I will do it.

864
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:10,230
- Now!
- Now!
