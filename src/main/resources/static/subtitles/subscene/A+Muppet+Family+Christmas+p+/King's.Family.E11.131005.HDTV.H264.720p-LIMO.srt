00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,810
What are you still doing up?

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,200
Please go to bed.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,880
I don't want to see your face.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,000
Do you want to be my lover?

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,550
Use it as you want.

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,850
The limit is a hundred thousand dollars.

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,300
This is nuts.

9
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,910
Congratulations!

10
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,970
You finally bought an apartment in Seoul.

11
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,500
I envy you.

12
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,050
Applause!

13
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,140
Thanks.

14
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,940
What's this?

15
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,380
It's your housewarming gift.

16
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,500
We don't do stuff like soap or toilet paper

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,970
Open it.

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,350
Whoa!

19
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,350
I can't wear this!

20
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,710
Of course you can!

21
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,000
Just put it on.

22
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,470
Your night will change.

23
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,350
First night in the new apartment, tada!

24
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,210
I heard it brings great fortune.

25
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,810
It brings great fortune?

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,880
Then I should put this on.

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,210
Wear this on your first night.

28
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,710
And tell us how it felt.

29
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,600
Are you coming home tonight?

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,380
I'm tired, so I'm going to bed.

31
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,650
The door code is our wedding date.

32
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,050
It's our wedding date.

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,580
What is it?

34
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,870
When is our wedding anniversary?

35
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,670
We got married?

36
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,940
Why you...

37
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,970
When was my wedding date?

38
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,150
How should I know that?

39
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,580
Ask Madam Park Salla.

40
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,680
Text it to me.
Don't be a smart ass.

41
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,580
Oh, this is crazy.

42
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,280
How can he ask me when he married?

43
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,210
Why did you have him, mom?

44
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,850
Respect your older brother!

45
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,210
Why wasn't I born first?

46
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,280
He doesn't act like he's older.

47
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,650
You can't blame Hobak for everything

48
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,670
We should actually be grateful.

49
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,280
What's wrong with Sedal?

50
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,510
There's no better than him out there.

51
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,540
Don't ever say that to anybody.

52
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,970
When did Sedal get married?

53
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,950
Why are you so startled?

54
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,370
You weren't sleeping?

55
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,300
Oh, I couldn't fall asleep.

56
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,100
You just got home?

57
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,350
Don't ask questions like that.

58
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,470
Looks like the move went smoothly.

59
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,970
What are you wearing?

60
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,470
What do you mean?

61
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,740
You can't dress up for going to bed.

62
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,970
We're at a new apartment,
so can't you be a new woman?

63
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,910
I'll put on a show for you later.

64
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,410
What kind of show?

65
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,150
I hope it's nothing see-through.

66
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,350
That's a new suit.

67
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,670
Did you buy that?

68
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,410
Wow, you look good.

69
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,240
I told you not to ask me stuff like that.

70
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,200
Take that down.

71
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,710
You told me to hang it.

72
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,470
And you took me seriously?

73
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,670
It's embarrassing.

74
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,600
This apartment is nothing to be proud about.

75
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,780
To the rich people, this is nothing.

76
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,240
But you said you were going to hang it up
and salute to it morning and night.

77
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,940
I can't make a joke?

78
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,010
You have no sense of humor.

79
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,850
Stop getting in my way and go to bed.

80
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,470
I came home thinking you were asleep.

81
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,740
Why did you hang this here? Huh?

82
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,270
This is pathetic.

83
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,580
You seem to like hanging things.

84
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,940
This pot is meaningful.

85
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,040
That meaning is meaningless.

86
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,910
Don't touch this.

87
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,740
I'm going to use it as a reminder.

88
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,040
There are painful but sweet memories in that.

89
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,410
Take that down.

90
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,470
How can you call those memories sweet?

91
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,210
They were totally pathetic.

92
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,100
We can't forget the hard days.

93
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,170
That's what's wrong with you.

94
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:49,170
It's better to forget bad memories as soon as possible.

95
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,500
Why are you picking a fight?

96
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,800
Did something happen at work?

97
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,350
You should have a look around.

98
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,100
I already have.

99
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,300
When?

100
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,100
I came with Loser and got a tour.

101
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,800
I didn't think you cared, but you did!

102
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,670
My darling honey.

103
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,000
Stop it.

104
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,170
Don't be coy.

105
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,650
Go wash up. Let's have a toast.

106
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,450
To celebrate our first night in our new house.

107
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,870
First night?

108
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,900
You're not planning anything, are you?

109
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,910
Like what?

110
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,780
Whatever it is, forget about it.

111
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,210
I'm exhausted. Just look.

112
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,140
Let's celebrate our first night here.

113
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,650
Stop saying first night.

114
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,350
Why are you so horny tonight?

115
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,370
A woman should be demure.

116
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,500
What the...

117
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,250
This is our first night in a new place.

118
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,940
Let's go to sleep.

119
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,350
Turn out the lights so we can save on electricity.

120
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,080
We still have to pay back the loan.

121
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,700
I think we'll do great.

122
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,800
Is the director good to you?

123
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,240
Yes.

124
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,770
Totally, amazingly, crazy and scary good.

125
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,850
Oh, that's great.

126
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,210
Don't lose this job, no matter what.

127
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,870
Be smart and do well.

128
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,450
Getting this job was hard.

129
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,680
This is nutty, nutty nuts.

130
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,900
Here.

131
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,600
Let's become rich.

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,650
Money's important, even between family members.

133
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,410
You just learned that now?

134
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,370
My boys aren't going to be poor like me.

135
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,370
When Sintong and Bangtong get married,

136
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,600
I'm going to buy each a house,

137
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,680
and I'm going to prepare for retirement,

138
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,850
so I won't have to rely on them.

139
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,710
Let's talk about retirement later.

140
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,470
We have a long life ahead of us.

141
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,740
What's that?

142
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,270
Oh.

143
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,400
A gift from my co-workers.

144
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,370
Tada!

145
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,300
That's for you?

146
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,900
Yes.

147
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,470
Have they gone crazy?

148
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,970
They said wearing this on the first night will bring great fortune.

149
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,470
Who said that?

150
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,240
That's nonsense.

151
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,850
How can people just blurt things out?

152
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,850
Why are you screaming?

153
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,600
I actually thought it was pretty nice.

154
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,680
Sedal, let me put this on, and...

155
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,770
Sintong! Bangtong!

156
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,370
You'll wake them up!

157
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,500
Be quiet. Quiet!

158
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,950
Don't do this! Stop it!

159
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,000
- What do you mean by that?
- Sintong!

160
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,900
Hey!

161
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,540
Ouch!

162
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,000
Who's that?

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,580
Director.

164
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,210
Answer it! Hurry!

165
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,900
What took you so long?

166
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,770
I thought I was quick.

167
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,710
Answer it before it rings three times.

168
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,580
I will.

169
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,470
Why did you call me so late?

170
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,970
Because I wanted to. Why?

171
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,600
I thought I'd say good night.

172
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,870
Okay. Good night to you...

173
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,270
Then,

174
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,200
I'll do what I've been wanting to do.

175
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,580
Father, thank you.

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,040
Do you feel better now?

177
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,410
Yes.

178
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,470
But I'm embarrassed.

179
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,240
Please keep this between us.

180
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,850
I'll have to see about that.

181
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:29,240
I really wanted to cry my heart out.

182
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,600
I wanted to,

183
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,550
and my heart was filled with cries,

184
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,510
but I couldn't do it.

185
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,350
I couldn't cry in front of my wife,

186
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,240
and I couldn't do it by the river.

187
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,600
But now that I've done it in front of you,

188
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,240
like a little boy,

189
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,600
I actually feel better.

190
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,740
Thank you, father.

191
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,270
[Yeoju]

192
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,370
Coming through!

193
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,410
Mr. Ko.

194
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,850
Oh!

195
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,350
What brings you here?

196
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,640
Did you come alone?

197
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,500
How did you find this place?

198
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,450
I came to your wife's funeral,

199
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,680
and I came here before Minjung's wedding.

200
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,100
When I got here, I could remember the house.

201
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,870
I didn't want to be bothered, so I came alone.

202
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,040
I wanted to have a drink with you.

203
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,950
I don't have much to offer,

204
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,050
but I can make chicken soup with one of these.

205
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,370
Oh, but you don't have to.

206
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,350
Stand here. I'll drive them to you.

207
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,470
Here they come!

208
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,600
Would you look at that!

209
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,680
Oh!

210
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,310
Oh!

211
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,450
You'll get hurt before you can catch one.

212
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,740
This is really delicious.

213
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,800
They're different from factory chickens.

214
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,470
They are muscular,
so the texture is really nice.

215
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,310
Right.

216
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,750
This is really a treat.

217
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,740
Yes.

218
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,770
Mr. Ko,

219
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,080
you must be really worried about Minjung.

220
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,450
In life,

221
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,400
there are ups and downs.

222
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,870
Minjung won't let it ruin him.

223
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,640
Of course not.

224
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,970
I know he won't.

225
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,350
But watching your children go through such hardship breaks your heart.

226
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,400
I should've dropped by to talk to you sooner.

227
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,540
I'm sorry.

228
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,970
No.

229
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,850
I'm the one who should apologize.

230
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,400
Subak's suffering because of my son.

231
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,070
Subak is still immature,

232
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,640
and that's a big problem for Minjung.

233
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,270
You shouldn't say that.

234
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,440
It's my son's fault.

235
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,550
Actually, Mr. Ko,

236
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,470
I don't know how to bring this up,

237
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:04,000
but can they come and live with me?

238
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:11,370
I hate to see them living at such a place,

239
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,080
and I thought I could take them in

240
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,770
and teach my daughter better.

241
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,100
I'd like to take care of Minjung.

242
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,600
If they lived at a nicer place,

243
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,950
things might become easier to deal with.

244
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:40,550
I know what people say about a man living at his in laws house,

245
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,550
and they're not wrong.

246
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,140
I've seen marriages break up because of that.

247
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,370
But the same goes for a woman.

248
00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:00,740
The best solution is to live far away from your in laws.

249
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,780
I understand that,

250
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,080
but I'd like to help out

251
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,550
while I can afford to help out.

252
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,870
Loser, have you ever spent $100,000?

253
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,100
Are you mad?

254
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,440
Let's say you have it.

255
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,640
You should see a doctor.

256
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,280
Just pretend you do and tell me.

257
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,870
I haven't even seen that kind of money.

258
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,440
Could you spend that in a day?

259
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,540
No way.

260
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,200
You need to have experience to do that.

261
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,140
How would you spend it
if someone gave it to you?

262
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,640
Who would give me $100,000?

263
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,600
Pretend someone did.

264
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,470
$100,000?

265
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,200
I could spend it if I put my mind to it.

266
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,470
It'd be easier than making it. Right?

267
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,350
Yes.

268
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,600
We spend $3 a day.

269
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,870
$100,000 would be?

270
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,780
Hold on.

271
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,140
I can't really calculate it...

272
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,280
$3 a day, 30 days a month.

273
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,400
3 times 3 is 9, 9$.

274
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,700
$90 a month.

275
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,470
That's about $1,000 a year.

276
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,480
That would last 100 years!

277
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,280
100 years?

278
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,780
If we split it, it would last 50 years.

279
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,350
Loser, that's why you're a loser.

280
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,900
Can't you spend it all at once?
Like a man?

281
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,350
What do you think?

282
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,900
It's perfect. Pretty.

283
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,050
You have an eye for style.
You weren't short?

284
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,350
No, and I pocketed the change.

285
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,250
I have to

286
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,680
because I'm unemployed.

287
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,350
It was actually perfect.

288
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,510
Will father like it?

289
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,280
He'll love it.

290
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,240
How about you? Are you okay?

291
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,580
I don't want to talk about mom.

292
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,600
I'm going to forget about it for now.

293
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,040
I want peace.

294
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,550
I'm just going to stop trying.

295
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,280
I feel peaceful right now.

296
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,600
How about you?

297
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,100
How's your writing coming along?

298
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,670
That question scares me these days.

299
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,940
It's not going well?

300
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,200
I quit my job to write,

301
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,270
and I'm going crazy.

302
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Do you regret quitting your job?

303
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,870
To be honest, sometimes I do.

304
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,580
I can't ignore how people think and mom, too.

305
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,870
But I know life is long.

306
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,850
Oh, my darling little sister.

307
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,310
You're right. People would laugh at you

308
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,100
if you become a writer at 29.

309
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,780
You need experience to write well.

310
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,850
You should start dating, too.

311
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,810
I put out some feelers.

312
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,250
Really? Who is it?

313
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,080
Tell me later. It's my mother in law.

314
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,580
- Mother is that you?
- Yes.

315
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Welcome, mother.
You too, Yeongdal.

316
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,640
I almost didn't come.

317
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,080
Please don't be mad.

318
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,780
Hello.

319
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,980
- Gwangbak, it's been a while.
- Yes.

320
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,440
Keep in touch.
You must have lots of free time.

321
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,740
I'm actually quite busy.

322
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,170
You used to be close friends.

323
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,740
Did you have a fight?
Why don't you visit?

324
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,640
No, but things got odd when we became in laws.

325
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,280
It wasn't when you became a teacher?

326
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,170
Don't think you're better than my daughter.

327
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,080
You never know what could happen to you.

328
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,250
I know.

329
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,510
I should go, Hobak.

330
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,510
Have fun. Bye.

331
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,550
You should stay.

332
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,310
Yes, have dinner with us.

333
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,640
Mother, have a look around.
I'll make dinner.

334
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,300
I can't believe they moved here by themselves.

335
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,370
I'm going to destroy them!

336
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,600
Mom, you have me.

337
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,100
Right.

338
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,970
I don't envy this apartment at all.

339
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,100
If my company carried this out,

340
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,470
safety will be ensured,

341
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:26,780
while reducing cost and construction period.

342
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,170
I will drive for you, too.

343
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,400
If you're done, you can go play.

344
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,580
Okay.

345
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,050
Aren't you seeing someone?

346
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,010
Not yet.

347
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,370
Being a teacher was your only merit,

348
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,740
so no wonder you're not seeing anyone.

349
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,480
Yeongdal's been very busy.

350
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,250
Men who are only interested in

351
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,050
pretty women are a problem,

352
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,550
but what can we do? Looks matter.

353
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,350
But Yeongdal had a lot of work done.

354
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,310
Everyone does that these days!

355
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,010
That's called making an effort!

356
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,600
People complain because they're jealous.

357
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,670
Why did you get fired?

358
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,850
She wasn't fired.

359
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,440
She quit to become a writer.

360
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,270
Aren't writers poor?

361
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,600
Star writers make really good money.

362
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,850
The Harry Potter writer is really, really...

363
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,370
That's only for the star writers.

364
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,200
You were bad at writing at school.

365
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,640
I wasn't bad.

366
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,550
I got good comments on my journals.

367
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,450
Just journals?

368
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,370
Everyone writes journals at school.

369
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,370
You can't become a writer from that.

370
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,350
You should've gotten married before quitting.

371
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,980
Your parents must be worried.

372
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,950
Especially your mother.

373
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,600
She always succeeds when she puts her mind to it.

374
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,510
So she'll make it someday.

375
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,900
I believe in her. She'll be a great writer.

376
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,770
It's been her dream since she was little.

377
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,350
You only had one dream?

378
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,640
Excuse me?

379
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,470
Yeongdal had so many dreams.

380
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,870
It changed whenever she woke up.

381
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,780
They were all different.

382
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,310
She took piano lessons for a month,

383
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,580
ballet lessons for couple months.

384
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,140
I even have a tutu.

385
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,080
She took acting lessons for a while.

386
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,140
That was very expensive.

387
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,050
She had many talents and many interests,

388
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,280
so she took cooking lessons, dance lessons,

389
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,510
and even gayageum lessons.

390
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,910
I bought a gayageum.

391
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,480
And was it sex crime victims counselor?

392
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,670
She wanted to become that and took classes.

393
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,580
She wanted to be a dog groomer,

394
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,200
so we bought some puppies.

395
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,300
Three puppies.

396
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,550
It was expensive, but she learned a lot.

397
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,600
She can fend for herself wherever she goes.

398
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,080
But you should focus on one thing.

399
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,170
But you've done two, teaching and writing.

400
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,970
I couldn't really stick to anything else,

401
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,170
but there's one I can never get sick of.

402
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,740
What is it?

403
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,450
Men.

404
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,580
My final dream is getting married.

405
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,750
I'm going to realize it.

406
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,670
Oh, Yeongdal's getting married.

407
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,550
When?

408
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,440
Oh, with that man she met before?

409
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,350
Yes.

410
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,670
He's totally into Yeongdal.

411
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,370
He asked her to marry him.

412
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,080
Oh, really?

413
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,980
But they just met.

414
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,350
People do things really fast these days.

415
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,200
He asked you to marry him?

416
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,000
He didn't say it, but it looks like we will.

417
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,140
He'll probably propose when he comes back from his business trip to China.

418
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,500
How do you know if he's going to propose?

419
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,200
Why would you say that?
It's bad luck!

420
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,670
I thought she's getting ahead of herself.

421
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,540
They just met.

422
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,350
I don't think you can be a good writer.

423
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,510
Relationships aren't bound by time!

424
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,440
Haven't you heard of love at first sight?

425
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,440
Even Subak got married in only 3 months.

426
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,700
She's getting married this year, okay?

427
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,870
She's your only sister in law.
Don't forget.

428
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,140
He sent me a text message from China.

429
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,600
I sent him one before.

430
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,550
What does it say?
Check it.

431
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,600
It's raining here.

432
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,900
I miss you more now that I'm here.

433
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,470
You miss me, don't you?

434
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,350
Your gift is safe and sound, so don't worry.

435
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,980
Watch over Seoul for me while I'm gone.

436
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,940
Oh, he's completely into her. He is!

437
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,970
He'll set the date anytime soon!

438
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,700
You know that.

439
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,870
He's bringing her a gift?

440
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,740
He asked if she wants an expensive handbag,

441
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,170
but she said she wants him back safe.

442
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,600
He loved it when she told him that.

443
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,140
Only rookies ask for gifts, she says.

444
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,250
Did you get dumped again?

445
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,600
I didn't!
I was at Hobak's place.

446
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,810
You always kick the door when you get dumped.

447
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,780
It's like a hobby for you.

448
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,170
Hey, hey, Gwangbak.

449
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,670
What?

450
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,700
Is Yeongdal seeing someone?

451
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,700
How did you know that?

452
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,640
I saw her coming out of the theater in the arms of some man.

453
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,780
Theater? In his arms?

454
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,370
Yes. While I was making deliveries.

455
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,970
But she didn't see me.

456
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,440
Don't you ever talk to her?
You're friends.

457
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,640
We're not friends.
We were classmates.

458
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,900
Did the guy seem like he liked her?

459
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,140
I don't know.

460
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,940
Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't.

461
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,500
I only saw them once.

462
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,440
But he looked pretty handsome.

463
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,370
She used to date ugly men because she was after their money.

464
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,940
Why can't you date someone?

465
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,140
What do you mean?

466
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,250
I should've known when you were getting dating advice from a 4th grader.

467
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,780
You should really think about it.

468
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,580
You were a better student than her.

469
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,200
Why can't you leave me alone?

470
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,970
Ugh!

471
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,370
I'll keep Seoul safe.

472
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,580
I miss you, too.

473
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,310
Come back safely.

474
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,750
Hot chocolate.

475
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,710
Cappuccino.

476
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,480
Good morning.

477
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,210
Sunblock.

478
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,050
He asked if she wants an expensive handbag,

479
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,280
but she said she wants him back safe.

480
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,670
He loved it when she told him that.

481
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,810
Only rookies ask for gifts, she says.

482
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,440
Mmm...

483
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,770
Sunblock.

484
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,750
Isn't it cheaper at the duty free shop?

485
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,780
I can't believe I did that!

486
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,780
I think he's going to propose soon.

487
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,700
Yeongdal, I miss you more now.

488
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,500
I'll be back soon.

489
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,740
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo...

490
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:26,250
Can Minjung come live with me?

491
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,350
Are you going into your in laws house?

492
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,850
What are you talking about?

493
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,810
Your father in law came to see father.

494
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,640
He did?

495
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,170
Father called me today,

496
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,970
asking how bad things are with you.

497
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,580
I don't know how bad things are,

498
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,230
but don't forget you're the eldest son.

499
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,470
You acted like their son, and now they

500
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,280
want to have you move in

501
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,080
and make you do whatever they want.

502
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,200
It's not like that.

503
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,570
He's not that kind of person.

504
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,800
It'd be one thing if you had money.

505
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,550
But this is different.

506
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,870
If you want respect, don't move in with them.

507
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,600
And one more thing.

508
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,780
You're not going to take care of father?

509
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,170
I should.

510
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,670
How can the eldest son who must take care
of his father move in with his in laws?

511
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,670
And when do you think you can move out?

512
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,700
And where will you do the ancestral rites?

513
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,040
Where will father sleep when he visits?

514
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:45,250
He couldn't see you even if he wanted to.

515
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,100
My father in law said it because he's

516
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,780
worried about me, but I'm not interested.

517
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,050
You didn't have to say anything.

518
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,750
I'm going to forget what you look like.

519
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,510
Must I come and visit you, bastard?

520
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,980
Don't call me bastard, bastard.

521
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,200
I'm Mr. Vice Principal.
They love me here.

522
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,740
Yeah, right.

523
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,600
I know they call you names and talk behind your back.

524
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,470
We did that, remember?

525
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,870
How come you don't get any wrinkles?

526
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,400
I feel happy, that's why.

527
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,670
I don't have to worry.

528
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,170
And I love what I do.

529
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,970
I envy you.

530
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,140
You should've picked up a trade yourself.

531
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,580
I know.

532
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,770
Why didn't you come to the reunion?

533
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,400
I've been busy.

534
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,500
Everyone else is struggling, but we have to work.

535
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,050
The company president is good.

536
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,740
Our friends have gotten really old.

537
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,480
They say people live to be a hundred these days,

538
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,580
but what's the use of living that long?

539
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,900
It's okay to be 100 when you're strong,

540
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,770
but if you're barely breathing, that's hell.

541
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,640
Is there something you want to tell me?

542
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,640
Yes.

543
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,850
Is your third daughter still single?

544
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,700
Yes.

545
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,440
Is she seeing someone?

546
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,470
I don't think so.

547
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,350
Good. Let me introduce someone.

548
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:20,170
Let's call it a blind date.

549
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,240
You have someone in mind?

550
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,280
Yes.

551
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,400
They can figure things out when they meet,

552
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,310
so I'll give him her number.

553
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:30,640
If they hit it off, that'd be nice.

554
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,780
I can trust anyone you bring.

555
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,850
And I trust your daughter.

556
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,750
He's on a business trip,
so I'll tell him when he comes back.

557
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,850
Sounds good.

558
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,850
If things work out?

559
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,440
I'll owe you!

560
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,210
Three big slaps on the face!

561
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,670
Bye.

562
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,540
Hey, hey!

563
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,580
You should say hello.

564
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,540
Why do you always bother me?

565
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:24,100
Sir, if you do this again, I'm calling the police.

566
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,210
What? Go ahead.
But I should be the one.

567
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,940
I can't believe how rude you are!

568
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,400
What would you tell the police?

569
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,000
You're the one who owes me money!

570
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,550
You must have nothing better to do to walk around making barking noises.

571
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,500
Stay out of my business.

572
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,400
Why would you be concerned about my barking noises?

573
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,080
What?

574
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,710
How rude!
You stay right here!

575
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,080
Yes.

576
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:58,350
Father, I think we can make it in China.

577
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,480
Our presentation was the best one so far.

578
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,610
Good. You can communicate with them?

579
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,350
You need to ask me that?

580
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,710
I told you about the Chinese market.

581
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,980
I'm glad I learned Chinese.

582
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,270
Good for you, son.

583
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,740
You're the best man ever.

584
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,780
Hey! How rude!
You! Stop right there!

585
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,940
Wow, I can't believe how rude she is.

586
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,670
What's going on?

587
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,350
Remember that rude girl?

588
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,670
I think she's crazy.
She's not normal.

589
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,270
Mr. Choi, the meeting is starting.

590
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,350
Father I have to go.
The meeting is starting.

591
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,580
Sunjeong!

592
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,650
I'm getting a delivery.
Can you sign for me?

593
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,810
Okay.

594
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,900
Delivery?

595
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,350
Daese.

596
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,210
Yes?

597
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,710
I have to go out today.

598
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,710
Oh? I'll tell them to leave it with the neighbor.

599
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,900
There won't be anyone home.

600
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,980
So can you have him come tomor...

601
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,440
Daese!

602
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,980
I'll be home.
I think I should be home.

603
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,380
I want to see him!
I think I should.

604
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,900
What are you talking about?

605
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,480
Nothing. I'll be home.

606
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,850
Hello?

607
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,110
It's okay. Someone will be home.

608
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,810
Please deliver it today. Yes.

609
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:41,380
Yes, I'm coming right now.
You're home?

610
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,950
Okay.

611
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,870
Father.

612
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,040
Minjung.

613
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,400
I'm at the Seoul Bus Terminal.

614
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,370
What's up? Why didn't you call?

615
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,670
I'm working, so I can't really...

616
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,250
It's okay!

617
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,400
I have the address, and I can find it.

618
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,140
I'm not taking a cab.

619
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,150
Don't worry about me.

620
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:20,740
Excuse me, you can't bring that on the bus.

621
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,380
I'll hold on to this.

622
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,310
It's new, so it's clean.

623
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,940
Please let me bring it onto the bus.

624
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,000
Don't let it get in the way, please.

625
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,100
I don't want any accidents.

626
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,650
I won't. Thank you.

627
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,750
I'm sorry.

628
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,000
Oh? Uh...

629
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,940
Parcel service.

630
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,510
Please sign here.

631
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,080
Okay.

632
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,440
Thank you. Goodbye.

633
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,040
Excuse me.

634
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,000
Are you in charge of this area?

635
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,700
Uh, no, I'm not.

636
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:54,170
It's someone else, but he couldn't make it.

637
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:58,040
Did something bad happen to him?

638
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,310
Well, I don't really know.

639
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,900
Thank you.

640
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,650
Where are you?

641
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,810
Why do you want to know?

642
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,440
I told you to be home.

643
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,940
My father's coming and you're not home!

644
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,310
I'm sick and I don't want to be bothered.

645
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:48,270
Did you expect me to throw a party?

646
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,540
Why is he coming?
He has no clue.

647
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,740
Forget about it.

648
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,750
Father.

649
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,480
Why are you waiting for me out here?

650
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,770
Did you come because of this?

651
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,740
I wanted to give it to you.

652
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,980
It took longer because I got on the wrong bus.

653
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,580
I should've crossed the street.

654
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,670
I went all the way to the last stop.

655
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,640
I told you to take a cab.

656
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,480
Why should I?

657
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,850
I actually had a tour of Seoul.

658
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,940
It must have been so tough.

659
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,670
And people were probably giving you a hard time, too.

660
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,870
It's okay.

661
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,400
It's for my son, so who cares?

662
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,040
Would you like to try it?

663
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,770
I hope it fits well.

664
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,640
The length and the width must be perfect.

665
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:14,270
I had to guess when I made this.

666
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,310
How is it? Does it fit?

667
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,210
Yes, it fits.

668
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:26,580
It has to fit like a glove.

669
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,880
It fits better than a glove.

670
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,310
It's light.

671
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,540
That's because it's empty.

672
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,200
Anyway, I'm glad it fits.

673
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:39,020
This your first A-frame, isn't it?

674
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,980
Yes.

675
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,170
Living in the countryside,

676
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:50,480
I never let you use one of these.

677
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:57,810
I had your siblings help out at home,

678
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:01,310
but I never let you help.

679
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,670
I didn't want to see you wearing this.

680
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,270
Father.

681
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,140
But what can I do?

682
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,380
A man must do anything

683
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,350
to support his family.

684
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,470
You could hurt your back using this,

685
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,810
so when you get up, don't get up at once.

686
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,350
Put your weight on the stick like this,

687
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:32,650
and get up slowly. Like this.

688
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,580
Got it? Try it.

689
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,810
Like this?

690
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:45,400
Yes.

691
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,600
Watch your back.

692
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,500
Don't put too much on it at once.

693
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,610
Come in, father.

694
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,150
Let's go get a drink.

695
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,000
Father.

696
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,170
Slow down.

697
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,650
I'm sorry, father.

698
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,810
I didn't want you to see me like this.

699
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,940
This rain will stop, won't it?

700
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,400
Yes, it probably will.

701
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,500
No, it will stop. I'm sure.

702
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,250
Minjung.

703
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,670
Yes, father?

704
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,170
Move in with your in laws?

705
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,400
Subak's having a hard time, and so are you.

706
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,250
This won't do.

707
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,350
I won't be doing that.

708
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,880
I'm not sure what my father in law said,

709
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,310
but I'm not going to live there.

710
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:35,940
Do as I say.

711
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:40,710
I know how you feel.

712
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:44,210
But you need a break.

713
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:49,440
Let them help you out just for 3 years.

714
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,850
But not longer than that.

715
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:58,400
And pay them back for their kindness.

716
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,810
Just

717
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:06,380
don't forget you're my son.

718
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,440
Father, thank you. Thank you.

719
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,080
This is the best thing you've ever done.

720
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,440
Applaud, applaud everyone.

721
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,080
It'll get really crowded again.

722
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,080
But there's no room!

723
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,580
There's Gwangbak's room.

724
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,940
It's a big room,

725
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,980
so it's perfect for Subak and her husband.

726
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,610
I can sleep with the girls.

727
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,250
Gwangbak can use the storage room.

728
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,380
Haebak, is it okay?
You're a senior now.

729
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,400
I'll be fine.

730
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,040
I can sleep in the yard, if I have to.

731
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,700
Welcome, Minjung.
And Subak. I'm so happy.

732
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:23,170
If you're smart, you'll do well,

733
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,270
even if you don't have new pencils.

734
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,440
It's the stupid ones who blame their tools.

735
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,530
Did someone complain about pencils?

736
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:37,210
There's someone here who cried about pencils and refused to go to school.

737
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:44,540
You have such a great memory!

738
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,600
You only remember stuff like that.

739
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,650
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

740
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,850
When are you moving in?

741
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,400
We'll move in on Sunday.

742
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,940
We don't have much to move. Why wait?

743
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,980
Right. You should move now.

744
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,580
Let's do it now.

745
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:07,650
We have Subak's old stuff in the storage room, so you can use those.

746
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,850
The Korean War was nothing compared to this!

747
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,000
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

748
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,170
Oh.

749
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:41,980
We're moving out.

750
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,210
And going where?

751
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,770
To a 5 bedroom apartment.

752
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,900
Don't be mean to your tenants.

753
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,540
I really was in the Miss Korea pageant.

754
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,780
Oh, hello!

755
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,880
Yes?

756
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,210
You came to my MMA gym with Mr. Wang.

757
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,770
Oh, yes!

758
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,770
Hello.

759
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:14,040
- Are you going home now?
- Yes.

760
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,000
Come and exercise someday.

761
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,040
I don't have the time.

762
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,810
You can always make time.

763
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,580
It's great for stress and losing weight.

764
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,900
Many people do it these days.

765
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,870
It's good for your body.

766
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:29,210
You look great already, but it's for your health.

767
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,610
I'll give you lessons for free.

768
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:35,200
Really?

769
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,310
Oh, thank you.

770
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:38,900
If it's free, I'm coming.

771
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,100
You promised!

772
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,850
Uh...

773
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,040
Hey, eat, eat.

774
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,400
Eat all you want.

775
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,870
Take this chance and eat up.

776
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,380
Wow, it melts in your mouth.

777
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,110
I don't even have to chew it.

778
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:11,270
There's no time for chewing.

779
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,310
It just slips down your throat.

780
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:16,250
My stomach is pulling it in.

781
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:22,110
Oh, I wish there were two of me so I can eat for two.

782
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:26,450
I'm already eating for two right now.

783
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,150
That's kind of funny.

784
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,940
Goof-off, what's going on?

785
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,270
Why are you buying us dinner?

786
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,670
You always bought drinks for me before,

787
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,940
so this time, I'm buying.

788
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:42,370
And I won't buy you some cheap pork.

789
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,480
I'm shooting sirloin into your mouths.

790
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,270
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta!

791
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,740
You're all dead, guys.

792
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,350
Come to think of it, you never had money.

793
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:54,670
Loser,

794
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:56,580
we were going to cut you off.

795
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,480
I figured that and that's why I'm buying.

796
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,880
Anyway, where did you get the money?

797
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,040
Did you win the lottery?

798
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:07,370
Don't ask any questions and just eat.

799
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,410
Hello?
Can I have more sirloin here?

800
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,480
Where are you?
Didn't you get my text?

801
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm busy.

802
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,400
Why are you busy?

803
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,870
Isn't it your day off?

804
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,350
I'm moving stuff.

805
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:23,980
Moving stuff?

806
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,400
Are you moving out finally?

807
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,870
No.

808
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,040
Subak's family is moving in.

809
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,740
They moved today.

810
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:34,280
Really?

811
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,850
Oh...

812
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:43,850
Good work, everyone.

813
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:46,210
There wasn't much to move.

814
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:47,750
Thank you for helping us, everyone.

815
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,350
It was nothing.
It was fun, actually.

816
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,900
Where's Subak?

817
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,770
She wants to eat later.

818
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,240
Okay.

819
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,440
Minjung, welcome.

820
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,370
We're family now.

821
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:04,500
Think of this as your own home.

822
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:05,970
Okay.

823
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,980
Isn't there anything else?

824
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,440
Just eat.

825
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,140
I couldn't cook because of the moving.

826
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,650
But this is Minjung's first dinner here.

827
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:19,850
Look at the side dishes.

828
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:21,170
I'm okay.

829
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,980
They say you are what you eat.

830
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,400
How can you work with eating this?

831
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,600
Bring out some fish.

832
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,000
Or order something.

833
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,470
We have Minjung here.

834
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,170
Is Minjung a guest?

835
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:35,310
He is. He's your son in law.

836
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,940
I'm fine.

837
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,850
I love your kimchi stew.

838
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,400
Don't expect a feast at every meal.

839
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,250
You may be my son in law,

840
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,940
but I'll feed you whatever's available.

841
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:50,850
You can't live here if you're picky.

842
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,940
A teacher's salary isn't big.

843
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:56,080
So unless you can pitch in...

844
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,980
Father, should I make some eggs?

845
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,280
Yes.

846
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:04,140
Do we have beer?

847
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,670
Try to make better side dishes.

848
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:12,600
He works and needs to eat well.

849
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,040
Of course, of course.

850
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:19,080
You must eat well to work hard.

851
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,670
Everyone's my boss, everyone is.

852
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,640
Ma, ma, mother!

853
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:38,540
Is that Sedal?

854
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,270
Is he drunk again?

855
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,540
Father, mother!

856
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,810
Sedal is here.

857
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:49,440
Did you come to pick a fight again?

858
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:51,100
Pick a fight?

859
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:52,670
I wouldn't dare.

860
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,270
Oh, put them down here.

861
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:58,880
What's all this?

862
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,140
This is sirloin, these are beef bones.

863
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,250
These are ribs and these are fruits.

864
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,380
And et cetera, et cetera.

865
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,880
Where did you get these?
Did you steal them?

866
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,900
I didn't steal them.

867
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:19,400
Your second son in law, Heo Sedal,
bought them with his credit card.

868
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,710
Oh, Minjung, congratulations.

869
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:25,580
I heard you moved in today.

870
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,000
Yes.

871
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,100
Did you come alone?

872
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,150
Yes.

873
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,270
I don't like going places with my wife.

874
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,670
Big animals are loners.

875
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,750
But you and I were a pair.

876
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,940
We were since 7th grade.

877
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,540
That's why they call us a married couple.

878
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,700
Why did Hobak send you here alone?

879
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,270
What's going on?

880
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,580
Where did you get the money for all this?

881
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,750
Don't worry about that, father.

882
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,610
Mother, do you like them?

883
00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:01,680
I've never received anything like this from you.

884
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,770
I don't do those dollar panties.

885
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:09,500
Are you happy, mother?

886
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,370
I am.

887
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:14,250
Nobody hates getting gifts.

888
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,810
And this won't be the last time.

889
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:19,670
I'll be a good son in law for you.

890
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,210
What's wrong with the side dishes?

891
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:25,540
Mother, you should eat better.

892
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,740
Gwangbak, let's cook up the meat I brought!

893
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:31,000
Loser, hurry up and get it!

894
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,740
Should I?

895
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,500
Sure, why not?

896
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,700
Now that we have the beef,

897
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:39,350
why don't we have some?

898
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:41,500
Hurry up and grill it!

899
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,940
I haven't had meat in a long time!

900
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,940
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

901
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,140
Grill away.

902
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,650
Hurry up.
What are you waiting for?

903
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:57,380
This is delicious.

904
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,500
Cut it into little pieces for me.

905
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,110
Here.

906
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:04,650
This is for you, mother.

907
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:06,080
Oh.

908
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,610
And this red ginseng is for you, father.

909
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:12,000
Thank you,

910
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,350
but I feel...

911
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:15,770
He's nervous.

912
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:17,850
Tell us where you got the money.

913
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,380
I didn't steal it, so don't worry, father.

914
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,400
Every dog has its day.

915
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:29,170
I never got anything like this from Sedal.

916
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,310
Mother, don't worry.

917
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:36,650
You can rely on me instead of Minjung.

918
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:40,080
After all, I was your first son in law.

919
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,110
Right, you were the first one.

920
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,610
Ten years and six years are different.

921
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:47,810
That's almost twice as long.

922
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,900
Goof-off, don't be like this.

923
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,210
You didn't get me anything.

924
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,500
Grandmother, what would you like?

925
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:58,940
Would you like meat or a dress?

926
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:01,040
My teeth are too weak for meat,

927
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,100
and my back's too bent for a dress.

928
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,580
Mom, you have more teeth than I do.

929
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,610
You have dentures.

930
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,670
That doesn't count!
They're not really mine

931
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,140
Nothing beats having your own teeth.

932
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:16,500
Loser, stay out of this.

933
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:21,970
Grandmother, I'll get you new teeth.

934
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,310
All of them.

935
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:25,750
Gwangbak, how many teeth does a person have?

936
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,480
About twenty, I think?

937
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,850
Isn't it forty?

938
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:32,350
Depending on the wisdom teeth, 28 to 32.

939
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,350
I knew you'd know.

940
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:37,110
Let's not count them.

941
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:41,040
Grandmother, get 50.
Or get 100.

942
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,850
50 upper ones, 50 lower ones.

943
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:45,850
Leave no empty space out.

944
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:47,250
Get 2 or 3 layers of them!

945
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:50,850
Get as many implants as you can.

946
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:53,580
Okay, let's do it, then.

947
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,580
Should I get gold ones?

948
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,040
Get whatever you want.

949
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:00,470
You can get colored jewels, if you want,

950
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,170
so they sparkle when you talk.

951
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,110
So you mean it?

952
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,250
- Mom.
- Yes?

953
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,750
It's dangerous to have teeth like that.

954
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,580
There are thieves who steal gold teeth.

955
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:17,870
What if someone comes in while you're
taking a nap and remove your teeth?

956
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,750
They do?

957
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,670
Oh, then I couldn't sleep!

958
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:26,400
How do the rich people do it?

959
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,940
I know.

960
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,810
I'm so glad I'm not rich.

961
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,770
I knew it.

962
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,740
Thanks to you, my Sedal, I can laugh.

963
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,110
I had nothing to laugh about these days.

964
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:45,900
Mother, what did you just say?

965
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:48,480
Did I say something?

966
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,810
I can laugh now.

967
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:52,610
Before that.

968
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:54,940
What did I say?

969
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:57,270
You said "my Sedal."

970
00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:00,870
Mother, you said "my Sedal."

971
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:02,740
Oh, man.

972
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,400
Did you like that?

973
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,640
Of course! I really wanted to hear that.

974
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:15,540
Mother, all this time, I was observing

975
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,040
Minjung, you step aside now.

976
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,080
I got married into this family earlier.

977
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,210
I became her son in law 4 years before you.

978
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:24,780
But that won't change the status.

979
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:26,610
Gwangbak, you eat.

980
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:28,210
You eat, Minjung.

981
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,540
Wrap it with this.

982
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:36,670
I'm going to send you and mother on trips and be a real son in law.

983
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:38,350
Minjung, don't worry too much.

984
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:41,150
I'm sure I can find you a job.

985
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:43,480
You can't make money on parcel service.

986
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,740
How can you be so heartless?

987
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:47,810
Excuse me?

988
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,480
We're having beef,

989
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,810
so you should go get your wife.

990
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,440
How could you eat alone?

991
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,540
How can you be so selfish?

992
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,580
But Minjung hasn't eaten any meat yet.

993
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,400
This was his first piece.

994
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,100
Choose your words carefully.

995
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:08,770
You're too harsh.

996
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,400
But I'm right!

997
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,140
He should be thinking about his wife.

998
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:16,580
My Sedal, eat up.

999
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,140
Sedal, you're very handsome.

1000
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:26,440
A man should be dark skinned.

1001
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:29,000
Being pale isn't attractive.

1002
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,170
But we both have bulging eyes.

1003
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:35,770
But they're not the same eyes.

1004
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:36,940
So?

1005
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:40,670
Is this your way of apologizing for before?

1006
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:44,400
I'd be grateful, if you forgive me, mother.

1007
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,940
Forgive him.

1008
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:49,040
I'd say this is enough.

1009
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,440
Okay.

1010
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,000
Say ah, my Sedal.

1011
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:58,140
Ah!

1012
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,750
Oh...

1013
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:08,950
This is nutty, nutty nuts!

1014
01:02:39,210 --> 01:03:04,670
Subtitles by KBS World

1015
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:06,770
From now on, show me some respect.

1016
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:07,740
What?

1017
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,400
Don't worry.

1018
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,540
She doesn't even know you're a woman.

1019
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,080
But don't get caught.

1020
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,350
Don't you have any pride?

1021
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,540
You don't feel ashamed?

1022
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,870
You don't feel upset about Sedal?

1023
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,770
Why can't you be happy for him?

1024
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:23,470
Take these out and throw away the trash.

1025
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,880
My son Minjung, forgive your dad.

1026
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,900
The best gift. What was it?

1027
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:32,170
Propose We had dinner and I got my gift.

1028
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:34,850
Did he propose to you?
