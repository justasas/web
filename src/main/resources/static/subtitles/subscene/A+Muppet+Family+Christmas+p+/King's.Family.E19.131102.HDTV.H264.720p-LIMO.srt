1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,325
This is a bus ticket to Seoul.

2
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,325
You want me to go back to Seoul alone?

3
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:24,500
Decide if you want to go back to Seoul alone or with me.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,225
I'll be back in a while.

5
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:28,225
Think long and hard,

6
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,500
so you won't regret it later.

7
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:34,425
If you're going to accept me as I am,

8
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:36,775
stay here and wait for me.

9
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,650
If you don't have the heart to,

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,000
take the bus to Seoul alone.

11
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:49,575
And just in case,

12
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,050
let's say goodbye here.

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,650
Hurry.

14
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:05,575
You made me laugh.

15
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:07,575
Thanks.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,150
Even if this is the end, I'm okay with it

17
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:15,300
because I was happy.

18
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:53,550
You!

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,000
I can't believe my ears.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,175
What did you say?
A high school dropout?

21
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:03,975
Everyone has a college degree these days,

22
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:06,600
so why couldn't he get one?

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,725
And he operates an excavator? And he's poor?

24
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,725
Are you out of your mind?

25
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:14,025
How awful? Where did you find him?

26
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:16,975
Did you get a lobotomy without telling me?

27
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:20,350
Father, don't get upset over this.

28
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,925
What's wrong with you?

29
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:24,250
You know how I broke their hearts.

30
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,675
You were a teacher, so how could you meet a high school dropout?

31
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:30,125
He dropped out in his junior year?

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,875
I dropped out of college and people hold that against me. It's humiliating.

33
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,375
He should at least have a college degree.

34
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,300
I know.

35
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,900
Even I have a college degree.

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,850
I have an English Lit degree.

37
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,175
And I have a law degree.

38
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:45,025
And I have a commerce degree.

39
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:46,500
Gwangbak, I'm very disappointed in you.

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,625
This is nuts.

41
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,175
You should be ashamed of yourself.

42
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:55,150
I was in the Miss Korea pageant!

43
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,975
I can't believe how dumb you are.

44
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,475
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

45
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,550
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

46
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,550
We should beat some sense into you.

47
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,375
Dad, here.

48
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,075
Rude, ugly hag.

49
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:10,325
You yelled at me to study hard, and you're seeing a high school dropout?

50
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:11,800
Can I drop out of school?

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,500
We're wasting our time. Get out!

52
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,275
Out!

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,975
Go inside before I get mad.

54
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,525
No, no, no.

55
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:51,150
Why I ought to!

56
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,000
Are you okay?
Honey, wake up! Honey!

57
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,375
How can you hit him?

58
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,750
Are you a thug?

59
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:31,475
Hey, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

60
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,450
The car from before, was that yours?

61
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,725
It was a nice car.

62
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,100
Give me your number.

63
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:50,875
Your phone number.

64
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:56,900
Aeji, it's dinner time. Aeji!

65
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:01,875
What's wrong?

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,675
Can't you hear me?

67
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:08,525
Mom!

68
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,550
I broke the stroller.

69
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,150
What?

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,225
What do we do now?

71
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:20,675
Your father is going to be furious.

72
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,750
What am I going to do?

73
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,500
He might kick me and Aeji out.

74
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,275
What do we do?

75
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:34,900
Uh, father, you're home!

76
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,875
Mom! Father's home.

77
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:40,975
You're home! You must be tired.

78
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:42,500
What's going on? What's wrong?

79
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,000
Nothing's wrong.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,975
I think you deserve this kind of welcome.

81
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:48,325
Don't you think so, too?

82
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:50,950
Right. Father, let's go inside.

83
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,675
Gwangbak's spending the night out with friends.

84
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,450
She called me.

85
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,675
The house felt really empty today, and I couldn't wait for you to come home.

86
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,275
Empty?

87
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:05,650
Mother and Don are home.

88
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,875
What's wrong?
Why are you acting like this?

89
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,425
What do you mean?

90
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:25,825
It's weird. Act like you normally do.

91
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:26,650
Mother!

92
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,225
Uh, father, about my getting a job...

93
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:31,800
I asked a few people.

94
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,775
What kind of job?
I never worked before.

95
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,225
When are they getting back to you?

96
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:39,625
They said as soon as possible.

97
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,800
Mother!

98
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,925
Honey, honey, wait a second. Come here.

99
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,625
Why?

100
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,900
Tada! Pumpkin rice cake.

101
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,700
Your favorite, pumpkin rice cake.

102
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,650
You love pumpkin anything.

103
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,900
Pumpkin rice cake, pumpkin soup,

104
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,175
and your favorite daughter is Hobak (pumpkin).

105
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:03,900
It's really delicious, father. Try it.

106
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,425
Later.

107
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,425
It won't be as good when it's cold. Try it.

108
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:10,125
I haven't even washed my hands yet.

109
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,900
I'll feed it to you.

110
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,575
Isn't it delicious, father?

111
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,050
Oh, my! I think his hair is getting thicker.

112
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,950
Huh?

113
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,725
Oh! Right! You're getting younger.

114
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:28,025
You look 10 years younger.

115
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,925
Did mother have some, too?

116
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:31,800
Excuse me?

117
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,500
Of course she did.

118
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,800
Father, I drew a bath for you.

119
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,175
This early?

120
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:44,850
Our bathroom is cold,
so it's better to do it early.

121
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:51,275
You worked hard all day,
so you should soak yourself in hot water.

122
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,675
Why are you rushing me tonight?

123
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,150
Let me say hi to mother first.

124
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,875
The bath is getting cold. Say hi later.

125
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,550
Oh, man...

126
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,175
What is it?

127
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:12,825
I need clean underwear.

128
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,725
I'll bring it to you. Get into the bath.

129
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,900
We've bought some time.

130
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,575
What if grandmother doesn't come back?

131
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,100
Is that him?

132
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:31,625
Name?

133
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:36,400
It's Ko Minjung.

134
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,675
This is crazy.

135
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,775
I looked for them everywhere.

136
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,375
What are we going to do, then?

137
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,925
What else can we do, mom?
Let's confess.

138
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,550
Let's confess and ask for forgiveness.

139
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,350
He's going to blow up.

140
00:08:57,325 --> 00:09:00,250
Oh, what the heck! He can't kill us.

141
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,050
Oh, that was nice.

142
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,325
Hey, is there anything to drink?

143
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,300
What's wrong?

144
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,550
Tell me. What did you do?

145
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:26,250
Grandmother ran away with uncle.

146
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,350
What?

147
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,700
Grandmother!

148
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,950
Uncle!

149
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,250
- Grandmother!
- Mother!

150
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,850
Grandmother!

151
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,300
Have you seen my mother?

152
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,475
No, I haven't.

153
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:56,925
Mom, I'm hungry.

154
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:59,100
I'm hungrier now that I've left home.

155
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
That's normal.

156
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,775
No home, no comfort.

157
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:07,450
Can't we get something and put it on Bong's tab?

158
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,450
Don't ruin your brother's reputation.

159
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,450
Everyone knows he's a vice principal.

160
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,325
Do you have any money?

161
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,975
Of course not.

162
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:20,550
Mom, why did you name me Don?

163
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,200
I have no idea.

164
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,525
Your father named you before he died.

165
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,475
He probably wanted you to become rich.

166
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:30,600
Hey, look in your pocket.

167
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,000
Do you think I can become rich someday?

168
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,950
I have some!

169
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,175
You do?

170
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,425
Oh, you little!

171
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:40,075
Try carrying some money next time.

172
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:41,500
But I don't have any to carry around.

173
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,475
How about you, mom?

174
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,075
I was furious so I didn't bring anything.

175
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:46,600
Hey, follow me.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,350
Try to look as sad as possible.

177
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:58,425
You used to look much sadder than that!

178
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,075
Remember what you do best?

179
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,700
Yes! that's it!

180
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,975
Follow me.

181
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,025
Oh, how cold.

182
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,250
Excuse me, it's nice to meet you.

183
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,250
It's nice to meet you.

184
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Not really.

185
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,300
I fled from North Korea during the Korean War.

186
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,150
Excuse me?

187
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,300
And I'm starving. Can you give me some food?

188
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,625
You came from North Korea?

189
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,050
Yes.

190
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,900
He's not my son but grandson, but he hasn't eaten for days.

191
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,075
Please give us some food.

192
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:47,625
She's my grandmother.

193
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,400
You can have these.

194
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,550
Thank you, thank you. God bless you.

195
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:06,975
Hey, slow down. You'll get sick.

196
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,100
This is the last bus to Seoul!

197
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,375
If you're going to Seoul, please hurry!

198
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,975
This is the last bus to Seoul!

199
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,375
Excuse me, is this the last bus?

200
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,325
Yes.

201
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:50,000
This is the last bus to Seoul!

202
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,775
Is anyone going to Seoul?

203
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:54,375
The bus is leaving!

204
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,875
Wait for me.

205
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:52,700
Huh? That's it? It should be bigger.

206
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,975
Read it.

207
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:57,550
Choi Sangnam!

208
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,350
I wrote "Wang Gwangbak,"

209
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,350
and I read it " My Love."

210
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,350
Excuse me, sir!

211
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,100
Please let me get off!

212
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,875
Excuse me, is there any other bus?

213
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,550
There's no more buses tonight.

214
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,675
The last one left just now.

215
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:30,215
[Seoul]

216
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,750
I have lots of ointment.

217
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,025
So leave it to me.

218
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:38,250
I'll make it all better.

219
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:43,050
I'll help you forget all your pain.

220
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,775
I'll be better to you.

221
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:47,825
I won't play games and I'll do what you say.

222
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:50,525
I'll go and come as you say.

223
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:15,300
What a fool...

224
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,525
You fool!

225
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,650
Hello.

226
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,975
- I want to report a missing person.
- Oh.

227
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,175
It's right over there.

228
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:06,500
Okay.

229
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,525
It wasn't me.

230
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:10,000
It must be a misunderstanding.

231
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,875
Circumstantial evidence says you're the one.

232
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,875
Minjung.

233
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:21,850
Father,

234
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,424
how did you know?

235
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:24,675
Know what?

236
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,500
I didn't come here for you.

237
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,629
Why are you here?

238
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,066
There's been a misunderstanding.

239
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:35,925
Your son in law is a thief.

240
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:37,000
Excuse me?

241
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,300
How could you steal from me?

242
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,742
I said I'd forgive you if you return them,

243
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:43,742
but you keep insisting it wasn't you.

244
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:46,113
What's going on here?

245
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:50,050
Your son in law went into her house while delivering a package today.

246
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,075
After that, money and jewelry went missing.

247
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,750
It wasn't me.

248
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,700
I came right out after pouring the rice out.

249
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,400
You were standing by me the whole time.

250
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,900
I really had nothing to do with that.

251
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,325
But I had no other visitors besides you!

252
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:13,400
People are really sneaky these days, so you could've taken them when my eyes were closed!

253
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,500
Pickpockets can steal at a blink of an eye!

254
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,625
Can I talk to you?

255
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,100
Minjung,

256
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,525
be honest with me.

257
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:33,926
You really had nothing to do with it?

258
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,425
Excuse me?

259
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:43,201
Please make mistakes out of desperation.

260
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:48,950
Father,

261
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,710
I'd rather go to prison.

262
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,914
Even if the world thought I was guilty,

263
00:18:56,914 --> 00:18:59,525
I didn't think you would...

264
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,725
Even if the whole world casted stones at me,

265
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:15,750
I thought you would believe me.

266
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,125
Hello. This is my business card.

267
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:30,375
[Mun Jin Middle School
Vice Principal Wang Bong]

268
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,175
Yes.

269
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:38,100
I swear on my teaching job,
my son in law didn't do it.

270
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,191
But the circumstances are suspicious.

271
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:45,595
Then let's go to her house and check.

272
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:48,375
Let's search the whole house.

273
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,700
I swear to god.

274
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:52,635
I'll eat my hat.

275
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:16,850
What did you say it looks like?

276
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,595
It's a pouch I always wear here.

277
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,625
It's red pouch.

278
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:27,675
I have a gold ring in there and all the money my sons gave me.

279
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,900
Let's all look for it.

280
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,150
Isn't this it?

281
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,200
Oh, my! Why was it in there?

282
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,275
Is that the pouch?

283
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:54,675
Oh, what do I do?
I'm so sorry.

284
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,831
Why didn't you look more thoroughly?

285
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,341
Minjung.

286
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,175
I'm sorry about before.

287
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,017
I don't know why I thought that.

288
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,925
I thought desperation could make you do it.

289
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:28,327
And since you're in a desperate situation I thought maybe you did steal it.

290
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,650
I'm sorry.

291
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,800
But I never doubted your character.

292
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:37,825
It was just a bad day for you.

293
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,825
It started off badly with that tofu,

294
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:42,975
and it just kept going like that.

295
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,175
It's because you feel unwelcome.

296
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:52,984
It's like feeling eternally hungry.

297
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,400
I was a resident tutor when I was in college,

298
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,050
and the family was really good to me,

299
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,100
but I always felt hungry for some reason.
and the family was really good to me,

300
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,525
but I always felt hungry for some reason.

301
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:08,050
I realized later it came from feeling unwelcome.

302
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:12,200
You probably felt unwelcome,

303
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,450
living with your in laws,

304
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,274
and that was why you were hungry.

305
00:22:17,575 --> 00:22:19,010
I'm sorry.

306
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,550
There's no need to be.

307
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,800
You're living here now so hold your head up.

308
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,325
There's no shame in that.

309
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,050
Whatever my wife says,

310
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,175
don't dwell on it.

311
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:34,575
She nags me all the time, too.

312
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:37,125
Eat whatever you want, whenever you want.

313
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,650
Turn the lights on at night,

314
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,025
and make all the noise you want to.

315
00:22:42,025 --> 00:22:44,350
Make lots of noise when you eat.

316
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,536
Wake Subak up to make you something. Okay?

317
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:50,825
Thank you, father.

318
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:53,100
I was really upset before,

319
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,212
but now I'm not anymore.

320
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,875
I'm really sorry.

321
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:01,700
Let's go in.

322
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,475
Anyway,

323
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:05,725
why did you come to the police station?

324
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,200
The police station?

325
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,000
I didn't go there for you.

326
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,350
Why did I go there?

327
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,325
Oh, I can't believe I forgot.

328
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:16,750
Father!

329
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:27,775
My father and I were in financial trouble,

330
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,450
and in my junior year, we hit rock bottom.

331
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:40,400
My father kept an installment savings account to send me to college,

332
00:23:41,925 --> 00:23:44,150
but I asked him to give it to me.

333
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,150
It was meant for me, so I asked for it early.

334
00:23:51,925 --> 00:23:55,025
I told him I'd use it as seed money

335
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:58,150
and be more successful than college graduates.

336
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:02,100
And your father gave it to you?

337
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:05,500
I can be pretty stubborn.

338
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,115
Your father is pretty amazing.

339
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,025
He believed in me.

340
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:20,950
And I dropped out of high school and started working.

341
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,200
To get over my education complex,

342
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,467
I read as many books as I could

343
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:32,600
and learned English and Chinese.

344
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,825
Maybe that's why.

345
00:24:34,825 --> 00:24:38,700
I never thought you lacked knowledge.

346
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,775
Actually, you taught me a lot of things.

347
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,250
Thank you for saying that.

348
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,700
Aren't you cold?

349
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,071
I brought you here for a reason.

350
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,325
When I was little,

351
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:14,746
my family came here on our first trip.

352
00:25:16,575 --> 00:25:19,475
Remember the rock we climbed earlier?

353
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:22,887
We took our only family photo there.

354
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,800
This place is meaningful to me,

355
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,675
and I wanted to bring the person

356
00:25:32,925 --> 00:25:34,965
who would become my family.

357
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,275
Why didn't you go?

358
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Fool.

359
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:43,775
You told me to wait for you here.

360
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,625
And I was going to, all night.

361
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,245
I was scared out of my wits.

362
00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:54,450
You won't regret it?

363
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,120
You can't live without me.

364
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:01,791
And you can't live without me.

365
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:07,730
You chose me and you can never leave me.

366
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:12,625
You won't regret it.

367
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:16,025
My sucker.

368
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,175
I like getting things done quickly.

369
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,450
Tonight?

370
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,375
I'm not really ready tonight.

371
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,300
What?

372
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,475
We should go home tonight.

373
00:26:32,475 --> 00:26:33,600
Next time...

374
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:36,625
What are you talking about?

375
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,375
I can't say anything to you.

376
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,725
I saw your bag.

377
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:47,850
You brought your makeup, pajamas and everything, didn't you?

378
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,771
No, I didn't.

379
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,975
I want to marry you.

380
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,846
I have something to tell you, too.

381
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,600
Go ahead.

382
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,600
Don't leave me stranded like tonight.

383
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,287
Don't disappear on me.

384
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:09,725
Don't flirt with other women.

385
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,600
And keep your eyes on me forever.

386
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:18,000
If you don't, I will...

387
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,900
I promise.

388
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,642
I'm yours forever.

389
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:55,675
You look very happy.

390
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:19,625
Mom, I'm cold.

391
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,750
Sit closer to me.

392
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,175
- Mom.
- Yes?

393
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:26,300
Aren't you glad I'm here with you?

394
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,600
You're not scared or bored.

395
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
Aren't you glad you had me?

396
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,875
Why you little...

397
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,875
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have fought.

398
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,700
You're a college graduate,

399
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,200
but you can't even get a job,

400
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,825
and that's why people look down on you.

401
00:28:40,825 --> 00:28:41,950
I know.

402
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:46,550
Oh, I'm completely awake.

403
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,975
You were pretty good getting the bread.

404
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:53,650
When I fled during the Korean War,

405
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,725
all I wanted was to survive,

406
00:28:56,725 --> 00:29:00,325
so I begged for food whenever I could.

407
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:03,325
I said I didn't care if it was dog food.

408
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,125
I begged for just one bite.

409
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:11,475
That was how I survived, but I might die from being kicked out by my daughter in law.

410
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,470
You're not going to die!

411
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,950
You survived the Korean War.

412
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:21,900
They'd be sleeping in their cozy rooms, and we're out here, freezing to death.

413
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,850
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

414
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,088
Bong must be looking for us.

415
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:26,950
Look what you gotten me into!

416
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,125
Why did you break that stroller?

417
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,328
It wasn't me! I'm serious!

418
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:33,796
It wasn't you?

419
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:36,250
I thought it was you, mom.

420
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,000
Really?

421
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,150
Oh, man.

422
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,604
Then why did we leave?

423
00:29:41,604 --> 00:29:42,975
I know!

424
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:46,175
We did nothing wrong, so let's go home.

425
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:48,550
Why I ought to...

426
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,050
Ouch...

427
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:52,800
Mom, rub spit on your nose.

428
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,550
Ouch! Let's go!

429
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,075
Mother!

430
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:04,425
Bong!

431
00:30:04,425 --> 00:30:06,225
Oh, son!

432
00:30:07,175 --> 00:30:10,675
I thought I would never see you again.

433
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:14,375
Where were you?
I looked for you everywhere.

434
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,200
I can't live without you, mother.

435
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,500
And I can't live without you, Bong.

436
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,075
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

437
00:30:23,975 --> 00:30:25,175
Bong!

438
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,375
Bong...

439
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:38,650
What's wrong with this family?

440
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,275
I can't believe this.

441
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,595
Look at that.

442
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:42,596
[Put yourself in other's shoes]

443
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,800
All you need to do is that.

444
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:47,768
Wang Subak!

445
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:51,725
Have you no respect?

446
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,000
He's your uncle, even if he's 2 years younger.

447
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,325
And you're his niece.

448
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,525
Right, she is.

449
00:30:57,525 --> 00:31:01,025
How dare you talk back to him?

450
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,416
What? Your mom?

451
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,150
Were you talking about my mom?

452
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,150
You want to be my equal now?

453
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,625
I'm Don's older brother, okay?

454
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,124
You want a piece of me?

455
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,650
Father, I'm sorry.

456
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,225
She wasn't trying to pick a fight.

457
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:22,750
They were like friends, growing up.

458
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,370
Be quiet.

459
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,825
Don't cut in while Bong's talking.

460
00:31:28,825 --> 00:31:30,750
How dare you!

461
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,200
I'm sorry, father.

462
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,725
I'm sorry. Let's leave it at that.

463
00:31:35,725 --> 00:31:39,275
Pay attention to the family hierarchy.

464
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:43,455
Hobak, don't treat your uncle like he's your younger brother.

465
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,058
I won't.

466
00:31:47,825 --> 00:31:49,875
Daebak, he's your uncle, not your brother.

467
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:50,895
Okay.

468
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:52,063
And you.

469
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:54,365
Yes.

470
00:31:54,365 --> 00:31:57,075
How can you make mother leave home?

471
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,625
And you framed her.

472
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:04,750
You're getting old, too, so how would you feel if your children treated you that way?

473
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,245
Your children will follow your example.

474
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:12,383
Your father is right, so pay attention.

475
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,050
Yes!

476
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,925
And Don.

477
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,491
Yes.

478
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,700
I told you not to act like a loser.

479
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,950
Why would you get involved in women's business and get treated like a loser?

480
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:34,300
It wouldn't have happened if it weren't for you.

481
00:32:36,475 --> 00:32:39,525
You're their uncle, so try to set an example.

482
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:43,025
You're younger, but you're still their uncle!

483
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:45,325
I know. I'm sorry, Bong.

484
00:32:48,525 --> 00:32:50,050
Who was that?

485
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:03,050
My stomach's asking for food.

486
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,100
What are you waiting for?
Go make dinner!

487
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,100
Okay.

488
00:33:07,575 --> 00:33:10,500
Bong, you're the best.

489
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,300
Mother, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

490
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,500
It's not your fault!

491
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,900
It's not easy to survive among these women.

492
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,152
I heard other women are pretty scary.

493
00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:27,850
Mother, don't ever leave home again.

494
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,424
You scared me to death.

495
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,126
I won't do it again.

496
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:33,600
I know.

497
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:38,450
Why didn't you tell me this before?

498
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,000
I won't let her get away with it.

499
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,725
Mr. Heo Sedal.

500
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,375
Yes, director.

501
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:46,375
Don't get too excited.

502
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:51,225
I normally don't get excited, but this can't be!

503
00:33:51,825 --> 00:33:54,414
I think you do normally get excited.

504
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,700
I wasn't going to tell you.

505
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,650
I never had a water slap before.

506
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:09,150
I saw sparks flying in front of my eyes.

507
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:13,075
Did it hurt?
I never had a water slap.

508
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,975
Would you like one now?

509
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:17,575
No, thank you.

510
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:22,375
It sounds like it hurts a lot.

511
00:34:23,075 --> 00:34:25,925
Things are getting more interesting.

512
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:26,725
Excuse me?

513
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:30,225
I feel like going to war,

514
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:32,551
and it's going to get more interesting.

515
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,925
Good shot.

516
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,450
I hate it when my feelings are hurt.

517
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,100
Do you understand what I'm saying?

518
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,075
I'll take care of it right away.

519
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,750
Sedal.

520
00:34:56,275 --> 00:34:57,750
What do you think you're doing?

521
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,750
What do you mean?

522
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,925
Is your entire family gangsters?

523
00:35:02,925 --> 00:35:04,350
Are they thugs?

524
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,700
Your entire family turn to violence,

525
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,900
from your uncle to your older sister.

526
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,825
How can vice principal's kids do this?

527
00:35:12,825 --> 00:35:16,025
How could you get Subak involved in this?

528
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:19,575
How can you slap an innocent woman?

529
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:24,675
She's never seen sparks flying in front of her eyes like that.

530
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,950
You can't solve this problem this way.

531
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:34,100
You're being really dumb, but this is against the law.

532
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,350
You and your family aren't that close, but you came together for this.

533
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:42,675
Whenever something happens to you, Gwangbak, Subak and your mother come to me.

534
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,750
It must be nice to have siblings.

535
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,450
If your family butt in one more time,

536
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,400
that will be the end of us.

537
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,725
I screamed at her.

538
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:04,740
She won't pull anything like that again.

539
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,925
It's not like we did anything wrong.

540
00:36:06,925 --> 00:36:08,750
We just pretended to be dating.

541
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,350
What's wrong with your family?

542
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,525
Actually, they're not my family.

543
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,975
They are my in laws.

544
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,600
They're not even that close,

545
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,200
but when something happens,

546
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,125
they stick together like bees.

547
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,120
I'm jealous.

548
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,350
You're jealous of that?

549
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:29,325
I've always been jealous of kids with lots of siblings.

550
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,000
Don't be jealous.

551
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,335
It's better to be an only child.

552
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,025
It's better to be an only child?

553
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:38,850
They say it's better to have no children.

554
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,675
It's the same thing.

555
00:36:40,675 --> 00:36:43,900
Having lots of siblings is a huge headache,

556
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,582
unless they are loaded and giving.

557
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:50,250
You have me, so don't worry.

558
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,353
I'll make sure nobody touches you.

559
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:56,057
Take care of your in laws.

560
00:36:56,057 --> 00:37:00,000
If anything like this happens again, you know, right?

561
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,625
I must return the car key and credit card.

562
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,500
This is my treat.

563
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,800
This is what every Korean loves, and it's called pork belly.

564
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:15,950
It really hurt, didn't it?

565
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,650
I can't believe you saw sparks.

566
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,025
I know the feeling.

567
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:22,450
Which cheek was it? This one?

568
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,375
This one.

569
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,725
This one?

570
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:36,325
Let's go somewhere else.

571
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:37,675
Why?

572
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:47,750
Oh, my!

573
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,125
I'm glad I ran into you.

574
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:44,575
Your kids are jumping like mad.

575
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:48,699
I rang the door many times, but it didn't work.

576
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:50,675
That can't be.

577
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:52,135
My kids don't jump.

578
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,225
My ceilings about to collapse.

579
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:57,000
Is this your first apartment?

580
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,310
Apartment noise leads to murders these days!

581
00:39:02,275 --> 00:39:04,275
I'm sorry.

582
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,825
I knew this would happen.

583
00:39:06,825 --> 00:39:09,118
What are you teaching those boys?

584
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,375
You!

585
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,125
You little rascals! Come here!

586
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,425
I told you to play quietly! Didn't I?

587
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,225
Why won't you listen to me? Why?

588
00:39:23,225 --> 00:39:26,000
Do you want me to die from stress?

589
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,138
No! I don't want you to die!

590
00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:31,025
Go ahead! Hit me!

591
00:39:31,025 --> 00:39:33,609
It's not my kid you're killing!

592
00:39:33,925 --> 00:39:34,700
What?

593
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,950
What did you say? Come here!

594
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,075
How dare you say such a thing!

595
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:03,025
Who is it?

596
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,225
It's me.

597
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:08,000
Father, how come you didn't call?

598
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,675
Maybe I should've called you first.

599
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:15,650
It's okay. Come in, father.

600
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:21,025
I bought some snacks for the boys.

601
00:40:21,025 --> 00:40:24,250
You didn't have to.

602
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,600
Where are they?

603
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,425
I put them to bed.

604
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:31,264
Were you crying? What happened?

605
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,950
I was a bit upset.

606
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,675
Because of Sedal?
I was a bit upset.

607
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:36,275
Because of Sedal?

608
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:38,125
Because of the boys.

609
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:44,625
When I came home, they were jumping up and down, and the downstairs lady came up.

610
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,850
Boys will be boys.

611
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,850
They can't help it.

612
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:10,825
But tell them not to bother the neighbors.

613
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,972
Apartment noise is a huge deal these days.

614
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,142
They should put themselves in other's shoes.

615
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,025
I spanked them already.

616
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,000
You didn't have to do that.

617
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,217
Just talk to them.

618
00:41:28,775 --> 00:41:30,675
I'm so upset.

619
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,450
What happened?

620
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,250
Hitting them broke my heart.

621
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:39,800
I don't know why I'm like this.

622
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,800
I hated mom,

623
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,700
but I'm turning into her.

624
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:46,737
Especially with Bangtong.

625
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:52,109
Are you partial to one of them?

626
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:58,975
When I'm upset, I feel like I'm doing the right thing by punishing them,

627
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,785
but when I calm down and think about it,

628
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:05,088
I think I hit Bangtong more than Sintong.

629
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:11,125
I swore to myself that I'd love them equally,

630
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,150
but I'm doing the same thing mom did.

631
00:42:14,775 --> 00:42:17,167
And it's driving me crazy.

632
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,675
That's how things are.

633
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:26,843
The victims of domestic violence grow up and become violent.

634
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:31,047
Don't beat your kids out of anger.

635
00:42:32,325 --> 00:42:35,825
I tell the teachers at every meeting

636
00:42:35,825 --> 00:42:39,075
not to hit the students out of anger.

637
00:42:39,075 --> 00:42:41,557
That leaves emotional scars.

638
00:42:43,475 --> 00:42:44,700
I know.

639
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,500
I'll be more careful, father.

640
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,675
Good.

641
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:55,370
Is everything okay with you?

642
00:42:56,675 --> 00:42:57,606
Yes.

643
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:01,125
I heard you're going to the gym.

644
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,125
Namhyeong told me.

645
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,900
Yes, I thought I should exercise.

646
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,900
I keep gaining weight.

647
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,600
Gain weight? You?
You're so skinny.

648
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,900
I think you lost more weight.

649
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,800
I look skinny, but I'm not.

650
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,325
You know I'm different from what you see.

651
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:22,700
I think your mom's softened up a bit.

652
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,900
She speaks harshly, but she's softened up.

653
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:30,137
You should drop by and talk to her.

654
00:43:31,325 --> 00:43:32,350
I will, father.

655
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,950
I better get going.

656
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,975
Hobak, can I ask you for a favor?

657
00:43:39,975 --> 00:43:42,000
Anything, except to borrow money, father.

658
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,925
It's Subak.

659
00:43:46,475 --> 00:43:49,925
Can you find a job for her?

660
00:43:49,925 --> 00:43:53,500
She needs to lend a hand.

661
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,550
I'll see what I can find, father.

662
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,550
I hope I'm not putting pressure on you.

663
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,525
Where's Sedal? Is he always this late?

664
00:44:05,525 --> 00:44:07,406
I think he has a lot of work.

665
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,700
Everything is okay, right?

666
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,075
It is, father. Why do you ask?

667
00:44:15,075 --> 00:44:17,600
It's nothing. I'm glad everything's okay.

668
00:44:19,025 --> 00:44:20,675
You play golf now?

669
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,225
My son is successful.

670
00:44:24,225 --> 00:44:26,191
I envy you.

671
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,025
It's nothing, really.

672
00:44:29,025 --> 00:44:33,400
I need to know how to do certain things to be with the boss.

673
00:44:35,475 --> 00:44:36,875
Like this.

674
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:41,500
This is how you stand.

675
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:45,725
Good shot!

676
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:49,950
Oh, I wish I could play golf.

677
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:56,854
Everyone who's well off in this town carry around their golf bags and practice their swings and play golf.

678
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,623
Your time will come.

679
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,400
Did you ask your director?

680
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:04,962
Not yet.

681
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,075
You said your director is rich.

682
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,325
Just ask, Sedal.

683
00:45:08,325 --> 00:45:09,925
Mom's trying to make a living.

684
00:45:09,925 --> 00:45:13,103
I'm waiting for the right timing.

685
00:45:14,025 --> 00:45:17,150
Why do you keep sleeping over here?

686
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,150
What did you fight about?

687
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,150
Just pretend you didn't...

688
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,350
Yes, director.

689
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,800
Right now?

690
00:45:35,975 --> 00:45:37,450
What's going on?

691
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,599
What is it?

692
00:45:49,175 --> 00:45:51,050
I'm so, so lonely.

693
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,125
I'm scared to be alone.

694
00:45:59,075 --> 00:46:01,400
Stay with me tonight.

695
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,275
And don't go anywhere, okay?

696
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,400
Let's go out for lunch.

697
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,675
Okay. What about Sangnam?

698
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:14,200
He left because he has plans.

699
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,650
He seems to be very busy these days.

700
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:17,775
Is something up with him?

701
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,975
Who knows?
Maybe he's seeing someone.

702
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:30,375
Go sit down. I'll bring it over.

703
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:39,875
Did you bring it?

704
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,875
Tada!

705
00:46:44,425 --> 00:46:46,675
My third grade winter vacation journal.

706
00:46:46,675 --> 00:46:49,150
Oh! Mine's from third grade, too.

707
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,125
Let's write a report on them after reading.

708
00:46:55,675 --> 00:46:57,175
And your photo album?

709
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,150
I don't show this to just anyone.

710
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,325
Tada!

711
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,325
How adorable!

712
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,375
Not adorable. Handsome.

713
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:14,587
A baby less than a year old isn't "handsome."

714
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,925
Look. I already look like a player.

715
00:47:17,925 --> 00:47:19,200
I was born with it.

716
00:47:21,275 --> 00:47:22,628
Not this one.

717
00:47:23,525 --> 00:47:25,150
Why not?

718
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,875
It's too sexy.

719
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:29,650
My pants are missing.

720
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,125
I want to see. Please show me.

721
00:47:34,575 --> 00:47:36,100
I can't...

722
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,800
Oh, my!

723
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,950
How adorable!

724
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,500
I'm embarrassed.

725
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,600
Give me 10 cents for every kiss.

726
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,800
Advance payment. I have nine left.

727
00:48:00,475 --> 00:48:01,750
Album.

728
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,400
I couldn't bring them all.

729
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,000
I'll show you when you come to my house.

730
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,975
Is it because you had work done?

731
00:48:08,975 --> 00:48:10,475
Is that why you can't show me?

732
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,050
No. I'm a natural beauty.

733
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,800
I had the same face since I was a girl.

734
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,675
With big eyes.

735
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,850
It must be nice to have many pictures.

736
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,875
I don't have that many.

737
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,275
This is it.

738
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,855
The rest of the pages are empty.

739
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:32,000
We will become a family and fill them up.

740
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,425
Let's do that.

741
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,438
Well...

742
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,875
Remember?

743
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,525
My mom?

744
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,325
Like you said, I'm going to forgive her.

745
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,150
I won't be able to love anyone

746
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:55,051
unless I do that first.

747
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,550
You're such a good boy.

748
00:49:02,325 --> 00:49:03,875
When is the best time?

749
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,350
As soon as possible.

750
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:08,050
I told you. I don't like wasting time.

751
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,725
I can't sleep because I want to marry you.

752
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:19,775
Can we not tell my family about your school?

753
00:49:19,775 --> 00:49:23,225
It has nothing to do with how I feel.

754
00:49:23,225 --> 00:49:25,150
I don't care about that stuff.

755
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:26,275
I know.

756
00:49:26,275 --> 00:49:29,975
You don't want them to be biased.

757
00:49:29,975 --> 00:49:32,500
Right. That's it.

758
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,000
Time will solve it,

759
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
so let's not bring it up just yet.

760
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,175
Okay.

761
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,100
We'll tell them later.

762
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,975
I won't bring it up.

763
00:49:43,975 --> 00:49:46,350
You need to meet someone today.

764
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:48,750
Who is it?

765
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,050
This reminds me of the soup you made me.

766
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:05,725
You made this soup on my birthday.

767
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,025
You didn't know?

768
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,725
You didn't have seaweed soup this morning?

769
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,800
Minjung!

770
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:41,925
Minjung!

771
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,875
Don't get off.

772
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:49,025
Here.

773
00:50:49,025 --> 00:50:50,475
I made some dumplings.

774
00:50:50,475 --> 00:50:51,950
You called me for this?

775
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:52,725
Yes.

776
00:50:52,725 --> 00:50:54,400
You like dumplings.

777
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,200
Eat it while you drive.

778
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,025
I also packed some warm coffee.

779
00:50:58,025 --> 00:50:59,875
Go. I'll see you later.

780
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:15,850
Sunjeong.

781
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,225
You're busy. You should go.

782
00:51:20,575 --> 00:51:21,850
Thanks.

783
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:25,350
But don't do this again.

784
00:51:25,925 --> 00:51:27,775
All people are the same.

785
00:51:28,825 --> 00:51:32,000
I'm not just some guy you used to know.

786
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,625
We almost got married,

787
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,925
and no man would approve of that.

788
00:51:37,925 --> 00:51:39,800
Minjung,

789
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,350
when we're together, don't talk about others.

790
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,900
It's okay.

791
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,883
I'm doing this because I can.

792
00:51:46,883 --> 00:51:48,375
So don't worry.

793
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:53,150
Why are you looking at me like that?

794
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,275
Are you worried about me seducing you?

795
00:51:56,525 --> 00:51:58,450
You're not capable of that.

796
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,875
Huh?

797
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,825
I'm not the same girl you used to know.

798
00:52:01,825 --> 00:52:04,000
It's been over 10 years.

799
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,875
How did you know I like dumplings?

800
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,605
Even my own wife doesn't know that.

801
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:15,125
This may sound presumptuous,

802
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:18,450
but I think I understand your wife.

803
00:52:19,482 --> 00:52:24,700
When you lose all your money like that, women can't help it.

804
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,700
She must feel very lost.

805
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,700
She has to take care of you and the kids.

806
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:34,125
It's natural to forget things like birthdays.

807
00:52:36,175 --> 00:52:37,099
I know.

808
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:40,375
You should be nice to her.

809
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:43,600
And you should try to rely on me a bit.

810
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,525
I can't be of big help,

811
00:52:45,525 --> 00:52:47,625
but I can be there for you.

812
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:56,951
Aunt.

813
00:53:05,675 --> 00:53:07,475
I'm right on time, right?

814
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,296
Say hi. This is my aunt.

815
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:12,600
Hello. I'm Wang Gwangbak.

816
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,675
It's nice to meet you.

817
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:18,150
I was wondering about the lucky girl.

818
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,125
Isn't she perfect?

819
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:20,274
Sit down, aunt.

820
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:31,425
You look like a good person.

821
00:53:31,425 --> 00:53:34,225
People with big eyes are all kind hearted.

822
00:53:34,225 --> 00:53:35,200
Right?

823
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,900
But he teases me, saying I look like a puppy.

824
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,475
You should hear her barking.

825
00:53:43,275 --> 00:53:45,600
Sangnam told me a lot about you.

826
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,975
He made fun of me?

827
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,525
No, he said you're a very nice person.

828
00:53:50,525 --> 00:53:52,300
You're like his mom.

829
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,300
How fake!

830
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,200
Be yourself. You'll be attacking each other soon.

831
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,425
We have to reveal one thing at a time.

832
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,700
You're not supposed to show everything at once.

833
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,050
I need to get this.

834
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,425
I'll be right back.

835
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,675
Yes.

836
00:54:16,725 --> 00:54:18,597
I'm not looking for anything else.

837
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,825
I just want you to be happy with Sangnam.

838
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:22,901
That's all.

839
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:25,700
I won't forget it.

840
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:31,175
You're the first woman he wants to marry.

841
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,425
You heard about our family, right?

842
00:54:34,425 --> 00:54:35,925
Yes.

843
00:54:35,925 --> 00:54:39,350
Unfortunately, you can't move out.

844
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:42,320
I know we have to live with his father.

845
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:46,400
But the house is big, so it should be fine.

846
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,325
You can have the second floor.

847
00:54:49,425 --> 00:54:50,550
The second floor?

848
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:52,900
And there isn't much to buy.

849
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,900
Maybe a new bed.

850
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,100
We bought new furniture recently.

851
00:54:58,875 --> 00:54:59,725
Okay.

852
00:54:59,725 --> 00:55:02,225
And the house isn't very old.

853
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,850
It looked pretty old.

854
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:08,250
I ran into him by his house one time.

855
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,275
That can't be.

856
00:55:10,275 --> 00:55:12,550
It's only 3 years old.

857
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,700
Really?

858
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,300
There are many people there, so no wonder.

859
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,025
And there won't be much work.

860
00:55:21,025 --> 00:55:22,800
The garden is big,

861
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,125
but we have someone who takes care of it.

862
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,500
So you won't have to worry about that.

863
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,500
I'm sorry,

864
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,000
but I don't understand what you're saying.

865
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:33,925
I'm talking about the house you'll live in.

866
00:55:33,925 --> 00:55:35,275
I know,

867
00:55:35,275 --> 00:55:38,575
but having the second floor or garden sounds

868
00:55:38,575 --> 00:55:41,650
weird when he lives in the basement.

869
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,525
He lives in the basement?

870
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,000
Did Sangnam tell you that?

871
00:55:48,975 --> 00:55:52,350
You should yell at him. He tricked you.

872
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,022
Excuse me?

873
00:56:05,725 --> 00:56:07,275
Are you okay?

874
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:15,900
What is it?

875
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,375
I met with my friends a few days ago.

876
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:23,525
Yeah.

877
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:25,775
And one of them saw

878
00:56:25,775 --> 00:56:29,650
his son in law meeting some other woman.

879
00:56:31,525 --> 00:56:34,228
And he was wondering what to do about it.

880
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,950
Why would he wonder about that?

881
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:40,850
He should have gone straight over to them,

882
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,400
yell at the evil witch

883
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,072
and beat the crap out of her.

884
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:47,675
That's what he should do?

885
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:49,275
Of course!

886
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:50,975
Why would he worry about that?

887
00:56:50,975 --> 00:56:54,425
Tell him to call her and teach her a lesson.

888
00:56:54,425 --> 00:56:55,975
He should nip it in the bud.

889
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,822
It's not Minjung or Sedal, is it?

890
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,759
It's not Minjung or Sedal. It's someone else.

891
00:57:21,425 --> 00:57:23,575
I miss mom.

892
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:28,413
I'm hungry. Where's my mom?

893
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,000
Does she hate me now?

894
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:38,089
If I see her, I should say I'm sorry.

895
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:09,700
Why did I do that?

896
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,100
Because you're happy.

897
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,550
Correct.

898
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:14,700
What were you doing?

899
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:19,025
I was meeting a little girl in third grade.

900
00:58:20,025 --> 00:58:23,300
See? You're better with words than I am.

901
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,425
You're a writer.

902
00:58:25,975 --> 00:58:30,525
I was meeting a lovely ten year old boy.

903
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:36,000
I think I know why you wanted to do this.

904
00:58:36,825 --> 00:58:40,600
Go to bed. You need your beauty sleep.

905
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,000
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

906
00:58:50,175 --> 00:58:52,600
This won't do. Come out.

907
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,500
Right now?

908
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,500
I can't do this. I miss you too much.

909
01:00:00,025 --> 01:00:01,700
I think we should stop.

910
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,675
Let's go.

911
01:00:05,325 --> 01:00:06,675
I'll take you home.

912
01:00:18,075 --> 01:00:19,225
You live here?

913
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,649
Go in. I'll see you tomorrow.

914
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:38,750
Good night. I'm going.

915
01:00:50,225 --> 01:00:53,850
Waiting for Gwangbak's future husband brings me back memories.

916
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,025
Of when I came to meet you.

917
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,750
How was it?

918
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,025
I was nervous.

919
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:05,223
I used to hang out here all the time,
so I wasn't nervous at all.

920
01:01:05,223 --> 01:01:06,875
The first impression is the key.

921
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:10,250
Men don't like women with lots of sisters.

922
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,825
So be lady like,

923
01:01:11,825 --> 01:01:13,931
and watch what you say.

924
01:01:13,931 --> 01:01:17,050
Just be yourselves. You can't fool him.

925
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,225
He should be here.

926
01:01:20,025 --> 01:01:21,650
Hey, sucker!

927
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:25,175
You look nice! The best!

928
01:01:25,175 --> 01:01:26,443
I always look nice.

929
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:28,250
You're full of yourself.

930
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,775
Let's go in. Everyone's waiting.

931
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,382
Am I shaking?

932
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,450
Don't forget what you promised.

933
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:37,725
I won't.

934
01:01:39,075 --> 01:01:40,100
Let's go.

935
01:01:42,975 --> 01:01:44,100
He's here.

936
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,900
He is?

937
01:01:50,925 --> 01:01:53,035

938
01:01:53,035 --> 01:01:54,725

940
01:01:58,125 --> 01:01:59,475
Welcome.

941
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,325
Here.

942
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,750
I never gotten flowers from a man before!

943
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,850
He brought dried yellow corvina and fruit, too.

944
01:02:12,825 --> 01:02:15,050
My fridge needed restocking!

945
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,875
Come and sit down.

946
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:20,675

Sit here.

948
01:02:37,425 --> 01:02:38,875

01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:40,475
Huh? Yeah.
