<i>[Episode 1]</i>

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,430
The sun is going to set! Hurry up!

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,140
Okay!

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,390
- Oh!
- Hey!

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,720
My goodness!

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,730
I almost died, running like that...

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,930
Take it easy.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,220
You're already tired,
from such little work?

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,880
Sir, I'm just worried about you
working too hard.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,860
Look at how much you're sweating!

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,740
No pain, no gain.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,870
Speed it up.
There's no time to kill.

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,730
- Is there anything else I should do?
- Well...

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,690
You can finish those.

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,020
And now...

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,800
These branches need trimming.

18
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,080
I thought they would be okay
but they grew too fast.

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,940
There are a ton of twigs
sprouting everywhere.

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,490
It's quite a mess.

21
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,260
It's going to ruin my crops.

22
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,710
No worries.

23
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,240
Spray some chemicals.
Then everything will be fine.

24
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,880
Chairman Geo, who knew
we would run into each other here?

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,290
Tae Soo! What brought you here?

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,350
I came to take a piss.

27
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,230
Next time, our chairman
will let you have it.

28
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,270
Ha... Hey.

29
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,370
There's no such thing as next time
in the world of business.

30
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,180
I heard Yoo Du Ri was good
at doing business.

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,380
But I guess that's not true.

32
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,540
Look at you, you little brat.
The way you talk...

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,390
Huh? Huh?

34
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,330
Oh man...

35
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,440
You'll sign it now, right?

36
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,600
What did you say?

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,890
That old geezer,
Baek Man Bo, must be senile.

38
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,050
How dare he order me around?

39
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,060
Huh?

40
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,180
Old geezer? Senile?

41
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,790
You must respect the elders.

42
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,620
You don't fear anything
just because you're doing well?

43
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,900
I'll kill you today.

44
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,280
<i>[Sweet Savage Family]</i>

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,910
Hi.

46
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,410
<i>[Chairman Baek Man Bo!
We wish you a long life!]</i>

47
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,630
Come on, hurry up.

48
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,500
Why are you so late?

49
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,710
I told you to pay extra attention!

50
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,640
I'm not the guest of honor.

51
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,170
Oh?

52
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,160
You did something to your face?

53
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,950
If I didn't look nice today,
I'd be a disgrace to you.

54
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,730
Is that so?

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,810
I'll get compliments for
you looking so sparkly.

56
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,850
Enough.

57
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,300
How much are you
going to give for the gift?

58
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,150
Why do you ask? I'll give just enough.

59
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,720
So how much?

60
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,390
Just one.

61
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,760
One million won?

62
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,360
Are you crazy?

63
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,980
We can't afford
a 10 million won gift!

64
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,920
Hey! Who's helping us make a living?

65
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,530
We worked to death to earn that money!

66
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,780
We worked because the chairman
gave us that work!

67
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,840
Man...

68
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,770
People might think you do
some kind of important work.

69
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,590
Are you saving the country?

70
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,600
Ugh...

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,530
Gi Bum! Director Baek!

72
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,100
Where are you going?
I'm not done!

73
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,270
You came!

74
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,760
Hello.

75
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,490
What's wrong? It's a good day.

76
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,670
What's all this?

77
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,750
It would have been classier
if it were at a hotel.

78
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,850
He's so tacky!

79
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,630
They're serving noodles!
Is this a folk village?

80
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,360
It's nice! It's festive!

81
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,820
- Honey, I need to talk.
- Chairman Baek is here.

82
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,000
- Mr. Chairman!
- Congratulations!

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,390
How did it go?

84
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,160
It's done.

85
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,390
Good job.

86
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,950
Mr. Chairman!

87
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,090
Congratulations!

88
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,540
Thanks.

89
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,600
Wow.

90
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,040
You always look great,
but you look even better today.

91
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,940
You look like the guest of honor today.

92
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,010
Isn't that true, honey?

93
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,320
Of course! Since you're so young

94
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,640
you still look good,
even without doing much.

95
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,160
Well, Mr. Chairman.

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,440
The members of One Heart prepared for
your 70th birthday for a month.

97
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,750
You know that, right?

98
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,980
Eun Ok made it possible
as the head of the group.

99
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, wow.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,800
Please don't say that.

101
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,690
We were obliged to do it.

102
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,810
Don't be nervous. Just smile.

103
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,560
One Heart! Don't be nervous. Smile.

104
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:30,220
<i>One Heart, One Heart, One Heart!</i>

105
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,360
<i>One Heart.</i>

106
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,470
Mr. Chairman, we wish you
a long, healthy life!

107
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:35,190
<i>All I think about is you...</i>

108
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,220
<i>When I think about you</i>

109
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,770
<i>I can't help stop thinking about you.</i>

110
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,510
<i>Hooray, Chairman Baek Man Bo!</i>

111
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,280
<i>I begged you so much...</i>

112
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,330
<i>but you left heartlessly.</i>

113
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,520
<i>No matter how hard I cry...</i>

114
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,390
<i>it's all pointless.</i>

115
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,960
<i>All I think about is you...</i>

116
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,270
<i>When I think about you...</i>

117
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,140
<i>my heart can't stop beating for you.</i>

118
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,270
<i>The angel of smile, Baek Man Bo!</i>

119
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,270
<i>We love you, Baek Man Bo!</i>

120
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,170
My goodness!

121
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,340
We love you!

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,110
That was great!

123
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,160
Go, honey!

124
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,350
Great!

125
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,910
The lady in red is my wife!

126
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,080
The one in the red dress!

127
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,890
Great! Great!

128
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,830
Hello?

129
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,920
What did you say?

130
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,090
What?

131
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,150
- My goodness!
- Be careful.

132
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,140
We're late.

133
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,200
Wait. I can't walk fast in this!

134
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,800
My shoe!

135
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,850
Why didn't you tell me?

136
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,800
It's not a good thing to talk about.

137
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,710
Wait until we get home.
You're dead today!

138
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,380
Be quiet.

139
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,800
I'm the assistant principal
at Bal Gwang Middle School

140
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,060
in charge of the
Anti School-Violence Committee.

141
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,820
We are here today to address

142
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,900
Yoon Sung Min's misconduct,
as she cyber-bullied Nam Mee Ae.

143
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,060
First, let us hear from
the victim's parents.

144
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,920
She constantly harassed and threatened
my daughter with texts and e-mails.

145
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,080
Mee Ae was so traumatized, that now

146
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,480
she almost has a heart attack
whenever her phone rings.

147
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,430
I'm not saying this just
because I'm a lawyer.

148
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,600
I must say, this is a serious crime.

149
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,610
I'm confident the committee will
deal prudently with this matter.

150
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,790
But I reaffirm that I hope there
will be severe punishment handed down.

151
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,020
That's all.

152
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,150
When a child does something wrong,
it is her parents who did wrong.

153
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,090
As her father, I apologize.

154
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,620
I ask for your mercy.

155
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,450
Soo Min, you were usually
good friends with Mee Ae.

156
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,050
Can you tell us why you did this?

157
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,170
She harassed my classmates.

158
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,280
When did I do that? I never did that.

159
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,210
Oh, so I'm going crazy?

160
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,610
- I saw it!
- Hey, hey hey!

161
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,660
Did you see that?
She shows no signs of remorse!

162
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,080
Even if she knelt down and started
begging, that wouldn't be enough.

163
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,220
A thief of a needle
becomes a thief of a cow.

164
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,490
A kid like that will cause
serious problems as an adult.

165
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,230
Wait a minute.

166
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,140
You don't know her well at all.
Why do you curse her future?

167
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,810
And it sounds like my daughter
isn't the only one at fault.

168
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,380
- Be quiet.
- Let go...

169
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,000
Soo Min, tell them how she
harassed other kids.

170
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,200
- I will complain to the committee too!
- What?

171
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,320
How dare you yell!
You're the parent of the aggressor!

172
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,690
You want a fight?

173
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,080
I can sue you for
making false accusations!

174
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,280
Like mother, like daughter!

175
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,050
Hey! Do you know me?
Why are you talking to me that way?

176
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,580
Is being a lawyer that great?

177
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,340
Watch your steps at night!

178
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,380
What?

179
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,060
Are you threatening me?

180
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,060
I'll sue you for making threats!

181
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,000
Sue me for assault too!

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,970
Sue me for assault, okay?

183
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,320
- This lady...
- Do it!

184
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,510
You're asking for trouble!

185
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,540
Oh, it hurts... it hurts...

186
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,030
You are a person who
knows the law very well.

187
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,980
It's inappropriate to act like this here.

188
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,440
I am very sorry.

189
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,290
We all learn from our mistakes.

190
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,170
I’ll teach her well at home.

191
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,280
I'll discipline her
and make sure she behaves well.

192
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,860
Please have mercy on her.

193
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,120
Please.

194
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,560
Watch your steps at night?

195
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,240
I was upset.

196
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,880
Is being a lawyer that great?

197
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,690
I'm so embarrassed because of you...

198
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,110
Be quiet!

199
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,670
I will deal with you at home.

200
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,760
Soo Min, you shouldn't
fight with your friends.

201
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,030
Try to get along.

202
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,060
I must be like someone here.

203
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,710
Let's go eat something since we're out.

204
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,840
When I'm stressed, I like to eat meat!

205
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,360
Steak!

206
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,400
Steak? My butt!

207
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,450
If you open your mouth again,
I'll confiscate your cell phone.

208
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,560
Ugh.

209
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,790
We haven't eaten out
together for so long.

210
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,590
Let's go!
It's the perfect day to do that.

211
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,330
Hey!

212
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,840
Whose genes do you have

213
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,940
to be so smart and handsome, huh?

214
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,760
If you don't answer correctly,
I'll cut your head off!

215
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,800
You, Dad!

216
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,690
That's right.

217
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,010
He's going to do well as an adult.

218
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,290
He's perfect! Sit down.

219
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,340
Eat up.

220
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,650
I spoke to your teacher on the phone.
You missed a question.

221
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,360
Yes. It was a mistake.

222
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,580
Not making that mistake is a skill.

223
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,000
That one question can change
your ranking at school.

224
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,180
By the way...

225
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,680
Strangely, your outfit fits
this place pretty well.

226
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,950
Don't change the subject.
What question was it?

227
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,770
Algebra? Geometry?

228
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,200
Stop it!

229
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,190
He's going to get indigestion.

230
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,610
Who will you go with when you
go to the workshop in Seoul?

231
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,710
Seoul?
He'll waste too much travel time!

232
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,800
There are good places here too.

233
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,010
On weekends, taking the train
is better than the express bus.

234
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,040
Why aren't you eating? Eat up.

235
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,430
Eat up.

236
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,390
Yes, Mr. Chairman?

237
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,360
Right now?

238
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,660
Yes, sir.

239
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,670
I got full just from
watching you guys eat.

240
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,810
This is what I live for, right?

241
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,890
Honey, order whatever you want to eat.

242
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,380
Do you want more steak?

243
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,890
You like the one with cheese.

244
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,260
Yoon Soo Min!

245
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,770
I told you not to use
your cell phone at the table.

246
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,580
Should I take it away?

247
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,520
Why do you take your
frustrations out on me?

248
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,350
Go.

249
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,720
No.

250
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,090
I can stay a little longer.

251
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,630
Go when I allow you to.

252
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,980
Go save the country.

253
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,000
Okay.

254
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,750
Stop right there!

255
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,050
Those rats!

256
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,910
Kill them all!

257
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,510
I almost died from running.

258
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,920
Were you on the track team?

259
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,360
Get them all!

260
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,930
Come here!

261
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,960
Stop right there!

262
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,170
Stop!

263
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,060
Hey.

264
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,100
Ugh...

265
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,120
Sir! Sir!

266
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,870
I returned the written contract.

267
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,280
Please save me.

268
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,210
I don't even know who you are.

269
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,100
I've never seen the written contract,
or whatever you're talking about.

270
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,550
Of course we never saw it.
That's because we never came here.

271
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,830
Boss.

272
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,040
Let's feed him to the fish
and go get some soju.

273
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,630
Save me!

274
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,680
Please save me, sir!

275
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,540
Forgive me! I did wrong!

276
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,880
Forgive?

277
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,910
What a swindler...

278
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,050
Do you know how many people's
lives you've ruined?

279
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,430
I can't live like a normal human
being because of jerks like you.

280
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,300
Go to hell and repent for your sins.

281
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,970
Let him go.

282
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,790
Okay!

283
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,850
Stop! I... I...

284
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,030
I... I...

285
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,110
In fact... In fact...

286
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,050
I have a house.

287
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,160
I hid it away secretly!

288
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,700
I'll give it to you!

289
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,730
Go ahead.

290
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,320
Two! I will give you two houses!

291
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,780
Two! That's all I have.

292
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,350
I promise.

293
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,000
As for me

294
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,350
I hate backstabbers more than
anything in the entire world.

295
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,080
Do you want to live?

296
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,810
That's entirely up to you.

297
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,190
Understood?

298
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,200
Eun Ok.

299
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,240
I'm home. Go sleep in the bedroom.

300
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,610
Oh.

301
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,870
You're home.

302
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,910
Did you eat?

303
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,880
I ate. Go get comfortable.

304
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll go to sleep then.

305
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,480
Good night.

306
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,240
Egg tart! Egg tart!

307
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,530
Where is my egg tart?

308
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,570
Just eat a fried egg with rice today.
I'll go buy more.

309
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,790
I don't want to! I want to eat it now!

310
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,910
Yoon Soo Min.

311
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,390
What's wrong with you?

312
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,590
I was saving the last one!

313
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,250
<i>You should take care of this!</i>

314
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,340
How did I know this would happen?
Did I eat that?

315
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,310
I didn't say you ate it.

316
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,070
Don't eat anything then!

317
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,280
Why are you yelling at me?
Someone else is responsible.

318
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,620
You're going to be late.

319
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,390
Give me money then
so I can buy something to eat.

320
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,530
You just wanted to get money, right?

321
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,320
What did I do wrong?

322
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,310
- My goodness!
- Stop!

323
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,810
I am sorry.

324
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,430
I am sorry.

325
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,850
I am sorry.

326
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,450
I am sorry.

327
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,900
The singer of the next generation!
Today's guest singer, Hong Jin Young!

328
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,460
<i>Charge me up with love.</i>

329
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,150
<i>My love battery must've run out.</i>

330
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,980
<i>I can't live with you,
I really, really can't.</i>

331
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,960
<i>You are my battery.</i>

332
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,810
<i>I like you even though
you're not a pretty face.</i>

333
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,290
I like you!

334
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,360
<i>I like you even though
you don't have a great body.</i>

335
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,930
I like you...

336
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,830
<i>If you only look to me</i>

337
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,440
<i>then I'd consider you the best.</i>

338
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,920
Everyone went crazy when
Hong Jin Young came out.

339
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,090
You are so adorable!

340
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,470
Thank you, sir.

341
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,650
Thanks to your support, I became
the MC of a variety show.

342
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,680
Really?

343
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,250
That's great!

344
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,710
Congratulations!

345
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,980
I knew you would be happy for me.

346
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,690
Of course I am.

347
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,180
I'll tell everyone about you.

348
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,790
When do you start?

349
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,050
Next month.

350
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,580
So speaking of that...

351
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,300
- Yeah?
- Actually...

352
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,610
I don't think I can make time.

353
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,380
What do I do?

354
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,450
Oh, well.

355
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,950
Some people work really hard.

356
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,720
But is she already out of battery?

357
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,210
It's just that her
main MC role is really big.

358
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,140
Please understand.

359
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,060
Is she quitting just here, or everywhere?

360
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,830
Well, that's...

361
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,370
All the clubs in the country.

362
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,700
Yes.

363
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,070
What about Busan?

364
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,920
Except that place.

365
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,220
Okay then.

366
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,900
Just stop by when
you're on the way there.

367
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,930
1.5 million people in
Daejeon love Hong Jin Young!

368
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,420
We've known each other so long.

369
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,970
We need to stick together all the way.

370
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,490
All the way.

371
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,120
This is Yoon Tae Soo,
Hong Jin Young's fan!

372
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,150
Pay your respects.

373
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,450
Hwang So.

374
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,280
Slow down, please.

375
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,230
Leave me alone.

376
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,280
It's not just anyone. It's Hwang So.

377
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,340
They said he hung himself
because he had no money.

378
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,390
Without knowing that,
I threw myself a birthday party.

379
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,290
He took good care of his underlings.

380
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,100
But what's this? No one showed up.

381
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,930
What's happening to this line of work?

382
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,810
At least Dal Shik should've been here.

383
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:57,970
I know he made a boatload of money.
But how dare he ignores his seniors!

384
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,820
This is not right.

385
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,940
You didn't know that
he went to prison last year?

386
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,180
His business failed.

387
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,310
He opened a business?

388
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,270
He invested in stocks.

389
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,870
His story was all over
the news at the time.

390
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,700
He made good money.

391
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,790
He started buying buildings and stocks
and then he lost them all at once!

392
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:22,240
That's why we are like a sand castle.

393
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,120
You may start your own business.

394
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,790
But once they get you,
you just go to jail.

395
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,450
Honestly...

396
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,070
How could you escape them if the
prosecutors wanted to get you?

397
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,220
Yeah.

398
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,980
It's time for us to find a new business.

399
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,230
Yes, sir.

400
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,930
Yes, Father.

401
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,380
Don't worry.

402
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,920
<i>Chairman Wang.</i>

403
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,940
<i>Shall we get to our casino business now?</i>

404
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,840
<i>Did your chairman approve it?</i>

405
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,940
<i>Of course.</i>

406
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,260
<i>The Chinese will love Daejeon
even more from now on.</i>

407
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,270
Man, it's so dry.

408
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,680
Hot! Hot!

409
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,510
Black noodles are the best
to eat quickly!

410
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,480
What's up with this leafy stuff?
Are we goats?

411
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,730
The chairman told us not to eat black
noodles in the office due to the smell.

412
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:41,180
We need to refresh the place first
if we want to have a fresh start.

413
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,480
What are you saying?

414
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,060
When an educated man looks
so serious like that

415
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,550
can he come up with good ideas?

416
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,030
Hey, Sung Goo!

417
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:55,160
A man must think with an open mind.

418
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,980
Who knows, maybe,
if you keep thinking and thinking...

419
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,930
you'll come up with
some good ideas too?

420
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,950
Geez.

421
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,400
Yes, Boss?

422
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,640
What did you say?

423
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,310
Oh, Tae Soo.

424
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:21,100
I think I'm going to die.

425
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,080
Just cremate me and scatter
my ashes somewhere.

426
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,020
And don't even hold a memorial ceremony.

427
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,580
Anyway, your wife is sick
of her mother-in-law.

428
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,490
She won't even have the desire
to hold a memorial ceremony.

429
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,200
Mom, why are you saying that?

430
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,660
I've lived long enough. It'd be
a good death if I died today.

431
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,730
Isn't it true?

432
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,920
Who says you're going to die?

433
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,370
Stop the nonsense. Tell me now.

434
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,910
I came here in the middle of my lunch.

435
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:01,030
It must be nice. You can eat.

436
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,720
I can't even dream of eating.

437
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,590
So what is this about?

438
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,290
Gosh, it's embarrassing to say...

439
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,590
But it's wrong not to say it.

440
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,050
Please, Mom!

441
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,790
Okay.

442
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:27,610
Since you are asking,
I guess I have to say it before I die.

443
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:32,060
Geez... geez.

444
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,500
Geez.

445
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,770
What's this?

446
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:49,310
I bought it because they were
giving away free toilet paper.

447
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,320
I ate it because it's supposed
to be good for my health.

448
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,480
But I have no strength,
like a baby's penis.

449
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,380
I've had diarrhea for three days!

450
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,260
I'm even wearing a diaper now.

451
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,580
My goodness...

452
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,380
How much did you pay?

453
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,330
2.8 million won.

454
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,990
What?

455
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,240
2.8 million won?

456
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,060
Are you out of your mind?

457
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,370
Did they say this would
give you eternal life?

458
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,750
Did I buy it for me?

459
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,940
I bought it for you, Tae Soo!

460
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,340
What the heck are you talking about?

461
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,490
Think about it.

462
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,620
Who suffers if I get sick?

463
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,950
It's you, Tae Soo!

464
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,970
If you got sad because
of your pathetic mother

465
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,160
how would I feel?

466
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,440
When I'm healthy, you're happy too!

467
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,940
Isn't that right?

468
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,800
Where did you buy this?

469
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,820
Where?

470
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,960
Well...

471
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,110
Is it here?

472
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,440
Go.

473
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,400
Hey. Open the door!

474
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,740
Open the door.

475
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,770
Come on!

476
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,570
Were you already packing up
so you could run away?

477
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,720
What's this about?

478
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,350
- Lock the door.
- Yes, sir!

479
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,620
Who are you?

480
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,640
You guys sold this to old people
for 2.8 million won!

481
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,320
- What is it?
- My mother had diarrhea for three days!

482
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,460
What will you do about that?

483
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,740
There must be a misunderstanding.
We are not those kinds of people.

484
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,090
What kind of people are you then?

485
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,720
As you see, we just moved in today.

486
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,480
This is a movie production company.

487
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,170
You are such a liar.

488
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,690
Is this made in Japan or America?

489
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,330
That's a camera. Don't touch it.

490
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,350
Hey, what are you? What do you do?

491
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,980
I am an educated man.

492
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,300
An educated man?

493
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,770
- Then am I an uneducated man?
- Stop.

494
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,910
I am telling you the truth.

495
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,800
I studied film abroad
and I'm a movie director.

496
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,100
We really make movies.

497
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,460
Why are you doing this? Please leave.

498
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,050
Don't even try.

499
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,620
You ripped off old people,
and now what are you up to?

500
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,060
- Guys, start it.
- Yes, sir!

501
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,090
Please stop it!

502
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,980
Please!

503
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,820
What's going on?

504
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,450
Should we call the police?

505
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,810
I shouldn't have come back.

506
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:27,540
If you don't stop, we'll call the police.

507
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,470
Hold it. We don't need to do that.

508
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,480
They'll leave when they see the truth.

509
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,580
What's this?

510
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,730
Hanbat Pictures?

511
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,070
That's the brochure about
our movie company.

512
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,550
- Movie company?
- Yes.

513
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,110
Look at the first page.

514
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,880
This is me. I'm the CEO.

515
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,740
Stanford?

516
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,820
Yes, and I went to Poland.

517
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,420
And I also went to
the Cannes Film Festival.

518
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,800
He's a famous movie director.

519
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,300
Yes... I'm pretty educated.

520
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,100
Oh, man.

521
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,120
Well...

522
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,030
Oh, wow.

523
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,390
I feel like dying from
all of this running.

524
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,700
Mom, it's me.

525
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,300
Can you see me?

526
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,430
<i>Yes.</i>

527
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,590
I will show you some faces.

528
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,960
See if any of them is the swindler.

529
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,280
<i>Okay.</i>

530
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,170
Is he this man?

531
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,700
I've never seen him before.

532
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,860
Yeah?

533
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,240
What about him?

534
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,180
Hello.

535
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,090
<i>It's not him.</i>

536
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,120
The last one. What about him?

537
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,840
What's going on?
Is something in your eye?

538
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,480
Look up.

539
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,200
What about this man?
He's the last one. Look carefully.

540
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,350
Turn him around. Let me see his ear.

541
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,790
His ear?

542
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,120
He'll do well in his later years.
I see wealth in his future.

543
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,730
You will succeed!

544
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,050
Thank you, ma'am.

545
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,690
Why are you reading his fortune?
I asked you to find the swindler.

546
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,820
That's why you don't have
good people around you.

547
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,780
You don't know how to see good people.

548
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,640
Enough. Just hang up.

549
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,440
Oh well.

550
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,530
I didn't do this intentionally.

551
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,210
Okay, anyway.

552
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,540
Keep up the good work, okay?

553
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,950
Sorry about that.

554
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,520
What are you doing?
It's not here.

555
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,840
Yes, sir.

556
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,730
What happened?

557
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,480
Luckily, I got him even though he moved.

558
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,990
I got the money back.

559
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,190
Plus free red ginseng.

560
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,490
This is real stuff, so you can eat it.

561
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:08,880
My goodness! What a relief!

562
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,630
What would I do without you?

563
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,740
Mom...

564
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,640
Please don't be so stubborn.
Come back and live with us.

565
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,430
We left your room just like it is.

566
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,880
Don't say that.
No one welcomes me.

567
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,280
I'm worried about you!

568
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,990
Don't worry about me!

569
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,960
A social worker comes to see me
since I'm a senior living alone.

570
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,070
You're not a senior living alone.

571
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,630
You can live with us.

572
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,930
Don't you miss the kids?

573
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,930
Please acknowledge your daughter-in-law.

574
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,760
And let go of things.

575
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,250
Can't we just live together happily?

576
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,440
You have no idea.

577
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,930
She's wonderfully sweet to you.

578
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,180
But she and I are like oil and water.

579
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,380
Geez...

580
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,050
Have a good day.

581
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,750
<i>[My honey]</i>

582
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,780
He calls me when I'm busy.

583
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,810
Go to the math class
right after the English class.

584
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,810
Okay.

585
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,090
Sung Min!

586
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,980
Why don't you take a grammar class too?

587
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,170
I don't have the time.

588
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,860
I'll work it out for you, okay?

589
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,510
Do it then.

590
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,110
Bye.

591
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,080
Go, go, my son!

592
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,510
Honey, it's me.

593
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,050
I get treated so nicely when I'm sick.

594
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,850
How are you feeling?

595
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,780
I've lived long enough.
It'd be a good death if I died now.

596
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,510
But I guess it's not the time yet.

597
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,700
Your son hates it when you
say things like that.

598
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,990
Are you siding with your husband?

599
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,510
I'm worried about your son.

600
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,830
You sure can talk like an angel.

601
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,920
I'll put the side dishes
in the refrigerator.

602
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,540
Okay.

603
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,510
We still have your room.
You can come back anytime.

604
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,170
Let's live comfortably.

605
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,880
It's good for both of us.

606
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,340
I'm saying this because you don't seem
to live comfortably and I don't either.

607
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,740
What about you?

608
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,590
Is something going on at home?

609
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,150
Did Soo Min get in trouble again?

610
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,270
Tae Soo and I had to go to the school.

611
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:20,780
Stop favoring Sung Min.

612
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,800
Kids are all born differently!

613
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,360
<i>[Wives can help their husbands succeed!]</i>

614
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:39,260
You have nothing to worry about,
except for your mother-in-law.

615
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,310
Your son is smart, your husband
does well, and you live in a nice house.

616
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,390
I feel suffocated when I think
about the two men in my home.

617
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,800
I heard Sung Min placed
first at school again.

618
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,860
He will definitely go
to Seoul University.

619
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,680
Don't say that.

620
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,240
He could lose his place if he
lets his guards down for a second.

621
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,580
He's barely holding that place.

622
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,230
Oh, don't whine.

623
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,680
That doesn't make any of us feel good.

624
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,400
Please.

625
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,510
- Oh, ma'am!
- Ma'am!

626
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,710
Welcome!

627
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,010
You worked really hard.
Didn't you get sick after that?

628
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,880
Wow! It's so beautiful!

629
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,010
It's silk!

630
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,970
It's so soft! I love it!

631
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,390
Do you like them?

632
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,220
Yes!

633
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,570
Everyone did a great job.

634
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,730
Thanks to you, the chairman had
a wonderful 70th birthday.

635
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,110
More than anything

636
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:41,750
I had a chance to witness the
power of One Heart once again.

637
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,020
I was very pleased.

638
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:48,000
In particular, our leader, Kim Eun Ok,
worked very hard.

639
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,490
Please don't say that.

640
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,050
It was like preparing for
my own father's birthday.

641
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,260
All I could think about was
how I could help more.

642
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,150
It's nice that you are busy
volunteering and working for One Heart.

643
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,960
But I wonder if you are neglecting
something important internally.

644
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,210
What's our motto?

645
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,740
- I know.
- I know.

646
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,740
Loyal wives with intelligence,
grace, and healthy bodies.

647
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,730
I've stressed this many times before.

648
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,340
To me, intelligence is the
most important of the three.

649
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,970
Oh, wait a minute.

650
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:26,590
I want to recommend this
book to all of you.

651
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,890
Why don't you read it and
discuss the book together?

652
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,170
Justice.

653
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,630
That's a bestseller.

654
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,760
The title is very intriguing.

655
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,040
You have an eye for books!

656
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,690
Isn't that right?

657
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,010
Of course!

658
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,490
Enjoy reading it.

659
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,900
Did the news reach that far?

660
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,140
Okay.

661
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,160
Let me know if there's anything
the chairman would like.

662
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,210
Come see me at the nightclub.

663
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,010
Okay. Bye.

664
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,150
Huh?

665
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,820
Let's go up.

666
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,760
Thank you so much for
taking the time to come.

667
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,700
She could have picked
a different color for each one.

668
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,550
Is this a uniform or something?

669
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,890
This is a knock-off, right?

670
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,490
In my opinion, her life,
in and of itself, is a knock-off.

671
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,390
She's not even legally married.

672
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,250
But she acts like queen.

673
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,440
I wonder what's in her past.

674
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,370
I heard she and the chairman
use different beds.

675
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,600
Really?

676
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,070
Is it platonic love?

677
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,580
Or is she just torturing him?

678
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,010
- The chairman must be desperate.
- Crazy!

679
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,910
You're writing a novel.

680
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,150
You're having fun too.

681
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,530
Did you hear that the chairman
gave all the men serious homework?

682
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,780
Yes. "Power for a new growth."

683
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,940
Power for a new growth? What's that?

684
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,510
Movies are a cultural industry.

685
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:51,000
Gangster movies, specifically,
are a symbol of power.

686
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,910
Friends for Busan.

687
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,220
The Glory of Family for Leo Soo.

688
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,650
Silla’s Night for Gyeongju.

689
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,330
Mokpo is the Port for Mokpo

690
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,360
Let me ask you something.

691
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,360
What is there for Chungcheong-do?

692
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,600
What do we have?

693
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:08,470
This is the current situation
of our Chungcheong-do!

694
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,500
Oh...

695
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,050
- The movie, Hot Brothers!
- That's right.

696
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:15,460
It's a black and white action film
about gangsters in Daejeon.

697
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,290
Many cities in Korea became famous
because of the movies about them.

698
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:23,710
Now, the time has come
for Chungcheong-do!

699
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,780
I am saying this with confidence.

700
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:30,590
The movie industry is
a high value-added industry.

701
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,190
You may not know exactly what that means.

702
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,190
Let me make it easier
for you to understand.

703
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:42,970
Korea's big companies could not sell
enough cars or cell phones

704
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:47,930
to earn half the profits
that the movie Avatar made.

705
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:52,590
That is the power of culture!
The power of movies!

706
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:03,370
Well said! Well said! Well said!

707
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:05,360
Thank you! Come in!

708
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,000
Come in, sir! Come in!

709
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,610
Come on in! Thank you!

710
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,960
You remember Yoo Sung Special District.
Everyone wanted to go there.

711
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,510
I'm saying we should revive that again.

712
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:21,320
A hotel, a shopping mall,
an amusement park.

713
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,910
And a casino.

714
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,900
A paradise on Earth!

715
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,280
This is... Yoo Sung Multi-Thematic Park.

716
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,930
We have a Chinese investor
who wants to invest 10 billion won.

717
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,520
They wanted Busan or Incheon.

718
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,720
But just barely, I convinced them
to pick Daejeon, the transportation hub.

719
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,680
Tell me how.

720
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,090
Give me details.

721
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,790
You don't see it?

722
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,560
I'm saying bulldoze it and rebuild it.

723
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,570
If we can do this, everyone will see us
as a legitimate corporate group.

724
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,990
Tae Soo.

725
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,600
- Yes, it sounds great.
- What does?

726
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,790
Gi Bum's idea.

727
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:59,480
Not that.

728
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,030
I'm asking if you have something.

729
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,200
I see.

730
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,140
- That is--
- Did you not hear my words?

731
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,980
You didn't hear me?

732
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,410
It's not that. I mean...

733
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,590
Well.

734
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,700
That is...

735
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,360
How about movies?

736
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:20,910
What?

737
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,260
The fists in Chungcheong-do.

738
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,430
You know in Daejeon...

739
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:28,160
It's called Hot Brothers.

740
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,050
That is...

741
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,000
Stop stuttering. Just say it.

742
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,900
I mean, the movie, Friends,
is based in Busan.

743
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,690
"The Glory of Family" is about Yeosu.

744
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,520
"Mok Po is the Port" is about Mokpo.

745
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,230
Silla's Night is based in Gyeongju.

746
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,610
But what about us? Nothing!

747
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,790
Are our fists like water?

748
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:48,180
There are many movies about other cities.

749
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,440
But why is it, that there
are no movies about us?

750
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,150
Don't you agree?

751
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,160
Movies are great.

752
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,020
They could make a movie
based on your life!

753
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,680
So they're making a movie?

754
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,250
Of course.

755
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,140
I went to the promotional meeting.

756
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,680
Look at this. This is the brochure.

757
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,700
What are you doing, Father?

758
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,550
You're here.

759
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,740
Why are you looking at
something like this?

760
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,650
I'm a bit curious.

761
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:50,040
Movies can't compare to a casino.

762
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,700
You should think big.

763
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,780
They don't raise pearls in a small creek.

764
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:57,420
You do nightclubs and a movie. Fine.
But you still remain a gangster.

765
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,530
It's like a gangster
investing in a movie.

766
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:02,800
But a multi-thematic park
is a different story.

767
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,770
You'll become a businessman
that revives the entire city.

768
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:06,930
Because of the casino?

769
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:08,310
Please stop.

770
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:11,240
You need to see the forest,
not the trees.

771
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,810
Is that all you can see?
What about the hotel, or the mall?

772
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,370
And casinos aren't always run by gangs.

773
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,510
A casino is a legitimate
leisure business venture.

774
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:25,030
Chinese tourists will come
like bees looking for honey!

775
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,380
This isn't a small business!

776
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,120
So it's risky.

777
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,740
Don't underestimate the Chinese.

778
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,030
Father.

779
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:34,130
China is the big thing now.

780
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:36,440
You have to get the Chinese to succeed!

781
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,750
This kind of opportunity
will never come again!

782
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,310
It's like a pumpkin rolling
in your hands by itself!

783
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:44,880
This isn't something you can pull off.

784
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,350
Please!

785
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:49,860
No father stops his son from getting
a pumpkin instead of an acorn!

786
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:52,060
Try this.

787
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,770
- This is a special dish.
- Thank you.

788
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:59,630
Our chairman doesn't
bring just anyone here.

789
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:03,250
I see. I received a very
special invitation then.

790
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,710
My mother loves acorn tofu rice,
so I had it a lot when I was little.

791
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,010
Oh.

792
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,490
Wow, it's delicious!

793
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,420
Delicious? It's bitter.

794
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:21,160
Mr. Chairman, I am from Daejeon too.

795
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,530
Please speak casually to me.

796
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,950
Oh!

797
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:25,630
Is that so?

798
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:29,180
You're my local then.

799
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,740
Yes.

800
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:34,520
And I heard you are my
senior in the film industry.

801
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,740
Mr. Yoon,
you didn't need to tell him that.

802
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,460
It's all in the past.

803
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,140
When I first went to Seoul

804
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,240
I worked briefly as
a production manager

805
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,400
for someone I knew that
owned a film company.

806
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,820
Moon Hee's debut film was a hit then.

807
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,560
You mean Black Stream?

808
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,820
Wow.

809
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:00,470
I've met my senior, who even
took a path before me!

810
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,870
It's my honor to meet you!

811
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,160
Don't say that.

812
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,860
There is a movie about
gangsters in Chungcheong-do.

813
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,400
The City of Violence.

814
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,380
The City of Violence!

815
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:15,000
It's directed by Ryu Seung Wan.

816
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,900
Actually, I'm the person who got
him to start making movies.

817
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,020
The name of the city in
that movie is Onsung.

818
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,540
It should be either Onyang, or Yoosung.

819
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:32,090
What's the reason to invent
a city that doesn't exist?

820
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,650
It doesn't exist!

821
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:36,440
That's why I'm making
a movie about Daejeon.

822
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,590
I want to make a good movie
about gangsters in Daejeon!

823
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:44,540
That's what interested our chairman.

824
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,400
I really want this movie to make

825
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,770
people be proud of our Chungcheong-do!

826
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:56,620
Many people in this country
look down on Chungcheong-do!

827
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,350
- Isn't that true?
- Yes.

828
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:00,400
You know what I'm most upset about?

829
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,390
They said it was the era of three Kims.

830
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:05,880
Both YS and DJ became President.
But why not JP?

831
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:11,050
It's all because they think of
Chungcheong-do as a joke!

832
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,080
That's right!

833
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,180
Don't ever underestimate Chungcheong-do!

834
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,090
When the Pope came to Korea

835
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:19,950
He didn't go to
Jeolla-do or Gyeongsang-do.

836
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,450
- He only visited Chungcheong-do!
- Right!

837
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,480
No need to say more!

838
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,090
UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon!

839
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,270
He's also from Chungcheong-do!

840
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,590
Right.

841
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:34,470
When I hear them say,
"idiotic Chungcheong-do"

842
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:36,640
my head opens!

843
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,900
They say we are slow.

844
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,320
That's bullshit.

845
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,030
Is Park Chan Ho slow?

846
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,610
Is Park Se Ri slow?

847
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,090
That's right.

848
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:47,900
The people of Chungcheong-do
are not slow!

849
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,210
Go, Hot Brothers!

850
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,910
May it be a big hit!

851
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,050
A big hit!

852
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,420
May it be a big hit!

853
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,340
What made you want
to invest in the movie?

854
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:06,290
Movies are a cultural industry.

855
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:09,290
Hot Brothers is about Chungcheong-do.

856
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,660
I wanted to make a good movie
about our hometown!

857
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,430
That's why I'm investing in the movie.

858
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,730
May it be a big hit!

859
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:20,030
Big hit! Big hit!

860
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:23,740
I never could've dreamed of
getting it done so fast.

861
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,800
It's all thanks to you.

862
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,630
Let's go toast to it then!

863
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,770
I'll buy you a drink!

864
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:32,200
I have more money than you do!

865
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,110
I have 3 billion won in my bank account.

866
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,150
What?

867
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,940
The chairman does things big.

868
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,710
He already deposited all of the money.

869
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:45,360
I see. That's why all the lawmakers are
treating him like their big brother.

870
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,660
I see.

871
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:50,880
Do you remember what your mom
said when you first met me?

872
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,800
Of course I do.

873
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,300
She said that in your fortune
she sees wealth and success.

874
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:00,440
Does that mean I'll be blessed
with good people from now on?

875
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,130
I should be that blessing to you.

876
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:05,690
Thank you for your kind words.

877
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:10,270
You are from Daejeon.
Where did you go to high school?

878
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,450
I went to Bal Gwang High.

879
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,990
- You went to Bal Gwang?
- Yes.

880
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:15,590
I did too! What year?

881
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,750
I was in the 17th year.

882
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,900
Speak casually to me, Brother.

883
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,760
You are my senior by one year.
I was in the 18th year.

884
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,470
- The 18th year?
- Yes!

885
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,690
Oh, my!

886
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:28,810
But we didn't know each other back then.

887
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:31,570
We just met as adults.
I can't speak casually to you.

888
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:36,380
This is why they say the people of
Chungcheong-do are called gentlemen.

889
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,250
I'm so happy to have met you.

890
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,660
I'm going to get really busy soon.

891
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,290
I will need your help.

892
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:46,670
Gosh, I know nothing.

893
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,530
You'll be the one to
help me out, older brother.

894
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,870
Please don't call me older brother.

895
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:55,140
I'm so glad to meet you.
Who knew we would meet like this?

896
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,870
I hate you. You totally
messed up my office before!

897
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:02,420
- I thought it was a machine gun.
- How on earth--

898
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,410
- I'm so ignorant.
- This is a camera.

899
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,190
- It's expensive.
- I got it.

900
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,070
Excuse me, Big Boss.

901
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:33,380
Chairman Wang wants you to call him back.

902
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,960
What are you?

903
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,610
Are you working for Tae Soo?

904
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:47,730
Of course not!

905
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,310
You planned this all along, didn't you?

906
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:50,480
I didn't!

907
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,320
I would never do that.

908
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,930
Tae Soo. Wait and see.

909
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:10,080
I won't leave you alone.

910
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,600
What's all this?

911
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,930
I can't even eat a cake!

912
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,070
Don't be like that.

913
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:30,090
I respect and love you so much, my dear!

914
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,800
You're being cheesy.

915
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,420
Dad, you look great in the picture.

916
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,470
Wow.

917
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:39,750
Can I tell my friends that
you are a movie investor?

918
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,930
Of course!

919
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:44,860
Wait. If the movie becomes a hit,
do we get to go to award ceremonies?

920
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,380
I guess the director gets to go.

921
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,920
I think the investor receives
the award for the best picture.

922
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,950
What? Then are you going to be TV?

923
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,680
I felt something right here. Feel it.

924
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,500
What are you doing in
front of the teenagers?

925
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,800
What's wrong with that?

926
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,880
- Give your speech! Practice.
- Great!

927
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,670
We didn't even start
making the movie yet!

928
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,830
Yoon Tae Soo! Yoon Tae Soo!

929
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,190
Stop it.

930
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,740
Yoon Tae Soo!

931
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,060
Okay.

932
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,840
Let us hear from Yoon Tae Soo,
who just won the award for best picture.

933
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,430
Thank you, thank you.

934
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,290
Thank you very much.

935
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:28,070
Ladies...

936
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,880
Gentlemen?

937
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,490
It's a beautiful night.

938
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,880
Actually, there were so many good movies.

939
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,650
I thought we had no chance.

940
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:47,990
They say a pheasant catches an eagle.
I can't believe I'm receiving this award.

941
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:51,170
Actually, I am nothing.

942
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,560
I am just a gangster.

943
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,730
The director set the table.

944
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:00,260
All I did was sit at the table
and eat with my spoon.

945
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:05,100
Lastly, I have some people
I want to thank.

946
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,560
My wife, whom I love dearly.

947
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,820
She is...

948
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,530
What's your name?

949
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,180
Kim Eun Ok!

950
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:22,930
And my puppies, Sung Min and Soo Min!

951
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:26,140
I want to give my glory to all of them!

952
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:35,990
Hey!

953
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:38,450
Stop!

954
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:42,700
You are a rat! Rat!

955
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:48,750
How dare you steal my money?

956
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,250
What was it, just over 10 million won
that he stole more than three years ago?

957
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:55,860
Yes. You know he doesn't
forget when it comes to money.

958
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,370
He's been a bit edgy since
he invested in that movie.

959
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:04,120
He spent 3 billion won, all at once.

960
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,970
Now that I'm old,
my heart has become tender.

961
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,100
I would have done more if I were younger.

962
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:17,440
He ran away with my money. How dare he...

963
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,460
Should I deal with him?

964
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,370
Leave it.

965
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:24,690
You shouldn't do this kind of thing.
You're meant to be big.

966
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,190
Mr. Son was quick to take that money.

967
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:31,810
He said he wanted us, not because of me,
but because of you.

968
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:34,770
He's just saying that.

969
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:36,840
I'm doing this because I trust you.

970
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,730
Tae Soo, this can change our lives.

971
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,390
Work to death.

972
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:44,610
Your life depends on it.

973
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,180
Yes, sir.

974
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,940
The chairman is really
putting his trust in you.

975
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,260
Oh, man! I feel burdened.

976
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,140
But Boss, will our names
be in the credits?

977
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,880
How hard can that be?

978
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,460
Mr. Son is my school senior!

979
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,250
Really? Everything is going so well!

980
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:07,820
- I know.
- Should I be an extra in the movie?

981
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,480
I can be an actor!

982
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,760
Then go to talk to him!

983
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,220
What about me?
If you do it, I'll do it too!

984
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,910
I can't!

985
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,380
Why don't all of us do it?

986
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,070
That's great! Okay!

987
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,270
No way.

988
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:24,590
I don't think we can.

989
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:25,920
Let's go.

990
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,700
We can't.

991
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,090
Flying kick!

992
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,270
Huh?

993
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,480
Where is everyone?

994
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:50,790
Boss, there's nothing here.

995
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:52,580
It's all empty.

996
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,840
What?

997
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:11,580
<i>The number you called does not exist.</i>

998
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:16,470
What? Did they run away?

999
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:17,790
Boss.

1000
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:21,250
Didn't the chairman
deposit three billion won?

1001
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,940
I'll kill them all...

1002
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,800
Go find him!

1003
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:32,090
Now!
