1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,718
- What are you doing?
- What about you?

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,100
I warned you. I told you to keep
your daughter away from my son.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,335
What are you talking about you?
Your son was already doing music.

4
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:18,721
You didn't know that, as his mother?

5
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:20,474
Okay, bring it on!

6
00:00:20,474 --> 00:00:24,434
Your ex-husband and your daughter
are crapping all over us!

7
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:26,791
Crapping all over you?

8
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:31,045
Okay, bring it on!
I'm not scared!

9
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:32,335
Bring it on!

10
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:35,342
You!

11
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:36,975
Stop!

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,621
Let go of my hair!

13
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:42,100
You let go!

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,350
What's wrong with you?

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,578
Do Kyung!

16
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:47,000
Hey! Let go!

18
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:53,728
Honey!

19
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:56,353
Are you okay, Honey?

20
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,801
Calm down, Honey!

21
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:05,055
Let go!

22
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:06,317
I said let go!

23
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:07,731
You let go first.

24
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:10,566
Let go, both of you! Calm down!

25
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:12,965
Let go on the count of three!

26
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:15,950
One, two, three!

27
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,671
Three!

28
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:19,947
You!

29
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,902
What's wrong with you?
This is embarrassing!

30
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:24,463
She won't let go!

31
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:25,668
What about you?

32
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,373
Eun Ok, please stop.
Do Kyung is a patient!

33
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:30,891
Oh, Gi Bum!

34
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,487
Your nose, your nose!

35
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:34,522
My nose? What about it? Huh?

36
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:35,855
Ah!

37
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:38,418
Blood! From both my nostrils!

38
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:39,612
Geez!

39
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,245
Let go!

40
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:45,362
Oh, my nose! My nose!

41
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:46,581
Let go!

42
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:48,706
Gi Bum! Oh, no!

43
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:52,760
Gi Bum, don't die! Don't die, Gi Bum!

44
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,472
This is bad! What should we do?

45
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:57,472
- Ah!
- My goodness!

46
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:59,245
Don't die!

47
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:00,245
Gi Bum!

48
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,840
My nose is bleeding!

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,941
Louder...

50
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:04,941
Oh no!

51
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:10,132
It finally stopped.

52
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:12,388
Why did you try to stop us?

53
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:14,852
I was going to battle it out this time.

54
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:17,540
How dare she hit my precious daughter?

55
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,701
If only my arm was in shape...

56
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:23,131
That's right. Is your arm okay?

57
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:24,189
Huh?

58
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,698
I guess it got better after
I warmed up my body a bit.

59
00:02:30,698 --> 00:02:33,217
Were you just pretending?

60
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:36,328
Stay still. I need to wipe your face off.

61
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:39,646
Geez. Your face is covered with blood!

62
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:41,068
Geez.

63
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:42,814
Blow.

64
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:46,604
Oh, Hyun Jee.

65
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:50,544
Oh... where have you been?

66
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:54,207
I was with Sung Min.

67
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:57,284
All of this happened because of me.

68
00:02:57,284 --> 00:02:59,364
I'm sorry, Mom, Dad.

69
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:02,479
Don't say that.
You did nothing wrong.

70
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,200
Right. The adults were wrong.
We ruined your show.

71
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,804
Offering a show to
the public is a great thing!

72
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:14,463
Your singing totally mesmerized me.

73
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:20,550
By the way, Hyun Jee...

74
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,789
Do you want to do music for film?

75
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:25,971
Why music for film, specifically?

76
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:31,429
Oh... you didn't know that I became the
CEO of a movie production company.

77
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:32,981
Never mind.

78
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:36,942
You are a beauty just like your mom.

79
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:38,925
Do you want to be
in a movie with your mom?

80
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:44,675
No, thank you. I retired a long time ago.

81
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:48,044
Why not? You'd be good in action movies.
You can fight.

82
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:51,352
Let go! Let go! Ah!

83
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,987
It's going to be a hit!

84
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,811
Stop it already.

85
00:03:57,811 --> 00:03:59,711
You should go home.

86
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,602
I'm good. I can go later.

87
00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:03,659
I meant she and I need to go home.

88
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,526
I see...

89
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:06,961
That's right.

90
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,675
Since when?

91
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:13,175
Let's talk later.

92
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:15,540
No. Answer me now.

93
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,550
Mom...

94
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,251
Did Hyun Jee talk you
into doing it together?

95
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:22,447
It's not like that.
It has nothing to do with her.

96
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:26,067
You were a good student. Why are
you suddenly doing strange things?

97
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:28,310
Do you know how I feel now?

98
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,242
It feels like the sky is falling down.

99
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:34,235
This is big.

100
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:38,552
Well... calm down.
Let's hear what he has to say first.

101
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:39,983
I don't want to hear it.

102
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:42,310
Stop that strange stuff
and focus on studying.

103
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,896
If you study hard for just one more
year, you'll go to Seoul University--

104
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:46,997
Stop talking about Seoul University!

105
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:52,555
I won't go to Seoul University.
I don't want to.

106
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,754
You have no interest in what
I like, or what I want to do.

107
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:03,822
You always talk about Seoul University.
Have you ever asked me about my dreams?

108
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,392
I kept it a secret all this time,
but I won't do that anymore.

109
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,507
I will keep doing music.

110
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:15,639
You've gone insane.

111
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,093
Okay, I'll help you come to your senses.

112
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,889
Honey!

113
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,975
- Mom...
- Step aside!

114
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:26,694
Mom.

115
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:27,757
I said, step aside.

116
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:29,451
Please don't do this.

117
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:30,687
Stay away. You'll get hurt!

118
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:32,483
- Mom!
- Go!

119
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:35,357
No, don't do that!

120
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:38,791
Tae Soo! Tae Soo!

121
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:40,495
Oh no!

122
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:42,396
I said step aside!

123
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,398
What are you doing?

124
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:04,108
Give me that.

125
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:05,377
I don't want to.

126
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,843
Give me that.

127
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:09,846
I don't want to!

128
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:12,218
You don't see what's going on here?

129
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:14,415
My cell phone!

130
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,788
I'll call the police!

131
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:18,060
Soo Min, go to your room!

132
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,718
Why are you doing this to me?
You pay for it!

133
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:23,444
Stop it! What are you all
doing to your own family?

134
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:24,788
Mom, can you stay out of it?

135
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:27,716
Am I not allowed to talk?
You don't respect your mother?

136
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:28,783
It's not that!

137
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:30,319
You stay out of it!

138
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,084
What about my phone?

139
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:33,154
You stay out of it!

140
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:34,161
It's all your fault!

141
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,255
You made it worse!

142
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:36,380
Calm down!

143
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,812
How can I calm down?

144
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:40,466
Stop, stop! Geez!

145
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,141
Do you really have to
do this in front of me?

146
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:45,726
I won't live much longer!

147
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:50,593
Geez, where is the Grim Reaper?
Please come get me!

148
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:17,935
<i>Just in case, here's a
song to cheer you up.</i>

149
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:33,973
Geez, you are handsome and smart...

150
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,579
And you are good at music!

151
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:38,806
Who's your dad?

152
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:43,996
Just scold me like Mom did.

153
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:46,268
Why would I scold you?

154
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:50,214
I totally understand you, Sung Min.

155
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:52,370
You are not allowed to
do what you want to do.

156
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,777
And you have to study,
which is not what you want.

157
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:56,777
It must be really hard.

158
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:03,186
However... I understand what
Mom is going through too.

159
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:09,129
Now I understand what it means to
say that everything has its own time.

160
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:14,244
Your life can get hard if you don't
study when it's time to study.

161
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:22,245
Give me some time to think.

162
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,114
Okay.

163
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:29,192
I will let Mom know.

164
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:34,323
Cheer up! Up here.

165
00:10:00,503 --> 00:10:04,553
Sugar is the best thing
when you are stressed out.

166
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:20,513
The song you sent me was pretty good.

167
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:22,480
Just pretty good?

168
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,673
Not amazingly good or shockingly good?

169
00:10:26,902 --> 00:10:30,870
Yes, it was amazing, shockingly great!

170
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:35,313
It comforted me.

171
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:44,201
But I'm not sure.

172
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:47,500
When I think about myself,
I just can't give up music.

173
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,928
But for my mom,
and the rest of my family...

174
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:53,905
I feel like I should focus wholeheartedly
on studying for one more year.

175
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:57,813
Then do that. You won't lose music
just because you stopped for one year.

176
00:10:57,849 --> 00:11:02,264
But without music, I don't feel
like studying, or even eating.

177
00:11:02,264 --> 00:11:04,232
Everything I see or hear is meaningless!

178
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:06,600
Then do what you want to do!

179
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,552
Why do you agonize when you've
already made your decision?

180
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:14,125
Did you know Sung Min was
doing music, Director?

181
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,206
Pardon me?

182
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,985
He often skipped cram school
to perform on the street.

183
00:11:17,985 --> 00:11:19,547
Did you know that?

184
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:21,874
That was...

185
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:25,313
Sung Min promised to keep his rank so...

186
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:26,730
Director!

187
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:31,284
You asked for his picture so you
could put it on a plank card.

188
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,879
You promised to teach him
as if you were his parent.

189
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,289
Parents wouldn't do that.

190
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:40,356
You can't do that when he's only one year
away from his college entrance exam.

191
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:41,956
I'm very sorry.

192
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:43,658
I'll make it short.

193
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,426
I cannot allow him to
skip cram school again.

194
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:49,605
Don't tell Sung Min that I was here.

195
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:53,860
And tell the front desk to text
me every time Sun Min comes here.

196
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:58,241
I'm sorry if was rude.

197
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:09,557
Kyung Mee, I can't come
to One Heart today--

198
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:12,110
What?

199
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,212
<i>Ladies dog fight! That's funny!</i>

200
00:12:14,212 --> 00:12:17,010
<i>I've seen her before.
Isn't she an actress?</i>

201
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,253
<i>Isn't she the chairwoman of One Heart?</i>

202
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:20,807
<i>One Heart? What's that?</i>

203
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:24,878
<i>It's a volunteer organization, but
it's just a bunch of gangsters' wives.</i>

204
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,528
You know...

205
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:31,519
One Heart's reputation, for which
we have worked very hard, was ruined...

206
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,168
By violence.

207
00:12:34,168 --> 00:12:37,756
The chairman would be very proud
of you if he found out, right?

208
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,320
Ma'am, please calm down and sit...

209
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,710
Put it down!

210
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,034
Sure.

211
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:50,251
I have no right to drink this water.

212
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:54,636
This kind of incident happened
as soon as I resigned.

213
00:12:54,636 --> 00:12:56,292
Absence of discipline!

214
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,511
Absence of leadership!

215
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,495
That's the only conclusion I can come to!

216
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:04,918
Please don't say that, Madam.

217
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:08,275
We were impulsive.

218
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:10,952
No, it's all my fault.

219
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:12,143
Yes, it is.

220
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:14,163
That's what I'm talking about.

221
00:13:14,163 --> 00:13:19,210
It's my fault that I didn't do anything
about what you did to Do Kyung.

222
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:24,509
If I had corrected the problem then,
this wouldn't have happened.

223
00:13:25,883 --> 00:13:29,735
How will you
take responsibility for this?

224
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:33,442
I've already resigned from my
honorary chairwoman's position.

225
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:37,360
Now it's your turn to decide.

226
00:13:38,488 --> 00:13:41,133
Will you choose the
big cause for One Heart?

227
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:44,041
Will you hold onto your
position for your own glory?

228
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,466
You choose.

229
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:04,022
Right. It is all my fault.

230
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:07,321
And I understand what you're saying.

231
00:14:08,552 --> 00:14:10,274
I will...

232
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:15,424
I will resign from the One Heart
chairwoman position.

233
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:20,434
Oh... I see.

234
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:28,393
Okay then... As of now...

235
00:14:28,393 --> 00:14:32,393
Both positions, Honorary Chairwoman,
and Chairwoman, are vacant.

236
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:37,051
We will elect a new chairwoman right now,
as this is an urgent situation.

237
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:41,453
All of you are eligible
to run in the election.

238
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:42,899
And also...

239
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,828
You will choose your next
chairwoman all on your own!

240
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:50,578
What the heck is going on?

241
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:53,072
Are we really having an election?

242
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:57,422
We only have 20 members. But now we
have an emergency planning committee.

243
00:14:57,422 --> 00:15:00,053
My goodness!

244
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:03,850
I understand how you feel,
but you should have held it together.

245
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,076
It's okay. I don't have the time
to work for One Heart now anyway.

246
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:10,711
You can have the chairwoman title.

247
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:13,759
But you're basically a
servant, just doing chores.

248
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,235
Do you really mean it?

249
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:19,618
What do you mean?

250
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,774
It sounds like you have
no desire for the title.

251
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:24,282
And how does that interest you?

252
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:26,745
I'm thinking of running.

253
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:34,470
You better do something about your wife.

254
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,350
She's totally marred the
company reputation.

255
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:40,200
Did she fight alone?

256
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,802
Enough.

257
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,201
What about your smart boy?

258
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:48,273
Hyun Jee wants to be a singer anyway.

259
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:51,624
But Sung Min was your only hope.
He's the bookworm!

260
00:15:53,772 --> 00:15:54,803
Good morning.

261
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:56,827
Oh, sit down.

262
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:03,578
Did you read the script? How was it?

263
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:05,851
Oh... that is...

264
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:08,932
Polish it up a little.

265
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:13,212
Make it a bit more dramatic and sensual.
Wouldn't that be enough?

266
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,212
Just a bit?

267
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:17,182
You can't turn a watermelon
into a pumpkin by fixing it up a bit.

268
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:20,855
Why don't you totally change it?

269
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,042
Don't just work on the surface.

270
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:26,096
A gangster movie is about action anyway.

271
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:28,509
There's no point in delaying it.

272
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,167
Just worry about whom to cast.

273
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,946
You can't move into
a house if isn't built well.

274
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:38,232
Tae Soo, I'm the CEO here.

275
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:40,357
Listen to your boss.

276
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:44,015
Don't take your stress out on them.

277
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:46,198
What did you say?

278
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:48,750
I've had enough of you.

279
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:53,033
Are we here to discuss the script?

280
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,001
What's wrong with you?

281
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:58,376
Whether it's criticism or blame,
let's talk about the real issue here.

282
00:16:58,376 --> 00:17:03,692
How can you make a movie when you just
waste your time arguing over nothing?

283
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:04,953
Yes.

284
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:06,148
Okay.

285
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:11,003
Everyone, follow me.

286
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,275
Geez, we are all dead because of you.

287
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:19,498
What did I do? Was I wrong?

288
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,626
This car is for you to use.

289
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:28,799
Are you really giving it to us?

290
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,596
Have you always been
fooled by people throughout life?

291
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:33,894
You're going to get big.
You better travel safely.

292
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:37,442
I'm not a stingy man, like someone
who might have always criticized you.

293
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:47,548
Bub Gyu, give it to them.

294
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:48,900
Yes, Boss.

295
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,105
Here.

296
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,377
What is this?

297
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,213
You need money.

298
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:59,893
You don't need to watch your spending.
But watch your mouth.

299
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,224
You don't need to
always speak up, okay?

300
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:07,678
Don't spend more than 7,000 won per meal.
You could get billed.

301
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:10,380
Hey, don't be pathetic.

302
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:18,115
What does a CEO do?

303
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:21,419
Isn't this something you do as the CEO?

304
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:24,372
We need to talk.

305
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:26,007
Come here.

306
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:28,775
Why do we have to come here?

307
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,327
I told you, I'm risking
my life for this movie.

308
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:32,976
But why are you doing this?

309
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:36,269
You want to take it away from me
because it's something I'm doing?

310
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:39,252
I was the one who got into movies.

311
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,903
Who showed you
"A Better Tomorrow" and "The Killer"?

312
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:44,372
You watched them because of me.

313
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:47,311
Stop talking nonsense.
What's the real reason?

314
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:53,618
You know Do Kyung used to be an
actress, and that acting was her dream.

315
00:18:53,618 --> 00:18:56,528
I want to make her dream
come true with this movie...

316
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:59,307
And get back together with her.

317
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:01,316
We're not making a home video!

318
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:04,959
Even famous filmmakers fail all the time.

319
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:07,356
If you put you life down on this movie,
it still will not be enough.

320
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:09,537
You can't use this for
personal goals.

321
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:12,373
Stop saying you put
your life down for it. That bothers me!

322
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:14,546
Then you put down your life for it too!

323
00:19:15,644 --> 00:19:17,088
Geez!

324
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:20,428
What's this talk about life? Is someone's
life in trouble or something?

325
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:21,991
Brother.

326
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:25,227
Why do you always scare people
by showing up out of the blue?

327
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:28,528
Your staff said you would be up here.

328
00:19:28,528 --> 00:19:32,000
I have big news.

329
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,583
You better take
your heart medication first.

330
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:40,729
I don't want to hear it. Just go.

331
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:42,750
You don't want to hear about Mr. Son?

332
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:46,238
That man...

333
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:49,426
Someone saw him.

334
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:52,309
What?

335
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:04,651
Why are you overreacting?

336
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,019
Well...

337
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:12,967
Director Baek was possessed by
Mr. Son's spirit, you know.

338
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:17,006
Well... keep going then.

339
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:26,981
That swindler came back to life,
and he's running around now.

340
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,369
What...

341
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,338
He came back to life?

342
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:37,560
He wasn't dead. He's alive.

343
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,574
Geez, what does that mean?

344
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,763
Wait and see.

345
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:47,804
I will catch him, and I'll twist his neck
and put a handcuff on his hand.

346
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:52,365
You better not think about
catching him on your own.

347
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:56,903
If anything happened to him,
you'd be my first suspects.

348
00:20:57,794 --> 00:21:00,164
I will catch him!

349
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:05,905
It's really good.
It's melting in my mouth!

350
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:07,016
I know.

351
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,237
- It's good we came.
- I know.

352
00:21:10,554 --> 00:21:14,420
Kyung Mee, can we really do this?

353
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,788
What if Eun Ok finds out?

354
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:18,903
Did we commit a sin?

355
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,080
We were invited here.

356
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,093
It would be strange if we came,
having not been invited over.

357
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:30,191
Think about your husband's future.
You need this.

358
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,825
Eat. It's good.

359
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:34,997
So good.

360
00:21:34,997 --> 00:21:38,923
I have a red from a 1999 vintage!

361
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,450
Wow...

362
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:46,925
Do you like the casual
Cheongdam-dong style party?

363
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:48,300
How is it, Kyung Mee?

364
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,182
I love it! Cordon...

365
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:56,133
Whatever it is you went to...

366
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:58,942
Your food is on a whole different level.

367
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,048
Thank you.

368
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:04,102
By the way, why did you invite us here?

369
00:22:04,102 --> 00:22:07,384
Well... so I can impress you?

370
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:12,890
You've only tried to control your son.
You haven't tried to understand him.

371
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,573
Are you really his mother?

372
00:22:17,657 --> 00:22:19,663
What did Sung Min say?

373
00:22:20,392 --> 00:22:22,688
Tae Soo talked to him...

374
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:25,439
He said he needed time to think.

375
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:29,534
I can hear my grandson's heart hurting.

376
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:32,165
My heart is hurting too.

377
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:35,665
What will you do about my screen?
It's not working.

378
00:22:35,665 --> 00:22:36,755
Soo Min.

379
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,915
I was left out in my class chat.

380
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:40,203
Stop it already!

381
00:22:40,203 --> 00:22:42,828
Sung Min caused the problem,
but why are you upset with me?

382
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,056
- Don't be rude!
- Whatever! Why me?

383
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:47,897
It's annoying!

384
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:50,910
Look at that.

385
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:56,105
My goodness. We spoiled her...

386
00:22:57,285 --> 00:22:59,222
Please eat more.

387
00:22:59,222 --> 00:23:02,772
Can you really swallow
food in this situation?

388
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:05,833
You're carefree.

389
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:11,515
You were all about your son's schooling.
But what came out of that?

390
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:15,144
Geez. It's frustrating.

391
00:23:16,449 --> 00:23:20,519
I have never been so
frustrated before!

392
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:23,420
Geez.

393
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,364
Sun Young.

394
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:51,034
I can't talk to you right now.
I'm in the middle of something.

395
00:23:51,753 --> 00:23:54,428
That's okay.

396
00:23:55,678 --> 00:23:59,787
I just wanted to see if I
could have a drink with you.

397
00:23:59,787 --> 00:24:04,007
I'm so sorry. I'll buy drinks next time!

398
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:07,365
You had a dream like that?

399
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:10,138
Kyung Mee! Be quiet...

400
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:12,277
Is Kyung Mee there too?

401
00:24:12,277 --> 00:24:15,760
If it's Eun Ok, tell her to come.
Let's drink some wine together.

402
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,361
Wasn't that Do Kyung's voice?

403
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:20,752
Are you all together now?

404
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:24,551
I'm sorry. I'll explain
everything tomorrow.

405
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:26,877
Geez, my hands are shaking.

406
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:30,273
Why didn't you tell her to come?

407
00:24:50,342 --> 00:24:52,881
This is great!

408
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,912
Hello, everyone!

409
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:56,928
Oh!

410
00:24:56,981 --> 00:24:59,694
What brings you here, Director Baek?

411
00:24:59,694 --> 00:25:04,894
Manager Chang told me you were
all here, so I came to say hello.

412
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:07,811
Manager Chang, let's take them out.

413
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:09,063
Yes.

414
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:10,853
Take one please.

415
00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:14,211
It's a special gift from Director Baek.

416
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:16,813
Please sit down. Please.

417
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,101
Thank you.

418
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:24,161
What are you doing?

419
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:26,827
I heard about the election.

420
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:28,854
I thought you could use my help.

421
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:39,861
Director Baek, isn't this cheating?

422
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:42,211
You're causing trouble for us.

423
00:25:43,686 --> 00:25:45,653
Don't worry about that.

424
00:25:45,653 --> 00:25:50,307
The ladies of One Heart are
representatives of Choong Shim.

425
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:53,272
As the CEO of Choong Shim Pictures,
and Choong Shim Construction

426
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:56,925
I must take care of our ladies!

427
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,008
You're the best!

428
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:26,646
I feel good.

429
00:26:26,646 --> 00:26:29,357
Thank you, Director Baek!

430
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:33,384
You're welcome! I'll take care
of your skin from now on!

431
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:34,923
Take care!

432
00:26:34,923 --> 00:26:37,838
Bye! One Heart!

433
00:26:39,854 --> 00:26:41,941
Great. Let's go in.

434
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:49,359
Oh!

435
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,096
Oh, man! You're drunk!

436
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:58,560
I thought you were fine. Is there any
medicine that will make you sober?

437
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,789
Just sit down. Stop being dramatic.

438
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:03,753
Okay.

439
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,604
Unexpectedly enough, you made me proud.

440
00:27:09,604 --> 00:27:11,955
I didn't even ask you to do that.

441
00:27:12,648 --> 00:27:15,788
You told me to prove myself with actions.
This is just the beginning.

442
00:27:16,873 --> 00:27:19,789
You should have done that sooner.

443
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:33,257
When I heard Hyun Jee singing the
other night, I thought of our old days.

444
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:34,671
The swap song.

445
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:38,171
Do you still remember that?

446
00:27:41,124 --> 00:27:45,402
<i>Let's go through the jungle.</i>

447
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:48,994
<i>Let's crawl through the jungle.</i>

448
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:52,951
<i>When we come across a "swap"</i>

449
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:55,564
<i>You'll see crocodiles!</i>

450
00:27:55,564 --> 00:27:57,758
<i>Crocodiles!</i>

451
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:04,852
Hyun Jee always said
swap instead of swamp.

452
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:14,709
Back then... the three
of us were pretty good.

453
00:28:17,974 --> 00:28:19,398
We were.

454
00:28:27,657 --> 00:28:32,407
Hyun Jee was...
always a fantastic dancer.

455
00:28:35,228 --> 00:28:36,900
Do you remember this?

456
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:41,609
Hyun Jee's favorite dance.

457
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:47,413
Oola Oola... Oola Oola.

458
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:49,508
Oola Oola.

459
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,181
Oola Oola.

460
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:55,722
Isn't Dad dancing?

461
00:28:55,722 --> 00:28:57,779
It's more fun dancing together.

462
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,236
I am. Of course I am.

463
00:29:00,236 --> 00:29:02,875
Oola Oola.

464
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:09,163
You are cute!

465
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:13,353
Remember Hyun Jee's kiss massage?

466
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:17,443
Grab your cheeks like this...
and kiss ten times.

467
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:20,559
Yeah...

468
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:33,211
Are you okay?

469
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:35,112
I guess I'm drunk.

470
00:29:35,112 --> 00:29:39,108
No, you aren't drunk!
You're totally sober!

471
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:42,769
I want to sit. My legs are giving out.

472
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:44,965
Okay...

473
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,130
Water.

474
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,567
Water!

475
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:07,446
By the way... the kiss massage.
How do you do it?

476
00:30:07,446 --> 00:30:09,387
I can't remember very well.

477
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:12,083
How can you forget that?

478
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:14,585
Come over here.

479
00:30:16,111 --> 00:30:18,188
Grab the cheeks...

480
00:30:18,188 --> 00:30:19,865
Hey.

481
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:32,674
Do Kyung, what are you doing?

482
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:35,717
Are you sleeping?

483
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:38,540
Do Kyung? Do Kyung...

484
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:43,151
Do Kyung... please...

485
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:47,239
Do Kyung, please wake up! Do Kyung!

486
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:57,182
I don't even wish for ten kisses.
Just one...

487
00:30:57,877 --> 00:30:59,490
Just once...

488
00:31:07,605 --> 00:31:08,816
Honey!

489
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:11,898
Oh, my husband is here!

490
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:16,270
You're so handsome that I can
recognize you from a mile away!

491
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,031
I'll die from running.

492
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:20,797
Why did you drink so much?

493
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,917
Just...

494
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,006
Because I'm in a good mood!

495
00:31:27,006 --> 00:31:29,940
What? Did something happen?

496
00:31:33,982 --> 00:31:37,347
How's your work at the movie company?

497
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:40,560
Is Baek Gi Bum bearable?

498
00:31:49,795 --> 00:31:53,240
It's true that life is in vain.

499
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:59,597
See how I got betrayed by my friends,
and tried to get comfort from alcohol?

500
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,403
When you proposed to me...

501
00:32:03,403 --> 00:32:08,560
You said you'd be loyal, no matter what.
Do you remember that?

502
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:12,267
I loved how that sounded.

503
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:15,334
Loyalty is the best thing
for a gangster to have.

504
00:32:15,922 --> 00:32:17,776
Of course it is!

505
00:32:20,766 --> 00:32:22,012
Honey.

506
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,326
Thank you.

507
00:32:30,318 --> 00:32:33,364
Thank you for accepting Sung Min
as your son and raising him.

508
00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:37,439
No one else could compare to that.

509
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,734
- You really are amazing.
- Huh?

510
00:32:42,346 --> 00:32:44,929
What are you talking about?

511
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,409
No matter what, Sung Min is my son!

00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,881
If you say that again, I will...

513
00:32:53,951 --> 00:32:55,127
Scold you.

514
00:32:57,432 --> 00:32:59,243
Drink.

515
00:33:00,006 --> 00:33:01,891
Okay. Here.

516
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,576
Okay! My amazing husband. Let's drink!

517
00:33:08,407 --> 00:33:09,944
You need a cup.

518
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:11,650
Sir, bring us a cup--

519
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,288
I have this. Toast!

520
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:19,736
Oh, good!

521
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:22,051
Good, my husband.

522
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:25,034
You are on my side, no matter what.

523
00:33:25,034 --> 00:33:27,776
That's needless to say.

524
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:30,366
You're not on someone else's side, right?

525
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:33,948
Well, I already told you.

526
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:41,156
I have your back.
So don't worry about anything.

527
00:33:41,156 --> 00:33:46,505
If anyone bothers you,
I'll bite off his nose!

528
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:49,388
Wow, I feel stronger now.

529
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:52,267
Cheer up, Yoon Tae Soo!

530
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:55,055
Cheer up, Kim Eun Ok!

531
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:01,306
<i>Let's go through the jungle.</i>

532
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:05,705
<i>Let's crawl through the jungle.</i>

533
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:10,047
<i>When you see a "swap"</i>

534
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,938
<i>You'll see crocodiles!</i>

535
00:34:12,938 --> 00:34:14,786
<i>Crocodiles!</i>

536
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:23,626
Smells good.

537
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:29,545
Cheer up!

538
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:54,768
What is it?

539
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:57,936
Oh... it's nothing.

540
00:34:57,936 --> 00:34:59,554
Are we already home?

541
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:02,811
No. Sleep more.

542
00:35:37,362 --> 00:35:43,027
I will close my speech with a proverb
that I've been cherishing in my heart.

543
00:35:43,027 --> 00:35:44,773
Put it into action!

544
00:35:44,773 --> 00:35:47,931
Your dream comes true when
you put them into action!

545
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,894
Gorgeous. Gorgeous.

546
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:56,436
That was an impressive candidacy speech.

547
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:03,454
Is there anyone else who wants
to run in the election?

548
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:05,492
I'm sure there isn't anyone.

549
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:07,273
Then...

550
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:11,764
Lee Do Kyung is the sole candidate
for the chairwoman position--

551
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:13,452
Wait a moment.

552
00:36:13,452 --> 00:36:15,581
I would like to run for the election too.

553
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:19,657
You would, Eun Ok?

554
00:36:22,105 --> 00:36:24,820
Then, why don't you give us a speech too?

555
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:40,592
For the past five years,
since the birth of One Heart...

556
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:43,199
I was the Chairwoman of One Heart.

557
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:48,750
I had praises. I also made many mistakes.

558
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,760
I know I'm lacking.

559
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,943
That's why I thought of stepping down.

560
00:36:55,943 --> 00:37:00,199
However, after some serious thinking,
I came to a conclusion.

561
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,503
No parents would give up their children.

562
00:37:03,503 --> 00:37:06,920
Just like that,
I can't give up One Heart.

563
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:14,826
More than anything, I believe...

564
00:37:14,826 --> 00:37:20,400
The members of One Heart will not
be blown away by a cosmetics gift set.

565
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,440
That's what I want to prove.

566
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:30,349
Then... according to the order
of candidacy submission...

567
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:35,199
Candidate number one, Lee Do Kyung!

568
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,456
Number two, Kim Eun Ok.

569
00:37:38,273 --> 00:37:42,304
The election is in three days.

570
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:46,056
We'll have a new chairwoman then.

571
00:37:47,284 --> 00:37:52,266
Wow, Director Baek! Congratulations!

572
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:55,132
Wow, you came to visit us yourself.

573
00:37:55,132 --> 00:37:57,983
I don't need that kind of thing.
Put it outside. Outside, outside!

574
00:37:57,983 --> 00:38:00,664
Now you are the CEO of a
movie production company!

575
00:38:00,664 --> 00:38:03,742
How can I just sit around doing nothing?

576
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:07,570
These are the people who will
make you a billionaire, like me!

577
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,782
Nice to meet you!

578
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,719
What are you doing here?

579
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:16,972
Hold on, Tae Soo.

580
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:20,746
Director Cho came to congratulate us.
He also introduced us to an investor.

581
00:38:21,588 --> 00:38:23,135
Are you crazy?

582
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:26,353
How can you let just anyone in here?

583
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:29,306
Well, Director Yoon.

584
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:33,030
Long time, no see. I've missed you.

585
00:38:34,586 --> 00:38:37,195
What did I say would happen
if we ever saw each other?

586
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:39,545
Huh?

587
00:38:39,545 --> 00:38:42,465
Geez, I forgot.

588
00:38:42,465 --> 00:38:45,686
Please understand. I'm an idiot.

589
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:49,175
This idiot is going home then.

590
00:38:58,056 --> 00:39:01,550
What was that?
That was my guest.

591
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:05,219
He's a swindler, not a guest.

592
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:08,945
If he came to invest,
he's our guest, no matter what he is!

593
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:14,840
Be careful, Tae Soo.
You are going to be full of regret.

594
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,577
Who's that guy next to Gi Bum?

595
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:27,197
He's Director Cho Dong Choon,
from Gunseol Group.

596
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,175
What the heck...

597
00:39:29,175 --> 00:39:32,291
Do you want to make a movie or not?

598
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:36,110
Questionable people come and go
all the time, and they say nonsense!

599
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:39,264
He looks like a gangster’s errand boy.

600
00:39:41,454 --> 00:39:45,130
You were happy to death when he gave
you the car keys and the credit card.

601
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,744
Now you've come to your senses?

602
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,918
What brings you here, Mr. Chairman?

603
00:39:59,072 --> 00:40:01,822
Why did Cho Dong Choon come here?

604
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:05,777
He came to see Gi Bum.

605
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:07,800
What are you doing, Tae Soo?

606
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,721
If Gi Bum does something wrong,
you should stop him!

607
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:13,934
How could you allow that?

608
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:17,000
Is this how you handle things?

609
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,153
How can I trust you with anything?

610
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,172
You didn't trust me with
the movie entirely.

611
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:33,240
Are you... blaming me now?

612
00:40:42,697 --> 00:40:44,101
Tae Soo.

613
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,378
Now that I see you today,
you sit really tall, yeah?

614
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:52,418
You are even taller than I am!

615
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:16,710
Let's have an election that is
clean, honorable, and free of bribery.

616
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,552
Just like the color white,
which represents One Heart.

617
00:41:19,552 --> 00:41:23,384
In particular, do not spread lies
about a candidate's past.

618
00:41:23,384 --> 00:41:26,914
My strategy is to be mysterious.

619
00:41:26,914 --> 00:41:28,903
Just like the color purple.

620
00:41:32,469 --> 00:41:35,989
Candidates, your eyes
are quite scary right now.

621
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:41,083
A clean election starts with... a smile!

622
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,987
Oh, Madam asked me
to take pictures of you.

623
00:41:43,987 --> 00:41:47,487
Please come forward and shake
hands with each other.

624
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:53,483
Okay.

625
00:41:58,346 --> 00:42:00,608
Okay. Ready...

626
00:42:00,608 --> 00:42:03,286
Please shake hands.

627
00:42:04,028 --> 00:42:05,414
Shake hands.

628
00:42:06,474 --> 00:42:09,885
Smile... one, two, three!

629
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:17,775
I'm over here.

630
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:20,436
What is this place?

631
00:42:20,436 --> 00:42:22,981
Why do you ask when you already know?

632
00:42:22,981 --> 00:42:27,085
By the way, did you clean
it up for a guest?

633
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:29,952
Or did you clean it up to hide something?

634
00:42:29,952 --> 00:42:32,764
You may not know,
since it's Gi Bum's hideout.

635
00:42:32,764 --> 00:42:35,434
Geez, there you go again.

636
00:42:35,434 --> 00:42:37,965
Say it in a way that I can understand.

637
00:42:37,965 --> 00:42:42,905
I believe there's something
between you, Gi Bum and Mr. Son.

638
00:42:42,905 --> 00:42:46,280
Here, Baek Gi Bum was...

639
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:52,840
Someone reported that he
worked on Mr. Son here.

640
00:42:54,521 --> 00:42:59,262
I should have had forensics work on it.

641
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,603
Then I would have
already gotten a gift box.

642
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,561
What do you think?

643
00:43:05,561 --> 00:43:07,496
Think about what?

644
00:43:07,496 --> 00:43:11,130
Then bring Baek Gi Bum here and ask him!

645
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:16,315
That brat has his almighty dad
in his back pocket. How can I do that?

646
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:21,210
What I need is a witness.

647
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:28,170
Bro, what am I, a woman's heart?

648
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,273
Stop trying to look into it.

649
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:34,170
You better bring me evidence!

650
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,746
Okay?

651
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,849
I'm a busy man.

652
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:42,110
Don't trust Baek Man Bo and Baek Gi Bum!

653
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:48,570
Lots of loyal dogs like you
have gone to jail for them.

654
00:43:49,114 --> 00:43:52,773
I'm worried you might end up like that.

655
00:44:18,628 --> 00:44:20,219
Dad!

656
00:44:21,983 --> 00:44:23,356
What are you listening to?

657
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:33,670
Wow, what a beautiful voice.

658
00:44:35,811 --> 00:44:39,144
Why don't you listen at home?
It's cold.

659
00:44:40,865 --> 00:44:43,000
Is it because of Mom?

660
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,793
You haven't decided yet?

661
00:44:47,014 --> 00:44:48,965
My head is spinning.

662
00:44:51,652 --> 00:44:53,182
Geez.

663
00:44:53,182 --> 00:44:57,376
My head is about to explode too.

664
00:44:59,253 --> 00:45:02,898
Cold air is the best thing
at times like these.

665
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:08,032
Should we keep taking in this cold air
and just freeze to death?

666
00:45:12,746 --> 00:45:14,143
Okay.

667
00:45:33,155 --> 00:45:34,945
Nonprofit foundation?

668
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:37,815
Yes, a nonprofit foundation.

669
00:45:37,815 --> 00:45:42,092
That's slight overkill.
We're just a group of volunteers--

670
00:45:42,092 --> 00:45:46,949
That kind of mindset kept One Heart
from growing in the past five years.

671
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:48,755
What's your point?

672
00:45:48,795 --> 00:45:50,487
Think about it.

673
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:53,010
It's hard to make a living these days.

674
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:57,543
We can help the members
buy a house with a loan.

675
00:45:57,543 --> 00:46:02,530
And for families with kids in schools,
we can set up scholarship funds.

676
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:06,625
Helping others is all well and good.

677
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:11,181
However, the real growth should start
with benefiting our own members.

678
00:46:11,181 --> 00:46:16,338
Wow, why haven't we ever thought of that?

679
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:20,150
Do Kyung, that is a great idea!

680
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:24,570
Ladies, you all agree, right?

681
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,423
Right?

682
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:34,286
Kyung Mee! Kyung Mee!

683
00:46:34,286 --> 00:46:37,706
You're being too obvious.

684
00:46:37,706 --> 00:46:39,875
What about your friendship with Eun Ok?

685
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:44,541
Geez, you have no idea.
I'm trying to survive, myself.

686
00:46:45,476 --> 00:46:47,760
If only my husband were better...

687
00:46:48,501 --> 00:46:51,681
Did Manager Change get in trouble again?

688
00:46:51,681 --> 00:46:53,864
It's not like that.

689
00:46:54,547 --> 00:46:58,849
I'm just saying life is hard...

690
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,233
Bye.

691
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:01,413
Okay.

692
00:47:01,413 --> 00:47:06,106
Okay, what you said was
really intriguing to me too.

693
00:47:06,106 --> 00:47:08,458
But can you keep all of your promises?

694
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:13,043
You won't be able to do those
things without the chairman's help.

695
00:47:13,043 --> 00:47:16,398
I don't need him. I have Director Baek.

696
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:17,894
Hey, Lee Do Kyung!

697
00:47:17,894 --> 00:47:22,106
It was just yesterday when we
shook hands on a clean election!

698
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:24,268
Do you really need to
involve your ex-husband?

699
00:47:24,268 --> 00:47:27,327
Eun Ok, you're being old-fashioned.

700
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:30,505
Did I cheat? Did I speak badly about you?

701
00:47:30,505 --> 00:47:33,155
In an election, I can use anyone
who will help me to win voters.

702
00:47:33,155 --> 00:47:36,005
That's how elections work.

703
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:40,268
Fair play, okay?

704
00:47:58,925 --> 00:48:00,179
Thank you.

705
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:03,900
I told you I didn't feel like eating.

706
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,099
You need to eat when it's time to eat,
even if you don't feel like it.

707
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:09,581
Okay.

708
00:48:17,315 --> 00:48:19,309
Please sit here.

709
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,911
Okay, sit right here.

710
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:32,684
Did you wait long?

711
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:34,731
Are you hungry?

712
00:48:34,731 --> 00:48:37,110
I already ordered.

713
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:40,605
The one with
lots of cheese, your favorite.

714
00:48:40,605 --> 00:48:45,257
Oh, man! My son knows his manners!

715
00:48:45,257 --> 00:48:47,449
See how sweet he is to you?

716
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:52,141
Let's eat. The food is getting cold.

717
00:48:56,047 --> 00:49:01,067
In my opinion, I am the only one in
our family who needs to do better.

718
00:49:02,032 --> 00:49:04,141
Everyone else is doing a good job.

719
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:08,110
Sung Min is good... you are good...

720
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,842
Just forget my mom.

721
00:49:10,827 --> 00:49:15,552
And Soo Min will do better
when she gets older.

722
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,264
Oh, my! I forgot.

723
00:49:19,264 --> 00:49:21,842
It's time to go pick up Soo Min.

724
00:49:21,842 --> 00:49:27,554
Well... enjoy your date
with your son, okay?

725
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:31,137
I will be back soon.

726
00:49:48,137 --> 00:49:53,199
I am sorry for having
disappointed you and Dad.

727
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:57,000
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about me doing music.

728
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,400
I will study hard
during my last year as you wish.

729
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,282
I'll study hard for my goal.

730
00:50:06,146 --> 00:50:07,836
Sung Min!

731
00:50:09,693 --> 00:50:13,844
You made the right decision!
You are my son, indeed!

732
00:50:13,893 --> 00:50:15,807
In return...

733
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,418
I want to major in music composition.

734
00:50:19,418 --> 00:50:20,690
What?

735
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:24,791
I will go to Seoul University as
you wish, but as a music major.

736
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,632
Are you crazy?

737
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:32,777
Music can be your hobby!

738
00:50:32,777 --> 00:50:35,965
After you get a good job and
make loads of money, buy a nice guitar!

739
00:50:35,965 --> 00:50:39,103
You can do whatever you want.
I won't stop you then!

740
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:41,014
Mom...

741
00:50:43,175 --> 00:50:44,815
I am serious.

742
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:48,722
This is the best scenario,
for both you and me.

743
00:50:48,722 --> 00:50:50,719
Sung Min...

744
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:55,324
Think about your dad,
who loves you so dearly.

745
00:50:55,324 --> 00:50:57,811
So he can be proud of raising you.

746
00:50:57,811 --> 00:51:00,050
So he can be proud of you.

747
00:51:00,664 --> 00:51:06,177
Dad said... he would support me
no matter what I choose to do.

748
00:51:16,355 --> 00:51:17,833
Dad!

749
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:19,367
Are you done?

750
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,612
- Bye.
- Bye.

751
00:51:21,682 --> 00:51:23,952
I'm a bit late. Let's go.

752
00:51:26,356 --> 00:51:29,871
Man, kids have hard
lives these days, right?

753
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:33,541
They study until this late, and then
do homework when they get home.

754
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:35,481
You're right.

755
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:41,199
When we were little, we would just
play baseball and run around.

756
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:46,730
Yes, it was good back then.

757
00:51:47,702 --> 00:51:50,193
Do you like baseball?

758
00:51:50,193 --> 00:51:51,992
Baseball?

759
00:51:51,992 --> 00:51:54,389
I'm sick and tired of it.

760
00:51:56,182 --> 00:51:57,692
Dad!

761
00:51:57,692 --> 00:51:59,556
Hey!

762
00:51:59,556 --> 00:52:03,505
- I told you to speak English!
- Okay.

763
00:52:03,505 --> 00:52:05,844
How was your class today?

764
00:52:05,844 --> 00:52:08,559
Grammar was a bit difficult.

765
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:09,967
- Really?
- Yes.

766
00:52:09,967 --> 00:52:14,170
Don't worry. I will teach you
some grammar when we get home.

767
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,159
- Okay.
- Okay?

768
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,289
How many words did you memorize?

769
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:25,675
What a bunch of bullshit.

770
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,813
Hey! Hey!

771
00:52:30,851 --> 00:52:34,565
Hey, come on, baby! Come on!

772
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:37,023
Come on, baby!

773
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:39,440
Baby, come on!

774
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,039
What's wrong with him?

775
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:43,557
Ms. Yoon! Ms. Yoon!

776
00:52:43,557 --> 00:52:45,822
Ms. Yoon! Hey!

777
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:50,094
Hey! Come on! Come on!

778
00:52:57,695 --> 00:53:01,547
I was so embarrassed that
I couldn't take this out at cram school.

779
00:53:01,547 --> 00:53:04,117
Look at this, Dad.

780
00:53:04,117 --> 00:53:07,695
Mom didn't even apologize to me.
Does that make sense?

781
00:53:07,695 --> 00:53:10,188
I know. Just let it go.

782
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:13,771
I have the worst phone
in the whole school.

783
00:53:13,771 --> 00:53:17,190
My friends have the newest phones,
while mine has a broken screen!

784
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:20,547
It's super slow and the
touch screen doesn't work.

785
00:53:20,547 --> 00:53:22,431
What should I do, Dad?

786
00:53:25,717 --> 00:53:27,186
What's wrong?

787
00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:37,838
Welcome!

788
00:53:39,126 --> 00:53:43,030
Sit down here and have some chicken.
I'll be right back.

789
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:44,516
But I'm not hungry.

790
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:46,554
Well, I want to have some.

791
00:53:46,554 --> 00:53:48,804
Don't come out at any cost.

792
00:53:48,804 --> 00:53:51,797
If I don't come back within
20 minutes, call your mom.

793
00:53:51,797 --> 00:53:53,199
Okay.

794
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,155
Who the heck are you?
What is this about?

795
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,965
My touch screen...

796
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:01,018
My cell phone...

797
00:55:15,217 --> 00:55:18,617
<i>[Keep us safe today.]</i>

798
00:55:23,257 --> 00:55:25,719
My goodness!

799
00:55:26,768 --> 00:55:28,168
Geez.

800
00:55:33,753 --> 00:55:35,110
Hey, kid.

801
00:55:38,684 --> 00:55:42,128
He followed me from Soo Min's
cram school last night.

802
00:55:42,128 --> 00:55:45,922
Boss, I dug into Manager Ma.

803
00:55:45,922 --> 00:55:48,813
Sounds like the chairman called
the guys from Cheongjoo.

804
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:51,610
What? Cheongjoo?

805
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:55,387
Yes, what would he call them here for?

806
00:55:55,387 --> 00:55:59,597
He would always call us,
dirty work or clean work.

807
00:56:00,978 --> 00:56:05,800
Boss, I'm a bit suspicious
of the chairman.

808
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:11,559
If it's really those guys,
you never know what they'll do.

809
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,797
This is Yoon Tae Soo.

810
00:56:17,797 --> 00:56:21,425
<i>I'm calling from Soo Min's cram school.
Her mom isn't answering her phone.</i>

811
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:23,202
<i>Did Soo Min come home?</i>

812
00:56:23,202 --> 00:56:24,867
What do you mean?

813
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,527
What happened to that?

814
00:56:39,527 --> 00:56:43,351
That's my question.
How did that happen?

815
00:56:43,351 --> 00:56:45,003
I don't know!

816
00:56:45,003 --> 00:56:47,858
It was already like that
when we came in.

817
00:56:47,858 --> 00:56:52,034
Geez, when I saw that...

818
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,612
My heart is still beating so hard.

819
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:57,657
Are you okay, Madam?
Should I get you some medicine?

820
00:57:00,054 --> 00:57:03,199
Please be honest, Eun Ok.

821
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:06,914
Did you want to win that much?

822
00:57:06,914 --> 00:57:10,257
What are you talking about?
I really don't know anything.

823
00:57:10,257 --> 00:57:12,340
Madam, please stop.

824
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,989
I don't want others to find out.
It's embarrassing.

825
00:57:14,989 --> 00:57:20,396
I'm in charge of the election.
I'm the most embarrassed one here.

826
00:57:21,121 --> 00:57:24,949
Not only the election, but also
One Heart has been disgraced.

827
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:28,655
Madam, what evidence do
you have against me?

828
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:32,452
Who else is there that would
do something like this?

829
00:57:36,143 --> 00:57:37,737
Your phone is ringing.

830
00:57:40,592 --> 00:57:42,445
I'm sorry, Honey--

831
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:44,918
What?

832
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:47,668
What is it now, Eun Ok?

833
00:57:50,043 --> 00:57:51,936
I have to go now.

834
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:55,913
Explain it before you go.
Otherwise you're admitting you did this.

835
00:57:55,913 --> 00:57:57,987
I have to go.

836
00:57:58,764 --> 00:58:01,005
What happened to Soo Min?

837
00:58:01,005 --> 00:58:04,657
She was going to see a movie
with a friend after cram school.

838
00:58:04,657 --> 00:58:08,056
But she didn't come
and we can't reach her.

839
00:58:08,056 --> 00:58:09,550
What?

840
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:15,373
Sung Min's thing was only a few days ago.
Now what's happening?

841
00:58:15,373 --> 00:58:16,634
What about Sung Min?

842
00:58:16,634 --> 00:58:19,467
He went to see Soo Min's friends.

843
00:58:21,811 --> 00:58:23,420
Did you talk to them?

844
00:58:23,943 --> 00:58:28,626
A friend of hers saw her talking
to a man at the bus station.

845
00:58:28,626 --> 00:58:31,963
Man? What kind of man?

846
00:58:31,963 --> 00:58:33,599
Calm down.

847
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,416
Honey, could it be those guys?

848
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,643
Soo Min!

849
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:45,369
Soo Min! Soo Min!

850
00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:48,161
Soo Min! Yoon Soo Min!

851
00:58:48,911 --> 00:58:50,664
Soo Min!

852
00:58:56,630 --> 00:59:01,114
Sorry. I need to report a missing child.
I can't find my child!

853
00:59:01,114 --> 00:59:02,349
Wait a moment.

854
00:59:02,349 --> 00:59:04,326
- What?
- Where was it?

855
00:59:06,153 --> 00:59:07,644
Well...

856
00:59:09,842 --> 00:59:13,967
Excuse me! Please let me
report a missing child.

857
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,882
I can't find her. She's a sixth grader.

858
00:59:16,882 --> 00:59:19,945
Soo Min! Soo Min!

859
00:59:20,603 --> 00:59:21,994
Soo Min!

860
00:59:21,994 --> 00:59:25,911
Soo Min! Soo Min!

861
00:59:26,572 --> 00:59:28,121
Soo Min!

862
00:59:28,121 --> 00:59:30,195
Soo Min!

863
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,269
<i>Tae Soo.</i>

864
00:59:36,269 --> 00:59:40,382
Now that I see you, you sit tall.

865
00:59:40,382 --> 00:59:42,039
You look even taller than I am!

866
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:44,358
The chairman called
the guys from Cheongjoo.

867
01:00:03,043 --> 01:00:05,063
What brings you here at this hour?

868
01:00:05,762 --> 01:00:09,224
Mr. Chairman, I need to check something.

869
01:00:09,224 --> 01:00:10,650
Check what?

870
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:14,179
We can't reach Soo Min.

871
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:15,827
Where did you daughter go?

872
01:00:25,126 --> 01:00:26,802
Mr. Chairman!

873
01:00:26,802 --> 01:00:29,173
Are you questioning me?

874
01:00:30,463 --> 01:00:32,016
Is that why you came here?

875
01:00:39,217 --> 01:00:43,262
Tae Soo, I know you are
desperate for your daughter.

876
01:00:43,262 --> 01:00:46,500
But how can you doubt me?

877
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,918
Your daughter is like
my own granddaughter!

878
01:00:54,335 --> 01:00:55,510
Yeah.

879
01:00:56,594 --> 01:00:59,085
Boss, we found the guy who did it.

880
01:01:16,659 --> 01:01:19,447
Where's Soo Min? Where's my daughter?

881
01:01:19,447 --> 01:01:20,878
How would I know?

882
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:22,266
You had me followed.

883
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:23,804
You got the wrong person!

884
01:01:23,804 --> 01:01:25,726
Your guy fessed up.

885
01:01:25,726 --> 01:01:28,273
I really don't know!

886
01:01:34,141 --> 01:01:37,438
How dare you! Where is Soo Min?

887
01:01:37,438 --> 01:01:39,599
I asked you, where is she?

888
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,978
You said I would be full of regret.

889
01:01:41,978 --> 01:01:45,414
Is this what you plotted
with that swindler?

890
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:49,148
What are you talking about?
Make it easy for me to understand.

891
01:01:49,148 --> 01:01:53,253
Gi Bum, how can you do this to me?

892
01:01:53,253 --> 01:01:58,177
We do dirty work but we also
have a rule we call the bottom line.

893
01:01:58,177 --> 01:02:02,550
That bottom line is to
not touch our families!

894
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:06,746
You want to know what happens
when you don't follow the rule?

895
01:02:06,746 --> 01:02:10,423
I will show you clearly! You bastards!
