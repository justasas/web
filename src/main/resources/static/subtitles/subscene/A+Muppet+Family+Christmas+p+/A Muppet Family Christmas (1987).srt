♫ It hasn't snowed a single flurry
Fozzie, we're all in a hurry. ♫

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,030
Guys, this is the best
idea we've had in years...

12
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,244
Christmas at my mother's farm.

13
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:48,146
Sounds great Fozzie, but don't you think we
should have called your mother...

14
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:49,648
To let her know we were coming?

15
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,205
How little you
understand bears Kermit.

16
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,579
My mother loves surprises!

17
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,084
- Good thing. She's in for a beauty.
- Surprise, surprise!

18
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:02,087
You see, I know what she
is doing this very second.

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,590
There she is in the
old farmhouse...

20
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:07,592
On the snowy hill,

21
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:11,096
nice and cozy by a roaring fire.

22
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:14,099
All the Christmas
decorations will be up...

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,601
And ma will be in her
rocking chair, knitting...

24
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:19,104
And feeling just a little sad...

25
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:22,107
That she's all alone
for the holidays.

26
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:26,512
Well, the plane leaves for
California in three hours.

27
00:01:26,612 --> 00:01:29,614
Ho-ho, Christmas in Malibu!

28
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:34,313
Ah, I'm going to lie on the
beach and catch some rays.

29
00:01:34,314 --> 00:01:35,620
Wocka, wocka!

30
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:38,623
Oh, this is going to
be such a surprise!

Well, I think I have everything.

44
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,444
Yes, the airline ticket,
my suntan lotion, the...

45
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,326
Come in!

46
00:02:29,327 --> 00:02:31,890
Hello! Is this Grizzly Farm?

47
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,565
Oh, you must be the renter.
Come in, come in!

48
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:37,978
Yes, yes, I'm Doc.
Are you my landlady?

49
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:43,103
No, Sprocket, I didn't know
I was renting from a bear.

50
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,604
Oh, mind your step!

51
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:46,607
Be careful. There's an
icy patch there. Oof!

52
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:52,419
I'm so glad there's someone going to be
staying in the house while I'm gone.

53
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:56,089
Well, Sprocket and I...
he's my dog, Sprocket.

54
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:58,618
We're certainly delighted
to be renting the place.

55
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:02,122
We've been wanting to spend a nice,
quiet Christmas in the country.

56
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:04,634
You've come to the right place.

57
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,285
Put your things in the bedroom

58
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,178
- at the top of the stairs.
- Thank you.

59
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:11,648
Now who could that be?

60
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,957
Ta-da! Merry Christmas!

61
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,651
- Son!
- Mom!

62
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:19,406
Ahh!

63
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:24,466
- It's so good to see you.
- Well, what the... a surprise!

64
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:26,838
No, no, the real surprise is...

65
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,341
- I brought all my friends with me!
- What?

66
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,343
Come on, everybody!
Merry Christmas!

67
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,345
Be careful of the icy patch.

68
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,347
Yeah, that's terrific!

69
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,849
Yeah. Come on!

70
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,352
- Hey, aren't you glad to see us all?
- Whoa!

71
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,522
- Well, I should say.
- Excuse me, Mrs. Bear.

72
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:48,447
Remember me? I rented this place
to have a nice, quiet Christmas.

73
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:50,949
Peace on earth! Give me present.

74
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,165
- Arf arf arf.
- Argh!

75
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:56,043
Be careful, Sprocket. These could
be from some foreign planet.

76
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:58,374
Actually, they're
from television.

77
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:01,724
I recognized Fozzie's
weirdo friends.

78
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:04,281
Yeah. We're proud of it too.
Heh-heh-heh!

79
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:05,372
Why am I here?

80
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:08,375
Tell me, Sprocket are these anything
like these Fraggles...

81
00:04:08,376 --> 00:04:10,048
you keep telling me about?

82
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:14,381
Come on, come on! Mom, I
want you to meet someone.

83
00:04:14,382 --> 00:04:16,614
This is my boss, my friend,

84
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,385
- my inspiration,
- aw!

85
00:04:18,386 --> 00:04:22,390
The one who gave me my big break
in the show business, Kermit.

86
00:04:22,683 --> 00:04:24,416
Oh, yeah, the lizard.

87
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:26,561
Uh, well, frog actually.

88
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:29,852
Listen, Mrs. Bear, I know there are an
awful lot of us here, so I just...

89
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,475
Don't you worry about it.

90
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,603
- There's plenty of room for everybody.
- Excuse me.

91
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:39,253
You promised me a nice,
quiet Christmas.

92
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:41,197
You think you’re disappointed?

93
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:45,201
I just took three months of
surfing lessons for zip!

94
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,704
Telephone!

95
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:50,708
- Telephone!
- Uh, that's just animal.

96
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,829
- Hello, hello, hello! Give me present!
- Joyeux Noel, Kermie.

97
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,561
Oh, pig.

98
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,408
Uh...

99
00:05:01,138 --> 00:05:02,952
Hello? Uh, Piggy?

100
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:06,061
Kermie, my dear cher, it's you!

101
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:09,064
Yes, Piggy, it's me. Hey,
listen, where are you?

102
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:10,724
You were supposed to come
to the farmhouse with us.

103
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:12,067
I know, Kermie,

104
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:17,072
but I forgot about a teensy-weensy
photo session I just scheduled.

105
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:20,075
Now give me more over the
shoulder, honey. Hold it.

106
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:24,580
- W-well, hurry up.
- Do not worry so, my little green hunk.

107
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:26,716
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Couldn't be nicer.

108
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:31,078
Thank you. My chauffeur Jerome
is ready to whisk me away...

109
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,904
Into your arms at the farmhouse. Ha-ha!

110
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:35,533
Oh, beautiful! Beautiful!

111
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:38,433
I must go now. I'm rather busy.
See you soon!

112
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:41,936
- Hmmph! Okay, bye.
- Kissy-kissy! Bye-bye!

113
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,042
- Oh! Oh, now do that pouty thing!
- Oh, yes.

114
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:48,546
Do that pouty thing! Oooh!
Oh, fabulous!

115
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:52,550
You'll find more
bedrooms up the stairs.

116
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:56,053
Those are our bedrooms!
We rented this place.

117
00:05:56,825 --> 00:05:58,055
Not more!

118
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,057
Fozzie, get that door!

119
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:02,560
Okay, mom! Up the stairs.
Up the stairs.

120
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:05,564
- Swedish Chef!
- Fleula yule!

121
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,080
Whoa!

122
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:09,727
Watch out for that icy patch there.

123
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:10,447
Ja.

124
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:14,317
Genghis fur her der

125
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:17,130
You mean, you're here to cook the
Christmas Turkey for us.

126
00:06:17,131 --> 00:06:18,043
Ja, ja!

127
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:21,078
Let's go to the kitchen.

131
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,462
I'll get it! Ha-ha! Yes?

132
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:32,551
Hi there!

133
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:33,964
Oh! Y-you're a turkey!

134
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:34,826
Of course.

135
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,467
Come on outside. We gotta talk.

136
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:38,213
Chicken in da cooking.

137
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:40,344
Sure, there are rats and chickens here.

138
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:41,972
We always have
rats and chickens.

139
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:44,906
You're in the wrong place
at the wrong time now.

140
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:47,409
Take a walk, fly South for the winter.
Anything!

141
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:50,481
I was invited for Christmas by
some guy who spoke Swedish.

142
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:50,871
Oh, brother.

143
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:53,380
Had a white chef's hat on.
Sounds like a nice vacation.

144
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:56,821
Mm-hmm. Listen, that guy is a chef.
Don't you realize...

145
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:59,824
It could be very dangerous
for turkeys around here?

146
00:06:59,825 --> 00:07:02,919
Not to worry. I'm a survivor.
Now, where's my room?

147
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:05,437
If you're not careful,
it'll be in the oven.

148
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:08,440
So long, bucko. Heh-heh!

149
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:09,976
See you at dinner!

150
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,990
What seems to be the
trouble, Fozzie?

151
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:15,973
Well, you see, Kirmit, the chef is
a little bit angry...

152
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,800
Because of all the rats and
chickens in his kitchen.

153
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:21,302
How about we send them to his
bedroom instead?

154
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:25,349
Oh, ja, chicken en da rat in
the bunksa-bunksa.

155
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,208
All right, let's go. Come
on, head 'em out! Okay.

156
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:30,760
- Up to the bedroom. Up to the bedroom.
- Yes, here we go, guys.

157
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:36,091
Whew, another crisis solved. Boy,
there sure are a lot of us here.

158
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:39,075
Well, the whole family's
starting to come together.

159
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:40,924
We always come together
at Christmas.

160
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:45,081
Yeah. Life would just pass in a blur if
it weren't for times like this.

161
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,683
Hmm?

162
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:50,587

00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:54,090

Just bring it inside, guys.
Thanks.

200
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:40,661
- Yo, Fozzie! I finally made it.
- Hey, Rowlf, welcome.

201
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:41,386
You're late.

202
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:43,333
I've been chasing a
truck all the way,

203
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,249
and boy, am I exhausted.

204
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:49,237
- I get it. Truck, exhaust. That's funny.
- Yeah, that's a dog joke.

205
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,668
- Go inside and tell mom that.
- Gotcha.

206
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:53,671
She loves canine humor.

207
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:58,348
Okay, boys, put it over
there in the corner.

208
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:01,852
- Come on, Doc, let's get this holly up here.
- Oh, Mrs. Bear!

209
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:04,855
I've been chasing a
truck, and boy... whoa!

210
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:09,359
Oh, my! I guess Fozzie didn't
tell you about the icy patch.

211
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,362
Yeah, I guess he didn't. Anyhow,
my name's Rowlf the dog.

212
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:15,866
- I've come for the holidays.
- More? More people?

213
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:18,368
I'll go out and
see if there's

214
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,371
a spare pillow in the kennel.

00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,043
Arf arf.

Well, Doc, you know
what this means.

00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:08,152
Sprocket and I will have to give up
our hammock in the attic, right?

Either that or build bunk-beds
in the broom closet.

Sprocket, go get me
a hammer, will you?

- Hi there. Hey, we're Ernie and Bert.
- Yeah.

387
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:19,443
Well, hi there yourself.
I'm Doc.

388
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:22,186
Did you know that "Doc" starts
with the letter "D"?

389
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:23,503
Why, yes.

390
00:18:23,557 --> 00:18:26,058
- Yes. "Yes" starts with the letter "Y."
- Yeah.

391
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:29,147
- True.
- And "true" starts with the letter "T."

392
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:30,058
What is this?

393
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,124
Where we come
from, this is small talk.

394
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:34,519
Whatever you say. It's
nice to meet you,

395
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,021
but I've gotta go and
build some bunk-beds.

396
00:18:37,022 --> 00:18:38,933
Bunk-beds! "B" words.

397
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:43,959
Hey, hey, hey, no, you got me wrong.
I-I-I'm a dairy cow. Moo!

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,264
No, no, no, du bis borgey.

00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:50,472
I'm a birdie, I'm a birdie. I'm a
seagull, all right?

401
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:52,798
No, no, no. Gobbla-gobbla.

402
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,115
Okay, all right, I
admit it, I admit it!

403
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:55,560
The jig is up!

404
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:58,150
Here I am, the Christmas Turkey.

405
00:18:58,364 --> 00:19:00,107

Ow! Hey! Watch it
there, will ya?

407
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:08,306
Oh, yeah, yeah, I
recognize it now.

408
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:11,297
This is... thi... this is the
traditional fitting, right,

409
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:14,488
to see if the roasting pan is big
enough for the nice fat bird.

410
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:18,445
Ja, ja, ja, gobbla-gobbla
torkey fitsky witsky.

411
00:19:18,446 --> 00:19:20,695
Of course, uh, before
we go any further,

412
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:24,664
uh, there is one thing I
think you should see.

413
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:27,370
Numisbiscus
gobbla-gobbla snooze?

414
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:30,373
If you think I'm a nice
fat bird, look at this!

415
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,987
Oy, York!

416
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,981
Nushna gobbla-gobbla humonga!

417
00:19:37,991 --> 00:19:40,351
Ain't it the truth.
Heh-heh-heh-heh! Mmm!

418
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:43,678
Hey, everyone, quiet down.
There's a bulletin on TV.

419
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:46,123
≡⌁ And now for this news flash. ⌁≡

420
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:50,343
≡⌁ The worst blizzard in 50 years is
approaching us at a great rate. ⌁≡

421
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:54,403
≡⌁ The weather service reports that
barometers are falling sharply. ⌁≡

422
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:56,679
≡⌁ Oh, no! Aah! ⌁≡

423
00:19:57,181 --> 00:19:59,331
He's right! Look at the snow.

424
00:19:59,457 --> 00:20:01,485
One snowflake, two snowflake,
three snowflake...

425
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:04,025
But Miss Piggy's out there in that storm.

426
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:05,837
Five, six...

427
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:17,354
All right, the huge canary sleeps
in the attic with the cookie eater.

428
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:18,230
Check.

429
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:21,171
The blue monster said
he'd sleep in the bathtub.

430
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:22,673
- Check.
- And, uh,

431
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,192
Ernie and Bert will bunk
out with the lizard here.

432
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:27,588
Uh, Frog. Kermit the frog.

433
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:28,932
 What about Oscar?

434
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:32,083
I'll be nicely miserable
in my trash can here.

435
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,858
Hey, maybe I could bunk
out here with you.

436
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:38,827
I never had a rat in my trash can before.
That might be nice.

437
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,246
Hey, everybody, look what I've got...
Christmas cookies!

438
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:44,442
Cookie!

439
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:49,513
Oh, thank you.

440
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,834
Who was that strange
blue creature?

441
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:56,786
That my kind of fella.

442
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:01,518
Hey, everybody, it's time to rehearse
for our sesame street pageant.

443
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:05,660
It's called 'twas the
night before Christmas.

444
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,931
- Come on out, Bert.
- I won't.

445
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,707
- Come on, Bert.
- Ernie, please don't make me.

446
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,974
Oh Bert, listen,
everybody's waiting.

447
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:20,073
Ernie, why must you
always humiliate me?

448
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:23,789
Come on, somebody has to play mama.
And you lost the toss.

449
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,177
- All right, well, just get it over with!
- Okay.

450
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:29,720
'Twas the night before
Christmas by Clement Moore.

451
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,580
Hit it, Rowlf.

452
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,570
"'twas the night
before Christmas..."

453
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:38,878
"And all through the house not a creature
was stirring, not even a mouse."

454
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:39,616
Cue the mouse.

455
00:21:39,617 --> 00:21:41,315
I'm here! I'm here!

456
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:43,205
Cute little Grover mouse is here.

457
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:44,689
What's the bowl for?

458
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,942
Oh, uh, so you can see
that I am not stirring.

459
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:51,446
Note how the hand never
touches the spoon.

460
00:21:52,557 --> 00:21:53,815
Thank you, thank you.

461
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:56,670
Thank you, public. Thank you.
This is great.

462
00:21:56,671 --> 00:21:58,869
Oh, aren't they adorable?

463
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,128
Hey, don't encourage them.

464
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:03,335
"Mama in her kerchief...
" That's you, Bert.

465
00:22:03,336 --> 00:22:04,159
I know, I know.

466
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,409
"And I in my cap had just settled
our brains for a long winter's nap.

467
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,482
"When out on the lawn there
arose such a clatter,

468
00:22:09,483 --> 00:22:11,112
I sprang from my bed to
see what was the matter."

469
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:12,275
Open the curtain!

470
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:20,296
Monsters as reindeer?

471
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,639
This is crazy!
Wh-where's Santa claus?

472
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,396
Don't worry, Bert,
we're getting to him.

473
00:22:24,397 --> 00:22:26,561
"With a little old driver
so lively and quick,

474
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:29,063
I knew in a moment it
must be Saint Nick."

475
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:31,320
Hello!

476
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:34,036
Is nothing sacred?

477
00:22:34,037 --> 00:22:35,039
Now wait a minute.

478
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,731
Who let the two-headed
monster be Santa Claus?

479
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,734
But he said he'd never
been in a play before.

480
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,684
I mean, they said it.
Both of them said it.

481
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:43,959
Just go to the big finish.
Will you, please.

482
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,545
"But I heard him exclaim
ere he drove out of sight,

483
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:50,674
Mewwy Chwi-mah to aww and
to aww a good nigh!"

484
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:55,117
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night!

485
00:22:55,229 --> 00:22:56,542
Close the curtain!

486
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:00,794
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

487
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:04,782
Sorry to break up your fun in here,
but have you folks seen the weather?

488
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:07,873
- There's a real storm out there.
- Oh, Lordy,

489
00:23:07,874 --> 00:23:11,971
I haven't seen a sky like that
since the blizzard of '41.

490
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:14,786
I tell you, Mr. Lizard,
it's a good thing

491
00:23:14,787 --> 00:23:18,289
all your friends are safe and
warm inside the farmhouse.

492
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,292
Yeah, but... all my friends
are not safe and warm.

493
00:23:22,638 --> 00:23:23,899
Sorry to hear that it's...

494
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,506
Cold enough out there to freeze your Winnebago.

495
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,662
- Hello?
- Hello, Kermie.

496
00:23:30,663 --> 00:23:32,444
I've finished my shopping.

497
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:37,506
Unfortunately, Jerome got the
limo stuck in the snowbank.

498
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:41,477
So, I'll just have to catch
a taxi to the farmhouse.

499
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:43,784
Listen, Piggy, there's a
terrible storm outside...

500
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:45,646
And I really think it's
too dangerous to travel.

501
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:48,148
So why don't you wait for the
storm to end before you join us?

502
00:23:48,313 --> 00:23:51,664
Nonsense. And miss my
Christmas Eve with vous?

503
00:23:51,665 --> 00:23:53,666
It's just a little bit of snow.

504
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:56,163
See you soon! Bye-bye.

505
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:05,754
Yo, taxi!

506
00:24:06,336 --> 00:24:07,242
Aah!

507
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:09,016
My... oh!

508
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:13,596
Oh! Oh!

509
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:17,037
Aaah!

510
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,650
I'm sure Miss Piggy
will be all right.

511
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,518
Kermit?

512
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:24,870
Kermit, y-y-you look worried.

513
00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:27,825
I know exactly what you need.

514
00:24:28,014 --> 00:24:29,414
- Comedy.
- What?

515
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,242
Yeah, come on.

516
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:32,816
Now's the time for you
to meet my new partner!

517
00:24:32,817 --> 00:24:34,026
Who's your new partner?

518
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:35,710
- A snowman.
- The heck you say.

519
00:24:35,711 --> 00:24:38,111
Yeah, yeah. Come on outside and
we'll do our act for you.

520
00:24:38,112 --> 00:24:40,301
Outside? It's too cold to go outside.

521
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:41,691
- It's not cold.
- It is cold!

522
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:42,492
It's not cold.

523
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:46,741
Can I come in and warm up?

524
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,733
Okay, so it's cold.

525
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:52,907
I'm Kermit the frog. You must
be Fozzie's new partner.

526
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,409
I'll say. We're terrific.
Yeah, yeah. Come on!

527
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,365
You are coming in a snowman,
but you are going out a star.

528
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,416
Hey, everybody, would you
like to see our new act?

529
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,980
We'd love to see your act.

530
00:25:04,006 --> 00:25:05,920
In fact, we'd hate
to miss your act.

531
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,017
In fact, we'd love
to hate your act.

532
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:13,172
Statler, Waldorf, where'd
you guys come from?

533
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:17,331
They're friends of mine, Fozzie.
They come visit me every Christmas.

534
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,383
M-my own mother is
friends with you guys?

535
00:25:21,498 --> 00:25:23,688
These two comics are
made for each other.

536
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:26,920
The snowman is ice cold,
and the bear's not so hot.

537
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:29,987
Oh, please.

538
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:33,199
After all, there's no
business like snow business.

539
00:25:35,112 --> 00:25:37,369
Come on, ignore them.
Snowman, do the straight line.

540
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,339
- Okay. Hey, Fozzie!
- Yes, Mr. Snowman?

541
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,899
Did you hear about the church
that burned down?

542
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,317
Holy smoke!

543
00:25:46,874 --> 00:25:48,600
That was our best joke.

544
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:51,104
That does it, Fozzie.
Forget the act.

545
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:54,337
I'm startin' to melt.
It's too hot in here.

546
00:25:54,545 --> 00:25:56,133
Well, you know what they say.

547
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:59,134
If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the farmhouse.

548
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:04,751
Oh, come on. You'll be
okay on the back porch.

549
00:26:05,111 --> 00:26:08,113
Boy, that storm is
really getting worse.

550
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:10,583
Yeah, I hope Miss Piggy is okay.

551
00:26:12,907 --> 00:26:14,908
There is one worried frog.

552
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:18,025
Aha! That's one. One worried frog.

553
00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:19,892
He's not the only one.

554
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:22,760
That's two. Two worried frogs.

555
00:26:24,973 --> 00:26:27,977
Search me. More small
talk, I think.

556
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:30,526
Hey, I'd better go out
and get some firewood.

557
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:38,719
Corka doon.

558
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:39,961
Hi there.

559
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:45,853
Did you wish to talk to me about
something, Mr. Cook, sir?

560
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:47,996
Oh, ja, ja, ja.

561
00:26:49,131 --> 00:26:52,133
- Ungus sher doo.
- Gee, nice kitchen.

562
00:26:54,223 --> 00:26:58,560
Hey, are you gonna have cranberry
sauce and mashed potatoes?

563
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:00,738
Ja, ensperging bern.

564
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:02,967
- Oh, boy.
- Yengis bern da goobla-goobla.

565
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:06,392
I just want to hear
about the whole meal.

566
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:07,799
Oh, yerngus sperg...

567
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,842
but first, I want to give
this little present to you.

568
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:12,404
Ebit her?

569
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:16,135
It's chocolate-covered birdseed.
I made it myself.

570
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:18,277
Engus sperg da merga mor?

571
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:20,726
I wanted to give it
to you because, well,

572
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:24,025
I know that you're from Sweden and
it must be hard for you because

573
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:27,740
you're away from your family
and loved ones during the holidays.

574
00:27:27,785 --> 00:27:28,489
Ja.

575
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,492
At Christmas, there are
places and people and things

576
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:34,599
that become very, very special.

577
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:40,074
♫ Chestnuts roasting
on an open fire. ♫

578
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:44,584
♫ Jack frost nipping

588
00:28:27,448 --> 00:28:29,950
Now there, Mr. Cook, tell me...

589
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:33,820
Exactly what are you going
to fix for Christmas dinner?

590
00:28:33,821 --> 00:28:37,324
Ohhh, uh, ooh, oh, um...

591
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:39,750
Skraper vie don cranen boochers.

592
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:43,148
- Shredded wheat and cranberry sauce?
- Ja.

593
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:45,188
My absolute favorite.

594
00:28:45,214 --> 00:28:45,874
Ja.

595
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:50,567
Ooh, going to be lots of snow
for me to shovel tomorrow.

596
00:28:50,568 --> 00:28:53,345
Uh, it's getting worse
and worse out there.

597
00:28:53,435 --> 00:28:56,904
Aren't you glad you're in
here all warm and toasty?

598
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:59,510
I just wish Miss Piggy were.

599
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:04,525
Okay, when I yell
"three," gun it!

600
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:07,104
One, two, three!

601
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:27,390
You're really worried about your
friend, aren't you, Kermit?

602
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,909
Hmm? Oh, well, uh,
yeah, yeah, a little.

603
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:34,892
I'll tell you what. I'll
go out looking for her.

604
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,467
Really? But you've never
even met Miss Piggy.

605
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:42,667
We never met any of you
until a little while ago.

606
00:29:42,668 --> 00:29:44,669
And now we're friends.

607
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:50,027
See, Sprockey and I were gonna spend
Christmas alone, but this is better!

608
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:52,217
Now, what's your
friend look like?

609
00:29:52,218 --> 00:29:56,222
Well, uh, to begin
with, she's a pig.

610
00:29:56,537 --> 00:29:59,945
Well, up to a short while ago, I
would have thought that strange.

611
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,515
I'll give it a try.

612
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:03,152
Gee, thanks, Doc.

613
00:30:04,912 --> 00:30:08,908
You'll be sorry. It's cold
enough to freeze your Winnebago.

614
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:12,552
What a sweet guy.

615
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:14,641
Uncle Kermit?

616
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:17,165
Robin? Where are you?

617
00:30:17,213 --> 00:30:18,296
In the cellar.

618
00:30:18,297 --> 00:30:19,574
What are you doing down there?

619
00:30:19,575 --> 00:30:21,183
I made a discovery.

620
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,101
Oh, yeah? What are
you talking about?

621
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:26,074
Remember telling me about Fraggle holes?

622
00:30:26,312 --> 00:30:27,985
Uh, yeah. So?

623
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:30,743
And how if I ever found
one, we could go into

624
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:33,345
Fraggle Rock and maybe
meet some Fraggles?

625
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:34,750
Uh, so?

626
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:36,472
Is that one?

627
00:30:36,473 --> 00:30:39,975
Ooh, look at that. Well, it
certainly looks like one.

628
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:41,697
You never know where you're
going to find these things.

629
00:30:41,698 --> 00:30:43,764
Can we go in, Uncle Kermit?

630
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:47,846
Well, maybe just a little ways,
see if we can meet anyone.

631
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:51,723
Watch your step, Robin.

632
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:54,797
Gee, it's kind of scary.

633
00:30:55,477 --> 00:30:57,679
These are beautiful caves. Oooh!

634
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,866
- Hey, Uncle Kermit, wait up.
- Hmm? Okay.

635
00:31:02,052 --> 00:31:04,554
Do you think this is
really Fraggle Rock?

636
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:06,042
Well I don't know but
if I were a Fraggle,

637
00:31:06,043 --> 00:31:08,125
I think this is the kind
of place I'd hang out.

638
00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:10,314
Wait a second.

639
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:13,357
I thought I heard something.

640
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,085
Guess not.

641
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:18,221
Well, anyhow.

642
00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:25,939
Oh, uh, uh, well, uh, hi, there.

643
00:31:26,037 --> 00:31:27,292
- Hi, yourself.
- Hi.

644
00:31:27,293 --> 00:31:29,058
- You're Fraggles.
- I'll say.

645
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:31,060
- But you're not.
- I'll say.

646
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:34,352
No, I'm Kermit. This is Robin.
We're frogs.

647
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:36,416
Oh. What's a frog?

648
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,471
- They're frogs.
- I'll say.

649
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:42,702
Don't touch 'em. Frogs are
probably noted germ carriers.

650
00:31:42,843 --> 00:31:46,692
Well, actually, we just came down here
to wish you all a Merry Christmas.

651
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:48,809
- Oh, thank you.
- That's nice.

652
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:50,428
- What's Christmas?
- Yeah.

653
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:53,291
- Oh, don't you have Christmas?
- No.

654
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,662
That's when you gather together
with the people you love...

655
00:31:56,974 --> 00:31:59,087
And you wish each
other peace on earth.

656
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:03,091
Oh! Oh, we have a
time like that.

657
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:07,095
Yes, we do. As a matter of fact,
we're celebrating it right now.

658
00:32:07,096 --> 00:32:12,100
We give each other presents. I'm
giving goober this nice yellow pebble.

659
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:15,103
And I gave Mokie that
pebble last year.

660
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,009
And I gave it to Red
the year before that.

661
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,512
And I gave it to you, Wembley,
the year before that.

662
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,780
That pebble's been
a gift 37 times.

663
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:25,348
- Thirty-seven times?
- Yeah.

Oh, Goober, I almost forgot.
Huh?

692
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:49,331
I want you to have this pebble.

693
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:50,975
So, here.

694
00:33:50,976 --> 00:33:52,707
Wow! Oh!

695
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:54,601
Oh. Ah. Thank you, Mokie.

696
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:58,471
Hey, listen, Fraggles, this has all
been great, but we gotta be going.

697
00:33:58,472 --> 00:34:00,341
Oh! Oh, what a shame.

698
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:02,336
- I'll say.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

699
00:34:02,337 --> 00:34:04,271
Robin, before you go,

700
00:34:04,272 --> 00:34:06,727
I'd like you to
have this pebble.

701
00:34:07,827 --> 00:34:08,956
Wow!

702
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:11,397
Gee. Well, Merry
Christmas, Fraggles.

703
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,562
Merry Christmas, frogs.

704
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:14,374
Bye! Bye!

705
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:15,816
- Bye!
- Bye!

706
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,556
Bye! Bye!

707
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:19,606
Gosh, that was fun.

708
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:22,421
Yeah, well, it's nice to be
with friends at Christmas.

709
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:26,141
Kermit, we hear shouting outside.
It could be Miss Piggy.

710
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:27,951
Oh, well, let's go.

711
00:34:28,973 --> 00:34:30,974
Anyone see her out there?

712
00:34:31,884 --> 00:34:34,391
Well, at least the storm
has eased up a bit.

713
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:36,381
Chef, why don't you
make some hot soup?

714
00:34:36,382 --> 00:34:38,831
And, Mrs. Bear, would you put
some extra blankets on a bed?

715
00:34:38,832 --> 00:34:41,380
- Wait a minute. There she is!
- What?

716
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:01,745
Yeah, and she don't look bad...
for a pig.

717
00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:15,439
Oh! Merry Christmas, Kermie.
Am I late?

718
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:18,755
I-I-I don't know how to
explain this, Kermit,

719
00:35:18,756 --> 00:35:22,258
but I was searching through
the snow and suddenly...

720
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:26,262
There was Miss Piggy with
this costume for me.

721
00:35:26,263 --> 00:35:27,997
You don't have to explain, Doc.

722
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:31,268
If there's one thing Piggy knows,
it's how to make an entrance.

My mother has an announcement.

741
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:42,711
Thank you, Fozzie. I'd like
to welcome you all here.

742
00:36:43,398 --> 00:36:46,464
You are all here, aren't you?

743

I think so, yes.

744
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:51,683
Oh, good, because I'm afraid
we're running out of room.

745
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:55,917
Two of you will have to sleep hung
on hangers on a hook on the wall.

746
00:36:55,917 --> 00:37:01,497
- What a fabulous idea!
- Love hanger. Love hanger. Ahh!

747
00:37:01,497 --> 00:37:04,263
It's the only way animal
ever sleeps, ma'am.

748
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:08,224
See, mom, I told
you it'd be easy.

749
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:10,216
They're weirdos, Fozzie.

750
00:37:10,217 --> 00:37:11,482
- Yeah?
- But...

751
00:37:11,492 --> 00:37:12,992
