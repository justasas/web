00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,420
Please come pick up your drink when it buzzes.

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,750
Hello.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,560
I'd like to see you.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,570
Okay. I'll be there.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,540
I ordered a small latte macchiato,

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,850
not a tall Americano!

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,200
How many times did I say latte macchiato?

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,170
I'm sorry.
I'll make you another one.

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,120
How can you mess up the order?

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,050
Let me make you another one?

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,320
Stop making mistakes. Where's your head?

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,670
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,420
I didn't know you worked here.

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,920
A little during the day, a little at night.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,300
It's just for a few hours a day.

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,670
I'm trying to keep myself busy.

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,160
This is my first time, so I make mistakes and get yelled at which makes me forget.

19
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,300
No matter how hard you loved,

20
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,070
your business at hand comes first.

21
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,200
It's the same for everyone.

22
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:41,120
I only heard yesterday that your parents are against the marriage.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,500
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,150
Sangnam is in a lot of pain.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,970
If it's something my family can solve,

26
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,550
I'd be more than willing to do,

27
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,050
but since it's your family's decision,

28
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,800
there's pretty much nothing either me or Sangnam can do.

29
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,100
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,120
How is Sangnam?

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,650
He never shows his feelings.

32
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,850
But I can imagine how it must be.

33
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,850
He just works all day.

34
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,670
They broke up?

35
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,400
Yes, see?
Sangnam would do anything I say.

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,020
But that's not like Sangnam.

37
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,180
It is like Sangnam.

38
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,840
Why don't you introduce someone to him?

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,270
But I don't know anyone.

40
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,270
He really broke up because you told him to?

41
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,380
He really did.

42
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,630
My son's a good boy. He sure is.

43
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,760
A good boy?

44
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,460
How?

45
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,190
Having a sick person in the family is hard.

46
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,220
It was really hard when your grandpa was sick.

47
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,540
The Korean War was nothing compared to that.

48
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,980
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

49
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,530
It's hard on the caregiver, too.

50
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,380
How's he going to look after him?

51
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,290
My sister from Paju is there for now,

52
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,480
and my other siblings live too far.

53
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,010
Subak will have to take turns with her.

54
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,530
But he's her father in law.

55
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,940
She can't really take care of him.

56
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,150
She can't help him with the chamber pot.

57
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,770
She'll just have to.

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,900
Maybe she can't help with the chamber pot,

59
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,530
but she has to help feed him and run errands.

60
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,740
I'll make money and pay for a caregiver.

61
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,140
I can't actually do it.

62
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,800
Why do things like this keep happening to us?

63
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,620
Maybe we should call for a shaman.

64
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,290
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

65
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,220
I'm sorry about everything.

66
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,270
Don't be.

67
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,270
How can people steal from farmers?

68
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,180
God will punish them, wherever they go.

69
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,630
Thank goodness you weren't hurt too badly.

70
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,180
I hope you get well soon.

71
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,160
Thank you.

72
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,370
I'm always causing you trouble.

73
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,620
Especially when Minjung's living with you.

74
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,970
Please don't say that.

75
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,510
Taking care of your father must be hard.

76
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm sorry, but I have to say something.

77
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,570
My father's had surgery.

78
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,660
Subak should come see him, shouldn't she?

79
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,190
Stop that.

80
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,700
You're right.

81
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,730
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,970
But my wife is sick today,

83
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,340
so Subak had to take care of her children.

84
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,810
She'll come as soon as she can.

85
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,330
Minsu, what is it?

86
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,810
I have to go home. What should I do?

87
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,100
You should go, then.

88
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,820
How can I leave him all alone?

89
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,270
He can't even move.

90
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,990
What is Subak doing?

91
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,270
She's busy.

92
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,330
Still, how can she not even visit?

93
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,480
I forgot to mention it to her.

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,940
Don't even try.

95
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,590
Then how could your father in law know?

96
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,750
You're always on your wife's side,

97
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,840
so she thinks she's better than us.

98
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,840
You should go. I'll be right there.

99
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,820
Hey! Watch where you drive that thing!

100
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,080
- What the heck!
- I'm sorry.

101
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,020
What are you doing?

102
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,260
Make soup with this and take it to the hospital.

103
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,720
I don't know how.

104
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,180
Don't say you can't. Just try.

105
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,540
Ask your mom how to do it and learn.

106
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,550
Why didn't you visit your father in law?

107
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,580
I was going to, but mom's sick.

108
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,900
I have to feed Jungji and go to work later.

109
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,080
When your father in law's at the hospital,

110
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,530
you should drop everything and visit him.

111
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,900
You're making me look bad by not going.

112
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:48,970
What is it?

113
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,920
How can you be such a blabbermouth?

114
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,730
What did I do?

115
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,930
You wanted to keep this a secret!

116
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,310
You wanted this to be a business trip,

117
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,970
but you turn around and tell everyone?

118
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,450
Do you know what your father and uncle tried to do to me today?

119
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,060
How could they bring a baseball bat?

120
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,060
Were they trying to kill me?

121
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,430
Don't you know that's against the law?

122
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,670
I almost called the police.

123
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,420
Tell your family to stay out of this.

124
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,860
I don't want them ganging up on me again.

125
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,960
You're driving me away, remember that.

126
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,610
How dare they?

127
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,380
Mom!

128
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,290
Sedal, what's going on?
I couldn't reach you.

129
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,740
What is it?

130
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,210
I had a problem, but it's okay now.

131
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,360
So you're not on a business trip?

132
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,590
It's like a business trip. I'm getting paid.

133
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,290
Mom, don't worry. It's a good thing.

134
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,880
It's a good thing? Okay.

135
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,760
I moved into your apartment. Isn't it great?

136
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,760
I'm selling my beauty salon,

137
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,370
and I bought a make up shop.

138
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,460
Hobak, this must be a great apartment.

139
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,800
See? Everyone's doing so well.

140
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,390
You got promoted, and I bought a makeup shop.

141
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,700
Everything worked out so well, right?

142
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,700
Yes.

143
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,110
Come to the grand opening, okay?

144
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,830
You have to help me with the party.

145
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,600
Mother, I'm home.

146
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,720
Hi.

147
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,160
- Hello, Bong.
- Hi.

148
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,040
What about dinner?

149
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,160
A meeting ran late, so I ate there.

150
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,030
- Okay.
- Did you have dinner yet?

151
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,120
There's nothing to eat.

152
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,920
Anggeum won't even go into the kitchen.

153
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,140
Mom, but you ate a lot.

154
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,330
You even had scorched rice soup.

155
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,780
Why you little! Why don't you go to work?

156
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,440
I'm done for the day.

157
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,720
Bong, go and rest. You look tired.

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,520
And stop worrying about your children.

159
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,570
You might be able to hide from your past,

160
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,220
but you can't hide from your destiny.

161
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,300
Things work out according to your destiny.

162
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,660
Things happen because they're destined to be.

163
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,590
I know.

164
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,730
Don't give in to Anggeum first.

165
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,750
Make sure you put her in her place.

166
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,210
I won't give in to her.
I have nothing to say.

167
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,010
Good.

168
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,760
They really aren't talking to each other.

169
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,580
A woman shouldn't be too stubborn.

170
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,340
Has Anggeum always been like that?

171
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,270
She wasn't.

172
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,350
When she first got married, she was so nice.

173
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,890
Subak got her looks from her mom.

174
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,680
So she changed because the marriage was that hard?

175
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,860
It's not like it was hard just for her!

176
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,780
It was a difficult time for everyone.

177
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,780
Did you turn Anggeum into a witch?

178
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,610
What?

179
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,260
I remember hearing her say

180
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,690
how she used to be a nice woman

181
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,040
but you turned her into a witch.

182
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,740
Why you little!

183
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,090
You believe her? She was lying.

184
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,670
Is Jungji better?

185
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,300
What about?

186
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,710
He was throwing up last night.

187
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,780
Mom, Jungji threw up last night?

188
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,780
I think he had indigestion.

189
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,890
You sound like you don't even care.

190
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,290
What do you mean?

191
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,780
Why did you feed him?

192
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,290
Why did you make him throw up?

193
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,200
Did you give him anything spoiled?

194
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,050
I worked my butt off to take care of your kids and this is the thanks I get?

195
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,600
Babies throw up.

196
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,030
You think I gave him poison?

197
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,980
I didn't mean it like that.

198
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,630
You don't do it for free.

199
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,500
I pay you, and I want my money's worth.

200
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,980
What?

201
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,200
Oh, whatever!

202
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,020
You promised to raise them, so you should do a good job!

203
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,300
Then you raise them.

204
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,450
I'm too busy to raise them!

205
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,980
I have to go to work!

206
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,170
Take the soup!

207
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,580
I made it despite being sick!

208
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,960
Ugh!

209
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,260
Oh, man!

210
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,120
Oh? Oh!

211
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,690
Hey...

212
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,860
Hey!

213
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,200
Man...

214
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,790
Uncle! Look what you did!

215
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,820
Likewise! Look what you did!

216
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,220
Oh, man.

217
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,820
Minsuk.

218
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,860
I'm saying hi here.

219
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,220
How is he?

220
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,980
Can't you see?

221
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,750
I brought soup. Give it to him.

222
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,000
I spilled a big on the way here.

223
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,980
Tell him I was here. I have to go to work.

224
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,130
Hold on.

225
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,040
I don't believe you!

226
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,440
Do you know how long father's been here?

227
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,410
How could you show up this late?

228
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,930
I've been busy.
Minjung hasn't told you?

229
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,090
I know you're busy.

230
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,420
But you're Minjung's wife. Act like it.

231
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,620
Minjung spends every night here.

232
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,120
What if he gets into a car accident at work?

233
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,340
I'm a daughter in law, too,

234
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,650
so I wanted to leave you alone,

235
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,940
but you made me furious.

236
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,060
I'm going to be breathing down your neck.

237
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,800
You've been doing that already.

238
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,190
What?

239
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,810
You always pick on me.

240
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,060
That's breathing down my neck.

241
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,960
You nearly drove me mad with your nonsense.

242
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,570
I never said anything because I put Minjung's happiness first.

243
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,700
Act like a proper daughter in law.

244
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,320
Take care of him by yourself or hire a caregiver.

245
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,580
What? How can you just leave?

246
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,040
I can't do this.

247
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,580
I was in the Miss Korea pageant!

248
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,300
Miss Korea is a person, too!

249
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:01,660
Even if you were Miss Universe, now that you're someone's wife, you must act like it.

250
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,290
Minsuk,

251
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,420
he's your father, not mine.

252
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,220
Why do I have to take care of him?

253
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,750
Your father's a vice principal.
He should've taught you better than that.

254
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,600
Why do you keep bringing my father up?

255
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,770
What does my father have anything to do with this?

256
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,100
It's not like you helped him get that job.

257
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,280
You're impossible.

258
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,840
If you don't want to make your father look bad, be a good daughter in law.

259
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,060
Wha...

260
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,690
Man!

261
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,130
Parcel service!

262
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,460
Yes, I'm on my way.

263
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,790
I know you're busy.
You didn't have to come.

264
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,090
I am but I thought I'd drop by.

265
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,330
I heard you got a job.

266
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,980
Yes.

267
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,700
That must be hard.

268
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,900
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,740
Are your kids doing okay?

270
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,460
Yes.

271
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,760
The nurse asked for his urine output.

272
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,390
The urinal's right there.

273
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,500
I can't do stuff like that.

274
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,480
Just leave it.

275
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,360
Minjung can do it when he gets here.

276
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,950
Go get his food and help him eat.

277
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,480
He needs to eat, so he can take his medicine.

278
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,410
Excuse me?

279
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,420
Okay.

280
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,840
Oh, my! Ouch! Ouch!

281
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,280
Oh, man!

282
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,980
She works at the cafe at the intersection.

283
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,480
She needed something to occupy her mind.

284
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,460
When I brought you up, she just cried.

285
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,420
You think it's easy to make money?

286
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,220
Minjung.

287
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,260
How did you know?

288
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,840
I couldn't call you,

289
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,650
so I called your office and they told me.

290
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,450
Your father's hurt?

291
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:29,860
A little.

292
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,900
His surgery went well.

293
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,510
He'll have to stay here for a while.

294
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,580
Your nose is bleeding?

295
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,590
Huh?

296
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,750
Yes.

297
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,040
How?

298
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,780
It's from exhaustion, I guess.

299
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,180
Who's looking after him?

300
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,020
You're already busy with your work.

301
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,280
My family is trying to work things out.

302
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,660
I never met him before,

303
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,440
but can I come in and say hello?

304
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,700
Oh, good shot.

305
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,400
You just need a little more practice!

306
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,680
Really?

307
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,100
Doesn't my swing look great? Huh?

308
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,390
I'll take you out on your first round soon.

309
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,430
This is nutty, nutty, nuts!

310
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,280
Nutty, nutty, nuts!

311
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,430
Yes!

312
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,730
I'm home.

313
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,870
Mom, how was your day?

314
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,750
Good.

315
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,650
Where's grandmother?

316
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,500
She went out with aunt.

317
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Mom, I'm hungry.

318
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,540
I'm working, but I'm happy.

319
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,660
Mom, you're the CEO. What am I?

320
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,550
You're an employee.

321
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,780
I want to be vice president.

322
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,660
You can be whatever you want.

323
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,490
What about the rice?

324
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,300
It's ready.

325
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,890
Oh! My!

326
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,660
You're good at this.
How did you do it?

327
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,650
It's easy.
The rice cooker does it for you.

328
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,710
There's nothing hard for you, is there?

329
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,880
You're creeping me out.
And the soup?

330
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,020
Kimchi soup. There was nothing else.

331
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,610
Ugh.

332
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,040
This is just great!
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

333
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,260
Take these sandwiches.
Don't skip lunch.

334
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,000
Thanks.

335
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,420
And don't get caught working there.

336
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,550
How did you know?

337
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,320
Word travels fast in this neighborhood.

338
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,260
Don't you want to be a writer? Just write.

339
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,550
Mom, I made sandwiches. Try some.

340
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,540
Oh, you're the only one who cares about me.

341
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
You did well on the exams, didn't you?

342
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,240
Please become a judge and make mom happy.

343
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,830
Mom, mom, I'm in a hurry.

344
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,070
My boss wants me to come to work right now.

345
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,890
Haebak, can you pick up Aeji?

346
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,580
Mom's too sick to go.

347
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,900
See? This is what my life looks like.

348
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,990
Don't ever get married.
Just live with me.

349
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,620
Ugh.

350
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,640
Yes?

351
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,420
I can't come today.

352
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,000
I have to babysit.

353
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,050
Nobody cares about me.

354
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,870
What?

355
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,940
The beauty salon woman's grand opening?

356
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,420
A makeup shop?

357
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,260
Thank you.

358
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,530
Why did you get a divorce?

359
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,110
Irreconcilable differences.

360
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,090
Kids?

361
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,580
One son.

362
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,370
- How old is he?
- Three.

363
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,460
Who is raising him?

364
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,590
His mom.

365
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,530
Do you see her?

366
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,990
When I pay alimony and when my son wants to eat something special, we go out sometimes.

367
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,600
A three year old boy has cravings?

368
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,040
She's using her son as an excuse to see you.

369
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,800
Are you jealous?

370
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,080
Are you crazy?

371
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,300
Wow, the great Ms. Wang Subak is jealous.

372
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,940
She's no match for you.

373
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,660
Is there someone you're seeing?

374
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,880
What do you want to know?

375
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,220
You're married, so I can't hang my hopes on you.

376
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,650
Yes, it's me.

377
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,020
No, I've been busy.

378
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,670
Don't start whining again.

379
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,220
I'm home.

380
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,160
You're early.

381
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,490
Hey, your mom won't make us lunch,

382
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,910
so we're playing for Chinese food.

383
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,580
- So, what's happening?
- With what?

384
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,370
Oh, you said you'll find a woman for you uncle, so what's happening?

385
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,300
Your uncle can't wait any longer.

386
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,430
I'm asking around, so don't rush me.

387
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,120
If you want just anyone, that's easy.

388
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,510
But a woman who's rich and good looking isn't easy to find.

389
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,140
You sound really annoyed.

390
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,830
Did someone slap you?

391
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,830
Nobody slapped me!

392
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,280
You're making me mad!

393
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,270
Oh, boy.

394
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,720
Don't get mad. Take your son.

395
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,210
- Oh, man.
- Oh.

396
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,850
What happened to him?
Why did he get hurt?

397
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,910
I didn't do it. I don't know.

398
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,420
Hey!

399
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,660
Mom!

400
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:59,130
Mom, what happened to my son's face?

401
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,970
Kids get hurt all the time playing.

402
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,580
Kids get hurt all the time?

403
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,460
You neglected him, and he got hurt!

404
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,340
What are you doing to my kids?

405
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,540
What do you mean by that?

406
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,150
Kids get hurt all the time growing up.

407
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,910
What if he gets a scar?

408
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,080
Ugh, kids fall down! That's normal.

409
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,650
How could you say that?

410
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,600
It's better not to get hurt!

411
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,830
You feed him god knows what, you make him fall down and get hurt.

412
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,350
I can't believe you!

413
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,870
You think I have nothing else to do?

414
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,170
I took my eyes off for only a second!

415
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,150
How can you yell at your own mother like this?

416
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,870
If my son got hurt, you should've told me.

417
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,410
How could you hide it from me?

418
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:47,310
Then you raise your own kids.

419
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,480
I don't know why I even bother.

420
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Why did I ever tell you to move in?

421
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,500
Ugh.

422
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,160
You're the one who told them to move in.

423
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,730
I know.

424
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,300
And I'm being punished by having to raise her kids,

425
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,850
and look how she's yelling at me.

426
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,020
You reap what you sow.

427
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,300
You worshiped Subak when you raised her,

428
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,920
so you have to suffer the consequences.

429
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,400
She didn't worship me!

430
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,770
You don't know what you're talking about!

431
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,700
You're just snapping at everyone today!

432
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,850
Now you're turning on me?

433
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,720
Grandma, you should stay out of this!

434
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,750
Ugh, seriously!

435
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,820
How dare she! She has no appreciation!

436
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,990
I knew this would happen.

437
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,960
What do you mean?

438
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,810
You should hide your affection for your kids, not worship them like gods.

439
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,820
I knew Subak would turn on you someday.

440
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,100
Please don't add to my misery.

441
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,890
- Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.
- Ugh.

442
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,240
- What are you doing?
- Just come with me.

443
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,490
Yes, it's me.

444
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,300
What is it?

445
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,450
Are you mad?
You left without a word.

446
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,270
You were busy talking on the phone.

447
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,840
Why is Ms. Almighty acting this way?

448
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,110
Being jealous of little girls.

449
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,280
Whatever. Why did you call?

450
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,540
Because I miss you.

451
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,960
Subak, do you want me to give you a chance to make an investment?

452
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,770
Seriously?

453
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,730
If you can get some money, I'll let you in.

454
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,470
How much are you talking about?

455
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,470
More the better.

456
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,600
I'll double it within a month.

457
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,270
Oh, my, really?

458
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,460
But I don't have any money.

459
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,730
You don't have a hundred thousand?

460
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,310
If I did, I wouldn't be living this way.

461
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,080
It'll turn into two hundred thousand?

462
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,640
Of course. Get a loan or something.

463
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,340
Your father's a vice principal, right?

464
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,010
School teachers have the best credit.

465
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,090
I can't ask my father for that.

466
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,090
Isn't there another way?

467
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,070
Oh, there is.

468
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,070
What is it?

469
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,810
Gwangbak.

470
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,080
Hi.

471
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,570
Oh, my!

472
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,020
You work here?

473
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,180
You're a lowly part timer now?

474
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,660
Everyone in your family works part time, huh?

475
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,300
What do you mean?

476
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,390
Your uncle and you.

477
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,830
That's only two people.

478
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,440
Two people in one family is a lot.

479
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,940
You keep getting weirder and weirder.

480
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,490
Even your face looks odd.

481
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,320
Quitting your job made you a nobody.

482
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,460
I used to envy you as a student.

483
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,860
Oh, you're dating a high school dropout?

484
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,120
Who told you that?

485
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,460
Everyone knows it, girl.

486
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,240
I posted it on my blog and everyone went wild.

487
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,300
Hey!

488
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,580
Why would you scream?

489
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,340
There's no secret in this world.

490
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,100
how could you date a high school dropout?

491
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,360
It must be hard to go down to his level.

492
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,570
It's not like that.

493
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,570
You better watch what you say.

494
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,900
Calm down, girl.

495
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,120
Here's my business card.

496
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,300
My mom opened a makeup shop.

497
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,500
She's president and I'm vice president.

498
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,180
Oh, can I order some coffee?

499
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,330
You better say hi.

500
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,250
I'm your brother's friend!
If you do this...

501
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,210
What?

502
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,780
I won't deliver pizza to your place.

503
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,930
Hey, Don!

504
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:17,180
I don't hang out with part time workers.

505
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,620
[Vice president Heo Yeongdal]

506
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,890
Vice president...

507
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,950
Hey...

508
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,560
You don't have to call me about every little thing.

509
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,570
I'm stuck at the hospital.

510
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,860
Why did you come?

511
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,510
I brought some food.

512
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,980
He needs to eat well to get well.

513
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,510
You didn't have to.

514
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,630
You're making me feel badly.

515
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,820
If you have something to take care of,

516
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,670
I'll stay here, so go and take care of it.

517
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,190
It's okay. You're busy.

518
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,780
I'm not busy. I have time.

519
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,060
So hurry up and go.

520
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,140
I'll tell your father I'm a caregiver.

521
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,250
Well, then,

522
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,840
I'll be back soon. I'm sorry.

523
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,710
Don't say you're sorry.

524
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,520
I won those bottled water at a giveaway,

525
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,810
and I want them all delivered today.

526
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,890
I think we have to deliver them.

527
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:03,150
If we don't he'll post complaints on our site creating bad publicity.

528
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,420
Oh, it's delicious.

529
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,210
I'm glad you like it.

530
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,580
Have you been doing this for a long time?

531
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,580
Not very long.

532
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,080
I need to make money.

533
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,420
Okay.

534
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,220
How many kids do you have?

535
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,060
I have one daughter.

536
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,950
She must be pretty, if she took after you.

537
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,610
Would you like to see her picture?

538
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,940
Sure.

539
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,200
Oh, she's precious.

540
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,800
She looks smart.

541
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,100
Everyone says that.

542
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,330
Hello?

543
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,270
Sunjeong, I'm sorry.

544
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,640
I had to make some urgent deliveries.

545
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,340
I'll be there as soon as I finish this.

546
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,600
If you're in a hurry, you can leave.

547
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,040
Will you stay a little longer then?

548
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:37,960
Thanks.

549
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,380
Who is it?

550
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,420
Who are you?

551
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,990
I'm Miho.

552
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,640
Miho?

553
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,020
Oh, you're Sunjeong's daughter.

554
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,210
Open the door. I'm your aunt.

555
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,630
She has a boyfriend?

556
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,880
Yes.

557
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,050
You gave her the perfect name.

558
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,220
Does this feel good?

559
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,980
Yes.

560
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,470
Oh, you're back.

561
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,620
Thank you so much about today.

562
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,560
I shouldn't ask you to do things like this.

563
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,450
It's okay, Minjung.

564
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,750
Call me when you need me.

565
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,500
I'll come.

566
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,720
My house is pretty close.

567
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,340
This will never happen again.

568
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,640
I'm very sorry about today.

569
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,760
I said not to say you're sorry.

570
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,050
What's this?

571
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,100
It's nothing.

572
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,420
What is it?

573
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,870
It's not much.

574
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,160
Hire a caregiver with this.

575
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,140
This is too much for you.

576
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,350
- Don't do this.
- I want to.

577
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,820
This will make me feel better.

578
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,560
You can pay me back, if you want to.

579
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,770
But still, I can't take this.

580
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,580
People are watching.

581
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,940
Bye, Minjung.

582
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,160
Sunjeong, don't do this to me.

583
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,500
You're crossing the line here.

584
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,250
I couldn't handle this.

585
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,530
I'd rather die than take this money.

586
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,380
I know you care and that's enough for me.

587
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,480
Go. And don't ever come back.

588
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,840
Thanks for today.

589
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,010
Father!

590
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,150
Girl!

591
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,950
You still scream "father" when you're scared?

592
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,470
So odd. Everyone else screams "mommy."

593
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,860
Nice house.

594
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,550
How did you get in here?

595
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,020
Your daughter's a smart girl.

596
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,190
Miho!

597
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,840
Mom.

598
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,370
I said don't open the door for strangers.

599
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,100
She said she's my aunt.

600
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,250
Look what you're teaching your kid!

601
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,650
Go up to Sangnam's room.

602
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,590
Get up.

603
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,400
You're crazy.

604
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,310
Look who's talking! How could you do this?

605
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,420
Get out.

606
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,890
This is my husband and my son's house.

607
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,390
I didn't know they were loaded.

608
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,700
That's Daese's chair, so get up!

609
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,140
What the...

610
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,820
Fine, I'm getting up.

611
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,730
Happy?

612
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,900
How did you find this house?

613
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,230
Didn't Sangnam tell you?

614
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,280
He came to see me.

615
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,640
Sangnam did?

616
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,390
We're mother and son.

617
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:05,190
You can't get between us.

618
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,080
Leave before Daese comes home.

619
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,720
I didn't get a penny when I got divorced.

620
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,340
I should see him at least once.

621
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,580
Daese will never see you.

622
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,770
What did you just say?

623
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,520
You think you can get money from him?

624
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,500
That won't happen as long as I live.

625
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,650
Daese and Sangnam had a hard life.

626
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,590
What about me?

627
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,690
You think my life was peachy?

628
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,770
When they were living in this big house, I was living like a dog.

629
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,100
Now they're living with you.

630
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,810
Why are you living with Daese?

631
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,630
What are you expecting to get?

632
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,360
Watch your mouth.

633
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,710
You screwed up my life,

634
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,900
and I had to flee to Geoje-do Island.

635
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,580
I ran into Daese there by accident,

636
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,700
and I've been living in this house since then.

637
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,070
That's it?

638
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,180
What?

639
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,080
It's as if you were the lady of the house.

640
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,780
You have feelings for Daese, don't you?

641
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,140
How dare you slap me?

642
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,270
You feel guilty, don't you?

643
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,540
Our parents did a great job raising you!

644
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,280
Oh Manjeong, I'm sick and tired of you!

645
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,780
Get out! I'm going to protect Sangnam!

646
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,900
Let go of me!

647
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,370
Are you crazy?

648
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:30,520
I'm Sangnam's mom!
How dare you!

649
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,370
Get out!

650
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,540
Hey! Let go of me!

651
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,250
- Get out!
- Let go!

652
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,910
Let go! Ugh!

653
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,460
If you ever come back, I'll kill you!

654
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,620
Hey! Oh Sunjeong!

655
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,390
Let me have my shoes!

656
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,930
Hobak!

657
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,040
Oh, uncle.

658
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,500
You're home from work?

659
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,040
I have to go back later.

660
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,050
You're a busy man.

661
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,320
And you're taking classes?

662
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,730
I have to work really hard.

663
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,050
Vice president isn't enough for me.

664
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,140
I'm going to president.

665
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,710
Did you and father meet Sedal?

666
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,740
Yes.

667
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,250
Is father really angry?

668
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,630
I never saw him so angry before.

669
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,830
He took a baseball bat to beat Goof-off up.

670
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,110
And? Did he beat him up?

671
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:44,330
What do you think?
He just scared him.

672
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,620
Why didn't you talk him out of it?

673
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,690
You're worried about Sedal?

674
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,480
I was worried about your father.

675
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,050
Sedal deserves a beating.

676
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,470
I guess you're on your husband's side,

677
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,730
but I would've beaten the crap out of him.

678
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,860
Why would you break your father's heart?

679
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,860
He cried.

680
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,900
How could you make mom and father fight?

681
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,110
They don't even talk to each other.

682
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,000
This family is a mess right now.

683
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,200
Subak, I'm sorry.

684
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,480
Father says mom favors me,

685
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,860
but father's always on your side.

686
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,790
You don't think I'm upset at father?

687
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:35,160
You said you wouldn't disappoint father.

688
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,660
So show me.

689
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,570
Either divorce him or learn to control him.

690
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,010
You only have two choices.

691
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,030
Stop dragging your feet like this.

692
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,440
A married couple should be a unit.

693
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:53,130
Maybe not one unit, but still a unit of sorts.

694
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,000
Whatever.

695
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,790
You two should be as one.

696
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:16,890
Mom, I'm sorry.

697
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,170
You and father had a fight?

698
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,130
It's my fault.

699
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,070
I wanted to be happy,

700
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,090
but it didn't work out, mom.

701
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:39,980
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

702
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,200
But I don't want to do anything I'll regret.

703
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,530
Please give me some time.

704
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,870
I won't disappoint either of you.

705
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,530
Father.

706
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:10,660
You're going home?

707
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,020
Yes.

708
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,180
I heard you and mom had a fight.

709
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,620
I heard you don't talk to each other.

710
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,230
What about Sedal?
Did he call?

711
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,700
Don't worry about it, father. I'm okay.

712
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,900
When I can't handle it, I'll tell you.

713
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:31,370
Okay.

714
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,710
Go home.

715
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,770
Good night.

716
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,400
Oh, Sangnam.

717
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:03,850
What are you doing here?

718
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:06,660
I can't believe I ran into you like this!

719
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,110
I'm so happy to see you.
How have you been?

720
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,150
Are you here alone?

721
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:11,770
Can I sit down?

722
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,740
I'd like to be alone.

723
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,730
I don't know what's going on,

724
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,180
but you shouldn't drink alone like this.

725
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,640
Pour me a drink.

726
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,230
Oh, there's no food.

727
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:35,860
My treat.

728
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,790
What's good here?

729
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,350
Cheers!

730
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,240
What are you talking about?

731
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,910
I saw them with my own eyes!

732
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:58,650
They were drinking at the tent bar!

733
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,220
How could he do this to you?

734
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,690
Ugh!

735
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:06,120
Huh? Now I remember.

736
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,880
I told you about seeing Yeongdal with a man

737
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,580
in front of the movie theater, remember?

738
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,100
That was him! What a bastard!

739
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,490
He broke up with you because of Yeongdal!

740
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:20,550
Are you serious?

741
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,300
Dead serious!
He chose her over you!

742
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,890
He wouldn't do that.

743
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,680
He's not a two timer!

744
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,020
I saw them with my own eyes!

745
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,380
Gwangbak! Gwangbak!

746
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,620
Should we get another bottle?

747
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,200
No, no more.

748
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,080
Let's get one more bottle.

749
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,080
I'm drunk.

750
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,200
I'm a working man,

751
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:00,510
so I must get up on time to go to work.

752
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,280
You can skip work just one day.

753
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,990
Oh, I'll help.

754
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,400
I'm fine.

755
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,940
I can walk fine.

756
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,600
You're drunk,

757
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,530
so let's go get some coffee.

758
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,470
Yeongdal,

759
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,910
don't waste your time on me.

760
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:33,990
I

761
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,640
have someone I'm in love with.

762
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,920
Hey!

763
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:38,760
Hold on!

764
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:43,820
Good morning.

765
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,530
Hot chocolate.

766
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,450
Oh, my!

767
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,780
Oh, my! Fire!

768
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,230
You fool!

769
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,390
Look at what's happening to this family!

770
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:50,020
Why can't you get up and cook?

771
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,130
Is your back broken?

772
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,880
All you do is lie down!

773
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,020
Grandmother, stop it.
Mom's miserable.

774
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,020
Mother,

775
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,630
I'm not coming home tonight.

776
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:01,830
What?

777
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,560
Why not?

778
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,220
I'm going on a business trip.

779
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:09,020
How can you work after eating like this?

780
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,330
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

781
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,680
Gwangbak, take this medicine.

782
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,970
We need to get the fever down.

783
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:42,250
Gwangbak!

784
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,170
You haven't eaten in days.

785
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:03,720
Have some bread, okay?

786
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,330
This just might kill you.

787
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:29,050
I hope you like the perilla leaves.

788
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,330
Mmm,

789
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,660
it's good.

790
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,550
You're a great cook.

791
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,950
I'm glad you like them.

792
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:43,060
You're here.

793
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,300
Yes.

794
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:48,340
I ran over to help him with lunch.

795
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,260
She's taking great care of me.

796
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:55,030
She even made side dishes for me.

797
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,700
I'll bring some warm water.

798
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,980
What did you say?

799
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,200
Stop coming here.

800
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,140
Minjung.

801
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:14,220
I appreciate you coming here to help me.

802
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:17,740
I do, but it's not right.

803
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,210
It makes me uncomfortable and nervous.

804
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,340
I'm okay with this, so don't feel badly.

805
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,740
It's not okay.

806
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,580
You have a family and a husband.

807
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,260
What if he finds out later?

808
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,240
I was your ex-boyfriend for heaven's sake!

809
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:35,850
Put yourself in your husband's shoes.

810
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,580
If you were my wife, I couldn't understand.

811
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,280
I couldn't forgive you for that.

812
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,150
Why do you make things difficult for me?

813
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,970
I'm sorry.

814
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,750
I'm sorry I made things difficult for you.

815
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,980
But you shouldn't feel that way.

816
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,080
Just let me do what I can.

817
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,460
You need someone to take care of him,

818
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,140
but you can't afford to hire anyone.

819
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,700
This has nothing to do with you.

820
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,720
It does.

821
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,460
He's your father,

822
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,330
but you won't take my money!

823
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,920
I can't ignore you when things are hard.

824
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,370
I just can't do that.

825
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,520
So let me help you out.

826
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,210
Sunjeong,

827
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,490
I know how you feel.

828
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,490
And I appreciate it.

829
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,980
I have a conscience.

830
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,620
Go. Don't come back.

831
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,140
I don't want to see you like this.

832
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:43,590
Minjung,

833
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,850
I don't have a husband.

834
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,050
I was afraid you'd feel uncomfortable

835
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:55,690
and sad if you knew that I'm divorced.

836
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:58,930
I'm single.

837
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:25,150
[Grand opening]

838
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:46,700
What happened to Mrs. Wang?

839
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,660
She never comes to our meetings anymore.

840
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,620
It's because her son in law went bankrupt.

841
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,260
I'm sure she's embarrassed.

842
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,150
She was too much to handle, remember?

843
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:58,680
You switch sides so easily.

844
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,530
You were as thick as thieves with her!

845
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:06,470
We just pretended to be on her side.

846
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,870
Did you call your brother?

847
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:25,930
His phone was off.

848
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:27,500
I sent him a text, so he'll show up.

849
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,740
He better!

850
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:38,340
Oh, he's here! My son's here.

851
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:39,530
Sedal!

852
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:44,330
Oh, my son!

853
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:46,330
I'm glad you came.

854
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,710
This is it?

855
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:51,980
I would've opened a bigger one for you.

856
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:53,940
Did you get the tree I sent?

857
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,900
Yes.

858
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,080
Is this your car?

859
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,750
It will be.

860
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,060
Where are you staying?

861
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,220
It's top secret. I should go.

862
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:06,710
Madam Park Salla, I hope you hit the jackpot.

863
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,190
Come in and make everyone jealous.

864
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:10,470
- Huh?
- Hurry, hurry.

865
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:11,660
Oh, hold on...

866
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:12,940
Whoa!

867
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,060
Everyone, my son's here.

868
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,780
Hello.

869
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:26,730
Thank you for coming to my mother, Madam Park Salla's, grand opening ceremony,

870
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:31,770
and I'm going to take you out to a hotel buffet in the near future.

871
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,530
Wow!

872
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:35,130
He said hotel buffet.

873
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,970
Hotel buffet? How amazing!

874
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:38,010
Oh,

875
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,580
I have an important meeting,

876
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,220
so I have to say goodbye here.

877
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:46,810
I hope you and my mother remain good friends.

878
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,150
Oh!

879
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,480
Madam Park Salla.

880
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,350
Goodbye, my darling son!

881
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,530
What are you doing?
Step aside.

882
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:59,000
It's amazing.

883
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,230
What does it sound like?

884
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,110
Amazing.

885
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:02,090
Sedal!

886
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:05,020
Let's talk.

887
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,890
I have nothing to say.

888
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:10,180
Don't rat on me to your father.

889
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,290
Hey, hey!

890
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:19,080
Oh, the engine sounds amazing!

891
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,290
It's crazy!

892
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,300
Sedal's gotten so awesome, huh?

893
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,070
It's like he has transformed.

894
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:29,660
Women must fall all over him.

895
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,090
You should keep your guard up.

896
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,840
- What is it?
- Mom, where are you?

897
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,450
You said you'd be back soon!

898
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:57,340
Jungji won't stop crying!

899
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,890
And I have to go to work.

900
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:01,660
I don't care. He's your child.

901
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,030
I'm not a nanny!

902
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:06,090
Mom! Mom!

903
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:07,450
Oh, man!

904
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,880
You're materialistic.

905
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,150
You're really mean.

906
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:14,710
You make me feel embarrassed, did you know?

907
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,030
Fine.

908
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:22,020
I'm a materialistic witch.

909
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,190
So what?

910
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:29,200
I've been a housewife all my life,

911
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:34,230
and all I have to show for it is my old body,

912
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,110
and you're embarrassed?

913
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,650
Others run their own businesses,

914
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:48,220
but all I am is my daughter's nanny.

915
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,100
People respect you because of your job,

916
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:59,230
but nobody respects me! Not even you!

917
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:03,100
Do you know how I feel?

918
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:09,700
Do you?

Even when your daughter's dying,

924
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,580
all you care about is bragging to others!

925
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,910
I found a woman for Sangnam.

926
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:57,910
Okay, I'll meet her.

01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:59,670
But I told you what to do.

01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:02,550
If it goes wrong, my father would kill me.

Let's get a divorce.

01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:04,360
You!

931
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,300
Don't push me any further!
