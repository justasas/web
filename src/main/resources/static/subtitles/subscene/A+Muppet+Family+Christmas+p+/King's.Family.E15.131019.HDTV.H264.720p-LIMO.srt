00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,400
This is so unfair! Unfair!

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,150
Sintong, Bangtong, get him back for me.

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,300
What good will your learning taekwondo do

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,710
if your dad is getting beaten up like this?

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,770
What are you blabbering about?

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,850
You don't need to know.

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,710
Let me see.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,390
Stay still, please!

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,740
I didn't even touch it, crybaby!

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,990
Ice will make the swelling go down.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,150
You should've been more careful.

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,710
You fell down because you were careless.

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,100
You look like you got beat up.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,100
I didn't get beaten up!

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,040
You cause more trouble than the kids!

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,040
Massage it with this.

18
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,260
Where did you fall down?

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,050
Don't ask too many questions.

20
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,240
It's making me hungry.

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,710
It hurts to answer.

22
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,150
How will you go to work looking like that?

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,500
I already called to say I couldn't come.

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,910
And? What did he say? He said okay?

25
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,060
Of course.

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,050
I go to work and come home whenever I want.

27
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,060
Oh, don't be like that.

28
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,440
You're being too cocky because he likes you.

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,650
You should be good to him.

30
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,470
I shouldn't be too good.

31
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:34,070
I should try to keep things exciting.

32
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,070
Exciting? You're not dating!

33
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,240
- That hurts!
- Ugh!

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,300
That hurts! That really hurts! I'm not kidding!

35
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,550
I took care of it.

36
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,100
So you just focus on yourself.

37
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,680
You're a good boy.

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,800
You were worried about Hobak, weren't you?

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,710
Yes.

40
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,950
You're an interesting kid.

41
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,100
I think you're like me.

42
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,400
Oh gosh!

43
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,800
I'd like you to take that back.

44
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,510
I think he learned his lesson.

45
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,650
I'm going to keep tabs on him, too.

46
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,570
Do you even know what that means?

47
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,740
How can you even ask?

48
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,210
It means to mark where he goes with tabs.

49
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,300
That's not completely wrong.

50
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,610
Don't tell Hobak, though.

51
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,290
I know. Ignorance is bliss.

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,010
I don't have time. I'm busy.

53
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,770
But I have something to tell you.

54
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,110
I'll see you some other time. I'll call you.

55
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,010
Hey, hey! Sedal!

56
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,370
Bye.

57
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,700
Man...

58
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,010
Hello?

59
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,340
Sedal? It's me.

60
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,840
Since you bought me drinks the other night,

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,270
I want to buy you dinner.

62
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,950
Let's meet tonight. My treat.

63
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,480
I'm full.

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
And it's not like I'm craving for anything.

65
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,680
Come on! I have something to discuss with you.

66
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,270
I'm really busy these days.

67
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,870
I'll call you when I have time.

68
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,560
Hey, Sedal! Sedal!

69
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,300
As if you kept in touch with me before!

70
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,770
I can't believe you.

71
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,870
You never discussed anyone with me before.

72
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,510
You're all on your own, boys.

73
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,210
I know why you want to take me to dinner.

74
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,800
It's called the power of money.

75
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,050
You never answered my calls before,

76
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,500
afraid I'd ask to borrow some money.

77
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,840
This is how the world works.

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,760
The amazing power of money!

79
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,470
Welcome. May I help you?

80
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,310
I'm here to see the director.

81
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,700
Oh, which director?

82
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,210
I don't know his name,

83
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,070
but he's pretty young.

84
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,590
There are many directors, so I don't know...

85
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,840
Hon, how are you feeling?

86
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,250
Are you in a lot of pain?

87
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,510
Oh, you should've been more careful.

88
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,500
I can blow on it to make it better.

89
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,030
That tickles. That tickles.

90
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,250
Yes! How is it? Is it better?

91
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,830
She's one of our directors.

92
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,310
It's not her.

93
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,710
I'm looking for a young male director.

94
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,040
I don't know.

95
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,960
I'll need his name.

96
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,660
Okay.

97
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,750
Okay, honey.

98
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,810
Take care of yourself.

99
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,250
And bring me glass noodles next time.

100
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,300
The rice rolls were good, too.

101
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,600
Hello again!

102
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,040
Yup.

103
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,310
- Is anything going on?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,600
- Are you getting married?
- Yeah.

105
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,400
Is "yeah" all you can say to me?

106
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,450
Yeah.

107
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,900
- You think I'm stupid?
- Yeah.

108
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,310
Hey!

109
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,010
Just pretend you don't know me.

110
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,510
You're so annoying!

111
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,670
Why you little!

112
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,310
Hey! I'm your older brother's friend!

113
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,270
Blind date?

114
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,900
You'll never find anyone good. So try it.

115
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,230
No thanks.

116
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,540
He works at a big company.

117
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,950
Who cares about that.

118
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,600
You'll be thirty next year.

119
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,710
Do it while you're still in your twenties.

120
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,970
Men don't like unemployed girls.

121
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,340
So I won't try it.

122
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,770
When I become a famous writer,

123
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,310
I'll be making much more money than them.

124
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,970
Don't see that truck guy!

125
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,350
Yeongdal's getting married.

126
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,360
When?

127
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,150
I didn't ask.

128
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,040
She was glowing.

129
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,450
Who would marry Yeongdal?

130
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,430
She's a gold digger who wants to marry a rich man.

131
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,070
He must be totally crazy.

132
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,640
How dare you call him crazy?

133
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,990
He's not crazy.

134
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,210
What's up?

135
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,810
You're getting married?

136
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,810
Your uncle is a blabbermouth.

137
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,970
How far did you go?

138
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,400
- What?
- How far did you go with him?

139
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,380
I didn't go anywhere with him.

140
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,070
You know what I mean.

141
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,250
Did you sleep with him?

142
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,710
- What?
- I said did you sleep with him?

143
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,080
Did you or didn't you?

144
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,950
THis isn't the 19th century.

145
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,770
Nobody gets married after merely looking at each other's faces.

146
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,970
What do you mean by that?

147
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,540
Quitting your job must have made you slow.

148
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,490
But then again, you've never dated, so...

149
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,040
Gwangbak, when a man and woman decide to get married,

150
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,590
they've already crossed the river.

151
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,730
They've already done everything, stupid.

152
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,900
I'm a player.

153
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,670
Don't fall for someone like me.

154
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,870
I hate it when girls cry and get clingy.

155
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,900
Why did you come after all these years?

156
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,740
There's nothing for you here.

157
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,980
Our mother-son relationship ended long ago.

158
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,800
Don't ever come to me again.

159
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,150
The person you have called is unavailable.

160
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,840
Leave your message at the tone.

161
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,440
Gwangbak, did she do what I said?

162
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,830
Was fishing successful?

163
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,380
Yeah.

164
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,570
So they're dating now, right?

165
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,270
Yeah.

166
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,570
Things are getting more important now.

167
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,010
She must get him drunk.

168
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,940
What if he turns into a dog when he's drunk?

169
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,010
There are some dumb women who ask about

170
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,580
when they can fart in front of their men,

171
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,590
but why is that important?

172
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,750
Farting is embarrassing even when you're alone.

173
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,250
She can never fart in front of him.

174
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:19,240
And if she feels one coming when she's  with him, she should clap like this.

175
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,940
And fart really softly, and go like this.

176
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,650
Oh, why is it so hot?  Why is it so hot?

177
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,370
And she has to shake it off.

178
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,880
Did she fart in front of him?

179
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,250
No, she didn't.

180
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,070
She didn't even get the chance to do that.

181
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,630
Miho.

182
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,190
Miho.

183
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,570
I broke up with him.

184
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,270
Gwangbak.

185
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,880
I did everything you said, but he dumped me.

186
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,350
It wasn't my friend. It was me.

187
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,250
Sorry.

188
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,570
I was too embarrassed to tell you.

189
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,360
It's okay. I knew it was about you.

190
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,440
You knew?

191
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,940
Miho, I'm going to try going on a blind date.

192
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,440
I wanted to fall in love.

193
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,260
It was the first time I'd met someone so perfect, but...

194
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,680
He's not attracted to me.

195
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,940
Gwangbak, don't cry.

196
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,200
You're not "not attractive."

197
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,300
Forget all about him.

198
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,240
Your prince will come.

199
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,290
Will he?

200
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,900
Of course.

201
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,010
Gwangbak, don't worry.

202
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,970
I'll teach you more.

203
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,430
Miho.

204
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,380
She did? Is she crazy?

205
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,980
She came to my work and demanded to know if I slept with him.

206
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,750
I can see why.

207
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,570
She's not going to become a writer.

208
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,570
I pity her.

209
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,850
I envied her because she was a good student.

210
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,250
Being a good student means nothing.

211
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,170
You must wait until the end to see how your life turns out.

212
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,750
Right.

213
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,770
Why are you home so early?

214
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,380
Why aren't you out on a date?

215
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,200
He's not answering his phone.

216
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,010
Crush him.

217
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,070
He should tell you where he's going.

218
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,110
Right. I'll crush him when I marry him.

219
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,750
Oh, this is nuts.

220
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,140
Look what he did to my face!

221
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,790
Who?

222
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,760
What do you mean who?

223
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,110
It's your loser uncle.

224
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,760
What about my uncle?

225
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,160
Huh?

226
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,600
It's nothing.

227
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,900
Here.

228
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,670
Give this to your director.

229
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,090
What is it?

230
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Will it look good on him?

231
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,070
Of course it won't.

232
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,110
He doesn't wear anything like this.

233
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,670
I want to show him how grateful I am.

234
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,120
I went to see your director today.

235
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,880
What?

236
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,480
Where did you go?

237
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,950
To the hotel.

238
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,350
Hey! How dare you go there?

239
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,750
So? Did you meet the director?

240
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,900
I didn't meet him.

241
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,240
You shouldn't.

242
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,840
What's the director's name?

243
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,610
Why do you want to know that?

244
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,040
I should've asked for his name.

245
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,510
They have several directors there.

246
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,300
Of course.

247
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,610
It's a big hotel.

248
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,480
You thought there was only one?

249
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,820
What's his name?

250
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,200
It's top secret.

251
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,980
Why would his name be top secret?

252
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:13,250
Stop worrying about stuff like that and just be a good wife. And make glass noodles.

253
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,830
Glass noodles?

254
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,350
The director wants glass noodles.

255
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,620
Living in the States for so long,

256
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,110
the director misses homemade glass noodles.

257
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,400
Are glass noodles in now?

258
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,840
Oh, right. I saw a woman director there.

259
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,700
What?

260
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,800
She was very stylish.

261
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,160
Can a young woman become a director?

262
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,800
I don't know.

263
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,980
She was talking about glass noodles with someone on the phone.

264
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,070
That was then?

265
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,900
What?

266
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:52,300
I mean, when you went there,
that woman director passed you by?

267
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,940
Anyway, I'll take care of my job, so you stay out of it!

268
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,010
Before I go nuts.

269
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,240
And you wear this.

270
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,290
Hello? I came right over.

271
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,850
My boss told me to call you because you were so sincere.

272
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,350
We want to use your parcel service.

273
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,700
You do?

274
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,110
Oh...

275
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,380
Thank you.

276
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,300
Ill do a really good job.

277
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,040
You came here every day for a month.

278
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,940
That was impressive.

279
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,510
Thank you so much.

280
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,200
If you need any help, even with cleaning, call me.

281
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,270
We send a lot of fragile things,
so please pay special attention to them.

282
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,540
Of course. I won't disappoint you.

283
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,170
I'll do better than your previous company.

284
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,070
And please tell other offices about me.

285
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,130
I will. I think you're a very hard worker.

286
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,240
Thank you.

287
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,200
Is something up with Sangnam?

288
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,980
Why? He went out on business.

289
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,070
Madam Park called.

290
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,570
Madam Park?

291
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,150
I'm sure I paid my bar tab.

292
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,700
I paid for all the drinks the last time we were there.

293
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,110
It's not about the tab.

294
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,300
I feel like I'm tattle telling.

295
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,750
What is it?

296
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,200
She said Sangnam came alone during the day

297
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,200
and started drinking. He's never done that.

298
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,150
Bastard.

299
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,700
Were you playing with me?

300
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,280
You said I was your destiny!

301
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,810
Have a nice life.

302
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,800
Congratulations on getting engaged.

303
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,880
Sangnam.

304
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,040
Drink some honey tea.

305
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,080
Let's forget about what happened.

306
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,610
You've been fine without your mom all this time.

307
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,580
You should forget about that woman.

308
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,150
I'll be your mom.

309
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,230
I know I won't be enough,
but I'll be your mom.

310
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,340
Sangnam!

311
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,670
Sangnam.

312
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,100
Sangnam, Sangnam!

313
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,080
What's wrong? What happened?

314
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Sunjeong, look at me and tell me everything.

315
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,600
Why is he acting like that?

316
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,000
We met my sister.

317
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,350
- What?
- I thought he should meet her.

318
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,600
Are you crazy?
I told you not to meet her!

319
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,310
I'm sorry, Daese.
We won't meet her again.

320
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,970
We'll never meet her again.

321
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,880
Why didn't you listen to me?

322
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,110
I said I'd kick you out if you let him meet her.

323
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,580
Why didn't you listen to me?

324
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,700
Get out of my house!

325
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,080
I'm not going to live with you anymore.

326
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,440
I want you out of my house before I come home.

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,430
You're home?

328
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,740
What are those?

329
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,890
There was a sale at the department store.

330
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,970
You went to the department store?

331
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,150
Isn't this pretty? It was pretty cheap.

332
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,200
I got five for the price of one.

333
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,100
Subak, you know we can't afford this.

334
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,500
I didn't waste the money!

335
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,650
These are for our girls.

336
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,380
You hate spending money on our girls?

337
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,500
It's not that I hate it.

338
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,310
I'd like to buy them everything, if I could.

339
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,810
But we must save every penny right now.

340
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,220
It's not like they have no clothes.

341
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,440
Why did you have to buy five?

342
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,580
They grow up so fast.

343
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,050
I want Aeji to feel confident at her kindergarten.

344
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,150
Especially now that she's a new kid.

345
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,080
Confidence from clothes?

346
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,850
Of course!

347
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,440
If the kids look shabby, the moms get blamed.

348
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,380
I need this so stay out.

349
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,810
You're not even using the expensive stroller.

350
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,540
I've been using it every day.

351
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,310
Hello?

352
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,970
Subak?

353
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,930
It's me.

354
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,970
How are you?

355
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,780
Thanks.

356
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,170
Excuse me?

357
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,880
I got the money you sent.

358
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,270
But don't worry about me.

359
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,900
And don't send me any money again.

360
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,880
I can take care of myself.

361
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,670
I'm getting some money from the government.

362
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,080
I don't have much use for money here.

363
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,290
You should save money and move out.

364
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,000
What is it this time?

365
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,780
Is your father the only person who matters?

366
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,050
You sent $200 to your father,

367
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,900
and you yelled at me for buying Aeji clothes?

368
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,810
How can you send $200 to your father without talking to me first?

369
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,310
How much have you sent behind my back?

370
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,880
Tell me! How much?

371
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,810
This was the first time.

372
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,470
I felt badly about cutting him off,

373
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,650
so I sent him $200 today for the first time.

374
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,390
I can't believe you! I can't believe you!

375
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,470
I'm sorry I didn't talk to you first.

376
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,000
And how can you call him "your father"?

377
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,880
He's not my father.

378
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,500
Don't be like that, Subak.

379
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:44,400
I know you're angry, but I don't like it when you call him "your father."

380
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,350
If I were doing well, it wouldn't matter,

381
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,110
but now that this happened to me,

382
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,700
I can't seem to be able to handle it.

383
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,690
What's going on?

384
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,310
Why are you screaming again?

385
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,080
He sent money to his father.

386
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,870
What?

387
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,900
How can you do that in your situation?

388
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,550
I know.

389
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,380
He doesn't know how hard it is for me.

390
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,740
I can't help it but get mad.

391
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,740
I was in the Miss Korea pageant.

392
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,610
I used to think shopping channels were

393
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,280
beneath me, but now I shop from them.

394
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,050
I can't get spa treatments anymore,

395
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,650
and my skin is breaking out.

396
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,740
All I can afford is sliced cucumber now.

397
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,900
So how could you send him money?

398
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,650
Are you crazy?

399
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,700
Is sending $200 to my father crazy?

400
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,900
You should take care of your wife and kids first.

401
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,050
Not your father!

402
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,850
Subak, Aeji and Jungji come first.

403
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,240
I can't believe how immature men are.

404
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,150
I know. Does he want to divorce me?

405
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:52,780
You're living with your father in law,
mother in law and grandmother in law.

406
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,650
I'm sorry.

407
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,550
Just because you're wife's nagging you,

408
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,080
you can't start yelling back at her.

409
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,380
You just need to keep your mouth shut until she runs out of things to say.

410
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,810
Before you moved in, it was peaceful here.

411
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,440
You fought on the night you moved in here.

412
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,430
Don't ever fight again.

413
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,570
Move. That's my seat.

414
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,170
It's not like your name is on the seat.

415
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,880
Did you buy this table?

416
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,970
What?

417
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,670
Huh?

418
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:26,550
It's you again?

419
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,380
It's like we're mortal enemies.

420
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,670
I should move out of this neighborhood!

421
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,990
What?

422
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,080
You should say hello first!

423
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,080
How dare you call me your enemy?

424
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,170
I'm not in the mood for that.

425
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:46,670
I'm sorry, but please don't get on my nerves.

426
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh, I don't believe this!

427
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,240
You're the one who sent me to the hospital!

428
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,150
The least you can do is say hello!

429
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,390
Where did you learn your manners?

430
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,810
Didn't your parents teach you any manners?

431
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,810
Why do you always pick on me? Why?

432
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:08,170
Who are you to criticize my parents?

433
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,740
I already wish I was dead.

434
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,940
So please don't pick on me tonight.

435
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,740
Hah! I don't believe you!

436
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,240
Why are you taking it out on me?

437
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,190
Did your boyfriend dump you?

438
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,000
This is why he dumped you!

439
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,670
I bet you can't even get married.

440
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,550
What?

441
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,810
It's none of your business!

442
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,200
Why do you care if I get married?

443
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,310
What's it to you?

444
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:44,280
I'm right! Your boyfriend dumped you!

445
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Did you see me get dumped? Did you?

446
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,670
I don't have to.

447
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:56,400
Seeing you drink beer here is proof enough.

448
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,110
Stop taking pictures!

449
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,700
It's obvious to me, too!

450
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:09,440
You drinking beer here tells me how your family is doing.

451
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,740
Your wife kicked you out, didn't she?

452
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Stop taking pictures!

453
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,390
Turn that off!

454
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,670
You're wrong.

455
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,200
I don't have a wife.

456
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,080
Upsetting, isn't it?

457
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,610
Oh, now I know.

458
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,400
She ran away because you're like this!

459
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,050
You look like a lonely old man.

460
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,350
I feel bad for your children.

461
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,850
What?

462
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,550
What is this ugly girl saying?

463
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,050
Ugly words from an ugly girl.

464
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,810
What?

465
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,110
How dare you call me ugly?

466
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,670
Why did you see a urologist?

467
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,440
What did you do to get injured there?

468
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,850
Oh, it's disgusting.

469
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,720
What? What? Disgusting?

470
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,310
Stop filming me!

471
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,470
What are you doing?

472
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:10,890
Why you little! How dare you!

473
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,780
You should apologize to each other.

474
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,900
It's not like you had a fist fight.

475
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,960
- No.
- No.

476
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,740
Are you going to sue?

477
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,350
Yes, I'm going to sue for defamation.

478
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,380
I'm going to do that, too.

479
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,700
And assault. Verbal abuse is assault.

480
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,080
He picked on me and belittled me.

481
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,170
And include blackmail.

482
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:44,550
He threatened me to pay for his medical bill.

483
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,550
That wasn't blackmail. That was just!

484
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:52,770
I had to see my doctor one more week because of you!

485
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:02,970
You bumped into me here and made me cry,
and I had to walk around like this!

486
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,970
Sit down!

487
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,690
Okay.

488
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,280
Fine. Let's take this all the way.

489
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,150
I have nothing to lose.

490
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,900
Me neither.

491
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,170
Then you two are suing each other.

492
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,800
Let's go to the police station.

493
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,870
Get out.

494
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,960
We're here. So get out.

495
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,350
We don't have time. Hurry up.

496
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,040
Well...

497
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,310
You go first.

498
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,780
Age before beauty. You go first.

499
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,740
I'm okay with this,

500
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,380
but it looks like you're not even married,

501
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,740
and I don't want to see your parents being

502
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,050
dragged into this and getting upset.

503
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,970
And you'll never find a husband.

504
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,670
I'm fine with this,

505
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,150
but it looks like you have a family to take

506
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,270
care of and I can't make you a criminal.

507
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,350
Let's never see each other again.

508
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,710
I know.

509
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,480
Oh, boy.

510
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,040
Miho!

511
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,600
Miho!

512
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,260
Miho!

513
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,190
Stop! Stop!

514
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,960
Daese.

515
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,230
I'm going to work.

516
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,950
Why won't you play with us?

517
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,650
He's lost his mind, so how could he?

518
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,410
What are they saying?

519
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,200
They're mad because you don't play with them.

520
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,800
Sintong, you shouldn't get mad.

521
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,610
Don't get mad.

522
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,910
Say goodbye.

523
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:32,610
Dad, make lots of money.

524
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,110
Money is all you talk about. Ugh.

525
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:39,230
See you later. And don't fall down.

526
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,550
Mom.

527
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,650
What is it?

528
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,610
Dad got another weird text.

529
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,970
It's spam.

530
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,550
Didn't it say girls and liquor?

531
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,700
Don't spy on dad's phone.

532
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,200
It said "honey."

533
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,700
And it said "kiss, kiss."

534
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,180
That's what they always say.

535
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,080
They call everyone that.

536
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,340
Stop worrying about that and go study.

537
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,080
The same thing happened to my friend's dad.

538
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,740
And his parents got divorced.

539
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,700
Stop talking nonsense and do your homework!

540
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,240
We'll visit grandfather's school when you're done.

541
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,010
Honey, I'm home.

542
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,240
Honey, welcome home.

543
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,070
Dad.

544
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,290
Oh, my baby. Did you have a good day?

545
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,510
Honey, here's your dinner.

546
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,700
Okay.

547
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,500
Have some.

548
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,800
Yum, yum...

549
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,240
Is it good?

550
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,840
It is good, honey.

551
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,660
Then may I have a kiss?

552
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,430
Stop kissing her and come out.

553
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,900
Okay.

554
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,150
Clean the yard.

555
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,510
Take the trash out,

556
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:01,870
wash the pots over there. Do it together.

557
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,510
Okay.

558
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,910
I wish they'd do it without me asking.

559
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,910
I can't believe I have to ask.

560
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,800
And clean the bathrooms.

561
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,550
Minjung, clean the upstairs bathroom,

562
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,880
and uncle, you take the downstairs one.

563
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,040
- How about you?
- Taking care of my baby.

564
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,390
Uh...

565
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,140
Oh, no!

566
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,380
What's this?

567
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,950
How could you break the soy sauce pot?

568
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,200
I can't believe you did this.

569
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Oh, what do we do about the soy sauce?

570
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,570
I was saving it for special dishes.

571
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:11,170
Why can't you do anything right?

572
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,070
I'm sorry.

573
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,780
Who did this?
Was it you, Minjung?

574
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,840
How can you be so careless?

575
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,340
How can you deliver parcels the way you are?

576
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,740
If I asked you to clean again,

577
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,150
the house would be in ruins!

578
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,200
Did you clean the bathroom?

579
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,650
Yes.

580
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,940
Don't stand there like an idiot. Take these out.

581
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,230
What's this?

582
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,070
I don't know. Who put this here?

583
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,290
Oh, they're chestnuts.

584
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,610
Oh, boy.

585
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:32,150
They're wild chestnuts. Yummy.

586
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,610
He sends them every year. Boil some.

587
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,070
Bugs got to them first.

588
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,680
Huh? What's this?

589
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,680
- Chestnusts.
- Did Minjung's father send them?

590
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,260
He should've called first.

591
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,110
He just left them by the door.

592
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,050
He didn't even come in?

593
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,680
He must have heard you yelling at Minjung.

594
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,050
It must have been then.

595
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,550
As if he was spying on how Minjung's doing.

596
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,970
How can he just leave without coming in?

597
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,450
This reminds me of your mother.

598
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,380
Excuse me?

599
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,950
When you married my son, your mother came

600
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:11,300
to our town and spied on you. Remember?

601
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,380
Too bad.

602
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,050
With your brain, you could've been successful.

603
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,110
Are you teasing me?

604
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,960
I won't answer that.

605
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,410
You can buy chestnuts in Seoul,

606
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,740
so why did he bring them and cause trouble?

607
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:37,700
I'm sorry my father came here without calling.

608
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,150
Don't eat them.

609
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,880
Why were you eavesdropping?

610
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,380
I listened because I could hear it.

611
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,410
You never appreciated anything my father sent.

612
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,910
He worked hard for these chestnuts.

613
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,110
It's not like I said anything.

614
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,430
Subak.

615
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,180
Minjung, it wasn't like that.

616
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,280
It's not like we made stuff up.

617
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,680
We must be some really honest people.

618
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,840
What are you talking about?

619
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,970
We say what we want to say, no matter what.

620
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:05,300
She was talking nonsense, that's why.

621
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,340
He should've called first.

622
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,840
How can he just toss it by the door?

623
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,150
Right. My father shouldn't have done that.

624
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,690
I'll tell him never to come again.

625
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,280
Why are you overreacting?

626
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,840
Fine. I'm overreacting.

627
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,910
Minjung, we'll eat them.

628
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,910
They are wild chestnuts and they are good.

629
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,180
Being really honest isn't a good thing.

630
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,170
We should watch what we say.

631
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,470
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

632
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,200
Forget the painful memories of the past

633
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Like passing wind

634
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,910
You are not alone anymore

635
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,700
You have your beloved, me!

636
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,610
Be still!

637
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,550
For I'll do everything for you!

638
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,450
Is this a dream or reality?

639
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,070
Don't be confused

640
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:03,740
Didn't know it then

641
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:11,880
Make me your home

642
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,040
Make me... Home...

643
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,770
Okay! The moment you've been waiting for!

644
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,100
What was that?

645
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,010
What's wron here?

646
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,970
I could do this before.

647
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,690
Women used to line up to hear it pop.

648
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,700
How boring.

649
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,790
I'm bored.

650
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,240
What should we do?

651
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,910
Let's go for a drive. Get the car.

652
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,280
I'll be right out after I change.

653
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,150
Okay.

654
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,150
Oh, my!

655
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,740
Hey, what's wrong with you?

656
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,070
Go.

657
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,430
Hey, Loser.

658
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,010
Fine.

659
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,730
To where?

660
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,670
Hey!

661
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,500
I have to answer it. It's my job.

662
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,010
Oh, man.

663
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,020
The phone is off...

664
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,450
I'm sorry I beat you up that day.

665
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:17,840
Did you have to apologize here?

666
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,030
If I don't answer quickly, she gets mad.

667
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,340
Fine, fine.

668
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,050
Remember what we used to say when we ran

669
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,740
out of money while playing arcade games?

670
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,430
We used to say we'd sell our souls for money.

671
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:39,400
That we'd become old women's boy toys.

672
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:42,410
We survived on $3 a day,

673
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:45,190
not being able to get a decent job,

674
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,800
working here and there part time,

675
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,570
and being looked down on by our families.

676
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:59,070
You and I were Goof-off and Loser, the duo, for over 20 years now.

677
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,680
It's been that long?

678
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,780
That sounds too long.

679
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,800
So how could you assault me like that?

680
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,790
Sedal,

681
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,070
I understand you,

682
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:14,840
no matter what people say.

683
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:19,300
We were willing to be an old woman's boy toy,

684
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,740
and a hot, rich woman appeared before you.

685
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,040
Of course you fell for her.

686
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:31,970
Who wouldn't fall for her?

687
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,380
Right?

688
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,300
It's really nuts.

689
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:40,150
Blood is thicker than water, and money is thicker than blood.

690
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,300
Says who?

691
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,460
Me.

692
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:50,240
Everyone said this the other night.

693
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,200
That they'd do anything if they can find a rich woman.

694
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,760
These days, both men and women dream of becoming Cinderella.

695
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:08,550
Women dream of Prince Charming,
and men dream of rich, fat women.

696
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:11,300
But Goof-off,

697
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,800
you are

698
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,280
just a toy to her.

699
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,110
She's not a rich, fat woman,

700
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,540
so why would she fall for you?

701
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:28,370
She's fooling around with you out of loneliness after coming back from the States.

702
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:36,880
Nobody would care if I sold my soul, but not you.

703
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,770
You have a wife and children.

704
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,780
Even if money was thicker than blood,

705
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,780
this isn't right.

706
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:11,740
Who is it?

707
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,330
Parcel service!

708
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,330
Wow, parcel service!

709
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:25,370
Please sign here.

710
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:31,010
My kids love seeing you.

711
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:34,610
Oh, thank you.

712
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,300
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

713
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,450
Goodbye.

714
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,670
Bye.

715
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,880
Goodbye. Thank you.

716
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,170
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

717
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,180
Hello?

718
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,970
These are for delivery.

719
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,290
Thank you.

720
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,800
Come with us.

721
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,100
What's wrong?

722
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,200
You don't know?

723
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,180
There's something called business ethics.

724
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,890
How dare you steal this from me?

725
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,880
Do you know how hard it was to get that job?

726
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,540
I should kill you!

727
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:48,150
Don't! You don't want to go to prison.

728
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,910
Let go!

729
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:59,370
Don't ever show your face in our district.

730
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,410
I can't believe you did this.

731
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,970
Why can't you do anything right?

732
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:28,470
Sorry. Something came up.

733
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,010
Get up.

734
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:32,010
Huh?

735
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:33,780
Come on...

736
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,870
Can't you hear me?

737
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,020
Are you angry with me?

738
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,200
Why didn't you answer the phone?

739
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,550
I told you to answer before the third ring.

740
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,300
Actually...

741
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,380
You said you'd do anything I asked.

742
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,110
You broke the contract.

743
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:53,190
How dare you?

744
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,910
It wasn't like that.

745
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,950
I won't stand for this.

746
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:02,110
You're fired.

747
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,040
Excuse me?

748
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,280
The car key.

749
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,240
Excuse me?

750
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,270
The car key.

751
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,320
The credit card.

752
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,300
Excuse me?

753
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,530
Don't make me repeat myself. It's no fun.

754
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,140
Get out.

755
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:58,390
Parcel service.

756
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:01,870
Parcel service.

757
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,830
Parcel service.

758
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,200
Parcel service!

759
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:21,070
It's parcel service!

760
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,950
What was that?

761
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,700
Who delivers parcels this late at night?

762
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,010
I didn't order anything.

763
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:29,610
Parcel service!

764
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:30,550
Oh, boy.

765
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:33,070
It's parcel service!

766
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:35,330
What's wrong with you?

767
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,510
You all came out.

768
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:46,910
You all came out to get your parcels.

769
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:52,010
I don't ever see you when I come home,

770
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:57,450
but you came out at the sound of "parcel service."

771
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,510
Why are you doing this?

772
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:02,010
Are you drunk?

773
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:05,340
If you're drunk, go upstairs to your room.

774
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,450
Yes, I did have a few drinks.

775
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:13,070
But I'm not drunk.

776
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:15,840
I feel completely sober.

777
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,350
Let's go up. You're drunk.

778
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,240
I'm not drunk!

779
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,700
Then what's this about?

780
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,540
Be quiet.

781
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:30,930
Am I really family to you?

782
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:37,380
Other families love to see me.

783
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,370
Why?

784
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,390
Because I'm the parcel service guy.

785
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:47,970
Everyone in Korea loves to see me.

786
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,180
Parcel service!

787
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:53,780
When I say that, even puppies come running.

788
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,740
That's who I am.

789
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:02,110
But when I come here,

790
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:04,500
I'm invisible.

791
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,400
Nobody's happy to see me.

792
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,410
When I come home from work,

793
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,970
I want the lights to be on,

794
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:23,340
I want you to greet me with smiles,

795
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:27,450
ask me if I'm hungry and get me food,

796
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:31,050
look into my eyes,

797
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:35,610
and ask me about my day.

798
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:38,010
That's the life I want.

799
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:42,200
I want to be treated with decency.

800
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:48,940
I came home after a long day of delivery parcels to strangers homes,

801
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:55,680
and nobody's glad to see me.

802
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,740
I never get to see you.

803
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:02,650
I go to work alone and come home alone.

804
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:05,430
Who am I?

805
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:10,060
Am I not family to you?

806
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,910
Display the new items

807
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,110
where the customers can see,

808
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:24,550
and please keep the shop tidy.

809
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,300
This is our company's best shop,

810
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,700
so please make sure it's always clean.

811
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,870
I will.

812
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,490
What is it?

813
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,500
Really?

814
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,500
Okay.

815
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,950
Make sure you look good.

816
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,370
I hate ugliness.

817
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:20,940
Thank you.

818
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,780
Is today a special day?

819
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,510
It's not a special day.

820
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:32,950
But it's going to be a good day for us.

821
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,380
A good day?

822
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,700
What is it? It's not my birthday.

823
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,830
Not our anniversary, either.

824
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:42,240
Did you get promoted?

825
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,500
Let's have dinner first.

826
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:03,580
Scalloped potatoes, caprese salad, and chickpea soup.

827
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:09,050
Squid ink croutons with seasame sauce caviar mixed with 25 year old balsamic vinegar.

828
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:12,410
And yellowtail ceviche with bell pepper and onion.

829
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:13,800
And we'll go with short loin.

830
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,450
Not too rare. Medium well done.

831
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:20,470
As for dessert, macaron, facquoise and florentine.

832
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:26,500
Oh, for wine, let's go with a vinage one, nothing too heavy.

833
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,200
You know all that?

834
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,040
Of course.

835
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:55,410
Oh, my.

836
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:58,280
Why did you order so much?

837
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,740
I thought your order was a bit long.

838
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,880
Isn't this expensive? How much is it?

839
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,380
Stop talking about money and just eat.

840
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:07,700
The director gave me a gift certificate.

841
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:11,680
It's your favorite. It's "free." Okay?

842
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,240
Oh, I should've brought Sintong and Bangtong.

843
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,650
Stop saying stuff like that and let's eat.

844
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:25,450
Like my mom says, I can't believe my eyes.

845
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:28,660
I've never had such food before!

846
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:31,970
You can't believe I'm here, right?

847
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:35,960
I can't believe my ears.

848
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,110
Can we get a doggy bag for these?

849
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:43,050
I know you can finish that.

850
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:45,840
You just might come after my food.

851
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,280
Oh, it just melts in my mouth.

852
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,680
So what's going on?

853
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,510
Let's finish eating first.

854
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,540
Talk to me.

855
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,690
Then you wouldn't be able to eat.

856
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:00,110
Don't you know me?

857
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:01,380
Even when there's thunder and lightening,

858
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,700
even when there's a war,

859
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,240
even when the world falls apart, I can eat.

860
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,870
And I've never had anything like this before.

861
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,000
What is it?

862
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,010
Didn't Minjung's father say anything?

863
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,800
He never came inside.

864
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,150
Minjung's father was here?

865
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,450
Why did he have to pack them for us?

866
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:02,570
It's going to go into the trashcan anyway.

867
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,180
Is that all you can say?

868
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,300
Don't eat it.

869
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,200
Don't eat the food my father gave me.

870
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,150
I won't.

871
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:11,150
Get married within this year if you can.

872
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:12,050
Do you understand?

873
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:15,950
She's meeting someone to get married.

874
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:18,770
Did you share the rice rolls I made with her?

875
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:20,780
You give me $3 a day,

876
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,410
but she gave me a $100,000 credit card!

877
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,050
I don't need you, either.

878
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,780
This is beyond nuts!

879
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,230
How much will it take?
