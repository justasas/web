00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,820
It's yummy. 

3
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,320
The flavors are alive. 

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,680
My lovely brother, did you enjoy that? 

5
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,450
Be yourself. You're creeping me out. 

6
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,490
Why did you drop out of school? 

7
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,220
Uh, how did you find out? 

8
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,210
Oh, my homeroom... 

9
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,450
Does the geezer know? 

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,770
Geezer? How dare you! He's your dad! 

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,380
All the kids call him the geezer. 

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,640
If I don't call him that, they'll find out. 

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,730
Nobody at school knows you're his son? 

14
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,870
Nope. 

15
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,560
Who was that truck guy? 

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,870
You want to know?
It'll cost you 50 cents. 

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,100
I said who is he? 

18
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:10,390
Must you bring that up at a local pizzeria where they serve delicious pizza? 

19
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,170
Why are you following a stranger around? 

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,950
What if he's a human trafficker? 

21
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,420
What if he makes you beg for money? 

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,890
What if he sells you to a shrimp ship? 

23
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,700
I'm not a kid.
Don't you know me at all? 

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,650
Don't you feel bad for dad? 

25
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,390
I said I'll hold his memorial services! 

26
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,560
So what's the problem here? 

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,070
It's not the memorial services I'm worried about. 

28
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,290
Look at uncle, your second brother in law and me! 

29
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,390
How do you think our family will turn out? 

30
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,710
Really messed up? 

31
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,330
Incredible. 

32
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,100
Give me Truck's number. 

33
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,940
I don't know the truck's number. 

34
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,160
I mean the truck owner's number. 

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,130
- Dream on.
- What? 

36
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,120
Don't you ever look in the mirror? 

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,620
He's way out of your league. 

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,820
Ouch, man... 

39
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,730
Excuse me, you shouldn't do that here. 

40
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,600
Really? They found her? 

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,680
It's not 100%. 

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,530
They said they'll call me tomorrow. 

43
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,400
I tried so hard, but I couldn't find her. 

44
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,740
I looked for her for 3 years in Geoje-do Island. 

45
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,580
Auntie, don't tell father. 

46
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,420
I won't. He'd kick me out if he knew. 

47
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,740
I really hope you find her this time. 

48
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,740
You should meet with her at least once. 

49
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,990
Meet with her and get it off your chest. 

50
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,000
- You're home.
- Yes. 

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,580
Daese, did you have dinner? 

52
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,530
I ate already. 

53
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,710
Oh, my doctor said not to touch this part. 

54
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,930
Oh, I'm furious.
I should be better by now. 

55
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,000
So rude!
Wait until I meet her again! 

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
- Who?
- You don't know her. 

57
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,580
Oh, what happened with Mr. Kim? 

58
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,870
It's not broken, but he pulled a ligament. 

59
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,510
He was lucky. 

60
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,230
My skin's all rough,  

61
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,930
and my emotions are also all rough... Ugh. 

62
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,590
Would you like to go to Jeju-do Island after this? 

63
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,840
We can play golf. 

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,630
You can go to the spa and get a massage. 

65
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,910
Hey, let's play for money. 

66
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,630
Let's not let the other get off easy. 

67
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,640
I've been getting real good distance, 

68
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,370
since I have nowhere else to use my energy. 

69
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,270
That means nothing. You must finish well. 

70
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,040
Like this! 

71
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,890
Yes! Ouch, ouch... 

72
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,550
Play with me.
Play with me and my doll. 

73
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,250
Oh, man! 

74
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,120
Play with me, mom. 

75
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,330
Ugh! Get away from me! 

76
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,900
- Play with me!
- You're so annoying! 

77
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,210
Okay, next!
Bangtong, you're done! Yes. 

78
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,630
Get dressed. Let's make rice rolls and go visit your granddad at his school. 

79
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,660
Yay! Nice! 

80
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,600
Oh, but it's Sunday. 

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,420
He goes to school, even on Sundays. 

82
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,760
Mom, let's go to the amusement park. 

83
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,590
All my friends have gone. 

84
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,110
Ugh! 

85
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,690
You know how expensive that is? 

86
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,780
You think money grows on trees? 

87
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,340
We will go. 

88
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,570
When? When? 

89
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,410
When we move to an apartment. 

90
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,360
Then I'll take you to the amusement park. 

91
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,870
And buy you pizza, too! 

92
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,680
I'd grow old and die before then! 

93
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,150
How rude! 

94
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,140
I'm older than you,
but I'm saying nothing. 

95
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,620
Mom. 

96
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,510
Lucky you.
You can make money. 

97
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,230
Make money? 

98
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,740
Go to your sister's place. 

99
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,770
Her housekeeper quit. 

100
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,750
Why? 

101
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,280
- Auntie.
- Aeji, poor baby. 

102
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,110
Auntie will play with you. 

103
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,590
Why did she quit? 

104
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,830
I don't know. 

105
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,130
He fired her without talking to me. 

106
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,300
Minjung did? 

107
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,800
He told me to do the housekeeping! 

108
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,330
I yelled at him because of my credit cards. 

109
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,600
No, I can finally breathe. 

110
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,240
I can't take care of my children. 

111
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,390
Oh, Jungji, you're precious. 

112
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,130
Oh, you're so good. 

113
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,790
- Sintong, stop!
- No way. 

114
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,890
Grandpa, I can't catch him. 

115
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,100
Sintong, stop! 

116
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,210
It'd be fun to go as couples. 

117
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,600
When you go into the blue waters of Maldives, 

118
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,020
oh, it's like heaven. 

119
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,860
Guam's nice, too, and we can go shopping. 

120
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,520
Or should we go to Hong Kong? 

121
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,790
That must really hurt. 

122
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,260
Be careful not to bump into anything. 

123
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,940
Oh, no... 

124
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,270
A woman? 

125
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,440
Is there proof? 

126
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,400
I have a feeling. 

127
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,220
Minjung isn't the type. 

128
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,990
You can never be sure. 

129
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,180
Anyway, Aeji seems to have lost weight. 

130
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,700
She's beyond picky about her food. 

131
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,920
And Jungji's so cranky at bedtime. 

132
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,830
Both girls are so difficult. 

133
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,850
Rich children are supposed to be difficult. 

134
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,100
Should we get them some Chinese medicine? 

135
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,760
Don't feed her. 

136
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,020
When my kids complain,
I take the food away. 

137
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,730
I let them go hungry and got rid of snacks. 

138
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,940
Now they eat everything I give them. 

139
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,190
She's not like your kids! 

140
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,800
She's different from poor kids. 

141
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,350
Sit back down.
I have the perfect solution. 

142
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,460
It works every time. 

143
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,740
- Yes, Subak?
- Hurry, hurry. 

144
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,150
- I can't. I'm outside.
- She's crying! 

145
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,820
Oh, man. 

146
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,870
Hold on. 

147
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,900
See? It worked. 

148
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,870
Gwangbak's barking put her right to sleep. 

149
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,940
I was wondering what that sound was about. 

150
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,470
Anyway, Gwangbak's been giving me insomnia. 

151
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,550
Let her be.
She can take care of herself. 

152
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,570
This month's allowance. 

153
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,230
You're the best. 

154
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,510
My precious, precious daughter. 

155
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,080
Dinner's ready. 

156
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,890
Thank you. 

157
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm going.
Mom, you're staying, right? 

158
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,040
I should prepare dinner for Minjung. 

159
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,210
Hobak, over there. 

160
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,760
You never help her out for free. 

161
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,740
You must've gotten rich off her! 

162
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,780
I have a money room.
It reeks of money. 

163
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,480
You know how great that smells? 

164
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,990
If you have clothes you don't wear,
can I have them? 

165
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,320
But you never wear anything I give you. 

166
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,820
And you don't carry the bags I give you. 

167
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,910
I wear them when I go to work. 

168
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,120
Give me everything you don't need. 

169
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,320
You don't even look good in them. 

170
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,090
I'd take them if I could wear them. 

171
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,490
Subak, you looked great in anything. 

172
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,090
And Hobak looked awkward in everything. 

173
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,580
You were Chunhyang, and she was Hyangdan. 

174
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,520
Why don't you quit your job and work here? 

175
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,540
- Huh?
- I pay you well. 

176
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,350
Quit that dumb job. 

177
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,470
It's not dumb. 

178
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,630
That's a great idea. 

179
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,390
Quit your job and work at your sister's. 

180
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,820
I'd do it in a heartbeat. 

181
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,080
Minjung. 

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,010
- You came for a visit?
- Yes. 

183
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,700
Where's your car? 

184
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,890
It's at the shop. 

185
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,340
You haven't had dinner, have you? 

186
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,180
I made zucchini soybean paste stew. 

187
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,470
Is something wrong? 

188
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,470
No. Why? 

189
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:38,140
You fired the housekeeper out of the blue,
and you don't look very happy. 

190
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,020
I'm just tired.
I'll see you again. 

191
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,360
Yes, Minjung. Take care. 

192
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,020
Hobak. 

193
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,400
Yes? 

194
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,640
What is it? 

195
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,620
Do you have something to tell me? 

196
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,130
Uh, no. Maybe later. 

197
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,270
Bye. 

198
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,910
I can eat by myself. 

199
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,830
It's okay. I want to do this. 

200
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,230
And Minjung, be honest with me. 

201
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,620
Why did you fire the housekeeper? 

202
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,080
Are you trying to teach Subak a lesson? 

203
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,950
She should run the house and raise the kids. 

204
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,040
But she doesn't know how to do anything. 

205
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,240
She never washed so much as one pair of undies herself. 

206
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,410
You know how I raised her like a princess. 

207
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,170
She was even in the Miss Korea pageant. 

208
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,600
But she's a mom with two daughters. 

209
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
She should be able to do anything. 

210
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Are you having an affair? 

211
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,860
Of course not. 

212
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,860
No. Right? 

213
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,230
You won't find a woman like Subak anywhere. 

214
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,230
Go look. 

215
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,840
She's pretty and lovely. 

216
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,570
What else would you need in a woman? 

217
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,660
What is it?
Did it go down the wrong way? 

218
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,030
Drink some water, here, here, here. 

219
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,510
More, more, more, 

220
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,650
Mom, should I get a face lift, like this? 

221
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,160
I look 10 years younger, don't I? 

222
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,910
You already look young. 

223
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,480
I asked and there's no other woman. 

224
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,480
No? 

225
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,090
All my friends husbands have girlfriends. 

226
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,480
Be nice to him. 

227
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,590
Where would you find another man like him? 

228
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,210
He's handsome, rich, good tempered. 

229
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,390
If he were available, women would line up. 

230
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,200
But where would he find a woman like me? 

231
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,260
Everyone thinks I'm younger than my age. 

232
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,530
Mom, would you like to get a face lift? 

233
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,960
I would love to. 

234
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,110
Oh, my, it looks so nice. 

235
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,300
Right? 

236
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,820
Oh, what the hell?
Should I just get it? 

237
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
What could your father do after it's done? 

238
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,360
He can't un-lift it, right? 

239
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,410
Right. Just go for it.
Who cares? 

240
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,190
Here. 

241
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,530
Oh, my! These are all luxury brands! 

242
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,020
They are in great condition! 

243
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,250
Hobak, where did you get these? 

244
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,370
Pick what you want.
Aren't they pretty? 

245
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,490
Give me a good deal on this. 

246
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,620
Don't worry,
I will give you a great deal. 

247
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,540
Hey, this would look great on you. 

248
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,830
$100. 

249
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,020
Yes! 

250
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,390
$100. Okay. 

251
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,220
Mom. 

252
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,140
A big hair salon is opening down the street. 

253
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,260
Thinking about that is making me so angry. 

254
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,140
What can I do with such a tiny shop? 

255
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,660
Why can't you find a rich man? 

256
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,570
I don't know what you do when you go out. 

257
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,750
What do you think I'm doing? 

258
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,710
I've been looking for a rich, handsome man who would love me and nobody else. 

259
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,000
Don't just meet anyone.
Find the right one. 

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,730
Look at the vice principal's daughter Subak. 

261
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,650
That's how you become a good daughter. 

262
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,950
Just wait. 

263
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,520
Don't compare me to her. 

264
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,290
Oh, ask Hobak to lend you money. 

265
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,170
She's always saving money. 

266
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,880
I'm sure she has some tucked away. 

267
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,040
Why didn't you come in? 

268
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,340
I missed you, uncle. 

269
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,410
I wish other women missed me like you. 

270
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,370
It's already been a month? 

271
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,240
It's only $100. 

272
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,530
But you don't even give your husband money. 

273
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,650
When this happens, I feel real awkward. 

274
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,990
So you know this is awkward? 

275
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,560
Of course, I do. Look. 

276
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,190
Awkward. 

277
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,980
What life? 

278
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,780
"If you don't own, you rent. 

279
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,730
Either unemployed or have a part time job." 

280
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,650
I'm giving it to you so you'd stop saying that 

281
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,220
and so you don't need to ask dad for money. 

282
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,410
Bye. 

283
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,110
Write them all down. 

284
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,640
I'll pay you back tenfold. 

285
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,910
- Uncle, what's your dream?
- What? 

286
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,910
Forget it. 

287
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,600
There's no way you'd have a dream. 

288
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,660
Yum! 

289
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,930
Mom! 

290
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,380
Come, come. 

291
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,570
Hobak, come. 

292
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,220
What's the occasion?
Why are we eating out? 

293
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,730
I was craving meat. 

294
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,940
And your kids haven't had meat in a while. 

295
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,730
They are going nuts. 

296
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,810
You move over there.
You come sit here. 

297
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,730
Hobak, sit here. 

298
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,700
Mom likes Hobak better than me. 

299
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,700
Bet this place is expensive. 

300
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,910
We could've eaten this at home. 

301
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,330
Then you couldn't eat for you'd be cooking. 

302
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,750
Before you eat, think about your faults. 

303
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,680
What? 

304
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,080
Try to be more like my mom. 

305
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,650
She's generous and cool.
How nice is that? 

306
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,170
You never treated us to pork belly before. 

307
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,270
She will, in the future. 

308
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,820
Yes! Why do you think she's making money? 

309
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,000
She's doing it to spend it on all of us. 

310
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,670
I'm right, aren't I? 

311
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,420
Yes. 

312
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,470
Eat up. 

313
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,920
You're the pillar of this family so you should take good care of yourself. 

314
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,410
I'm the pillar. 

315
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,700
Don't play favorites. 

316
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,500
She's the type who's good at making money, 

317
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,160
and I'm the type who's bad at making money. 

318
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,540
That's called irreconcilable differences. 

319
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,330
Number 1 reason for divorce. 

320
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,250
Yeah, right! You should try harder. 

321
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,000
Where could you find a woman like Hobak? 

322
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,370
Right. 

323
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,490
Forget the kids.
You eat. 

324
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,690
Your husband or kids won't appreciate it. 

325
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,370
There's no need for you to worry about them. 

326
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,900
Eat two pieces at a time. 

327
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,890
Until you feel like you're getting indigestion. 

328
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,960
You can take medicine later. 

329
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,950
After you eat, let's go to my shop. 

330
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,840
Your shop? 

331
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
Your hair needs trimming. 

332
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,510
I want to do my only daughter in law's hair. 

333
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,960
Wow! 

334
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,170
I can't stop eating. 

335
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,280
I haven't had meat in such a long time that my bones make sounds when I walk. 

336
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,140
Creak, creak. See? 

337
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,840
Creak, creak, creak, creak. See? 

338
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,520
Mom, can I order more? 

339
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,250
Fine. Eat up and get all greasy. 

340
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,730
Hello? Give us 3 more portions. Hello? 

341
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,680
What's wrong with my eyes? Ouch. 

342
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,160
Hobak, Hobak, say ah. 

343
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,530
Oh, my! You look beautiful. 

344
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,190
Hobak, you're so pretty. 

345
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,830
This doesn't feel right. 

346
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,110
What's going on? 

347
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,290
Oh, you're so sharp. 

348
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:13,400
Hobak, do you know why I keep working despite my terribly aching joints? 

349
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,190
It's to feed your kids. 

350
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:22,420
But my shop is so tiny that I can't really make much money. 

351
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,780
Oh, I need to put my kids to bed. 

352
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,150
Hobak, you have money, don't you? 

353
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:32,300
I'll pay you interest, so can I borrow some? 

354
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,220
When I die, this shop will go to you. 

355
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,360
But I don't have any money, mother. 

356
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,160
You know I don't make that much. 

357
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,920
You've worked for years, so how can that be? 

358
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,950
Unless you gave your money to your parents. 

359
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,380
Hobak, you're heartless. 

360
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,530
Mom treated you to dinner,
even though the business has been real slow. 

361
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,890
But I never asked her to. 

362
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,130
Your son and grandsons ate most of it. 

363
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,270
- Are you serious?
- Yes. 

364
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,520
Hobak! 

365
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,900
This is what I believe. 

366
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,750
Close people shouldn't lend or borrow money. 

367
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,840
But who else would you lend money to? 

368
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,780
Those who ask to borrow money are bad. 

369
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,080
Okay, fine! 

370
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,950
If you're going to act like this, fine. 

371
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,020
Pay me for the pork belly. 

372
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,260
You yelling at me should cover it. 

373
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,470
What? 

374
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,170
Then pay me for doing your hair. 

375
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,680
How's this? 

376
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,150
Whoa! 

377
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,510
How rude! 

378
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,310
Haebak. 

379
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,750
Daebak dropped out of school, did you know? 

380
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,420
Do you know who talked him into it? 

381
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,930
Working isn't everything.
you should date. 

382
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,720
I'm actually trying. 

383
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,320
I'll be back. Salute! 

384
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,970
- Take care.
- Okay. 

385
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,970
Hey! 

386
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,330
Hey! Stop! 

387
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,230
Hey! Over here! 

388
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,760
Huh? Oh, my! 

389
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,020
Hello? Huh? Hey! 

390
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,690
Hey! Can you get off for a second? 

391
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,940
Hurry! 

392
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,800
Hello? Huh? Oh... 

393
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,420
Stop right there! 

394
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,420
Hey! 

395
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,390
Oh, wait! Over here! 

396
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,680
Mommy... 

397
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,310
Over here! Here! Wait! Oh... 

398
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,710
Hold on! Mommy! Help! 

399
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:01,800
Help! Aaagh! Help! Aaagh! 

400
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,770
Hey! You! You! 

401
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,460
You! You! Excuse me! 

402
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,050
- Hey!
- What do you want from me? 

403
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:20,030
I feel crappy, so I can't introduce myself. 

404
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,450
Do you know Wang Daebak? 

405
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,960
I saw you with him. 

406
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,390
So? 

407
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,710
I'm his older sister. 

408
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,610
Why did you talk him into dropping out? 

409
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,490
You know that's illegal, right? Oh, wait, 

410
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,060
let's go to the police station. 

411
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,990
Hey! 

412
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,040
Hey! 

413
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,530
What are you doing? 

414
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,550
You said you wanted to go to a police station. 

415
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,430
Get on. 

416
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,230
Slow down! 

417
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,900
How can you come at the same time every day? 

418
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,220
A man has to eat. 

419
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,600
The side dishes look good today. 

420
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,560
Give her one, too. 

421
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,640
I'm going to eat first. 

422
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,950
Is this the police station? 

423
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,240
Let's eat first. 

424
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,820
It's dinner time for the police, too. 

425
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,820
You're actually eating right now? 

426
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,100
I am. 

427
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,730
I do manual labor, 

428
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,800
so I always eat at the same time. 

429
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,530
It'll be a hard day, so you should eat. 

430
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,400
I think I've seen you before. 

431
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,020
That's way too obvious. 

432
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,390
We really haven't met before? 

433
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:30,620
Girls these days chase after handsome men. 

434
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,990
I can't believe she said that. 

435
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,000
Yes, sir. 

436
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,330
You'll need two concrete mixers, 

437
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,400
and unless it rains, we'll finish on time. 

438
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,080
Yes. 

439
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,860
What is it? 

440
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,860
Right now? 

441
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,220
What's wrong with her? 

442
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,180
I think we should teach them a lesson. 

443
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,580
What's wrong with your barking? 

444
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,300
Oh, the one Jungi loves the most. 

445
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,660
Two dogs fighting, barking hoarsely! 

446
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,870
Do that! 

447
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,710
What are you going to report me for? 

448
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:24,770
Crime against a minor is a felony. 

449
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,610
Let's go in. 

450
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,340
How much do you know about Daebak? 

451
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,200
I know enough.
I changed his diapers. 

452
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,390
I raised him. 

453
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:38,930
He's in 7th grade,
but he's really immature. 

454
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,310
His grades are horrible, he's impossible, 

455
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,910
he's outrageously positive, mischievous... 

456
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,200
Outside those. 

457
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,330
First, 

458
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,890
Daebak is in the middle of a storm. 

459
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,900
He's easily tempted and too passionate. 

460
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,560
7th grade is a very difficult time. 

461
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,470
He's too excited, so school will do no good. 

462
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,310
- Second.
- But he should... 

463
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,930
If you're worried,
don't say hurtful things. 

464
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,480
I didn't say hurtful things. 

465
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,760
What the heck is wrong with you? 

466
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,170
You're neither a good student nor obedient. 

467
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,790
What are you going to be when you grow up? 

468
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,830
You have no chance of success. 

469
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,500
Third, 

470
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,640
this is the most important thing. 

471
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,760
Daebak 

472
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,290
has no dream. 

473
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,170
He doesn't? 

474
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,430
He said that? 

475
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,520
For a boy his age, not having a dream 

476
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,240
is worse than a desert without an oasis. 

477
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,370
I know that. 

478
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:52,700
Life is long, so missing a few days of school isn't a big deal. 

479
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:59,020
Giving Daebak the time he needs to find his dream and go back to school 

480
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,090
is what we as adults should do. 

481
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,810
Let's go inside. 

482
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,840
If you say I did wrong,
I should be punished. 

483
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,460
You didn't do wrong. 

484
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:19,110
Why did you call everyone over? 

485
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,830
Subak, Hobak, Gwangbak, Haebak! 

486
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,060
What are you good for? 

487
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,690
You didn't know Daebak dropped out of school and you call yourselves his sisters? 

488
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,600
Daebak dropped out of school? 

489
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,220
When? Why? 

490
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,280
He's your youngest brother. 

491
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,850
What did you ever do for him? 

492
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,240
But, 

493
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,160
you're his school's vice principal! 

494
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,350
Why didn't you know about it? 

495
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,910
I don't believe this! 

496
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:50,670
Why are my children always quitting? 

497
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,730
Where are you?
Come home right now! 

498
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,940
Did a war break out?
What's going out? 

499
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,760
Daebak dropped out of school, mom. 

500
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,250
What? 

501
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,670
Why did he drop out of school? Huh? 

502
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,300
Nobody knows why. 

503
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,500
What's going on?
My phone's been on fire. 

504
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,140
- Hey, what's going on?
- You! You! 

505
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,890
Come here! 

506
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,360
Shut up! 

507
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,400
What's the reason? 

508
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,220
There's no reason. 

509
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,310
Dropping out of school ain't a big deal. 

510
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,470
What's wrong with him? 

511
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,470
Life ain't all that special. 

512
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,910
Okay, okay. 

513
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,110
Everyone, just mind your own business. 

514
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,950
Bulldozers and excavators, go back to work. 

515
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:38,090
If you want to take care of your wives and kids for a long time, work safely. 

516
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:42,090
Put on your hard hats and keep digging. 

517
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,970
If you have complaints, complain away. 

518
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,210
And 7th graders can be explosive,
treat him with care. 

519
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,630
So, I'll see you tomorrow. 

520
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
Water! 

521
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,990
What's wrong with him, huh? 

522
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,540
What were you doing? 

523
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,250
You're in charge of Daebak. 

524
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,470
I've been trying to figure out what to do. 

525
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,900
So what did you figure out? 

526
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:23,200
First, Daebak is in the middle of a storm. 

527
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,030
7th grade is a really difficult time. 

528
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,030
What use is going to school by force, 
without knowing the meaning behind it? 

529
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,530
What meaning? You just need to go! 

530
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,280
Hold on. 

531
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,880
Second? 

532
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,300
Second, if we want Daebak to do well,
we shouldn't say hurtful things. 

533
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,570
You're worthless, what are you going to be, 

534
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,630
you're a bad student, you won't succeed,  

535
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,840
stuff like this. 

536
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,700
I regret saying such things to him. 

537
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,800
You, too, right? 

538
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,180
And third, this is the most important one. 

539
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,780
Daebak has no dream. 

540
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,850
There she goes again. 

541
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,640
Life is long, so missing a few days of school isn't a big deal. 

542
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,920
What we should do is wait for Daebak to find his dream and decide to go back to school. 

543
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,900
Wait? Why should we? 

544
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,690
We should be him up, if it comes to that. 

545
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:23,240
What you said, all three of them, are right. 

546
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,790
So what do you want to do? 

547
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,770
Leave him be. 

548
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,500
Leave him be like that? 

549
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,210
Let's pretend we left him on an island. 

550
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,190
He's a middle school boy, extremely wild. 

551
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,520
This is what I tell the teachers. 

552
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,620
Everyone's born with a certain amount of wildness in his blood, 

553
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,160
and if he doesn't act it out when he's young, he'll do it... 

554
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,260
What's he talking about? 

555
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,260
If you're going to go wild, do it early. 

556
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,800
Mom, you're smart. 

557
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,110
Mother understands, so why can't you? 

558
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,900
Because we're of different blood. 

559
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:08,450
Cheating on your spouse when you're old is dangerous,
so do it when you're young. 

560
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,380
Don't you think so? 

561
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,810
That's not it, grandma. 

562
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,430
Did they call? 

563
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,650
They said they would,
but they haven't yet. 

564
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,830
How do you feel? 

565
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm nervous. I don't know. 

566
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,080
I don't know what I'd say when I see her. 

567
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,910
You didn't get a call did you? 

568
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,060
No. 

569
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,100
How can she be so heartless? 

570
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Doesn't she miss you? 

571
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,360
Sangnam, 

572
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,930
if you can't forgive her, 

573
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,140
don't meet her. 

574
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,860
I'm worried you might get hurt. 

575
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,100
I'm already hurt. 

576
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,000
I thought it had healed... 

577
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,570
Even if I get hurt again, 

578
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,570
I have to meet her. 

579
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,770
Only then can I get over it. 

580
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,940
I don't know what to say. 

581
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,940
I'm sorry. 

582
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,720
Why would you be sorry? 

583
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,930
Don't be. 

584
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,500
Don't get mad and go to sleep. 

585
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,110
How can I not get mad? 

586
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,860
Whom did our kids take after? 

587
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,960
They took after their parents.
Go to sleep. 

588
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,910
A middle school drop out!
How awful! 

589
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,830
And his father's a vice principal! Ugh... 

590
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,200
Everyone go inside.
Daebak, follow me. 

591
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,690
You're dead! 

592
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,190
Daebak, 

593
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,490
you don't want to go to school? 

594
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,770
I don't want to go to school, either. 

595
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,310
The Board of Education's breathing down my neck. 

596
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:07,380
I've go so much to do,
but teachers won't listen to me, 

597
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,180
the principal is out to get me, 

598
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,570
and the students call me the "geezer." 

599
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:20,360
I want to quit, but I can't because I won't be able to support you guys. 

600
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,920
Oh... 

601
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,480
Be frugal. 

602
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,280
What's there to save?
It's $3. 

603
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,760
If you don't want it, forget it. 

604
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,460
Even beef soup is 7 or 8 dollars. 

605
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,300
Don't eat out!
There's food here. 

606
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,190
For a man, his wallet gives him self esteem. 

607
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,920
My self esteem is worth $3. 

608
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,910
Then go make money.
You're healthy enough. 

609
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,240
- Get up!
- Hey! 

610
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,980
Go to bed early and stop playing computer games all night! 

611
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,250
It gets rid of bad odor. 

612
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,230
You mean idle thoughts. 

613
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,070
- Stop talking nonsense and get up!
- Man! 

614
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:29,200
All you think of when you're awake is this? 

615
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,510
I think of it when I'm asleep. 

616
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,910
- Get up right now!
- Man! Give it back! 

617
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,790
I'm going to school. 

618
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,810
Standing together like this is awkward. 

619
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,280
Watch out for cars! 

620
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,870
Cross the street when the light's green! 

621
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,920
He's only going to school. Big deal! 

622
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,790
Uncle, don't you want to go to work? 

623
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,920
Ya, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo. 

624
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,250
Wang Daebak, go for it! 

625
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,530
Hello? I'm Daebak's sister, Gwangbak. 

626
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,290
Not Pibak, Gwangbak. 

627
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,720
Hello? 

628
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,550
I can't here you. Who is it? 

629
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,310
Gwangbak. Daebak's sister, Gwangbak. 

630
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,750
Oh... 

631
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,030
What's up? I'm busy. 

632
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,080
Since you're busy, I'll make it short. 

633
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,060
Daebak went to school today, finally. 

634
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,550
It was quite moving. 

635
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,080
Thank you so much. 

636
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,250
So I was thinking... 

637
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,680
Get to the point. 

638
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,580
Yes, yes. I'll get to the point. 

639
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,960
I want to buy you dinner, to thank you. 

640
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,890
You don't have to. 

641
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,340
But if you're asking me out on a date, sure why not? 

642
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,270
Let's make it tonight, then. 

643
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,140
Let's meet when I get off from work,  

644
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,460
and can I decide where? 

645
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,450
Sure, sure. Whatever you want. 

646
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,940
I'll see you at the construction site. 

647
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,220
Yes! 

648
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,930
I'm worried. 

649
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:37,800
You might quit your job after we're married. 

650
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,800
You dropped out of school just like that. 

651
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,370
A job is different. 

652
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:45,070
I'm not going to get a job. 

653
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,800
I'm going to become a housewife. 

654
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,810
These days, we need to be a dual income family. 

655
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,930
We can't survive on a single income. 

656
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:56,850
There are so many vice principals who can't quit because of their families. 

657
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,710
I will be frugal. 

658
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,240
Daebak, you're not a mama's boy, are you? 

659
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,650
How can you even ask? 

660
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,640
Daebak! 

661
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,120
Oh, hey. 

662
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,730
Who was that? 

663
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,280
My class vice president. 

664
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,700
Pretty, huh? 

665
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,650
She's not pretty! 

666
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,930
You don't know what you're talking about. 

667
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,520
Stop that. 

668
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,220
Daebak, what are you doing? 

669
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,090
Daebak! 

670
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,450
Why? What is it? 

671
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,020
Daebak, stop right there! 

672
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,450
Men are so immature. 

673
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,260
They are all cheaters. 

674
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,680
Is Daebak cheating on you? 

675
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,170
He keeps looking at other women. 

676
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,960
Who cares.
You're prettier than any of them. 

677
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,150
I know that, but it still feels bad. 

678
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,260
Mom, do you think I should marry him? 

679
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,800
He has 4 sisters and his mom's scary. 

680
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
You're scared of his mom already? 

681
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,980
In laws are always intimidating. 

682
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,820
I just need to win over his third sister. 

683
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,820
Why? 

684
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,820
She's really difficult. 

685
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,760
Even his parents can't handle her. 

686
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
Do you have any ideas? 

687
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,910
I don't know. 

688
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,650
Why do you speak with an accent with Daebak? 

689
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,320
You can speak without it fine. 

690
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,360
Seoul men love girls from Gyeongsang-do Province. 

691
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,010
When I go, Daebak, he melts away. 

692
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,080
Oh, boy. 

693
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,350
Who's daughter are you?
How precious! 

694
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,750
Yours, of course. 

695
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,310
- Let's go.
- Huh? 

696
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,050
Why did you get all dressed up? 

697
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,320
I'm not dressed up. 

698
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,040
You want to look nice to someone? 

699
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,020
No, it's not that. 

700
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,700
Oh, my! Oh, my! 

701
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,410
I was going to help you.
Are you nervous? 

702
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,270
No, I'm not nervous. 

703
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,690
So you're not nervous. 

704
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,120
When you get nervous, you get chatty. 

705
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,810
Thank you. 

706
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,660
Let's eat. 

707
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,210
Why? What's wrong? 

708
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,910
Why? What is it? 

709
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,180
It's so delicious. 

710
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,780
It looks bad, but it tastes amazing. Try it. 

711
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,790
It's good. 

712
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,210
You must come here often. 

713
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,490
I have a name. 

714
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,890
It's Choi Sangnam. 

715
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:52,710
My dad named me Sangnam,
"the man of men", so I can become the best. 

716
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,540
Gwangbak's a Go-Stop term, isn't it? 

717
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,860
Your parents must like the game. 

718
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:00,260
No, and I hope I don't have a bad hand in life. 

719
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,990
I hope I have a good hand. 

720
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,490
Did you know? 

721
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:07,220
You can't win with too many good cards. 

722
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,300
If you have everything, you can't succeed. 

723
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,370
You only work hard when you lack something. 

724
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:21,040
Most successful people got there after overcoming their shortcomings. 

725
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,040
My grandmother said something similar. 

726
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,140
When you have a few good cards, you win. 

727
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,160
So I think you have a good hand in life. 

728
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,000
Because you seem to have many shortcomings. 

729
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,860
Should I lest them? 

730
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,820
First, you're ugly. 

731
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,280
No way. 

732
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,330
- Hot!
- You're impatient. 

733
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:45,450
You have to blow on it before you eat it.

735
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,390
Okay. 

736

You have a foul mouth. 

737

But I don't! 

738
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,690
I heard you on Daebak's phone. 

739
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,560
Wow, I can't even remember what you said. 

740
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,800
- That's...
- Shh! 

741
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,560
So out a five card hand, 

742
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,020
you're ugly, impatient and foul mouthed. 

743
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,400
That's three useless cards. 

744
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
I'll count the rest as good cards. 

745
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,580
Let's find out what those two cards are. 

746

You're so funny.

- Me?
- Yes. 

749
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,110
That hasn't helped me. 

750
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,950
Women are so weird. 

751
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:41,870
I make them laugh, but they always run to the men who make them cry. 

752
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,430
How do you know when so well? 

753
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,920
I'm a player. 

754
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,690
No real player says he's a player. 

755
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,290
But it's true. 

756
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,310
Let me give you a tip.

00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,100
Don't fall for me. 

758
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,760
I hate it when women cry. 

759
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:25,300
This isn't much of a grand opening,
but we'll have a great party later.

Let's put our hearts together and work hard. 

761

But Mr. Ko, 

762
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,850
you've never done this kind of work before. 

763
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,860

Where to?
Jeju-do Island?

Mom's been saying she wants to go on a cruise.

Expensive.
Where are we having dinner? 

774
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:06,380
At a hotel.
Either a buffet or a steakhouse. 

775
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,790
That'll be expensive. 

776
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,820
It's $100 to $300 per person. 

777

Let's invite some guests.
Is 100 guests okay? 

778
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,040
100 guests?
How much is that? 

779
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,140
I can't do that.
That's too much. 

780
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,140
Right. And I'm unemployed.

Mom will turn 60 only once!

You stay out of it then. I'll take care of it.

How can you be so selfish?
You make money!

You want to cancel my 60th birthday party? 

789

It's not that. 

790
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,010
Subak's suggestion is way out of my budget. 

791
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:13,130
You've never bought me anything. 

792
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,380
Your husband never gave me any allowance.

This is how people are. 

794

When you get something, you give.

Your older sister isn't even married yet! 

805

They'll think there's something wrong with her for you to get married first.

00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:43,500
It's nothing. I'm old.
I'm seeing things. 

879
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,830
He could've been his twin. 

880
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:48,390
- Who?
- Nothing. I'll talk to you later. 

881
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:51,630
Mom, can you get my kids? 

882
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,030
I left them with the lady on the first floor. I'll be home late. 

883
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,320
Okay. 

884
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:00,060
I knew it.
That scared me good. 

885
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,460
How could he look so much like him? 

886
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:14,250
Oh, boy. 

887
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,010
I looked, but I couldn't find any jobs. 

888
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:19,150
I really want to sign a contract. 

889
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,810
You were too busy playing games. 

890
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:24,730
No, I really want to find a job. 

891
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,510
Big sis, 

892
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,090
let's eat out. 

893
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:34,350
Go home and eat.
I already cooked rice. 

894
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:46,090
Sedal, we'll have to pitch in for my mom's party. 

895
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:48,650
What? 

896
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,840
This is nuts! 

897
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,180
Hotel buffet and a cruise? 

898
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,350
You tell your rich sister to pay for them. 

899
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,160
$1,000 or $2,000 means nothing to them. 

900
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,550
Maybe $10,000 would put a dent. 

901
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:26,810
But I can't not pitch in.
I'm still her daughter. 

902
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:29,510
You are, but she doesn't care about you. 

903
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:32,200
Tell those who want to show off pay for it. 

904
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:35,850
Hey, 

905
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:38,770
isn't that your brother in law? 

906
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:42,920
Huh? 

907
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,690
Minjung! 

908
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,000
Minjung! 

909
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,860
What are you going to do? 

910
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:03,430
So your company went bankrupt? Totally? 

911
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:07,350
You have nothing at all left? 

912
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,860
Wow, how could this happen? 

913
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,870
How unbelievable. 

914
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:17,360
Tell Subak. You shouldn't burden this alone. 

915
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,350
She needs to know. 

916
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:23,140
I'm trying to find the right time. 

917
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,550
She won't be able to handle this. 

918
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,540
I brought it up a few days ago, 

919
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,540
and she said she'll die with our children. 

920
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,240
She said she'll die? 

921
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:35,400
I can see her do that. 

922
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,400
Hasn't that crossed your mind? 

923
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,760
That you just want to kill yourself? 

924
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,190
What's wrong with you? 

925
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:44,220
I would if I were him. 

926
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,010
But you're really amazing. 

927
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:49,670
How could start a parcel service? 

928
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:51,830
I'd be crying, jumping into the river, 

929
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,730
jumping off a building, 

930
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:58,360
set myself on fire, and go nut... 

931
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,820
I really admire you, Minjung. 

932
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,560
It'll be hard but what could she do? 

933
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,590
She's a mother.
She must get through it. 

934
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,560
Subak's been through just about everything. 

935
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,920
All sorts of things, like... 

936
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:27,590
What do you mean by that?
What bad things? 

937
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:31,630
What bad things has she been through? 

938
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:34,710
Nothing, Minjung. She didn't. 

939
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:38,660
Before she met you,
she was a student. 

940
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,650
Sometimes things just come out of my mouth. 

941
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:48,220
I'm sort of all over the place. 

942
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,180
How could you crush my foot? 

943
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,040
Oh, my poor foot. 

944
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,140
You're such a blabbermouth! 

945
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,410
Why can't you think before you speak? 

946
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:09,600
Subak doesn't think of you as her sister,
so why are you covering up for her? 

947
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,700
If I were you, I'd tell him everything. 

948
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,700
He would go insane. 

949
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,690
I'm doing it for Minjung, not Subak. 

950
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,530
You're so concerned about Minjung. 

951
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,820
Go live with Minjung, then! 

952
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,350
Keep this a secret until he tells her. 

953
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:28,570
Even with uncle, okay? 

954
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,310
Let me ask my mouth. 

955
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,460
Mouth, mouth. 

956
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:39,380
This is the biggest crisis of your life. 

957
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,020
What would you do? Huh? 

958
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:46,720
This is nuts. 

959
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,720
What are you doing? 

960
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,560
My friends are going crazy. 

961
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,910
I uploaded photos and they're dying from jealousy. 

962
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,960
So what's the occasion? 

963
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,280
You feel bad for firing the housekeeper? 

964
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,720
I do and I need to tell you something. 

965
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:23,160
Oh I have something to tell you too. 

966
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,780
Next Saturday is my mom's 60th birthday. 

967
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,140
You didn't know, huh? 

968
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,140
No. 

969
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,610
I knew it.
You can't remember her birthday? 

970
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:35,470
Us daughters had a meeting. 

971
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:38,210
We'll have a buffet dinner and send her on a cruise. 

972
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,980
And she's getting a face lift. 

973
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,100
What? 

974
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:45,130
I'm looking for a European cruise, 

975
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:47,210
and we're thinking of inviting 100 guests. 

976
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,650
So it'll be $150 per person, cheap. 

977
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:52,790
With flowers and orchestra, about $30,000? 

978
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,850
No harp. They asked for a delivery charge. 

979
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:56,940
I did good, huh? 

980
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:19,420
Do you know what day next Saturday is? 

981
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,420
I told you, my mom's 60th birthday. 

982
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,810
It's my mother's first memorial service. 

983
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,840
Oh, no! 

984
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,340
Can't we do it another day? 

985
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,380
What? 

986
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,750
What do I do?
I've already made reservations. 

987
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,200
We can't do that for her. 

988
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,200
We can do something simple, like dinner. 

989
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,480
You don't want to spend money on my mom? 

990
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,710
It's not that!
We can't afford it! 

991
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:03,880
Why not? 

992
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,150
She's taking care of our kids! 

993
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,720
I'm disappointed in you. 

994
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,150
Subak! 

995
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:46,580
Father. 

996
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,330
Where were you? 

997
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,130
Why didn't you answer your phone? 

998
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:51,920
We were having dinner. 

999
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,450
You have a very good life. 

1000
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:56,880
It's not good at all. 

1001
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,320
What brings you here? 

1002
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:00,660
That's all you can say? 

1003
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:04,470
I'm not in a good mood,
so please don't add to it. 

1004
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,980
Hello. 

1005
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,110
Did you see that?
"Don't add to it"? 

1006
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:16,510
And a simple "Hello" to father? 

1007
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:18,410
Stop that. Let's just go. 

1008
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:21,720
Why should you?
This is your son's house. 

1009
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,300
Go inside. 

1010
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,200
Come in, father. 

1011
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,170
Go in. You shouldn't mind her. 

1012
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:28,750
Why should you? 

1013
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:30,930
I have to go and catch the train. 

1014
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:31,920
Minsuk! 

1015
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,550
Go in! 

1016
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:39,900
I told you. 

1017
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:43,230
If you don't take him, I'd bring him. 

1018
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:46,650
Take care of him and control your wife. 

1019
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,420
I'll send the rest of his stuff soon. 

1020
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:08,270
- Enjoy.
- Thank you. 

1021
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,440
What's this? 

1022
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,800
Black bean noodles. 

1023
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,290
I know what it is.
Why did you order it? 

1024
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:27,080
It's for father. 

1025
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,040
What? 

1026
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,040
Tell your father to come and eat.

1028
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,070
This is the third time you did this to me. 

1029
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,710
- Pay up.
- Excuse me? 

1030
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:13,700
This is different from what I wrote. 

1031
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,220
How could you belittle someone who's proud of his job? 

1032
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,540
You don't want to live with me? What is it? 

1033
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,330
I did everything I could for your family. 

1034
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:27,080
You might think he's an embarrassment,
an aged country folk, but he's my father. 

1035
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,600
This is what being married means? 

1036
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,770
What did you have to endure? 

1037
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,090
I've always been discriminated against! 

1038
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:34,490
You think you never hurt me? 

1039
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:35,460
Hurt you? 

1040
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,630
You did. 

1041
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:39,180
How did I ever hurt you?
