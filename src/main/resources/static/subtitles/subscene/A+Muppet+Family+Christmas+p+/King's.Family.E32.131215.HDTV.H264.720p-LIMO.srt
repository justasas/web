2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,540
I couldn't believe my eyes.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,490
He's crueler than the meanest mother in law I know!

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,190
I've just about seen and heard everything,

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,190
but I've never met anyone one more absurd.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,970
Compared to him, Sedal's mom's a saint.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,840
I couldn't believe how absurd he was being!

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,490
Don't talk like you know everything.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,060
I've lived longer and seen much worse.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,300
It couldn't be worse!

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,990
No wonder he couldn't remarry.

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,070
It was horrible. He's horrible.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,000
All he has is his son, so be understanding.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,340
We should all be understanding.

15
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,340
Why should we do that?

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,690
Was the house nice?
Did they look rich?

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,840
The house was nice.

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,130
He sat at the head of the table, like he's important.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,370
He should've sat across from me!

20
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,690
He has no manners.

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,400
And he said he was being

22
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,740
considerate by not asking for a mink coat

23
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,840
and brand name purses.

24
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,660
He kept talking back at me whenever I said something.

25
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,370
So forget it!

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,000
He's weird, but he's not a bad man.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,460
What do you know?

28
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,990
So I told him to call the wedding off.

29
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,930
You canceled the wedding?

30
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,340
He screamed he wants to cancel, too.

31
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,490
So Gwangbak's not getting married?

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,130
I guess not.

33
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,740
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

34
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,990
Taking care of a single father in law is harder

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,130
than taking care of a single mother in law.

36
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,040
I can't believe him.

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,590
He should leave Gwangbak and Sangnam alone.

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,160
This is the problem with Korea.

39
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,300
Parents ruin their children's lives.

40
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,870
Especially the parents in law.

41
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,990
I have a horrible sister in law, too.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,690
She keeps nagging about everything.

43
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,300
Father, they should break off the engagement.

44
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,900
Just look how mad mom is.

45
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,930
Thank goodness this happened before the wedding!

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,770
Can you believe this?
You saw her!

47
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,670
She was rude at the lunch,

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,170
but how could she tell me to cancel the wedding?

49
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,170
How could she do that?

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,740
What did I do? What did I say?

51
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,990
It's not like Sangnam's a doctor?

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,240
Tell me. Whose fault was it?

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,490
Huh? Tell me what you really think.

54
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,130
Daese, calm down.

55
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,070
How can I calm down?

56
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,340
Whose side are you on? Huh?

57
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,070
What happened?

58
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,490
This wedding isn't happening.

59
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,300
What?

60
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,930
The wedding's off!
Her whole family is rude.

61
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,800
I thought her father was the vice principal!

62
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,400
But he wasn't able to teach his family a thing!

63
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,870
Like mother, like daughter!

64
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm sure of it.

65
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,770
The whole family is rude.

66
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,070
End it!

67
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,960
You were there.

68
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,270
What happened?

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,460
It was horrible.

70
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,930
My heart's still pounding.

71
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,740
Your dad aside, her mother's difficult, too.

72
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,270
She just blurted out everything on her mind.

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,870
She brought up canceling the wedding first.

74
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,900
She did?

75
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,670
She brought up the audition,

76
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,500
I can see why your father's hurt.

77
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,060
He did say some mean things, too, though.

78
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,490
What do we do?

79
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,060
They were just going at it.
It was unstoppable.

80
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,160
Why didn't you come home?

81
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,840
Why did you go around in your boxers?

82
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,770
Have you been eating at all?

83
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,240
Where have you been staying?

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,770
How many days have you gone without food?

85
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
Can we have another bowl of rice?

86
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,530
Are you full now?

87
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,440
Now I can see you clearly.

88
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,590
Why didn't you come home, then?

89
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,660
Just look at you.

90
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,270
How can I come home?

91
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,290
It's your home, so why not?

92
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,340
I missed you so much,

93
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,460
so I just wanted to get a glimpse of you.

94
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,490
I can't go home looking like this.

95
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,600
How could I?

96
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,990
I was horrible to Hobak...

97
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,370
You were blinded by money and lost your head.

98
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,030
Why didn't you test the waters out first?

99
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,060
Why did you have to jump in like that?

100
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,300
At least you got out in one piece.

101
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,940
Why didn't you talk some sense into me?

102
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,140
When a son acts crazy,

103
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,900
a mother should beat some sense into him!

104
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,160
Let me know I was going the wrong way.

105
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,900
Why did you let me go on?

106
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,090
I didn't just let you go on.

107
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,790
I actually encouraged you.

108
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,190
Oh, who knew it would end like this?

109
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,440
I thought she'd take you places.

110
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,400
You're getting a divorce?

111
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,200
Did Hobak tell you that?

112
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,640
Yes.

113
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,300
She keeps yelling at me to move out.

114
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,730
We had a fight this morning, too.

115
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,790
Mom, I'm sorry.

116
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,690
You're suffering because of me.

117
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,700
- I should go.
- Where?

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,290
I saw you and had lunch, so I should go.

119
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,430
Where will you go?

120
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,900
Anywhere my feet take me.

121
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,840
I'll work at the construction site and sleep in the underpass with newspaper blankets.

122
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,070
Let's go home.

123
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,090
I can't go home like this.

124
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,430
I'll come when I'm successful.

125
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,440
How do you plan on doing that?

126
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,870
You'd be lucky if you don't starve to death.

127
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,290
Let's go.

128
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,430
No woman would forgive you looking like this.

129
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,290
Go in.

130
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,860
Take a bath and stay here for now.

131
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,140
Buy some food with this.

132
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,460
Mom.

133
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,990
Go in.

134
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,400
You can't work at construction sites.

135
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,640
And it's freezing winter!

136
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,960
You're not good at manual labor.

137
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,570
I should buy a phone for you first.

138
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,070
It's okay.

139
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,290
It's not like anyone would call me.

140
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,840
Don't go anywhere.
Stay here.

141
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm going.

142
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,730
I have nothing more to say.

143
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,300
Please forgive him.

144
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,930
I'm really sorry about this.

145
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,340
How can I be more understanding than this?

146
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,290
You think this marriage will work?

147
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,990
This wasn't meant to be.

148
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,140
End it here.

149
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,160
I'd rather Gwangbak die a spinster

150
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,230
than let her marry into your family.

151
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,090
I'm going to be her husband.

152
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,930
And I'm not like my father.

153
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,540
I'm not interested, so leave.

154
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,860
Mother,

155
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,130
I'll make sure my father leaves Gwangbak alone.

156
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,000
How? You'll all be living under one roof!

157
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,840
Don't be absurd.

158
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,440
I'm very sorry.

159
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,570
There's no need for that.

160
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,730
Your mother wants to cancel the wedding.

161
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,440
Father.

162
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,700
How dare you call me "father"?

163
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,300
Just call me Mr. Choi.

164
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,130
I understand how you feel.

165
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,460
My mom can be very blunt,

166
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,890
so she even hurts my feelings sometimes.

167
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,230
But deep inside, she's not like that.

168
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,390
And when we get married, you won't see her

169
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,490
but once or twice every few years.

170
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,960
Please be more understanding.

171
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,130
I'm different from my mom.

172
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,890
You're not.

173
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,340
You're the same.

174
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,090
You say whatever's on your mind.

175
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,360
You have no respect for anyone.

176
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,990
You're the same.

177
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,840
Leave.

178
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,570
Why are you asking for forgiveness?

179
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,070
You have doctors and judges lined up for you.

180
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,670
But I'm sure they're all idiots.

181
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,870
You should go.

182
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,570
I don't think we can decide anything here.

183
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,800
I understand what you want to say, so go.

184
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,670
You should leave now.

185
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,440
You got your point across.

186
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,170
I don't think we'll get answers here.

187
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,440
Goodbye.

188
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,990
I'll come back again.

189
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,090
There's no need.

190
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,460
You're making me uncomfortable.

191
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,390
Daese, how could you say that to her?

192
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,290
I look weird to you, don't I?

193
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,140
I don't normally say mean things.

194
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,630
I try to be nice and say nice things.

195
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,340
But whenever I see that rude girl's family,

196
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,940
I can't help but say rough things.

197
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,800
This means we're not right for each other.

198
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,890
Where are you coming from?

199
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,840
Oh.

200
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,270
I was meeting some investors.

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,730
The amount involved is huge,
so my nerves are on edge.

202
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,840
Here.

203
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,490
Are they for me?

204
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,990
Of course.

205
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,400
What happened to my money?

206
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,930
It's been a month.

207
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,540
I've been dying to get it back.

208
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,340
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

209
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,590
Give me a few more days.

210
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,570
How many?

211
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,840
When tens of millions of dollars are at stake,

212
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,340
your money is like child's play.

213
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,700
Your money can't compare to the smallest dividends.

214
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,990
Should we go on a trip together?

215
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,490
Really?

216
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,070
Where?

217
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,770
Anywhere. Just the two of us.

218
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,530
Let's go after things get sorted out.

219
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,900
We'll go somewhere secluded and enjoy each other's company.

220
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,130
And try to cool down my burning heart, okay?

221
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,560
I feel better now that Sedal's at the sauna.

222
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,140
I felt lost when I didn't know if he was alive or dead.

223
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,360
What is he going to do?

224
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,530
He'll have to think about it.

225
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,640
He looked like he's been on the streets for a long time.

226
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,390
He was all skinny.

227
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,560
You feel badly for him?

228
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,340
When he's making our lives miserable?

229
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,440
Hobak wants us out.
What are you going to do?

230
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm going to talk to her.

231
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,800
I'll scream and yell if I have to.

232
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,940
She won't kick us out by force.

233
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,800
And we'll refuse to move out.

234
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,960
That's what others do.

235
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,800
All cheating husbands come home to their wives.

236
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,170
Go to the bank.

237
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,370
Okay.

238
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,360
Hello.

239
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,270
I'm looking for some...

240
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,540
Oh, my.

241
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,430
What are you doing here?

242
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,640
I switched to skin care business.

243
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,460
I think this suits you better.

244
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,570
Doesn't it?

245
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,930
You're looking for skin care products?

246
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,440
Yes, I'd like a toner, please.

247
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,560
For a woman?

248
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,140
No, for a man.

249
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,590
I don't have a woman I'd buy a toner for.

250
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,940
What have you been using?

251
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,270
What have you been using?

252
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,360
Anything I could find.

253
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,570
You shouldn't when you're so stylish.

254
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,340
Should I pick one out for you?

255
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,390
Sure.

256
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,300
This one's popular because it smells nice.

257
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,200
You won't even need to use any cologne.

258
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,040
Would you like to sample it?

259
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,440
How is it?

260
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,940
It's nice.

261
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,090
Isn't it?

262
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,390
They say it attracts women.

263
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,930
But I think it's the man who wears it that counts.

264
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,670
Don't you agree?

265
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,440
I do.

266
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,990
Of course, I do.

267
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,490
Give me your hand.

268
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,260
How does it feel?

269
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,540
It's nice.

270
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,670
Where are the red lipsticks?

271
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,700
You can look for it yourself.

272
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,090
I should just die.

273
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,670
Those darn grannies!

274
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,670
Let's see who lives longer!

275
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,760
What's that smell? Huh?

276
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,590
Oh, my!

277
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,840
Anggeum!

278
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,990
Oh, fire!

279
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,230
Fire!

280
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,840
Huh? Fire? Fire? Fire, fire...

281
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,560
Oh, my! Ugh!

282
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,230
The Korean War was nothing compared to this!

283
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,940
Oh, mother! Oh, my...

284
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,460
How many times has it been already?

285
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,990
You're going to burn this house down.

286
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,960
Where will we live if you do? It's winter!

287
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,590
What happened to you?
Did you lose your mind?

288
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,070
Oh, if I lost it, I could go find it.

289
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,230
I don't know what happened to me.

290
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,960
What if you're getting senile?

291
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,260
Taking turns with chores isn't helping you.

292
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,390
Should we hire a housekeeper?

293
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,460
We could hire someone twice a week.

294
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,360
If you want to, get me a full time one.

295
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,440
Twice a week won't do me any good.

296
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,840
Hang in there.

297
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,230
When I retire, I'm kicking everyone out,

298
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,160
and we'll travel the world, holding hands.

299
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,930
If you're not used to it, you can't do it.

300
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,990
Why would we hold hands and do that?

301
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,360
Why not?

302
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:43,340
It'll feel all brand new since we've never done that before.

303
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,130
That's why I haven't held your hands.

304
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,590
So it would be exciting for you.

305
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,090
Getting old has made you cheeky.

306
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,960
I've become a pathetic old babysitter.

307
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,570
Who knew marrying you would do this to me?

308
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:09,240
Hang in there until they can move out.

309
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,090
That's what I'm doing right now.

310
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,860
I keep forgetting things.

311
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,360
Honey, let's get fire insurance.

312
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,570
Fire insurance?

313
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,130
I'm afraid I'll burn this house down.

314
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,190
I keep burning pots these days.

315
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,360
I keep forgetting about the pots on the stove.

316
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,190
Thanks to mother, I didn't have to call 911.

317
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,590
Where do I call when I've lost my mind?

318
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,000
Me.

319
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,300
Would you like to see a doctor?

320
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,440
I'm afraid to. What if it's dementia?

321
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,730
Do you remember who I am?

322
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,530
I don't. Who are you, sir?

323
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:01,270
I'm scared you might forget who I am and run away from home one day.

324
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,500
Don't worry.

325
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,170
If I get dementia, I'll disappear.

326
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,190
Nice. I can get a new wife.

327
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,160
If you don't want me to, forget the kids.

328
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,030
You've been working too hard lately.

329
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,490
Hobak's getting a divorce,

330
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,070
Gwangbak lost her mind.

331
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,070
We just have too many daughters.

332
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,840
Now that Subak's family is okay, the other girls are giving us trouble.

333
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,340
At least one is doing okay.

334
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:39,040
You can't lose your mind, not until the day Daebak gets married, Anggeum.

335
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,860
Got it, Bong.

336
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,240
Oh...

337
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,470
Sangnam's the problem.

338
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,440
He's completely blinded by love.

339
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,960
Can you find someone nice for him?

340
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,200
Wait, that girl you were talking about,

341
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,490
can you ask again?

342
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,240
She said she wasn't interested.

343
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,440
Ask again.

344
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,990
Maybe she changed her mind.

345
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,140
Since you like her, I'm interested.

346
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,630
I'll ask.

347
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,860
By the way,

348
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,430
Sangnam took some money from the company.

349
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,070
He told me not to tell you.

350
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,090
How much?

351
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,270
$5,000.

352
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,590
That much?

353
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,960
Can you find out?

354
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,940
I think he gave it to that rude girl.

355
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,840
And he didn't want to do wedding gifts,

356
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,540
because they can't afford to do that.

357
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,300
I think he gave it to her for the wedding.

358
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,970
Ask him.

359
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,200
Is she's that poor, it's a problem.

360
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,930
So ask him.

361
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,540
It wasn't that, aunt.

362
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,860
It wasn't?

363
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,000
No.

364
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,540
Then why would you need $5,000?

365
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,340
Behind your father's back.

366
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,300
Aunt, actually,

367
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,090
I met mom.

368
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,930
What?

369
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,530
When? Where?

370
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,760
The day you met Gwangbak's parents.

371
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,590
She was waiting for me outside the house.

372
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,740
So I gave her some money.

373
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,670
Who knows when I'll see her again?

374
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,190
I didn't want to let her go empty handed.

375
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,840
Aunt, was that a mistake?

376
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,360
I understand.

377
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,570
It's me. We need to talk.

378
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,840
I know you're in Seoul!

379
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,240
Give it back.

380
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,770
What? you want some gum?

381
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,200
$5,000.

382
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,490
Crazy...

383
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,240
Give it back.

384
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,430
My son gave it to me.

385
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,730
How dare you ask for it back?

386
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,440
What right do you have?

387
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,860
You're horrible.

388
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,090
You're a mosquito sucking on your son's blood!

389
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,660
Dracula, vampire.

390
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,230
Mosquito's  are too cute.

391
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,640
You're a parasite, not a mom.

392
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,930
You gave up on being a mom a long time ago.

393
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,990
Where are you staying?

394
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,640
Why do you want to know?

395
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,040
Go home.

396
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,630
Why do you care if I go home or not?

397
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,160
How ridiculous.

398
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,340
Don't stay in Seoul. Go home!

399
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,430
Does Seoul belong to you?

400
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,570
Do you own it?

401
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,000
Stop talking nonsense and give the money back.

402
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,470
It's gone.

403
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,540
You already spent it all?

404
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,360
It's only $5,000.

405
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,190
It's barely enough for chewing gum.

406
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,200
And don't mess with me.

407
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,100
You think you're Sangnam's mom or something, but wake up.

408
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,840
I'm the one who gave birth to Sangnam.

409
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,040
I'm seeing my son, so stay out of it.

410
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,590
This is none of your business.

411
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,340
Stay out of Sangnam's life.

412
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,070
He's getting married soon, so stay out.

413
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,540
Sangnam's getting married? When?

414
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,470
He didn't say anything.

415
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,860
You gave birth to him, so act like him mom for once.

416
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,930
Leave quietly.

417
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,040
Oh, ouch.

418
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,340
Oh...

419
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,090
Who are you?

420
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,040
Is this Mr. Wang Bong's house?

421
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,500
It is.

422
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,670
I'm a housekeeper.

423
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,570
Mr. Wang Bong sent me.

424
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,270
What should I do first?

425
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,200
Why did you send a housekeeper?

426
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,630
Just let her help you today.

427
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,130
Do you have money to burn?

428
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,730
Then give it to me.

429
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,340
I got her because you were aching all over last night.

430
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,540
Just let her help you today.

431
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,630
That's not going to solve anything!

432
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,130
There's so much to do around here.

433
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,800
And giving instructions is a hard job.

434
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,390
Honey,

435
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,590
then you shouldn't tell me you're sick.

436
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,430
Obviously, I can't tell you anything.

437
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,340
I just wanted you to listen, not try to fix anything.

438
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,630
I'm not going to tell you anything again.

439
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,390
I thought I was helping you out.

440
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,070
Then send help throughout the year.

441
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,840
I hired her for today, so give her a chance.

442
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,040
I sent her home.

443
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,860
You did?

444
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,070
Don't ever tell me you're sick again.

445
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,740
You're not romantic at all.

446
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,270
I'm not traveling the world with you.

447
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,240
What?

448
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:41,300
Why would I go anywhere holding the hand of a man who's dense and not romantic?

449
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,840
It'll drive me insane.

450
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,630
Go with some other woman.

451
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,770
Fine! I will!

452
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,970
Hello?

453
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,770
Hey! Bong, you!

454
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,400
Bong?

455
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,000
You mean my son?

456
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,840
Uh, no. My friend.

457
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,800
Her name's Bonghui.

458
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:05,800
She's short and wears glasses. Bonghui.

459
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:09,970
Oh, she won't listen to anything I say.

460
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,970
Sedal! Sedal!

461
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,340
Where are you?

462
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,940
Mom.

463
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,000
Oh, you look so sick.

464
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,590
I brought some medicine.

465
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,160
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

466
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,860
Medicine is enough for me.

467
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,230
You can't on an empty stomach.

468
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,300
Here. Let's eat first.

469
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,770
It's like I'm visiting my son in prison.

470
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,240
Eat up.

471
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,960
I can't eat anything.

472
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,590
But you have to.

473
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,770
I brought nigiri, your favorite.

474
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,570
I'm working so I can afford this much.

475
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,540
Thanks, mom.

476
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,240
You didn't tell her I got kicked out in my boxers?

477
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,370
It's embarrassing.

478
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,690
Then hurry up and pull yourself together.

479
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,160
Just look at you.

480
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,030
You look horrible.

481
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,500
Dad, dad...

482
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,990
You should take a nap now.

483
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,500
Don't get sick again.

484
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,390
Bye, mom.

485
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,890
I'll be back.

486
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,300
Dad.

487
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,070
Dad, dad...

488
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,570
Is it true?

489
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,630
It was dad.

490
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,270
He was standing with grandmother.

491
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,340
But he pretended not to see me.

492
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,470
With grandmother?

493
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,070
Where did you see him?

494
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,800
Bangtong, go home.

495
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,070
Hobak...

496
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,890
Hobak,

497
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,890
it's all my fault.

498
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,990
Please forgive me.

499
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,340
Don't say another word.

500
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,430
I'll see you in court.

501
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,490
When can you come?

502
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,200
Don't do this.

503
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,890
I'm really sorry.

504
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,730
Don't get clingy on me.

505
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,500
It's driving me further away.

506
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,960
I don't want to see or hear you cry.

507
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,570
How about noon tomorrow?

508
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,840
Hobak, please.

509
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,690
I'll see you at the court tomorrow at noon.

510
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,460
I'm really sorry.

511
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,260
I have nowhere to go.

512
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,500
If you dump me, I have no where to go.

513
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,700
Please forgive me.

514
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,730
I made a mistake.

515
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,700
You ignored me when I was kidnapped.

516
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,270
You screamed I had nothing to do with you

517
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:06,090
and you didn't care if I lived or died.

518
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,840
When you did that...

519
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,890
I died that day.

520
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,070
I'll see you tomorrow at noon.

521
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,360
You better come.

522
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,090
Sangnam, it's mom.

523
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,390
Yes.

524
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,160
Can you come and see me?

525
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,340
I'll call you back at another time.

526
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,030
You haven't gone home?

527
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:07,240
I was going to but I wanted to cook a meal for you.

528
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,540
This was your favorite when you were a boy.

529
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,570
Eat.

530
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,090
Eat with me.

531
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,630
I guess eating alone isn't very appetizing.

532
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,860
Try it. See if you like it.

533
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,930
When I made this for you,

534
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,760
you used to say I was the best cook.

535
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,040
How is it?

536
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,690
It's good.

537
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,730
I'm a great cook.

538
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,590
When I ran a tea house,
my coffee was famous among the locals.

539
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,860
There's this herbal tea.

540
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,840
The one with a raw egg yolk floating.

541
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,930
Mine was amazing.

542
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,090
I was successful back then.

543
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,740
Those were the days.

544
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,340
But I had to close the place down.

545
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,860
Oh, I can't talk with my mouth empty.

546
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,900
This is better.

547
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,990
Here.

548
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,460
I bought thermal underwear for you.

549
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,940
It'll keep you warm at the construction site.

550
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,360
I heard you're getting married.

551
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,990
I was a bit disappointed.

552
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:34,540
Did I have to hear that from my sister?

553
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,040
Well, it's okay.

554
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,940
Even if you don't think of me as your mom,

555
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,530
I'm not going to see you get married before I go.

556
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,070
That's why I rented this apartment.

557
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,240
But there's no need.

558
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,240
How can you say that?

559
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:55,570
I should've raised you and married you off.

560
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,300
I made so many mistakes.

561
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,760
It breaks my heart when I think about it.

562
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,340
What kind of woman is she?

563
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,390
And her family?

564
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,230
Are they well off?

565
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,590
She's an ordinary woman from an ordinary family.

566
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,360
Ordinary won't do.

567
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:22,430
She must have money and a good job.

568
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,630
Married women work too these days.

569
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,130
Do you have time tomorrow?
I want to see her.

570
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,300
Excuse me?

571
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,400
I haven't done anything for you,

572
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,930
but I should get to see my son's future wife.

573
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,790
Otherwise, we wouldn't recognize each other and get into a fight on the street.

574
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,070
That'd be real funny.

575
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,970
I don't have an ulterior motive.

576
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:58,540
I just want to be good to my daughter in law to make up for how I was to you.

577
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,590
Oh, my! Is it for me?

578
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,570
Deposit $1,000 a month to that account.

579
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,700
I heard I should get at least that amount.

580
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,530
$1,000?

581
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,360
Why? It's too much?

582
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,590
No, it isn't.

583
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,240
I'd like to give you more, If I could.

584
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,370
More? $1,000 isn't enough?

585
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,730
Oh, forget it.

586
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,270
Then you raise your kids.

587
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,040
How can you say that?

588
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,360
Mom, you're mean.

589
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,860
You're preying on my weakness.

590
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:01,840
What?

591
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,130
Don't say anything.

592
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,170
Don't deposit it whenever you feel like it.

593
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,990
Pick a date and don't miss it.

594
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,860
I'm going to pretend I have a job.

595
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,890
You're going to complain no matter what.

596
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,990
so I'd rather get paid for it.

597
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,360
When I get sick raising your kids,

598
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,390
will you two take care of me?

599
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,230
I'm going to save the money for when I get old.

600
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,440
Isn't that better, Minjung?

601
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,070
It is.

602
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,070
We should've paid you before you asked.

603
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,340
I'm sorry.

604
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,930
How can we afford $1,000?

605
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,890
Let's make it $500.

606
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,240
You want to haggle the price of raising your kids?

607
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,700
But they're your grandkids.

608
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,370
You care too much about money.

609
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,200
You're my daughter but Minjung cares more about me.

610
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:49,970
And don't yell at me about how I raise them.

611
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:56,660
Then you stop saying you can't do it,
how sick you are, or tell us to move out.

612
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,360
Fine! How mean.

613
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,140
You're horrible.

614
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,140
Parcel service.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

615
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,370
I'll leave it at the front desk. Okay.

616
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,740
Hello.

617
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,740
You didn't have to do this.

618
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,160
Running to each other on the street is rare.

619
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,430
I've always wanted to treat Miho to something.

620
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,630
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

621
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,630
You're not busy?

622
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,340
I was on the way to the factory for pick up.

623
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,340
I told them I'd be 30 minutes late.

624
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,700
Miho, what's your favorite bun?

625
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,740
The sweet red bean bun.

626
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,340
Mine too.

627
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,470
My favorite is the sweet red bean bun, too.

628
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,300
How weird.

629
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,570
Kids these days don't like them. Right?

630
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,300
I'm looking for a cab.

631
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,200
I can't find one.
I'm freezing out here.

632
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,370
Just hold on.

633
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,670
Huh?

634
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,070
Seoul men love girls from Gyeongsang-do Province.

635
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,340
I can melt them with my accent.

636
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,840
What are you doing?

637
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,340
Subak.

638
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,430
Hello.

639
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,660
What are you doing here?

640
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,740
Oh, I ran into her.
I wanted to say thank you.

641
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,140
Father told us to treat her to dinner,

642
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,970
but I'm doing this instead.

643
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,890
Hello.

644
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,530
Oh! Aren't you Daebak's girlfriend?

645
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,130
You're Miho's mom?

646
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,000
Yes.

647
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,070
Oh, and you work as a caregiver.

648
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,160
People might mistake you as family.

649
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:01,200
Oh, actually, she looks like you.

650
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,930
Don't say that.

651
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,970
Gwangbak's fiance is Miho's cousin.

652
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,800
Huh?

653
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,430
It's kind of complicated,

654
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,260
but they're in laws.

655
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,460
Miho's mom's older sister's son is...

656
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,840
Whatever. I won't get it even if you explained.

657
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,390
Yes, sir.

658
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,360
I'm in a cab. I'll be right there.

659
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,440
I really am in a cab right now.

660
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,640
He bought us too many buns.

661
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,840
He did.

662
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:41,160
Mom, you worked as a caregiver?

663
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,740
Yes, for a short while.

664
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,740
Uncle doesn't pay you well?

665
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,070
He does.

666
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,430
I wanted to help someone in need.

667
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,760
Anyway, mom, it's weird.

668
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,340
I can't help but like him.

669
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,640
Daebak's brother in law seems like a good man.

670
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,770
He looked really happy to be with you today.

671
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,890
You did, and he did, too.

672
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,240
Bangtong!

673
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,570
Dad!

674
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,070
- Bangtong!
- Dad!

675
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,100
Let's go.

676
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,860
hurry.

677
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,930
If mom catches, she'll get mad.

678
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,930
It's okay. Mom won't find out.

679
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,470
You're our dad, so why not?

680
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,600
Coming home with you is so great!

681
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,040
Yay!

682
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,070
Mother,

683
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,870
where is Sedal right now?

684
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,640
I don't know.

685
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,540
I know you've been talking to him.

686
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,960
Then why would you ask?

687
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,630
Go to the sauna right now and tell him to come to the court.

688
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:24,470
He said he'd be here, so he has to come.

689
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,630
Tell him I won't let him weasel out of this.

690
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,340
If he keeps this up, I'm going to sue.

691
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,340
Okay?

692
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,300
Hobak, hello?

693
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,930
What did she say?

694
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,300
She's demanding for a divorce.

695
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,970
Or she's going to sue.

696
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,640
Oh, this is crazy!

697
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,200
Let! Right!

698
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,040
Doesn't that feel good?

699
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,840
Yes!

700
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,200
Dad, you're the best!

701
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:19,200
I didn't k now what love was back then!

702
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,970
Hello?

703
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,640
Why didn't you answer the phone?

704
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,940
When did you get home from school?

705
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,300
A long time ago.

706
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,600
Then why didn't you pick up the phone?

707
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,770
You scared me!

708
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,930
Didn't I tell you to come home on time?

709
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,990
You did.

710
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,260
So we came straight home.

711
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,360
And?

712
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,140
Well, we were playing with dad.

713
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,370
What?

714
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,800
I'll be right back.

715
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:52,990
Okay.

716
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:00,530
I didn't know what love was back then!

717
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,090
What are you doing?

718
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,890
Come with me.

719
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,900
You two stay here.

720
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,770
What are you doing?

721
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,460
This won't work.

722
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,040
I'm not going to change my mind.

723
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,840
You know how long I waited for you?

724
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:38,140
I'm sorry.

725
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,670
But I missed the boys so much.

726
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,200
You can see them after the divorce.

727
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,500
Don't see them behind my back.

728
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,340
I wanted to take a bath with them

729
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,200
and make them spicy rice cake.

730
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,930
Whatever you want to do for them or with them,

731
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,530
do it after taking care of our issue.

732
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,760
Hobak,

733
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,360
let's start over.

734
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,200
We have the boys.

735
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,840
The boys?

736
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,190
When did you ever think of them?

737
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,360
- Honey.
- Who are you calling honey?

738
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,100
Don't make me mad.

739
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,200
And don't use the boys.

740
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,640
Now you want to think of the boys?

741
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,140
I don't ever want to talk to you or see you.

742
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,370
Get out before I get really mad.

743
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,200
Hobak.

744
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,070
You want me to kick you out?

745
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,540
Dad, don't go!

746
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,360
Dad!

747
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,470
Dad.

748
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,600
Sintong, Bangtong,

749
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,440
I'll come back some other time.

750
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,240
- Dad!
- Mom, can you forgive dad?

751
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,340
Bangtong's crying.

752
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,740
Let's tell dad to stay.

753
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,840
Dad.

754
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,840
No, dad has to leave.

755
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,260
Leave now.

756
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,860
Dad.

757
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,470
Goodbye.

758
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,800
- I'm leaving.
- Dad!

759
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:15,030
- Dad!
- Dad!

760
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,200
Hey.

761
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,160
What are you doing?

762
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,930
Worrying.

763
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,130
I can't figure out what to.

764
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,870
How are things with your family?

765
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,540
It's like walking on thin ice.

766
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,840
The wedding's around the corner.
What now?

767
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,970
You and I will be there.

768
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,140
No way.

769
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,600
You talk to your parents and I'll talk to mine.

770
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,740
Okay.

771
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,370
Father,

772
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,770
the wedding's around the corner.

773
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,100
Wasn't it canceled?

774
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,200
How can you say that?

775
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:19,160
I wanted to talk to you in private.

776
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,530
Have a seat.

777
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,800
About that audition.

778
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:33,870
It keeps bugging me.

779
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,770
You're the daughter I rely on the most,

780
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:42,370
so why in the world did you enter that audition?

781
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,700
Have you no pride?

782
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,500
I know love goes beyond pride,

783
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,030
but that was too much.

784
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,130
I told you before.

785
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,740
We met under such horrible circumstances

786
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,340
that even when he wanted to accept me,

787
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:01,600
his pride wouldn't let him, and that was why.

788
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,200
That's what you think.

789
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:07,870
What normal people would do that?

790
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,900
It's not like his son is a prince.

791
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,990
I was furious and embarrassed to hear that.

792
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,840
Your mom was a bit too harsh,

793
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:20,800
but I don't think he's normal.

794
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,990
Didn't you see him at the lunch?

795
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,260
He kept arguing with your mother.

796
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,640
You think you can handle him?

797
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,600
How can you handle him?

798
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,770
You'd be living with him.

799
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,660
You'll see him every day.

800
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,430
I know what I'm getting into, father.

801
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,590
But that doesn't mean a thing.

802
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,770
To me, you're the most important.

803
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,460
I want him to say you're the only one.

804
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,000
Instead, you had to compete against other women,

805
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,700
cook instant noodles, race carrying a pillow and do a triathlon?

806
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,570
Nobody would believe it.

807
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,740
You know how powerful mother in laws are?

808
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,870
Before the problem used to be the husband's mother,

809
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,700
but now it's the wife's mother.

810
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,740
You've met her, you should know!

811
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,890
But we won't be living together.

812
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,030
She'll still control you.

813
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,300
I can't let you marry her daughter!

814
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:24,160
Like mother, like daughter.

815
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,990
Oh, it's cold.

816
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,640
What's all this?

817
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,540
It's our stuff, mom.

818
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,770
Hobak, Hobak, come out here!

819
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:44,870
You're here?

820
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,600
What do you think you're doing?

821
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,760
You won't listen, so I took actions.

822
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:55,340
I told you that I'd be forced to take action.

823
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,840
Please move out.

824
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,260
You're so mean.

825
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,730
Where can we go in the middle of winter?

826
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,770
Neighbors!

827
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,800
Come out and see!

828
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:07,600
She's kicking her mother in law out!

829
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:10,340
Oh, neighbors!

830
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,800
Be quiet.

831
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,300
How can this happen?

832
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,740
They'd put this on the news!

833
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,570
Why can't it happen?

834
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:21,100
You and I aren't family anymore.

835
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,570
Why would I live with strangers in my home?

836
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,570
Are you picking a fight here?

837
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,030
This is wrong!

838
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,230
You went too far this time.

839
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,390
God will punish you.

840
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,590
The boys miss their dad so much.

841
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:36,570
I heard he came home but you kicked him out.

842
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,300
How could you kick my boy out in this cold?

843
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,570
You made your kids cry,

844
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,600
and now you're kicking me out.

845
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:46,370
You think you'll live happily ever after?

846
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,140
God will punish you!

847
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,140
Fine.

848
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,540
I'll accept any punishment.

849
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,140
What about you?

850
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,640
What about him?

851
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,770
What?

852
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,930
I went too far?

853
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:04,200
Remember what you did to me?

854
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:08,570
You screamed at me to divorce your son.

855
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,130
You said I was in your son's way!

856
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,270
What's wrong?

857
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,630
That woman doesn't want him anymore?

858
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:20,740
She dumped him and now he wants to come back here?

859
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,930
Don't even dream about it.

860
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,090
I'm not a trash can.

861
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:31,770
I won't take someone else's trash.

862
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,300
Hoping he'd come back,

863
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,530
I let him go to her.

864
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,530
Do you know how I felt?

865
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:49,930
Why do you think I took you in when you moved in with your stuff?

866
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,990
Because I like you?

867
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,030
No.

868
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:59,740
I did it because I thought maybe Sedal would be back.

869
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,930
But remember what you did to me?

870
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,860
You're a woman, too.

871
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,240
If you sided with me just once, just once,

872
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,540
I wouldn't be doing this.

873
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,130
I couldn't.

874
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,970
Think of Yeongdal.

875
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,430
Who knows what will happen to her?

876
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,240
You have a single daughter for heaven's sake.

877
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:28,890
You say you never know how one's life will turn out.

878
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,990
After sending Sedal to that woman,

879
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,840
I couldn't sleep anymore.

880
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,640
Just thinking about him being with her

881
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,240
made my blood boil,

882
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:46,040
so I went running at the riverbank.

883
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,360
I beat my chest over and over again.

884
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,240
And what did you do?

885
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,570
You took kimchi to your son.

886
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,890
The son who's living with a rich woman.

887
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,130
Laughing with him, behind my back.

888
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,740
Was it really that great?

889
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,990
My heart's broken to pieces.

890
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,070
It's shattered and covered in dry blood.

891
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,800
And you think I went too far?

892
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,660
Just think of the boys?

893
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:22,470
Take him back for the boys?

894
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,470
I heard lots of people regret getting divorced,

895
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,070
so I tried to hang on with all my might.

896
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:36,100
I tried everything, breaking my heart to pieces.

897
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:40,900
I don't want to open that wound again.

898
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:45,990
I told you that I would hold on until I couldn't take it anymore.

899
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,690
I can't take it anymore and I don't want to.

900
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,200
And now we're strangers.

901
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,870
Understand?

902
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,570
Come out!

903
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,430
I said come out!

904
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,970
Is someone here?

905
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,040
I said come out!

906
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,860
Who's screaming?

907
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:14,840
Go and see.

908
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,370
Hello. What brings you...

909
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,540
Go tell Hobak's folks to come out.

910
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:31,070
Well, what is this about?

911
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,840
I don't know what Yeongdal told you,

912
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,970
but I'm just as upset as she is.

913
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,040
Maybe we should go somewhere...

914
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,130
Loser, you just go and fetch him.

915
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,930
It's Goof-off's mom.

916
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,160
She wants to talk to "Hobak's folks."

917
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,200
I wonder which one.

918
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:56,240
Should it be you, mom?

919
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,470
Hello.

920
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,470
Yes, hello.

921
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,240
You have lots of daughters,

922
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,740
so maybe it's okay for one of them to divorce,

923
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,600
but not us.

924
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:20,270
How dare she demand for a divorce?

925
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:22,660
What did Sedal do to deserve it?

926
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,240
Mr. Want, tell me.

927
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,240
Let's go inside and talk.

928
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,200
Are you on something?

929
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:33,570
You're talking like you're out of your mind.

930
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,600
Who do you think we are?

931
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:38,070
You look like you had a few drinks.

932
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,160
Yes! I had a few drinks! So what?

933
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,970
How dare you talk to me like that?

934
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,970
You want a piece of me?

935
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,740
Stop it.

936
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,100
Mrs. Park, it's cold.
Let's go inside.

937
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:52,100
I'm furious, so I can't feel the cold!

938
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,770
But still, we should go in.

939
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,460
Fine. Let's go in.

940
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,570
You think I'll get scared?

941
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,670
Oh, my!

942
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:03,660
- How dare...
- Oh, my!

943
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:08,370
I can't believe my eyes.

944
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,670
I never said anything because of Hobak,

945
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,570
but how dare you act like this?

946
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,470
You always said everything you wanted!

947
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,930
Hey, Park Salla, are you mad?

948
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,630
Yes, Lee Anggeum, I am mad!

949
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:26,160
Your daughter kicked my son out.

950
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:29,200
It's freezing, but he can't come home

951
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:32,070
when the boys are asking for their dad.

952
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,970
How can she be so heartless?

953
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,700
She thinks she's above everyone.

954
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,640
You must be very sad.

955
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:44,040
We're very sad, too.

956
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,660
But what can we do about it?

957
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:50,700
No parent wants their children to get divorced.

958
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,200
However, Hobak tried very hard,

959
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:55,600
and she couldn't do it anymore.

960
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:59,170
Look what happened to my son.

961
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:02,390
This is how you raised your daughter?

962
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,070
It's because your son cheated on her!

963
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,430
He didn't cheat on her!

964
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,470
A rich woman seduced him,

965
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,370
and he fell for it because he was naive.

966
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,300
Oh, man.

967
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:16,260
Little kids would follow anyone with candy.

968
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:18,070
Is that a sin?

969
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,430
This is impossible. You should leave.

970
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,630
Mr. vice principal,

971
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:25,640
it happens to all men.

972
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:29,400
How can you ask for a divorce over this?

973
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,470
I guess some men could think about it.

974
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,500
But acting it out is wrong.

975
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:40,190
So you're okay with them getting divorced?

976
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:44,540
You should try to talk your daughter out of it!

977
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:48,730
How can you just sit down and watch?

978
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,240
Oh, neighbors!

979
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,890
How dare you call for my neighbors?

980
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,660
Go to your neighborhood and ask for yours!

981
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,930
You want to be humiliated in front of mine?

982
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,870
Don't. She's drunk.

983
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,140
I did try talking to Hobak,

984
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,840
but she's already made up her mind.

985
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:13,370
Since we share grandchildren, let's try to...

986
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,070
Try to do what?

987
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,370
Uncle, take her out of my house.

988
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,300
Oh...

989
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,600
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

990
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,930
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

991
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:30,260
My poor son...

992
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:37,990
You forgot how your daughter treated my son!

993
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,690
Oh, how upsetting!
How upsetting!

994
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,240
Shut up!

995
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,240
Take her home.

996
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,930
Me?

997
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,570
She's drunk and emotional.
She can't go alone.

998
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,030
Take her home.

999
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,530
Why should he have to do that?

1000
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,630
- What is it?
- Come out.

1001
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,970
Right now?

1002
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,100
Okay.

1003
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,730
Mom!

1004
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,140
Take her home.

1005
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,930
Mom, mom!

1006
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,460
Hey.

1007
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,770
Mom, what's wrong with you?

1008
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,430
What do you mean?

1009
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,800
Why would you get drunk like this?

1010
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,200
What if someone saw you?

1011
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,930
Who'd want to marry me?

1012
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,390
When my mom's acting like this?

1013
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,090
Nobody saw me.

1014
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:09,200
Only Loser saw me.

1015
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,360
Like Hobak, they're as tough as nails.

1016
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,100
The whole family's heartless.

1017
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,500
I'm all sober now.

1018
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,300
Now Sedal's the loser.

1019
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,470
Oh, how crazy!

1020
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:30,070
How did we end up like this?

1021
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,570
Wait, why did you leave the apartment?

1022
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,990
What if she moves our stuff outside?

1023
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,130
Right!

1024
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:39,340
We have to stay there so Sedal can return.

1025
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,240
Mom.

1026
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:02,860
Dad! Dad!

1027
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:16,100
Dad...

1028
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,440
You're getting home late.

1029
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,630
Yes, father.

1030
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:29,740
Are you going somewhere?

1031
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,930
Yes, I'm meeting a friend.

1032
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,030
I'll see you later.

1033
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:34,900
Minjung,

1034
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,800
is that the only jacket you have?

1035
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,460
- Excuse me?
- You look cold.

1036
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,640
Go in.

1037
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,200
Okay.

1038
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:49,600
Good boy, go to sleep.

1039
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:51,940
Mother, you should put him down.

1040
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,160
Oh, he starts crying when I do.

1041
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,430
- Give him to me.
- Oh.

1042
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,570
I can't take this.
He fidgets so much.

1043
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,260
He takes after me.

1044
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,990
No, he's just like Subak.

1045
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,360
She was so fidgety and hot tempered.

1046
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,700
She's still really hot-tempered.

1047
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,100
Get out.

1048
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:28,390
Let's have dinner some other time.

1049
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,590
I have golf plans tomorrow.

1050
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,160
Are you upset?

1051
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:35,800
Tell me what you want.

1052
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:37,740
What should I get you?

1053
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,100
You want a handbag?
The latest design?

1054
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:42,140
Really hot.

1055
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,240
Can I be honest?

1056
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,770
About what?

1057
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:48,660
Get rid of all the women you're seeing.

1058
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,200
I can't take it anymore.

1059
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:54,240
I didn't know you got so jealous!

1060
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,840
Oh, no!

1061
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:59,260
You're so sexy when you're jealous.

1062
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,360
But you're taken.

1063
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,840
- Taken?
- Yes.

1064
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:06,300
You have a husband.

1065
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:13,070
Go to sleep, my Jungji.

1066
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:17,430
Let's go and see if mom's coming.

1067
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,390
Go to sleep, my Jungji.

1068
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:32,390
Go to sleep, go to sleep.

1069
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,570
And you're buying me that handbag!

1070
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:50,840
Okay. I'll get you a crocodile bag.

1071
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:58,840
Hobak.

1072
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,370
Please tell me I'm seeing things!

1073
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,070
Wasn't that the bastard?

1074
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,840
You have no right to call him that.

1075
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:08,660
That's the bastard you lived with.

1076
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,660
How can you still see him?

1077
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:12,760
Stay out of my business.

1078
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:13,660
Subak.

1079
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:15,360
Be quiet.

1080
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,570
It's my life.

1081
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,260
It's none of your business.

1082
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:19,800
This is wrong.

1083
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:22,630
You were young and you made a mistake.

1084
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:25,470
You were only twenty one.

1085
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:29,100
You left home to go to college and lived with that man.

1086
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:31,940
It almost broke our parents marriage.

1087
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:34,070
So how could you see him again?

1088
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,840
If it weren't for you, I would've married him.

1089
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:42,070
If you hadn't told on me to father,

1090
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,840
I would've become Miss Korea.

1091
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,430
That day,

1092
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,430
when you showed up with father,

1093
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,430
that was the day of the pageant.

1094
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,200
If father hadn't beaten me up

1095
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:58,640
my life would've turned out differently.

1096
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:01,300
I'm here because of you! Understand?

1097
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:02,990
What about my life?

1098
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:08,940
You lived with a man but because of you,

1099
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,240
I had to drop out of college.

1100
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,970
And I didn't tell him.

1101
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,390
He heard it from somewhere.

1102
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,760
He hit me till I bled.

1103
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:22,430
And he cried the whole time.

1104
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,740
He asked me where you were.

1105
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,890
Whom you were living with.

1106
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:32,070
You told me to shut my mouth, so I did.

1107
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,130
It's in the past.

1108
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,540
You made a mistake.

1109
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,160
But Subak,

1110
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,930
don't do this.

1111
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:49,370
You have no idea how horrible what you're doing is, do you?

1112
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:56,800
It's the most cowardly and evil thing in the world.

1113
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:59,660
To me, it was hell.

1114
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:01,970
My spouse being with another person.

1115
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:04,240
That's hell.

1116
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,570
It destroys one's soul completely.

1117
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,190
Subak, I'm begging you.

1118
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:15,140
End it now.

1119
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,160
What if Minjung finds out?

1120
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,260
Everyone will be ruined.

1121
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:25,590
You, the kids, and Minjung, everyone.

1122
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,500
Minjung!

1124
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:10,370
Hold on. I have something to...

1125
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,040
I don't want to see you. Get out!

1126
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,090
What are you doing?

1127
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:14,340
What are you doing here?

1128
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,740
How could you do this to me?

1129
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,370
What do you mean by that?

1130
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,940
Be honest with me.
I think I have to know.

1131
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,930
Mom, try to remember.

1132
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:24,700
I don't remember where I put him.

1133
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,930
I should just die!

1134
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,230
He better be okay!

1135
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,070
Or you'll be sorry!

1136
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,990
I don't need any of you!

1137
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,840
I want all of you to leave!

1138
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:39,200
Your mom's the most important person to me.
