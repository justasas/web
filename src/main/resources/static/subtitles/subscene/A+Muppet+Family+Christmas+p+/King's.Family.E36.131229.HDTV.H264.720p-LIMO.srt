00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,280
Don! Wait for me!

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,020
What were you doing?

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,310
What were you doing with Loser?

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,710
I didn't do anything!

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,040
Then why did you run?

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,090
I ran because you chased after me.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,740
That's nonsense!

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,110
Stop hitting me!

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,750
What if something happens to me?

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,610
What? What could happen?

12
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,950
Huh?

13
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,240
It's nothing, mom.

14
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,340
Don was here to ask me something.

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,810
Ask you what?

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,420
About stuff.

17
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,620
You're acting really suspicious.

18
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,880
What do you mean?

19
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,750
I think Loser's interested in you.

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,250
No way. He's not interested in me.

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,390
I think he is!

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,490
He's been following you around lately.

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,390
Don't fall for him!

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,420
I won't.

25
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,020
I'm not a leaf. I don't fall.

26
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,450
You're talking like Loser now.

27
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,310
He thinks you're easy, but he's wrong.

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,340
Let's go.

29
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,990
Where were you?

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,810
Are you having an affair?

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,280
Yes.

32
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,720
Don't be cheeky with me.

33
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,520
Go to bed.

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,410
Do you think I'm an idiot?

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,320
Why won't you believe me?

36
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,450
If that's true, I'd be jumping up and down.

37
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,110
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,350
The house seems empty.
Almost desolate.

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,850
Like there are a lot less people.

40
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,690
It's because Gwangbak's not here.

41
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,180
Where's Minjung?

42
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,840
He's busy.

43
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,550
You can relax, Bong.

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,580
Three of your daughters are married.

45
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,020
We still have a long way to go.

46
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,050
We have Haebak and Daebak.

47
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,890
Haebak's fine, but I'm worried about Daebak.

48
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,350
Haebak will get a scholarship,

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,220
and she'll become a judge for sure.

50
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,840
But what will become of Daebak...

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,890
He'll be able to take care of himself.

52
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,190
A fortune teller told me he'll be successful.

53
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,680
Incredible! Grandmother, you're the best.

54
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,710
I'm furious.

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,780
I couldn't sleep because of it.

56
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,020
After giving my blessings!

57
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,950
- We're off to school.
- See you later.

58
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,820
Pay attention to your teacher.

59
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,890
I'll make you spicy rice cakes when you come home.

60
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,350
Dad, you're the best.

61
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,820
Get me a fresh bowl of soup. It's cold.

62
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,890
Okay. Is it cold?

63
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,280
Give me lots of vegetables.

64
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,390
Can't you get your own soup?

65
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,640
I did this for him when he was unemployed.

66
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,640
And I actually have a job.

67
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,290
Here.

68
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,490
Eat up and go to work.

69
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,080
Why aren't you eating?

70
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,450
Sedal, don't you have anything sour and sweet?

71
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,690
There's nothing to eat here.

72
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,020
How can you complain about the food?

73
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,180
Why not? He's the cook, isn't he?

74
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,840
What's wrong with her?

75
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,240
She hasn't been eating so well.

76
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,080
I think she lost her appetite.

77
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,690
Make something special for her later.

78
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,740
Leave her be.
She'll eat when she's hungry.

79
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,510
I want you to do it.

80
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,110
Okay.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,650
Looking back,

82
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,090
I think we had a very mundane life.

83
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:16,380
When did we ever laugh together or hold each other and cry in joy?

84
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,410
I wasn't able to make you happy.

85
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:29,180
Anyway, I'm sorry things turned out like this.

86
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,510
I asked to see you today

87
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,710
because Gwangbak's married now

88
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,590
and we should finalize the divorce.

89
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,450
Is that all you have to say?

90
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,080
What else can I say?

91
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,990
You're impossible.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,880
You don't want to divorce me?

93
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,720
There's no reason for us to stay together.

94
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,550
You said you wanted it.

95
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,740
I don't care what you think.

96
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,380
But I'm thinking right now.

97
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,880
About what?

98
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,510
What is there to think about?

99
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,810
We have children.

100
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,110
Don't use them to force me to stay.

101
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,350
I have no intention to do that.

102
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,880
I'm thinking about what to do with the kids.

103
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,010
I'll call you when I decide.

104
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,280
You keep thinking and thinking.

105
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,220
That's all you do.

106
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,090
You're always thinking.

107
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,590
That's what's wrong with you.

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,320
You never think things through, including this.

109
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,080
So? What's wrong with that? It's nice.

110
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,750
Shut your mouth.

111
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,210
Do as I say, no matter what.

112
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,610
I'll call you later.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,310
I'll raise the kids.

114
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,810
What right do you have?

115
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,550
I'm their mom.

116
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,180
You said you're worried about the kids.

117
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,140
I'll raise them.

118
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,490
They are my kids.

119
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,810
I can't let a woman like you raise them.

120
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,990
Then take them with you.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,350
- You!
- You're going to slap me again?

122
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,290
Slap me again.

123
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,110
I'll get a medical report and sue you.

124
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,720
Why is everything so...

125
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,610
Do you ever think about anything?

126
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,310
I wish I could be like you.

127
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,680
Then be like me.

128
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,880
Our relationship has been ruined,

129
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,580
so divorce is the only natural course.

130
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,420
And volunteering to raise the kids.

131
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,990
What's wrong with that?

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,490
You're really going to raise the kids?

133
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,940
How can I?
My mom will raise them.

134
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,710
But you must pay child support.

135
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,420
Don't call me before I call you.

136
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,610
I won't answer your calls.

137
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,990
I'm so annoyed.

138
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,110
Why?

139
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,090
He won't divorce me.

140
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,250
I want to divorce him so I can marry you.

141
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,380
But he won't sign the papers.

142
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,940
He has no self respect.

143
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,550
Maybe he can't let me go.

144
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,420
You want to marry me?

145
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,110
Of course.

146
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,880
It took us so long to get back together.

147
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,740
Does your husband know who I am?

148
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,850
I don't think so.
Only that you're my boss.

149
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,180
Don't let him find out.
I don't want trouble.

150
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,380
I know that.

151
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,220
Oh, what's that smell? Huh?

152
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,440
It's for when the kids return from their honeymoon.

153
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,210
Oh, don't burn anything, okay?

154
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,390
What time are they going to be here?

155
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,990
Around dinner time, I think.

156
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,090
Minjung.

157
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,050
I'm going to be really late.

158
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,150
I'll try to finish early,

159
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,120
but don't wait for me, mother.

160
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,550
- Yes, father.
- Put her on.

161
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,850
Hold on.

162
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,550
Here. It's my father.

163
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,510
Yes, father.

164
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,110
Where are you?

165
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,220
We're on our way back to Seoul, father.

166
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,640
How long will it take?

167
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,410
How long will it take?

168
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,680
Well?

169
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,990
We'll get there in about two hours.

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,090
Father, it'll take about two hours...

171
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,740
Come home within two hours.

172
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,490
Excuse me?

173
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,640
Don't make me repeat myself.

174
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,950
But we have to drop by my parents house.

175
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,050
Come home within two hours!

176
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,110
Father.

177
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,850
What do we do?

178
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,920
Father wants us home in two hours.

179
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,520
We...

180
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,850
We can't see each other again.

181
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,290
We can't, never again?

182
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,820
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,280
Sunjeong.

184
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,440
Yes, Daese.

185
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,910
Yes, Daese.

186
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,410
Are you okay?
You don't look well.

187
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,680
I'm fine.

188
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,590
Can you prepare dinner?
The kids are coming.

189
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,510
Aren't they eating at her parents house?

190
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,240
I told them to come home.

191
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,740
You did?

192
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,840
Miho, get the door.

193
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,380
Mom, it's aunt. Should I open the door?

194
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,680
Open it.

195
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,610
Hello.

196
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,280
Hi.

197
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,990
You look just like your mom when she was little.

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,040
You're not going to be pretty at all.

199
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,740
I'll be prettier than you, aunt.

200
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,190
And don't chew gum so loudly.

201
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,890
It makes you look uncouth.

202
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,040
What?

203
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,240
Teach your girl some manners.

204
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,240
You should act like an adult first.

205
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,190
How could you say that to a child?

206
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,240
Why not?

207
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,820
And spit out your gum.

208
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,050
Mind your own business.

209
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,280
Why are you so busy?

210
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,840
I'm cooking for the kids when they come back.

211
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,220
They're not eating at her parents house?

212
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,920
They didn't want to cook for them, huh?

213
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,740
You don't know anything, so be quiet.

214
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,740
Stop! You haven't washed your hands.

215
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,180
My hands are clean.

216
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,020
I washed them at home.

217
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,220
Don;t be such a neat freak.

218
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,380
Did you make bulgogi?

219
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,610
It's Sangnam's favorite.

220
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,090
He doesn't eat that, don't you know?

221
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,420
Why not?

222
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,640
He ended up at an ER after eating that when he was little. Remember?

223
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,350
You were there and you don't remember?

224
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,690
It was your bulgogi that made him sick!

225
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,720
He ate it when I made it for him last time.

226
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,640
I'm sure he was pretending.

227
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,440
Please try to be considerate.

228
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,240
Go sit in the living room.

229
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,910
You're so rude.

230
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,240
I don't want to be in the same room with you.

231
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,510
I'm enduring it because of Daese and Sangnam.

232
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,010
Me too!

233
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,440
I would never see you, if I could.

234
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,550
Are you dating anyone?

235
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,140
It's none of your business.

236
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,280
You're mean because you're not dating.

237
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,290
I'm not you!

238
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,940
But I'm right.

239
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,990
Women should date because being in love softens you up

240
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,820
and changes your personality.

241
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:58,090
See how good tempered I am?

242
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,510
Do you keep in tough with that man you dated?

243
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,990
Be quiet.

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,540
I don't want you talking about him.

245
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,880
Don't be so pissy.

246
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,680
I'm still your older sister, girl.

247
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,380
You don't know what happened to him?

248
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,740
You could find out, if you wanted.

249
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,540
I think I heard he runs his own business.

250
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,740
I can't believe you've gotten over him.

251
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,780
Heartless.

252
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,780
Dating for 7 years is like being married.

253
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,180
Don't you think so?

254
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,040
Please shut up!

255
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,010
I can't believe how rude you are.

256
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,240
I said shut up.

257
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,350
Girl,

258
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,420
you're scaring me here.

259
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,010
You're getting meaner with age.

260
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,910
When you get older, you should soften up.

261
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,780
But you're mean and nasty.

262
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,540
My son in law, Sangnam.

263
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,010
Welcome.

264
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,180
Thank you.

265
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,880
Did you have a nice dream?

266
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,440
I didn't.
I didn't sleep at all.

267
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,810
How could he get sleep?
All night, they...

268
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,610
Mother.

269
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,510
They were busy staring at each other all night.

270
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,140
What did I say?

271
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,490
You should let me finish.

272
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,990
You're right.

273
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,720
Father, I know everything.

274
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,110
Saying you should stare at each other is

275
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,880
wrong with sex education now.

276
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,440
I didn't know that, sir, I apologize.

277
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,780
How does it feel to be married?
Really happy?

278
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,810
Yes, I'm really happy.

279
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,240
I'm wondering why I waited so long.

280
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,040
For me, it doesn't feel real yet.

281
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,410
It's because you're here.

282
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,010
It'll hit you when you go to his house.

283
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,450
You didn't get hanbok?

284
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,490
You need to wear it when you go home.

285
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,610
They skipped it to keep the wedding small.

286
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,610
They didn't get hanbok.

287
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,040
Where's Hobak?

288
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,540
Something came up at work.

289
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,490
Where's Minjung?

290
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,510
He's busy.

291
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,640
Minjung hasn't been home for days.

292
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,910
He told me he'd try to come.

293
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,540
Call him and tell him to come home for dinner.

294
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,110
Why? He'll be here when he can.

295
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,610
And don't call him when he's busy.

296
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,740
I wonder if he's eating.

297
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,280
Is he sleeping at the office?

298
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,280
I think so.

299
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,640
You're talking like he's a stranger.

300
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,880
You should check on him.
He's your husband.

301
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,590
Let's have dinner.

302
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,050
Mom, we have to go.

303
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,490
Why?

304
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,040
Have dinner and hang out.

305
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,380
Father wants us home.

306
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,810
What was that?

307
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,520
Who does that?

308
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,040
You have dinner at the wife's side of the family

309
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,540
when you come back from the honeymoon!

310
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,040
Sangnam, how can you let this happen?

311
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,840
I told him we'd be there.

312
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,110
My family is big, but he's all alone.

313
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,990
He's not! He has Sunjeong and Miho.

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,820
How could he tell you to come home?

315
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,050
He didn't.

316
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,540
We'll come another time, mom.

317
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,780
Let's go, Sangnam.

318
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,210
Sit down. We should eat here.

319
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,240
Mother, we'll eat here.

320
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,490
It's okay.

321
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,740
You should go.

322
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,320
We're fine.

323
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,720
No, we're eating here.

324
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,950
Where are they?

325
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,720
He must be stuck in traffic.

326
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,880
Maybe she took him to her parents house.

327
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,220
Where are you?

328
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,850
I'm at Gwangbak's house.

329
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,990
We're having dinner here.

330
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,850
What? Didn't I tell you to be here?

331
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,210
I'll explain to you later.

332
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,450
I have to go.

333
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,220
Why you...
Hey! Sangnam!

334
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,280
How dare they!

335
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,140
How dare they disobey me?

336
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,310
Whoa, I don't believe this!

337
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,650
It's not Sangnam.
It's her family.

338
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,740
You should nip this in the bud.

339
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,150
Manjeong.

340
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,320
What? I'm right.

341
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,920
Gwangbak, you have to come now.

342
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,780
Uncle is furious.

343
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,990
Okay, Miho. Thanks.

344
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,220
Call me if anything else happens.

345
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:55,240
Everything is so delicious.

346
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,840
Oh...

347
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,620
Eat up.

348
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,350
Chew slowly.
You'll get indigestion.

349
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,820
Slow down.

350
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,240
What's wrong?
Do you feel sick?

351
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,580
Huh? Get the medicine.

352
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,850
Oh, no! Anggeum, you gave him too much.

353
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,210
I'm fine.

354
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,240
I'm just so happy.

355
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,340
I've always envied kids with big families.

356
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,080
When I came home from school,

357
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,040
my house was always empty.

358
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,450
But when I went to my friend's house,

359
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,420
there were brothers, sisters and a mom.

360
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,950
They welcomed me and fed me.

361
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,490
Whenever I went to my friend's house,

362
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,450
I didn't want to come home.

363
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,810
I stayed until my father came to get me,

364
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,040
thinking how nice it would be to live there.

365
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:02,510
Being here tonight reminds me of that time.

366
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,380
Incredible.

367
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,420
I've already envied those with no siblings.

368
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,740
They don't have to share anything.

369
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,920
I know.

370
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:12,720
Right.

371
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,890
We grew up envying friends with no siblings.

372
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,690
You try living with a mom who hits you and yells at you.

373
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,510
And fights over food, crying.

374
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,450
It was hell for us.

375
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,810
We all said not having siblings was the beset kind of life to have.

376
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,450
Thank you for saying that.

377
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,280
Thank you.

378
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:38,690
Everyone longs for someone they don't have.

379
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,720
You should let it all go because we're your family now.

380
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,190
Wang's family.

381
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,280
I will.

382
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,040
Mother, can I come here every day and eat?

383
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,340
As long as you pay for the food, sure.

384
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,040
You're nuts.

385
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,410
Oh, this is nuts!

386
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,590
I'm the one who's going nuts!

387
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,110
Hobak's getting worse because you let her!

388
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,190
Try standing up for yourself.

389
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,850
Even a mouse cries out when cornered.

390
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,740
Why can't you do that?

391
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,950
Why would I even try?

392
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,590
Mom, I'm doing this because I want to.

393
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,140
I don't want to get a job.

394
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,720
I like running the house. It's nice.

395
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,810
But you're a young man!

396
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,780
You're my son, not my daughter.

397
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,880
Why did you turn into a housewife?

398
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,520
I can't sleep at night because of you.

399
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,880
Oh, I'm happy.

400
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,320
Your father's furious.

401
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,740
Miho's been calling and texting me.

402
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,040
Don't worry. You have me.

403
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:20,080
My mom and father are much more forgiving than your father.

404
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,220
Can't you just help me out?

405
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,240
Don't do anything to upset your father.

406
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,740
But we were supposed to eat here tonight.

407
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,890
My father was being unreasonable.

408
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,920
I'm their son in law.

409
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,780
I should do my part to your parents.

410
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,190
We didn't do anything wrong, so relax.

411
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,040
I'll get yelled at, not you. Let's go.

412
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,150
The bride and groom are...

413
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,240
Who do you think you are?

414
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,490
What were you thinking?

415
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,720
This is how you want her to act?

416
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,540
My own son thinks I'm a joke,

417
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,190
so why would your wife respect me?

418
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,190
Didn't I tell you to come home?

419
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,280
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you, but

420
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,490
it's tradition to have dinner at her house.

421
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,950
What?

422
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,780
I still think what you did was wrong.

423
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,140
You should've asked your father first.

424
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,690
We all waited for you without eating,

425
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,090
and you show up this late?

426
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,220
I think it's up to the woman.

427
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,190
She asked me to come, but I told her no.

428
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,950
Even if Sangnam wanted to stay for dinner,

429
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,740
you should've pushed him to come home!

430
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,040
I told you to be home within two hours!

431
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,080
I'm sorry, father.

432
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,380
Father you're being unreasonable.

433
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,050
You can scold her,

434
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,010
but you should do it when she deserves it.

435
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,510
She did nothing wrong.

436
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,690
How dare you defend her?

437
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,820
If you're going to act that way with your wife,

438
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,540
you're not my son.

439
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,120
Daese, this is her first night here so we...

440
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,490
Forget it!

441
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,790
what are you wearing?
You didn't get hanbok?

442
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,840
How can you wear that instead of hanbok

443
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,010
on your way back from the honeymoon?

444
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,390
They didn't get hanbok because...

445
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,120
You stay out of this.

446
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,740
There isn't a thing I like about her.

447
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,580
You!

448
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,990
Yes, father.

449
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,080
What's this?

450
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,540
Why is this...

451
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,490
Oh, my!

452
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,450
You gave this to him?

453
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,950
Unbelievable.

454
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,310
You really made no effort, huh?

455
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,180
I'm sure she didn't do it on purpose.

456
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,510
The mistake itself shows no effort.

457
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,840
I'm sorry.

458
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,990
I put the wrong letter by mistake.

459
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,990
The real letter is at home.

460
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,420
Forget it.

461
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,590
I don't want a letter that's copied.

462
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,610
You said you'd be good to me.

463
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,190
You said you'd make me happy.

464
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,950
Yes.

465
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,810
And this is you being good to me?

466
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,220
How can you lie every day?

467
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,490
Why are you crying?

468
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,590
Don't make me regret giving my blessings.

469
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,680
Father, that's too much.

470
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm too much?

471
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,190
Yes.

472
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,010
People make mistakes.

473
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,780
It's not right to say such harsh words...

474
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,880
Sangnam.

475
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,640
You fool.

476
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,110
Calm down and let them pay their respects.

477
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,050
For what?

478
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,950
She has no respect for me!

479
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,010
Go in.

480
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,120
You stay here.

481
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,020
Your father has every right to be angry.

482
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,720
She should've been more careful.

483
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,120
It seemed insincere.

484
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,850
You could think it's nothing,

485
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,040
but that's when things are good.

486
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,310
That was why he told you to come straight home,

487
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,580
but you ignored it, so he's acting like that.

488
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,150
Father, I'm sorry.

489
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,690
This will never ever happen again.

490
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,540
Father, please let me bow.

491
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,190
There's no need.

492
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,110
You're stubborn, but I'm stubborn, too.

493
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,050
Don't bother bowing.

494
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,280
After my husband passed away,

495
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,880
you know how hard it was to raise them?

496
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,290
Sedal is my only son.

497
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,340
He was the light of my life.

498
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,250
I put him through law school.

499
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,510
But then you happened to him.

500
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,610
He wanted to become a prosecutor,

501
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,620
but thanks to you,

502
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,620
he lived like a loser on $3 a day.

503
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,950
He made the mistake of falling for a rich woman,

504
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,620
and now he's paying for it.

505
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,820
Imagine how I feel watching this.

506
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,080
You have sons, so you must know.

507
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,240
So mother,

508
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,240
just accept what's going on.

509
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,650
There's nothing I can do.

510
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,920
Even if Sedal did nothing wrong,

511
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,720
this is how things must be.

512
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,720
Just look. It's nice.
Sedal has something to do.

513
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,850
Being a housewife isn't a job!

514
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,240
Lots of men do it these days.

515
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,810
You working made your mom sad,

516
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,610
and I'm sad when I see my son cooking.

517
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,750
Times change and men and women are equal

518
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,580
but all moms with sons feel the same.

519
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:54,040
They want their sons to make money, doing what they love, not to be a housewife.

520
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,920
But what else could we do?

521
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,850
Sedal's the only one available.

522
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,040
He needs something to do.

523
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,490
You're not doing this because you need him.

524
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,920
This is your revenge!

525
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,490
Fine. This is my revenge.

526
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,720
I can't take Sedal back, just like that.

527
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,690
He has to make up for what he did.

528
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,390
Or I wouldn't be able to take him back.

529
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:29,540
So mother, please be patient until I get over everything.

530
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,040
I would've dumped him if I could,

531
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,080
but I can't.

532
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,580
He's my husband.

533
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,780
He's the father of my children.

534
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,880
I hate him and I want to leave him, but I can't.

535
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,720
So what can I do?

536
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,450
I want to torture him until I feel better.

537
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,120
How long will you keep this up?

538
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,240
I don't know.

539
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,720
Just think of me as your son in law.

540
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,990
Or you can move out if you can't handle it.

541
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,450
What?

542
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,220
You're telling me to move out again?

543
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,280
If you can't take this, maybe you should.

544
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,040
You go inside.

545
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,990
I've said all I have to say.

546
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,990
Mom, why are you being so stubborn?

547
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,690
I got myself into this.

548
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,190
She's not heartless. She took me back.

549
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,280
She's being heartless right now.

550
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,080
She'll torture you until you die.

551
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,010
What else could she do?

552
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,150
How could she just forgive me?

553
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,950
Could you do it, if it were you?

554
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,240
Mom, I went to hell and back.

555
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,040
I'm happy now. I agreed to do this.

556
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,640
Even if she insisted on doing this,

557
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,420
if I didn't like it, I would've said no.

558
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,620
I'm fine with it, so all is well.

559
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,350
Housekeeping is actually fun.

560
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,280
It's perfect for me.

561
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,880
You're an idiot.

562
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,090
I'm embarrassed.

563
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,640
What if other people find out?

564
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,150
Why should you be embarrassed?

565
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,740
Lots of men do what I do now.

566
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,890
Quiet!

567
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,680
Be discreet when you go grocery shopping and when you take out the trash.

568
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,420
Such an idiot... Ugh...

569
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,880
This is nuts.

570
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,720
Are you sad?

571
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,950
The welcoming party was too much, right?

572
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,420
It was my fault.
I made the mistake.

573
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,950
He didn't like me from the start,

574
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,740
so I should've been more careful.

575
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,280
My father was too harsh.

576
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,580
I put myself in his shoes.

577
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,010
He had every right to react that way.

578
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,320
Don't worry.
I'll do my best to the end.

579
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:08,690
I'll show him what kind of person I am and make him love me.

580
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,550
I'm glad you feel that way.

581
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,590
Hey, wife.

582
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,280
It's our first night in our own house.

583
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,920
Did you sleep well?

584
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,150
Did you?

585
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,010
Yes.

586
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,450
Uh, no, I didn't.

587
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,590
I feel really badly about everything.

588
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,990
You should brace yourself.

589
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,890
Sleep well and eat well.

590
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,890
this won't be a temporary residence for you.

591
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,580
I need to learn a lot, about everything.

592
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,780
All girls these days are like that.

593
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,780
But take your time. I'll help you.

594
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,190
Just be here when I go to my class.

595
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,450
Clean these.

596
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,540
Who came to dinner last night?

597
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:33,510
It must have been a big party.

598
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,150
Sangnam was really happy about that.

599
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,920
Everyone except Hobak's family and Minjung came.

600
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,650
Minjung seemed like a really nice person.

601
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,620
Yes, he really is.

602
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,190
He's actually nicer than Subak.

603
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,650
Let's go to the market later.

604
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,740
Yes, aunt.

605
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,590
Did you sleep well, father?

606
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,010
Sunjeong, I'll see you later.

607
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,810
But you need your breakfast...

608
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,180
He goes to the construction site first.

609
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,650
See you later, Daese.

610
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,420
Father, I'll see you later.

611
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,950
I'll get the breakfast ready for you.

612
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,240
Aeji, it's me.

613
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,190
Dad.

614
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,190
How are you, Aeji?

615
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,950
Dad, come home.

616
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,150
Dad, come home.
Why won't you come?

617
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,790
I'm really busy.

618
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,780
Aeji, if you miss me,

619
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,580
you can call me anytime, day or night.

620
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,340
I'll come and see you.

621
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,510
Dad, I miss you.

622
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,240
Me too.

623
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,310
Aeji, goodbye.

624
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,540
He's not coming?

625
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,450
He says he's busy so I should call him later.

626
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,950
He must be really, really busy.

627
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,540
I wonder if he has time to eat.

628
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,340
- This one is fresher.
- Oh!

629
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,710
Yes, yes.

630
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,740
You're really fresh.

631
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,420
I am?

632
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,820
Huh? Minjung!

633
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,880
Gwangbak.

634
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,990
Hello.

635
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,620
Yes, hello.

636
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,220
You're back from your honeymoon already?

637
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,120
Yes.

638
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,190
Sangnam couldn't take time off,

639
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,720
so we went to a ski resort for one night.

640
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,180
I was sad because you weren't there last night.

641
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,140
I heard you are very busy these days.

642
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,610
Yes, it's the end of the year.

643
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:51,220
Your absence was really big.

644
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,140
Everyone waited for you.

645
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,640
They did?

646
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,540
I should go. I'm behind schedule.

647
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,120
Go, Minjung.

648
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,490
I wish you all the happiness.

649
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,890
I'll see you again.

650
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,890
What are you doing?

651
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,250
You scared me.

652
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,090
Why would you get scared?

653
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,290
How did you get in?

654
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,220
What? You left the door open.

655
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,310
Shouldn't you say hello instead of how did you get in?

656
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,910
Your father in law should yell at you more.

657
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,410
Make me something. I'm hungry.

658
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,290
You want me to eat this?

659
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,890
I'm sorry.
This is all I have right now.

660
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,040
Fried egg?

661
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,850
What kind of daughter in law serves fried egg to her mother in law?

662
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,250
You should at least make me some stew and fish!

663
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,050
I'm sorry, mother.

664
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,080
I don't know how to cook yet.

665
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,780
I'm learning so I'll make it for you next time.

666
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,720
Your mom didn't teach you how to cook?

667
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,450
I can't believe your mom.

668
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,850
How dare she let you get married?

669
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,250
And you.

670
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,890
I wanted to say this last night,

671
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,490
but why haven't you been calling me?

672
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,990
Excuse me?

673
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,390
You should've called me the minute you got to your hotel, don't you think?

674
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,540
Like I said before, Sangnam's my son.

675
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,390
You should be good to me.

676
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,850
Do you understand?

677
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,540
You're here. Wait for me here.

678
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,450
I'll take a shower and be out in 10 minutes.

679
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,850
Let's go have dinner.

680
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,890
Did you like that last restaurant?

681
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,750
I made reservations there.

682
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,450
Your mouth is so small.

683
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,540
Why is it so hot in here?

684
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,010
Isn't it hot in here?

685
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,490
It feels fine.

686
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,790
Maybe it's because I just exercised.

687
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,190
May I unbutton my shirt?

688
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,490
Go ahead.

689
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,850
Here.

690
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,120
Ah...

691
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,580
It must take a long time for you to eat.

692
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,080
I couldn't eat much since I was a girl.

693
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:42,410
You've done a great job keeping your figure.

694
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,910
I don't do anything.
I was born with it.

695
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,910
Oh, did I sound conceited?

696
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,950
No, you didn't.

697
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,910
When you're beautiful, it's okay.

698
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,610
My hand feels soft, doesn't it?

699
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,450
Feel it.

700
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,910
Oh, it's really soft.

701
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,640
Oh, my...

702
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,040
Who is it?

703
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,450
It's bothering me.

704
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,040
Is it a woman?

705
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,310
No.

706
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,490
- What?
- You're not coming for dinner?

707
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,450
I'm having dinner with a guest.

708
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,890
But you should come home to have dinner.

709
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,020
Why would you call to say that?

710
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,990
Mind your own business. Bye.

711
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,410
Okay.

712
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,420
What did he say?

713
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,640
He has an appointment.

714
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,040
He told us to enjoy our dinner on our own.

715
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,280
He thanked me for calling.

716
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,220
Who was that?

717
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,850
My kid's mom.

718
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,390
Do you talk to her often?

719
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,450
No.

720
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:04,180
She came to attend the wedding but she hasn't gone home yet.

721
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,680
Do you live with her?

722
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,950
No.

723
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,720
I met her because of our son. That's all.

724
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,120
She's going home soon.

725
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,580
Okay.

726
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,240
It's too cold to eat out here.

727
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,190
This is better for the baby.
The air's nice.

728
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,740
Here.

729
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,490
My princess.

730
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,040
You eat, too.

731
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,120
I'll eat after you're done.

732
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,490
The rich men you dated must have taken you to nice places, 

733
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,020
but now you're stuck with me,

734
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,450
eating cold chicken in the park.

735
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,680
I'm fine with it.

736
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,910
The men I dated before didn't give a hoot

737
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,380
about me or what I wanted to eat.

738
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,390
They sway your true colors come out when you eat,

739
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,080
and they ate all the drumsticks.

740
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,580
I even broke up with a guy during dinner.

741
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,890
We were having chicken gizzards.

742
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,520
And they were messy when they ate.

743
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,490
Where did you find guys like that?

744
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,140
Heartless bastards.

745
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,510
I know.

746
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:22,180
I'll always give you the best part of everything.

747
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,310
Here.

748
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,420
I don't want you to catch a cold.

749
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,680
My princess.

750
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,880
Okay, my prince.

751
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,020
Ah.

752
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,080
Eat.

753
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,720
Let's get on the next one.

754
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,890
The elevator's here.

755
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,450
Where should we go next?

756
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,490
Karaoke! Karaoke!

757
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,410
Should we stay on or get off?

758
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,840
We can do this again next time.

759
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,850
Get in before someone sees us.

760
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,040
I don't want to say goodbye.

761
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,390
Give me some time.

762
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,650
I'll talk to Bong and set the date.

763
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,250
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.

764
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,120
I hope that I'm the best thing that ever happened to you, too.

765
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:23,620
I miss you already.

766
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,540
Me too.

767
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:40,850
Me too.

768
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,620
What's that? It's yours?

769
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,720
Yes.

770
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,850
Why are you reading that when you're single?

771
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,750
Why can't a single girl read this?

772
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,190
I want to be ready before I get married.

773
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,450
What the...

774
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,250
Read it after you get married.

775
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,990
You do the weirdest things sometimes.

776
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:17,020
We have a cooking lesson at No. 1905.

777
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,690
Oh, we do? At what time?

778
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,790
Oh, recycling is a problem, did you know?

779
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,320
Hello.

780
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,990
Oh, hi.

781
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,910
I'm the neighborhood association leader.

782
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,540
Oh, hello.

783
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,990
This is my day off, so I'm helping my wife

784
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,540
with the cleaning and the trash.

785
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,150
You don't have to say that.

786
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,180
The word's out.

787
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,840
We have lots of men like you here.

788
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,390
So don't be embarrassed.

789
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,020
You'll do this for the rest of your life.

790
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,780
Not for the rest of my life.

791
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,090
I'm taking a leave of absence right now.

792
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,490
That's what they all say.

793
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,680
But you'll get used to it.

794
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,490
Come to the monthly meeting.

795
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,850
And drop by my house sometime.

796
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:19,490
Drop by?

797
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,910
We have coffee together.

798
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,640
Come by. We can chat.

799
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,010
We're home!

800
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:32,450
Hi!

801
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,490
Wow! Spicy rice cakes!

802
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,620
It's great to have you home, dad.

803
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:40,040
Stay home and don't go anywhere.

804
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,540
Yes! Yes!

805
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:45,450
We got lonely because nobody was home,

806
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,410
but now, it feels great.

807
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,810
- It does?
- It does, it does!

808
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,540
Eat this and do homework.
Make mom happy.

809
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,850
Okay.

810
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,120
So dad, you're mom and mom's dad?

811
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,490
That doesn't matter as long as you have a mom and a dad.

812
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,250
Go wash your hands.

813
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,290
Okay!

814
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,040
Oh...

815
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:07,390
I'm so happy.

816
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:19,890
You have a doctor's appointment today.

817
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,910
Don, my mom went out.

818
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,040
I have to stay at the store.

819
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,950
But this is the only break I have.

820
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,040
Okay. Hold on.

821
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,740
Oh, how precious!

822
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,350
Are you a doll or human?

823
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,720
- Look at his hands!
- Be careful.

824
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,950
- Oh, my!
- Peekaboo!

825
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,040
So precious, aren't they?

826
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:51,510
Our baby will be even more precious.

827
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:54,750
Your grandson is cute.
Take care.

828
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,550
Go in.

829
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,680
Thank you for coming.

830
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,580
Ms. Heo Yeongdal!

831
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,280
- Yes! 
- Yes.

832
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,410
Heo Yeongdal!

833
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,290
Watch out!
Don't fall down! Watch out!

834
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,050
Hey! You!

835
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:24,120
Mother! Hit me, not her!

836
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,950
What? Mother?

837
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,750
It was my fault! Hit me!

838
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,320
You come here!

839
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,510
How could you do this to me?

840
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:34,350
Of all men, why did it have to be Loser!

841
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,120
Oh, I want to die!

842
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,650
You and I are both dying today!

843
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,720
Nobody's dying! She's pregnant!

844
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,520
Oh, I don't believe this.

845
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,050
Mom, I'm sorry.

846
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,580
Ugh, you!

847
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:49,890
I don't care if you're pregnant!

848
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,580
Over my dead body!

849
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:53,910
You come here!

850
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,540
Mom, I'm sorry.

851
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:58,910
Don't hide behind him!
Come over her!

852
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,140
Mother!

853
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,450
Don't call me that!

854
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,310
How dare you call me mother?

855
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,540
How can this be?

856
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,680
Your life...

857
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:10,410
How could you fall for Loser?

858
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,680
Mother!

859
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,450
Hit me.

860
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,490
I don't care if you beat me to death.

861
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,080
Yeongdal didn't do anything.

862
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,220
It was all my fault.

863
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,120
If you give me your blessings,

864
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,250
I'll give my life to Yeongdal and the baby.

865
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,350
Mother!

866
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:32,010
Oh, my dear husband!

867
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,810
Oh, mother!

868
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,520
Sedal! Sedal!

869
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:40,590
What? What happened?

870
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:42,240
- Water, water.
- Huh?

871
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,250
Okay.

872
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,220
Mom, water, water.

873
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,220
What?

874
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,720
What happened?
What's wrong with mom?

875
00:49:58,730 --> 00:49:59,950
Did she have a fight?

876
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,640
You go and beat Loser up right now.

877
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:06,340
Beat him up or kill him.

878
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,450
Loser? Why?

879
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,020
He did the same thing you did!

880
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:11,720
What same thing?

881
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,950
Oh, my dear husband...

882
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,450
What do I do?

883
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,350
How could you fall for him?

884
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,540
Mom, mom.

885
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,450
Mom, I'm sorry.
We'll live happily.

886
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,410
Happily?
How could you possibly?

887
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,950
You life's ruined!
How did this happen?

888
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,180
Hold on, hold on!

889
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,040
What are you talking about?

890
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:38,650
How could you let your friend run wild?

891
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:42,220
How could you let Loser do this to your sister!

892
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,550
That's what happened?

893
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,920
You guys are together?

894
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,880
Hurry up and tell us.

895
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,080
What is it?

896
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,540
- Mom.
- Huh?

897
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,950
Bong, Anggeum.

898
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,580
I want to get married.

899
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,120
What?

900
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,050
Married?

901
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:12,890
You have a woman?

902
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,690
Yes.

903
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,040
What does she do?

904
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,780
How old is she?

905
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,390
When did you meet?
You never told me.

906
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,020
She's outside.

907
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,150
Outside?

908
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,910
Hey, tell her to come in.

909
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,780
How can she just show up like this?

910
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,890
Oh, boy.

911
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,820
Come in.

912
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,520
Hello.

913
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,640
You're the woman he's seeing?

914
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:47,340
Yes.

915
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,080
How did this happen? Huh?

916
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,640
It just happened.

917
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,780
Sit. Have a seat.

918
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,990
Sit.

919
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,390
You must be surprised.

920
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,050
We're beyond surprised.

921
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,720
How did this happen?

922
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,020
This is good.
It's someone we know.

923
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:14,220
What did the beauty salon woman say?

924
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,520
Right, her mom called him Loser.

925
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,920
Please help me out.

926
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,840
She's really angry with me right now.

927
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:28,040
How dare she be angry with you?

928
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:30,240
It's not like her daughter's anything great.

929
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:37,580
I'm sure she has her reasons to be against it.

930
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,640
Let's think about you getting married.

931
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:41,950
You should date first.

932
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,520
Sir, we have to get married soon.

933
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,650
We can't do that.

934
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:49,310
You're really something.

935
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,720
Gwangbak just got married.

936
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,540
Uncle, I'm sure you're in a hurry,

937
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:56,950
but two marriages in one year isn't proper.

938
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,020
Let's do it next year.

939
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,810
Here.

940
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,220
What's this?

941
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,490
You're...

942
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,580
You're pregnant?

943
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:19,950
What?

944
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,450
How?

945
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,620
Because of alcohol.

946
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,420
We really got drunk that night.

947
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,510
The Korean War is nothing compared to this!

948
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:30,720
What do we do?

949
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:32,790
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

950
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:41,490
Mom. Mom, take this.

951
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:46,080
Take it, take it.

952
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,850
Where's Yeongdal?

953
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,080
I don't know.

954
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,580
She left while I was getting your medicine.

955
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:59,910
I told you not to let her out.

956
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,110
Oh, man.

957
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,580
Where are you?

958
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:08,620
At my in-law's.

959
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:10,040
In-law's my butt!

960
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,120
You want mom to go crazy?

961
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:13,950
Not you too!

962
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,390
Goof-off, we need to talk.

963
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,420
You!

964
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,080
I'm going to kill you!

965
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,810
I don't mind dying,

966
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,780
but if you yell at Yeongdal, I'll kill you.

967
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,040
She's pregnant.
What if something happens?

968
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,780
How dare you! 
Loser, come over right now!

969
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:33,680
Yeongdal.

970
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,080
It's me, not Yeongdal.

971
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:37,410
Uncle, please take care of Yeongdal.

972
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,340
Don't worry about us.

973
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,420
She's pregnant, so try to comfort her.

974
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,540
Bye.

975
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,880
How can you smile at a time like this?

976
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,650
This is great.

977
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:50,220
For whom?

978
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,720
You only care about your uncle!

979
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,450
You don't care about Yeongdal!

980
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,180
I'm sure she's in love with him.

981
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,340
My uncle didn't force himself on her.

982
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,350
They were meant to be together.

983
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,290
How could you say that?

984
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,190
The same thing happened to me and Sedal.

985
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,240
Your son and daughter are so much alike.

986
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,820
Like brother, like sister.

987
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:11,620
Are you trying to make me angry?

988
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,180
Oh, father, welcome.

989
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,340
- Yes.
- Mom.

990
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,580
Hello.

991
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:23,990
You! Come here.

992
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,180
What are you doing?

993
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:28,140
Yeongdal, go to me room. Careful.

994
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,280
Where's your mother?

995
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,820
She's lying in her room.

996
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,640
You little...

997
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:40,610
Come here! Huh?

998
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,850
Sedal, calm down.

999
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,580
How can I calm down?

1000
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:46,990
My mom's in shock right now.

1001
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,750
Be quiet.

1002
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,950
Father, we made our decision.

1003
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,620
We're happy about them.

1004
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:54,950
When did I say that?

1005
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,120
This is nuts.

1006
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,680
Please ask your mother to come out.

1007
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,880
I said she's sick!

1008
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,850
Mrs. Park, come out.
We need to talk.

1009
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:20,420
You lying down won't solve anything.

1010
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,740
I have nothing to say.
I don't want to see you.

1011
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,790
So just leave.

1012
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,090
Don't be like that. Come out.

1013
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:30,240
Think of they baby your daughter's carrying.

1014
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,290
Are you kidding me here?

1015
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,620
If you won't come out, we'll come in.

1016
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,390
Mrs. Park,

1017
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,450
please excuse us.

1018
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:01,310
Don, ask for her forgiveness.

1019
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,990
Mother, I'm sorry.

1020
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,620
There you go calling me "mother" again!

1021
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,040
Who's your mother?

1022
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,010
How dare you call me that?

1023
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:13,450
Please let us get married.
I'll be good.

1024
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,350
Married? No way!

1025
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,150
You'll be good?

1026
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:18,720
I know you won't be!

1027
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,040
Mrs. Park.

1028
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,890
I'm sorry things turned out this way.

1029
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:28,810
It's my fault for not watching over my brother.

1030
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,490
At least you know that.

1031
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,790
How could this happen?

1032
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,320
He ruined my daughter's life.

1033
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,150
It's so embarrassing.

1034
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,740
How can I go on?

1035
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,150
What are you going to do about this?

1036
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:46,910
That's why we came.

1037
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,340
They have to get married.

1038
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,580
What?

1039
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:51,120
You asked what we'll do.

1040
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:54,080
Your family's shameless.

1041
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:55,890
What did you say?

1042
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:01,220
Mrs. Park, I'm very sorry.

1043
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:04,490
But what else can we do?

1044
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,890
I'll get a place for them, so let them get married.

1045
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,850
We have a baby to think about.

1046
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,020
Why are you crying?

1047
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,590
You think we're happy about this?

1048
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:35,540
I don't want to hear about marriage, so go.

1049
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,180
I can't process anything right now.

1050
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:41,380
I need time to think, so please go.

1051
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,150
Meanwhile, your girl's belly will grow big.

1052
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:46,510
What?

1053
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:49,820
It's not that simple, can't you see?

1054
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,080
If you were me,

1055
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:53,680
would you let your daughter marry Loser?

1056
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:55,340
We did!

1057
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,580
You took our daughter from us!

1058
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:01,390
You think we were happy about Sedal?

1059
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,250
Don and Sedal are just about the same.

1060
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,990
At least Don has a job!

1061
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,910
What was Sedal doing back then?

1062
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,780
Now you'll know how we felt back then.

1063
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,190
What? How dare you!

1064
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,220
How dare you say that!

1065
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:20,780
I'm sorry. You stay out of this.

1066
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,610
Loser, come with me.

1067
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,220
Stop it. Stay here.

1068
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,810
I'm going to beat him up and go to jail.

1069
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:30,990
You know Yeongdal's the apple of my mother's eye!

1070
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,990
- How could you...
- I said stop!

1071
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,950
- You! 
- Hey!

1072
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,810
Sedal, have a seat. Let's talk.

1073
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,750
I'll get you for this.

1074
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,920
Mrs. Park,

1075
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,490
I know my little brother isn't good enough,

1076
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,680
but please give him your blessings.

1077
00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:00,810
Why are you begging?
They should do that.

1078
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:01,620
What?

1079
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:04,950
Don didn't do this by himself.

1080
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,720
They did it together.
Yeongdal isn't a child.

1081
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:13,410
She's old enough to know how to behave.

1082
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,990
Are you picking a fight?

1083
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,290
That was what you said to us 9 years ago!

1084
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,790
What did you say to Hobak?

1085
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,920
You said she ruined your young son's life!

1086
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,680
So let's not do this.
I don't want this!

1087
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,410
I hate Loser,

1088
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:32,450
but I don't want you as my in laws again!

1089
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,350
One is enough! 
That's plenty! Ugh!

1090
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,390
Hah! As if!

1091
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,790
Go. This wedding isn't happening.

1092
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,250
But what about the baby?

1093
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:46,650
We'll take care of the baby.

1094
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,310
I don't believe it!

1095
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,220
You think you can do what you want?

1096
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:55,120
I won't let some baby ruin my daughter's life and marry Loser.

1097
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,950
So please go home.

1098
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,310
Ugh.

1099
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:07,750
Oh. Oh, boy. Oh.

1100
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:21,680
Why are you doing this?

1101
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:23,780
No! I said no!

1102
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,650
I married a man who runs his own business!

1103
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,810
Not someone who delivers parcels!

1104
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,620
I regret marrying you,

1105
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,990
and I regret having your kids! Satisfied?

1106
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,310
I want a divorce!

1107
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,640
Minjung!

1108
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,990
Where are you coming from?

1109
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,750
We had to take care of something.

1110
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,250
Did you eat?

1111
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,820
You've lost weight.

1112
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:57,540
You can't be that busy!

1113
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:59,180
Let's go in.

1114
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:00,490
Okay.

1115
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,390
There's something I must tell you.

1116
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:06,080
What is it?

1117
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:14,040
I'm sorry I have to tell you this.

1118
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:21,080
Subak and I

1119
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,410
are getting a divorce.

1121
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:56,510
What did Subak do?

1122
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:57,990
She...

1123
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,390
No! You can't divorce her. No way.

1124
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,750
Don't forget to pay me child support,

1125
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,690
since you agreed to it in court.

1126
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,110
Take good care of the kids.

1127
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:10,890
Mom, say yes.
I promise he's a good guy.

1128
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,650
I rather die than see her marry him.

1129
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:14,720
I don't want anything to do with that family.

1130
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,250
You told your husband you have too much work?

1131
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,650
She didn't! 
I was just saying what I felt.

1132
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:20,880
You stay out!

1133
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,790
You know something, don't you?

1134
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,120
No, I don't.

1135
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:27,190
There's no need to hide it. Tell me.

1136
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:32,250
Stay in touch with me, please!

1137
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:33,250
Minjung!
