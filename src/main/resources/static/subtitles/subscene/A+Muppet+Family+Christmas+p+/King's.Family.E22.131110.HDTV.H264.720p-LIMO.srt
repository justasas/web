2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,070
Father.

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,040
It's ice to meet you. I'm Wang Gwangbak.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,690
My daughter in law.

5
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,860
It's you?

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,740
Why are you here?

7
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,390
What happened?
Why is this rude girl here?

8
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,970
- Get out of my house.
- Father!

9
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,440
I never want to see you again.
Get out!

10
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,390
What's wrong? 
What happened?

11
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,470
What is it?

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,140
Remember that rude girl he was talking about?

13
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,470
It's her.

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,940
I don't understand.

15
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,000
Sangnam brought his girlfriend,

16
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,240
and she was that rude girl.

17
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,390
What? How could this be?

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,030
I know. I can't believe what happened.

19
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,560
This pot has history, so it's our family treasure.

20
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,660
What's going on?
Hobak's gone?

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,040
This is nuts. She won't answer my calls.

22
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,240
After I talked to her!

23
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,830
Why did she leave?
Why did she take the boys?

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,330
I know.

25
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,630
I really hope she doesn't do anything stupid, like in the news.

26
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,570
Like in the news?

27
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,100
People kill their children and themselves.

28
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,270
Oh, I'm too scared to even talk about it.

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,240
She won't die with the boys over a divorce.

30
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,240
She's just awful.

31
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,860
Call her parents. They would know.

32
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,490
She doesn't go there anymore.

33
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,590
Who knows? Maybe she told them.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,360
Go in.

35
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,590
Alone?

36
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,840
Of course!

37
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,140
Then why did you come along?

38
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,740
Because I'm worried.
We'll wait for you here.

39
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,270
Okay. I'll be right out.

40
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,570
Sedal.

41
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,700
Yes, I'm here.

42
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,640
What's up?

43
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,440
You're here?

44
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,770
What's going on?

45
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,740
I was just passing by.

46
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,270
As if you're a traveler.

47
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,070
Welcome. Did you eat?

48
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,940
Not yet...

49
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,770
Get him some rice.

50
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,800
Okay.

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,560
Did you come alone?

52
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,240
There were three, but only I came in...

53
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,490
I mean, I was passing by alone.

54
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,430
Did Hobak pass by here before?

55
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,390
No, she didn't.

56
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,740
What's taking him so long?
What's he doing?

57
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,340
I'm hungry, mom.

58
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,800
Grilled dotted gizzard shads.

59
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,990
People say they bring wandering husbands back.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,060
Okay.

61
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,260
Not husbands. Daughters in law.

62
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:15,640
The grilling smells so delicious that they come back, after running away.

63
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,390
Do they really bring back daughter in laws?

64
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,800
Of course.

65
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,170
Whoever it is, if they left home, that's it.

66
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,430
They won't come back to eat some fish,

67
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,430
unless they're a few bricks short of a load.

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,330
The fish is just an excuse.

69
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,590
Right. If they really hate you, they won't come back.

70
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,540
I can see why they would come back home.

71
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,490
I better get going.

72
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,930
Is that a new watch?

73
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,630
Yes.

74
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,890
You bought it?
You must be doing well.

75
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,240
That looks expensive.

76
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,060
Wow, this is the famous...

77
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,590
It's a knock off.

78
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,400
I know. But it looks just like the real one.

79
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,840
Have you ever seen a real one?

80
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,540
No way.

81
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,470
What took you so long?

82
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,340
They don't seem to know anything.

83
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,670
Mom, let's go grill dotted gizzard shads.

84
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,490
They bring daughter in laws back.

85
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,690
Should we file a missing person report?

86
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,740
She's not missing. She left me.

87
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,360
His law school degree is paying off.

88
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,800
So we file a runaway report?

89
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,930
Father, let's talk.

90
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,300
I have nothing to say to you.

91
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,340
I know how you feel.

92
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,670
I heard so much about that rude girl,

93
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,490
and even I would feel awful.

94
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,890
But I think there's been a misunderstanding.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
What if I didn't?

96
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,860
I'll prove it. Just give her a chance.

97
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,340
You never really got to know her.

98
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,840
- Just meet her...
- There's no need!

99
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,670
I don't have to!

100
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,100
Then at least accept her apology.

101
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,360
Why would I do that?

102
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,540
My meeting her means I accept her apology,

103
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,530
and that means I accept her as my daughter in law,

104
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,240
which I have no intention of doing.

105
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,240
Father.

106
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,400
Don't mind me. Why do you care?

107
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,000
You're an adult. You can do as you please.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,740
You don't mean that.
Why would you say that?

109
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,970
I can't believe you fell for a girl like her.

110
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,070
Father!

111
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,170
What do we do?

112
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,690
Aunt, what am I supposed to do?

113
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,130
I don't think an apology will do any good.

114
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,630
You and I both know how upset he's been about her.

115
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,030
I know, but she's not like that. You met her.

116
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,640
But I only met her once and you can't be sure.

117
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,390
Maybe she hasn't shown that side to you yet.

118
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,400
You only met her recently,

119
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,200
and women are good at hiding things.

120
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,260
Aunt, I know everyone has two sides.

121
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,030
But she's not like that.

122
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,460
If father talks to her, he'll be able to see.

123
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,670
But he's really angry at her.

124
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,840
She won't answer.

125
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,700
Where's Gwangbak?
Why won't she pick up?

126
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,990
She must be busy dating.

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,340
Gwangbak is seeing someone?

128
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,240
He came to say hello to the family.

129
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,490
Who? What does he do? What's he like?

130
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,990
Is he a doctor?

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,160
No, he only finished middle school.

132
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,490
What? Middle school?

133
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,360
What's wrong with her?

134
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,160
How can she meet a middle school graduate?

135
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,060
She's unemployed so she couldn't do better.

136
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,570
I feel sorry for her parents.

137
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,070
Poor Gwangbak.

138
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,440
Try calling her.

139
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,660
The person you called is unavailable...

140
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,960
Is she screening calls? She won't pick up.

141
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,630
Maybe she's embarrassed.

142
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,690
Let's see if she left any suicide note.

143
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,490
Why would you say such a horrible thing?

144
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,740
You want me to be on the news saying,

145
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,570
I did nothing wrong. I asked for a divorce,

146
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,940
and she just took the kids and left.

147
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,340
How could this happen to me?

148
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,340
Hey, don't film me!

149
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,670
How can you laugh?

150
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,430
Right. This is no time to laugh.

151
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:48,100
She wouldn't clean the apartment like this unless she's going to die.

152
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,860
This is nuts.

153
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,160
Yeongdal, take the kitchen. Mom, living room.

154
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,190
I'll take the master bedroom. Search!

155
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,440
Oh...

156
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,830
Oh, man.

157
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,970
She was in the Miss Korea Pageant.

158
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,760
I knew I'd seen her before.

159
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,490
Are you two an item?

160
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,740
No, she works for me.

161
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,530
I'd like an employee like her, too.

162
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,430
You're funny.

163
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,360
You didn't drink.

164
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,390
I don't drink when I'm working.

165
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,130
Oh, really?

166
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,060
But I have you.

167
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,300
So I'm drinking for you?

168
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,490
Just get the party going.

169
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,760
I'll give you any position you want.

170
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,490
That's it?

171
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,490
What is it? What is it you want?

172
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,570
I'm home.

173
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,140
Why can't you come home early?

174
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,530
Excuse me?

175
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,660
I think I'm coming down with something,

176
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,960
but neither his mom or dad would come home.

177
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,630
Am I the nanny?

178
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,560
He won't even go to sleep,

179
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,990
but I have no one to bark for him.

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,200
I'm sorry. I'll put him to sleep.

181
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,940
Since your wife is working, you should

182
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,400
come home early and look after your boy!

183
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,630
I know you don't deliver at night!

184
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,600
That's enough. He's had a long day.

185
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,040
Am I wrong?

186
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,690
They don't care if their mother's sick!

187
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,900
They just dump their kids on me!

188
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,990
Why are you yelling at Minjung?

189
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,260
Where is Subak?

190
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,860
It's her first day. She can't come home early.

191
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,100
I'll take Jungji.

192
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,890
Try to put him to sleep.

193
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,530
He keeps waking up every five minutes.

194
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,690
Subak was such a mild tempered baby,

195
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:54,200
and she'd fall asleep right after feeding.

196
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,270
I don't know why he's so sensitive.

197
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,100
Oh, this is crazy.

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,970
Did you have to say it like that?

199
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,840
Stop it. I'm dying here.

200
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,840
What?

201
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,260
What? What? You're so dull.

202
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,430
You're getting worse as you get older.

203
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,900
Look who's talking. You're the dull one.

204
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,760
Just listen to the stuff you say.

205
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,740
What's wrong with what I say?

206
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,360
Don't speak so harshly.

207
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,070
Minjung's still your son in law.

208
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,990
Even if he lives here, he's still a guest.

209
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,390
He's not a guest!

210
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,990
My friends and their son in laws are friends.

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,660
They make jokes with each other,

212
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,590
and they treat them like their own sons.

213
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,490
I don't think they should.

214
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,790
I think you must watch your manners.

215
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,530
Son in laws aren't really sons and daughter in laws aren't really daughters.

216
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:13,060
You can fight with your children,
 but you can't do it with others children.

217
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,440
You should know that already.

218
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,490
Minjung and I aren't the same!

219
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,970
Why is that. He's someone's precious son.

220
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,240
So watch what you say to him.

221
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,360
Verbal violence leave deeper scars.

222
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:32,160
Try to be more caring towards me, your wife!

223
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,390
Who's going to be by your side at the end?

224
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,600
You'll regret it when you're really old.

225
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,840
Lie down.

226
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,100
Excuse me?

227
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,070
Lie down on your stomach.

228
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,100
Here. I'm lying down.

229
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,630
Oh.

230
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,840
I'll teach them a lesson.

231
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,240
How dare they use my old wife!

232
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,470
You will?

233
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,300
Of course.

234
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,330
You're my precious wife.

235
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,970
I can't believe my ears.

236
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,800
Oh, that feels good. Right there, there.

237
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,570
Come with me.

238
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,800
Bye.

239
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,260
Good job.

240
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,060
The investors really liked you.

241
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,170
You're my Miss Korea.

242
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,190
You're the only one who understands me.

243
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,530
How many years has it been?

244
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,490
Did you miss me?

245
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,890
Of course. Did you?

246
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,360
I never forgot you.

247
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,670
I'll see you tomorrow.

248
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,260
Stay a little longer.

249
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,360
I have golf early in the morning.

250
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:27,100
Fine.

251
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,100
You can come to work in the afternoon tomorrow.

252
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,330
Goodbye.

253
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,870
When did you get here?

254
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,270
What are you doing out here?

255
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,170
I was waiting for you because I got worried.

256
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,490
Are you my wife?

257
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,240
Like a wife who's waiting for her husband carrying a baby on her back.

258
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,370
It's embarrassing.
What if he catches a cold?

259
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,170
You're really clueless.

260
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,760
Did you drink?

261
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,830
There was a business meeting, for work.

262
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,490
You used to say this all the time.

263
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,740
Okay. I didn't say anything.

264
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,940
How did you get here?
The bus was just here.

265
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,990
Why do you want to know that?

266
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,760
It's dangerous to be out late.

267
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,940
I'll come and meet you from now on.

268
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,240
What for? Are you crazy?

269
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,700
They drive me home when it gets late.

270
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,100
Don't do this again. 
It's over protective.

271
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,530
I'm home, father.

272
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,590
Why are you home so late?

273
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,390
There was a business dinner.

274
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,440
Did you drink?

275
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,290
They usually take you out to welcome you.

276
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,290
Don't you know what time it is?

277
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,760
You should've come home before ten.

278
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,740
You're a mom with two kids,

279
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,670
so how could you come home after midnight?

280
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,840
And all drunk!

281
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,670
Your mom is sick.

282
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,400
Why didn't you answer her call?

283
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,840
It was so loud that I didn't hear.

284
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,830
Your mom's old.

285
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,660
Babysitting isn't easy for her.

286
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:37,140
You should come home early for your kids instead of staying out until midnight.

287
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,300
You're not single.

288
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,800
Go upstairs.

289
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,090
Father, I'll come home early starting tomorrow.

290
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,640
Agh!

291
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,940
You scared me! What's wrong?

292
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,760
Oh... I had a nightmare.

293
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:21,170
You did? You're sweating.

294
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,870
This is going to kill the three of us.

295
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,070
Where did she go with the boys?

296
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,130
Let's report it to the police.

297
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,870
Mom, I think she's going to...

298
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,170
Going to do what?

299
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,470
Who's calling so late?

300
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,470
Is it Hobak?

301
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,030
I don't know this number.

302
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,090
Answer it.

303
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,060
Hello?

304
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,770
Hello? Please speak!

305
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,360
Hobak?

306
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,100
Hey, can you deliver noodles?

307
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,740
What the...

308
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,670
Sure, why not?

309
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,670
Ugh! This is nuts.

310
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,100
So?

311
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,390
He asked if I can deliver noodles.

312
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,900
Crazy bastard.

313
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,870
Hobak is so mean.

314
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,700
We're all worried sick.

315
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,760
She should at least call us!

316
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,090
Man...

317
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,590
- Ugh!
- Oh, my!

318
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,330
Mind your own business!

319
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,740
Why do you care if I'm barking like a dog?

320
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,030
Why do you care if I got dumped?

321
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,940
Why do you care if I get married?

322
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,940
- Let's not see each other again.
- Right.

323
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,990
Why do you keep doing this to me?

324
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,140
This is the worst coincidence.

325
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,990
We can't be together, can we?

326
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,530
I never want to see you again. Get out!

327
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,990
Come out.

328
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,870
Daese,

329
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,370
Sangnam's in love. Please say yes.

330
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,970
What you've seen may not be everything.

331
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,990
I know what I'm talking about.

332
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,530
What she did to me showed me who she is.

333
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,990
But you should meet her once and...

334
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,470
No. Once a rude girl, forever a rude girl.

335
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,060
You may not want to hear this.

336
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,560
I already went through it with your sister.

337
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,840
I knew who she was, but I thought she'd change.

338
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,930
But people don't change.

339
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,840
She was vain, unfaithful,

340
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,890
and she committed frauds and lied.

341
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,530
She never changed.

342
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,470
But that girl isn't my sister.

343
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,400
I trust Sangnam.

344
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:56,070
He wouldn't bring just anyone home.

345
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:01,760
You can decide after meeting her.

346
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,440
Don't do this.
Don't take Sangnam's side.

347
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,070
He's in love so he can't think straight,

348
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,200
but soon he'll realize the truth.

349
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:19,170
She's going to make Sangnam miserable.

350
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,400
Run over to the beach.

351
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:31,170
Let's see who wins! Ready, go!

352
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,370
I caught a crab!

353
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,770
You did?

354
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,240
Let me see.

355
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,970
Wow, it's a big one. Whoa!

356
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,290
Be careful.

357
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,860
Ganghwa-do Island? Why?

358
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,600
Just because. I brought the boys.

359
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,930
I didn't tell Sedal, though.

360
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,570
I heard he came last night but said nothing.

361
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,160
He probably went there to check.

362
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,700
I didn't answer his calls.

363
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,140
Should I come?

364
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,640
It's okay. I just want to be with the boys.

365
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,700
I'm using my vacation days.

366
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,900
Good for you.
Relax and have fun.

367
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,170
Don't tell anyone at home.

368
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,440
I don't want to worry father.

369
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,370
It's nice to see the boys have fun.

370
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,270
Why didn't I do this before?

371
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,470
I was so stupid.

372
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,530
I only focused on making money and didn't think to make memories with them.

373
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,860
Why in the world did I live like that?

374
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,170
What's more unbelievable is that

375
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,490
even though I lived like that,

376
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,240
I have nothing left anymore.

377
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,990
I was such a fool.

378
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,360
Hobak, don't blame yourself.

379
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,870
You've done really well.

380
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,740
From now on, do what you want to do.

381
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,560
Okay. Call me if you need anything.

382
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,990
Man...

383
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,560
Hey, Wang Hobak!

384
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,260
Where are you?

385
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,630
You think I'll let you get away with this?

386
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,840
How dare you take the boys?

387
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,830
Heh, Hello? Hello? I can't believe...

388
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,890
Your call will be forwarded to voice mail.

389
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,570
Oh, this is nuts!

390
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,000
Where are you?

391
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:13,540
Be quiet. You haven't learned anything!

392
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,830
If you scream again, I'm hanging up.

393
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,490
Oh, okay. I won't scream.

394
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,440
I'm furious,

395
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,260
but I'm trying to calm down. So answer me.

396
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,200
Where are you right now?

397
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,560
Are the boys safe? Tell me.

398
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,930
I don't have to.

399
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,370
Why did you call so many times?

400
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,400
Where are you?

401
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,900
I'm hanging up.

402
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,040
Okay, okay. I won't scream.

403
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:49,130
Don't call or ask questions. Just wait.

404
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,640
Wait until I feel like coming home.

405
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,640
What about the boys? Are they safe?

406
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:57,300
Yes. Your kids are safe, so don't worry.

407
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,170
Heh, heh, hello? Hello!

408
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,370
Hey, Wang Hobak! Ugh!

409
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,270
Hey! What are you doing?

410
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,760
Hey! Stop right there! Thief!

411
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,060
What did you call me? Thief?

412
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,240
Why did you kick my door?

413
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,140
Look at this! You burned my hair!

414
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,400
You brought bad luck!

415
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,870
You shouldn't be a hair dresser!

416
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,300
What? I shouldn't be?

417
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,360
I had a beauty salon in Myeongdong!

418
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,470
Why are you taking out your anger on me?

419
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,830
Your bad luck has nothing to do with your hair!

420
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,130
You want me to beat you up or something?

421
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,040
Are you trying to make me even angrier?

422
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,360
Look! Look how you burned my hair!

423
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,540
I want compensation!

424
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,290
Are you trying to get money off of me/

425
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,290
What? What did you say?

426
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,290
Am I trying to get money off of you?

427
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,100
Oh, my...

428
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,830
Hey, wake up. Wake up!

429
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,860
What happened?

430
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,470
You're alive, right?

431
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,790
Oh, my...

432
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,940
Mom, I'm going to work.

433
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,100
This late?

434
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,630
People might become suspicious.

435
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:01,360
Isn't that too short?
You're a mom.

436
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,770
Everyone says I have great legs.

437
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:09,670
Yours are just long. Her legs were pretty.

438
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,670
My legs?

439
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,170
They're not pretty anymore.

440
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,260
I used to get compliments on my legs.

441
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:21,970
Men followed me home because of my legs.

442
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,670
My legs were pretty, right, mother?

443
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,070
I was kidding.

444
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,140
Hey, Subak, what happened?

445
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,970
With what?

446
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,060
You said you'll find a woman for your uncle.

447
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,490
Oh, I'm asking around right now.

448
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,700
Don't get someone who's really poor.

449
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,870
You want a rich woman?

450
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,740
Right. And she can't be too ugly.

451
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,670
Rich and pretty women would love uncle.

452
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,340
Right?

453
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,740
I was kidding, too.

454
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:58,170
Okay. I'll try. 
Aeji, I'll see you later.

455
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,970
Yes, mom. Bye bye!

456
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,790
You should try to find him a bride.

457
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,830
It's like you want him to die a bachelor.

458
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,060
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

459
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,760
I'm sorry the class ran late.

460
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,490
Hurry up and deliver this.

461
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,090
Okay.

462
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,670
It's open.

463
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,390
Put it here.

464
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,740
Open the box.

465
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,490
You can't do it?

466
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,640
If I knew it was you, I wouldn't have come.

467
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:10,140
Why I'm a paying customer.

468
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,870
Where are the pickles?

469
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,690
You didn't bring any?

470
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,200
Pizza and pickles are like siblings.

471
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,970
How could you forget the pickles?

472
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,600
You're so stupid.

473
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,530
What?

474
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,760
Go get them. I can't eat pizza without them.

475
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,170
Or I want my money back.

476
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,030
Man.

477
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,490
Oh, man!

478
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,670
Here are the pizza's siblings.

479
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:27,190
I never heard pickles are pizza's siblings.

480
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,970
Man!

481
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,760
Gwangbak's uncle.

482
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,170
What is it?

483
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,090
Read it.

484
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,330
Man...

485
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,060
You little!

486
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,790
As you can see, I can't go out.

487
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,970
So help me out.

488
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,790
Man...

489
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:27,160
Can I help you?
Your wife sent you?

490
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,740
She's lucky to have such a caring husband.

491
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,470
Don't ever ask me to do this for you.

492
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,600
And why did you call me Gwangbak's uncle?

493
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:49,040
I'm your brother's friend. Don't call me that.

494
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,200
Thanks, Gwangbak's uncle.

495
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,030
So? Should I go alone?

496
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,270
Just wait.

497
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,940
For how long?

498
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,490
Stop whining. I'm trying to think here.

499
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,470
Fine. I'm going alone.

500
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,740
Would you like to go ahead without me?

501
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,240
I'll come after I sort things out here.

502
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,270
Okay. That watch.

503
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,370
- Yes?
- Give it back.

504
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,290
What did I just say?

505
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,470
To go ahead without you.

506
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,090
My darn mouth!

507
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,940
When I'm nervous, I just blurt things out.

508
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,090
I'm coming with, of course.

509
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:47,700
Give me one hour, Okay? Darling?

510
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,740
Whatever!

511
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:56,740
Oh, man. This is nuts.

512
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,740
Man!

513
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,390
I found a clam!

514
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,590
Where? How nice! Wow!

515
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,060
I didn't get anything.

516
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,260
What are you doing?

517
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,900
Ugh! You! You come back here!

518
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:26,470
My stomach hurts. You don't care if I die?

519
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,890
My head hurts. It's about to blow up.

520
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,290
When you come back, I'd be dead.

521
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,260
I think I'm going to die of anger.

522
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,390
What? What do you want? What is it?

523
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,630
I really am sick.

524
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,940
Whatever! I told you not to call me!

525
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,240
Hold on!

526
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,970
Tell me where you are and I'll feel better.

527
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,700
Hearing your voice made me feel better.

528
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,870
Tell me where you are and I'll get well.

529
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,060
Why do you want to know that?

530
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,370
I should know where you are!

531
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,170
I must know where my wife and sons are.

532
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,860
Since when were you so interested in me?

533
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,670
Mom, the water's coming in!

534
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,630
Come here! It's dangerous over there!

535
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,670
Bye!

536
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,760
Parcel service. Please sign here.

537
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,370
Where are you?

538
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,560
I need to see you. It won't take long.

539
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,660
Minjung.

540
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,360
What happened?

541
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,370
That's what I want to ask.

542
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,600
Why did someone else deliver to my house?

543
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,000
When I ran into your husband the other day,

544
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:57,900
it felt like someone smacked me in the head.

545
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:03,060
I kept forgetting it,

546
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,790
but when I saw him,

547
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,970
I realized you belong to someone else.

548
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:17,940
I don't think we should keep running into each other like this.

549
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,260
We each have our own families.

550
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,400
Are we doing something here?

551
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,090
But I don't feel comfortable.

552
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:34,370
I feel badly for your husband, a bit guilty.

553
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:45,930
I felt like I was caught stealing something that day and my heart was pounding.

554
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:51,470
I'm not a bold man.

555
00:39:54,010 --> 00:40:00,900
I think I still have feelings for you.

556
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,260
That's why I feel this way.

557
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:15,940
I'm not going to deliver to your house until I feel nothing when I see you.

558
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,540
Don't worry about the deliveries.

559
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,840
Someone else can take care of it.

560
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,600
You're happily married,

561
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:34,000
so I don't want to cause troubles.

562
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:38,970
And your husband won't like it.

563
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:45,160
Minjung, actually...

564
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,630
Actually, I'm...

565
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,990
Hold that thought.

566
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,760
Parcel service.

567
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:57,500
I'm coming. I'll be there in 10 minutes.

568
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,560
Sunjeong, I have to go.

569
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,760
Oh, what were you going to say?

570
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:11,240
Huh? It's nothing. Go. You're busy.

571
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,870
I hope you're not hurt by what I said.

572
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,930
I'm doing this for you.

573
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,870
Be happy.

574
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,890
Minjung,

575
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:44,270
I missed you a lot after we broke up.

576
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:49,160
If you were dead, I could've forgotten you.

577
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:55,060
I would've looked for you, but I felt guilty.

578
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,370
I'm being honest.

579
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:07,630
I'm not asking for anything else.

580
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:13,870
I just want to keep seeing you.

581
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,440
Please.

582
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,990
Let me see you every now and then.

583
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,990
Seeing each other,

584
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,100
we're not allowed that.

585
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,890
We each have our own families.

586
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,740
I don't want to put my family at risk.

587
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,140
Giddy up! Ha! Ha!

588
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,440
I'm home.

589
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,060
Yes, Miho. Come here.

590
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:46,370
Mom, what's wrong?

591
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,770
I feel badly for you, Miho.

592
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,470
Mom, why would you feel that way?

593
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,430
I have you, uncle, Sangnam,

594
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,760
and even Daebak. Don't you agree?

595
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:07,770
Yes, you're right. I shouldn't feel that.

596
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,970
I can't breathe. Let me go.

597
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,240
Just one more minute, Miho.

598
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:19,470
I just want to hug you.

599
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,170
Dad, give me some more.

600
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:23,060
Okay, here. Eat up.

601
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,560
Mom, this is so good. This is the best!

602
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,890
Yes, yes! It's good!

603
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,990
Eat slowly. You'll get sick.

604
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:34,000
Mom, you eat, too. Ah!

605
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,600
Mmm, yum!

606
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,790
It's more delicious because you gave it to me.

607
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,930
Bangtong, why don't you give me a bite?

608
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,200
Have one more.

609
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,630
Isn't it good?

610
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:52,440
Bangtong, you shouldn't stare at people.

611
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,290
We have a dad, too.

612
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,830
If you like dad so much, go live with him!

613
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,760
I'm living with mom.

614
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,500
Mom, tell dad to come.

615
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:10,200
You, dad, Sintong and I are a family.

616
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:15,270
It's sad if anyone's missing.

617
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,200
Keep eating.

618
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,490
This is where we stand financially.

619
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:46,170
Who wants to do it?

620
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,760
You want to do rock, paper, scissors?

621
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:58,640
Go! Rock, paper, scissors!

622
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,260
Rock, paper, scissors!

623
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,500
Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors!

624
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:13,970
Oh! Father! Father!

625
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,660
You two do it.

626
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:23,160
Stop it! You can't decide it this way!

627
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,290
Subak's our firstborn, so she can't.

628
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,140
And my baby son can't either!

629
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:32,740
You can't send two of your daughters to college and tell your only brother to quit.

630
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,330
Bong, do the right thing!

631
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,540
Loser, let's hang out!

632
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,490
Stop crying.
 Who cares about a college degree?

633
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,040
You already have a future husband.

634
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,170
What do you mean by that?

635
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:16,200
You know what I mean.

636
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,630
Was that a proposal?

637
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,870
Sort of.

638
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:30,470
You're uncle's friend and you're younger.

639
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,790
Who cares about those things?

640
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,240
And it's only one year. I'm in law school.

641
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:43,160
The Constitution doesn't have anything about dating your younger uncle's friend.

642
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,390
Answer me. Will you marry me?

643
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:53,140
Tell me. Will you or not?

644
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:58,640
If you catch me, I'll tell you.

645
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:03,400
Man. We're shooting a movie now?

646
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,890
Hey! Hobak! Wang Hobak!

647
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:18,660
Oh, it's dangerous!

648
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,560
Hey, you'll get hurt!

649
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,830
Oh, what's this!

650
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,200
Sintong! Bangtong!

651
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,560
Dad!

652
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:48,290
Hello. It's me, Choi Sangnam.

653
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,930
Yes, hi.

654
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:54,130
I'm glad I ran into you here.

655
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,870
Have you had lunch yet?

656
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,600
I have.

657
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,140
If it's okay, may I buy you coffee?

658
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:04,200
No, thank you. I'm busy.

659
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,700
I'll visit you this weekend.

660
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:10,140
I'd like to see grandmother and mother.

661
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,200
Gwangbak hasn't told you anything?

662
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,790
Excuse me? Tell me what?

663
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,160
You should go.

664
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:22,060
Goodbye. I'll visit you.

665
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,240
Start the engine!

666
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,930
Okay.

667
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:34,770
It won't start?

668
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,900
Man.

669
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:44,470
Jangbi, where's Sangnam?

670
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,390
I don't know.

671
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,600
I didn't tell him anything.

672
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:58,900
I thought you told him about my father.

673
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,930
He seemed a bit unhappy.

674
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,470
He asked me if I heard anything.

675
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,240
Is there something you haven't told me?

676
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,770
No, of course not.

677
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,240
He probably felt awkward, running into you.

678
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,600
Okay.

679
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,330
You're sad, aren't you?

680
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:23,760
We should stick together.

681
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,740
Leave everything to me.

682
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:30,140
You made it snow, so of course I will.

683
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,040
Did you hire those men?

684
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:36,900
Yes. Let's meet there when it snows.

685
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,970
Under that street light.

686
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,600
Really? Promise me.

687
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,760
But what if your father doesn't say yes?

688
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,300
It doesn't matter. I'm moving out.

689
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,830
You can't.

690
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:57,530
My life with you is more important to me.

691
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,670
It's my life, not my fathers.

692
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:04,200
I'm not going to wait until next year.

693
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:11,470
Who is it?

694
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,430
I don't know. Maybe it's the magazine.

695
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:19,970
I'm Sangnam's father. Are you with Sangnam?

696
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,060
Excuse me?

697
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:24,560
Send Sangnam back to work right away.

698
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:28,160
Please don't ever meet my son again.

699
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,790
I'm sorry.

700
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,700
Please let me apologize to you in person.

701
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,430
I'm so sorry.

702
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:42,540
You and I will never meet again.

703
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:45,500
I don't have to tell you why, do I?

704
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:48,400
Don't ever see my son again.

705
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,560
father, I'll talk to you later.

706
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:55,290
I'm hanging up.

707
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,890
Father!

708
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:31,470
You're skipping work?
Have you lost it?

709
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,160
I finished everything. I'm disappointed in you.

710
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,200
How could you say such mean things to her?

711
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:42,770
What? You're disappointed in me?

712
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:48,540
That useless rude girl has turned you against me!

713
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,840
How dare you call her a useless rude girl!

714
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,760
She's the woman I'm dating.

715
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,270
I'm asking you not to pass judgment.

716
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,040
What? You're already siding with her?

717
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,900
You're making me side with her.

718
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,890
I didn't know you were like this!

719
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,030
If you really trusted me,

720
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,270
you would at least meet her once!

721
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,000
How could you make her leave crying?

722
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:16,970
You called her and told her not to see me.

723
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,140
You always speak of character and culture.

724
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:22,170
Is that what you meant by that?

725
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:25,090
What did you say? Huh?

726
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,200
How dare you talk back at me like this?

727
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:31,270
I'm very disappointed.

728
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,530
Hey! Choi Sangnam! 
Stop! Stop right there!

729
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,200
I have nothing more to say!

730
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:39,000
Just who do you think you are!

731
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:42,100
Why I ought to... You!

732
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,870
Let go!

733
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,060
You let go first.

734
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:52,600
How dare you... 
I said let go.

735
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:55,740
I didn't do anything wrong.

736
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,100
How dare you!

737
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:00,560
You've really lost your mind over that girl.

738
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:03,640
Stop it! What are you doing?

739
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:07,500
Let go. Let go!

740
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,740
Sangnam, you let go first.

741
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,770
How dare you! Come here!

742
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,170
Sangnam, rung! I'll hold him here!

743
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,700
You!

744
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,270
- Daese!
- You!

745
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,770
- Daese!
- You come back here!

746
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,340
- Stop!
- Daese!

747
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,870
- You!
- Daese, calm down!

748
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,770
Hey! Choi Sangnam!

749
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:33,870
Calm down!

750
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:40,970
Wang Gwangbak! Come out!

751
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:52,060
Be honest. You didn't tell him?

752
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:54,290
Father.

753
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,360
How could you be so childish?

754
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,970
Is this who you are?

755
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,740
You've been lying to both sides?

756
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,200
I was flustered when I ran into him.

757
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:10,540
How could you be so stupid?

758
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:13,540
Instead of doing what your father said,

759
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:17,200
you go behind my back and do what you want?

760
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:21,830
Was this why you didn't send the gifts back?

761
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:29,100
I can't break up with him, father.

762
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:31,540
Please let me marry him.

763
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:35,140
I told you why you two can't work.

764
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:39,170
You should've given it some thought.

765
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:43,790
You're well educated, so why can't you see?

766
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,530
Oh! Hello, uncle.

767
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:56,570
You shouldn't drop by like this.

768
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:57,560
Excuse me?

769
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:02,640
My brother said no to you, but if you keep coming here, it reflects badly on you.

770
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,600
My brother's headstrong.

771
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:08,140
Wait here. I'll get Gwangbak.

772
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:10,440
But this is the last time.

773
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,900
Gwangbak, come out. Your friend's here.

774
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,860
Who?

775
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,940
Yeongdal.

776
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,990
Tell her to come in.

777
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:35,540
She can't. Gwangbak.

778
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:40,470
Tell her I'm not home. I can't see her.

779
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:44,740
She wants to ask you something. Come out.

780
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:48,160
Just listen to me.

781
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,740
Go.

782
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,870
Follow me.

783
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:29,290
How could you lie about that?

784
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,140
I'm sorry.

785
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:35,440
We should be on each other's side.

786
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,830
How could you lie?

787
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,870
How long were you planning on lying to me?

788
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:44,470
I was worried

789
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:48,860
that you were hurt because of my father,

790
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,600
and I was bringing you flowers.

791
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,060
I was going to ask you to give me some time

792
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,740
because I can change my father's mind.

793
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,890
I was going to tell you not to worry.

794
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,490
I was trying to change my father's mind.

795
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:12,740
I couldn't tell you because it'd hurt you.

796
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,740
We should break up.

797
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:24,740
Sangnam.

798
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:29,160
I can beat my father, but you can't.

799
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:33,090
And there's nothing you can do here.

800
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,600
We're not meant to be together.

801
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:38,470
Ending this here will be better for...

802
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,870
No! This isn't right!

803
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,970
I'm not good enough for you.

804
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:53,470
I must have been dreaming.

805
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:57,160
You and I are too different.

806
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:02,990
Our family and educational background,

807
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:06,000
and our jobs.

808
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:10,370
I only finished middle school,

809
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:14,100
and I grew up in a broken family.

810
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,870
Don't say that.

811
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,860
You said I have emotional scars.

812
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,240
You grew up in a normal family,

813
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,040
so you'd never understand.

814
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:35,570
My inferiority complex will torture you.

815
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:40,140
Your parents are right.

816
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:46,430
How can a middle school graduate marry a former teacher and a future writer? 

817
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,530
That's nonsense.

818
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:52,340
Let's pretend this never happened.

819
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:58,200
Don't! Those things don't matter.

820
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:01,200
I can persuade my family.

821
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:09,160
No.

822
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:13,090
Persuasion won't work here.

823
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:17,000
It's how things are.

824
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:21,540
No, this can't be!

825
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,570
This is too hard for me. I'm going.

826
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:35,740
How could you...
I won't break up with you.

827
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,140
Don't leave me, please!

828
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:40,830
Don't leave me, please!
What am I supposed to do?

829
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:43,440
We're in love and that's all that matters.

830
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,160
We're both adults.

831
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:51,330
We don't need our parents permissions.

832
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:58,390
Please don't do this to me. Please!

833

834
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:54,330
I'm disappointed in you! You are two faced!

835
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,200
Please let me breathe.

836
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,200
What do you mean by that?

837
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,540
See me free for one month.

838
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:03,900
What happened to Hobak is mostly your fault.

839
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:04,790
What?

840
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,830
You're not a good mother.

841
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,290
I even feel ashamed. My heart is breaking.
