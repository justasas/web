00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,000
Final Episode 16

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,740
It's so hard to get away with my fate...

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,840
of being a gangster's wife.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,370
I was finally looking forward
to ending it after 18 years...

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,740
so that I can live a normal life.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,700
I guess I am not lucky enough for that.

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't stop if I go now.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,800
I'll just have to keep going.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,400
You think I don't know that?

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Go.

13
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,470
Go and either save a country...

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,600
or some people.

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,200
- Honey.
- Go!

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,940
Go before I change my mind.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Wait.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
What...

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
What happened?

20
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,470
Where is Chul?

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,670
His father got hurt so he
took him to the hospital.

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,100
Did he get hurt badly?

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,300
Those gangsters pushed him and he fell.

24
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,500
It didn't seem too serious.

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,740
We're just worried that they might
not be able to open the store.

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,970
The place is totally ruined.

27
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,000
By any chance,

28
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,770
was it the same guys that came before?

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,840
No.

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,840
They were new faces.

31
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,470
They must've hired professionals.

32
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,300
That way it won't leave any evidence...

33
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,000
and they'll be able to end things.

34
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,470
Will they come back?

35
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,870
Just think of this...

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,000
as a taster.

37
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,000
Next time, it's going to be the dry
cleaner's and the other stores.

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,600
They are going to slowly
take over the place.

39
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,500
So?

40
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,570
You want us to back off
before it gets worse?

41
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,740
We are tired of those lame advises.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,200
So please leave.

43
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,500
No.

44
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,770
I came to tell you that
I will fight with you.

45
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,840
Well, it may not be an easy fight.

46
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,200
We can put ourselves into a
more dangerous situation.

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Then...

48
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,500
how do you plan to help us?

49
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,500
I've been with Choongshim
for over 20 years.

50
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,000
I know them inside and out.

51
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,400
And I can clearly see what
they're thinking right now.

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,310
Isn't that a big weapon in itself?

53
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,310
Even if we will have a bloody fight later,

54
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,100
we need to first declare
a war against them...

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,470
in a gentlemanly manner.

56
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,740
Okay. Make sure you end things properly.

57
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,810
Hey.

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,670
Why do you keep coming here?

59
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,940
Is this your house or what?

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,870
How is it different from my house?

61
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,100
I worked here for 20 years...

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,840
and it's your room. We've
been friends for 25 years.

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,940
Don't I have the right to come in here?

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why are you here?

65
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,400
Drop the lawsuit against Manbok Shophouse.

66
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,840
- What?
- Drop the case and...

67
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,200
promise them that you will
redevelop it in a fair way.

68
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,670
Also, compensate them for making
the gangsters trash the snack bar.

69
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,140
Have you gone mad?

70
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,000
What's gotten into you? Did you get bribed?

73
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,600
That's your dirty trick.

74
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,200
Watch your mouth, my friend.

75
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,600
What if I say no?

76
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,670
Then you will end up in jail.

77
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,900
Why would you bother doing this for them?

78
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,200
Who do you think you are
to help someone else?

79
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,200
Those people are suffering because of...

80
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,670
Choongshim, but you and I are
equally responsibly for it.

81
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,400
We've done so many bad things
in the past 20 years and...

82
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,200
I am trying to make up for it.

83
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,000
I want to make an apology by doing this.

84
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,370
Only then will I get to live the
rest of my life without guilt.

85
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,370
Gosh, aren't you the hero?

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let them die like that.

87
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,300
You should get your life sorted out first!

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,600
You listen to me.

89
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Being born rich doesn't give you
the right to step over the weak.

90
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,940
Ms Oh, why don't we go to a
hot springs this weekend?

91
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,300
You want to go on a trip?

92
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,940
But you just got out of the hospital.

93
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,300
It's for you.

94
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,840
You like going to hot springs
around this time of the year.

95
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,400
Don't worry about me.

96
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,000
You need to get better first.

97
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,500
Okay.

98
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,940
Let's go on a cruise trip in spring.

99
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,200
We can get on the cruise
and go all around...

100
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,500
the world.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,300
Do you want to do that?

102
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,700
What do you mean?

103
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,470
You don't know what a mess our company is.

104
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,870
You don't even know what I
had to hear from Tae Soo.

105
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,500
And yet you are just so happy.

106
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,610
Ki Beom, don't do this.

107
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,970
Just think of it as a tough lesson
for you to become the president.

108
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,110
Do you think it's easy
to get to that position?

109
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,500
Right. Yes.

110
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,300
Have a good time, you two.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
What's wrong with you?

112
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,400
You agreed to be nice to them.

113
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,400
He's with the woman who cheated on him.
How can I not get mad?

114
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,200
Then what if he finds out
about Ms Oh and Mr Bong...

115
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,900
and passes out again?

116
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,400
The doctor warned us, remember?

117
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,370
How do we know if he knows or not?

118
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,200
Honestly, I feel like...

119
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,500
Dad is just putting on a show.

120
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,300
So you think he's pretending
that he doesn't know anything...

121
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,100
when he actually knows everything?

122
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Otherwise,

123
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,200
does it make sense for
him to forget just that?

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
Anyway,

125
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,470
please keep an eye on Dad.

126
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,600
There has to be something more.

127
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,500
We're eating kimchi fried rice again?

128
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,100
Just eat it. It's simple
and nice for breakfast.

129
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,470
My friends tell me that I
smell like fried kimchi.

130
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,400
They also tease me about my
name being on the truck!

131
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,600
Mum,

132
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,300
you added chicken breast today.

133
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
How is it?

134
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,740
It's more filling and more nutritious.

135
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,570
I'm thinking of adding it to the menu.

136
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,100
You should make anchovy
kimchi fried rice, too.

137
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,500
These days, female office workers...

138
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,840
lack iron because they
always go on poor diets.

139
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,370
I was already thinking about that.

140
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,740
Gosh,

141
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,940
my puppy and I will be fed...

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,900
only kimchi fried rice,

143
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,570
and we will die shouting
"kimchi fried rice".

144
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,100
Gosh, Mum.

145
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,500
By the way,

146
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,770
we're going to need everyone's help...

147
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,500
with the food truck for a while.

148
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,000
Especially you, Eun Shil.

149
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,870
Why? Are you getting another job?

150
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,370
No, that's not it.

151
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
I need to help someone.

152
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,900
I think I am going to be
busy with that for a while.

153
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,100
What?

154
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,670
How can you push aside making a living...

155
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,800
and help someone else?

156
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,970
Tae Soo,

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,100
don't tell me you stuck your nose
in someone else's business...

158
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,970
and caused trouble again.

159
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,300
What's wrong with him helping other people?

160
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,600
You can't live this life
alone anyway, you know?

161
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,870
What are you doing? Hurry up and eat.

162
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Father,

163
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,900
you know that you have a doctor's
appointment tomorrow, right?

164
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
It's at 3pm.

165
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,000
Don't worry about it. I will go with Ms Oh.

166
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,100
Father,

167
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,200
are you having trouble
with anything else...

168
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,400
after your brain surgery?

169
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,200
Perhaps your memory has gone fuzzy.

170
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,070
Or you remember some new things?

171
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,600
Why? Are you worried that
I might have dementia?

172
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,600
Of course not. Why would
I be worried about that?

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,100
It's just that your doctor asked me...

174
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,000
to take a good care of you.

175
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,200
Just focus on taking care of Ki Beom.

176
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,800
- Pardon?
- He treats Ms Oh very badly.

177
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,800
You saw him yesterday.
He was so rude to her.

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Yes.

179
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,700
I will tell him to be more carful.

180
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,600
You have to learn how to
control your husband.

181
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,700
Just think of it as practising
to become the president's wife.

182
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,370
Okay, Father.

183
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,400
- We're in trouble.
- What?

184
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,800
- We're in trouble.
- What is it?

185
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,800
Attorney Park called and
said he's resigning.

186
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,970
- What's wrong with him?
- What?

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,900
What's the reason? Why is he
taking his hands off the case?

188
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,500
Choongshim people must've done this.

189
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,710
This is what they always do.

190
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,500
It's all your fault.

191
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,710
What do you mean?

192
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,300
It doesn't feel right.

193
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,500
Our lawyer just quit!

194
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,100
Ever since you got involved,
they've become more fierce.

195
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,400
- He's actually right.
- He's right.

196
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,800
I heard you betrayed Choongshim.

197
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,400
That's why we are going
through this hassle.

198
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,210
I can't trust you any more!

199
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,970
Did he pay you to say that?

200
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,800
- What?
- It sounds like...

201
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,710
one of Choongshim's favourite move.

202
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,000
What are you talking about?

203
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,900
Did they promise you to give you
a nice spot to open a store?

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,600
Or did they promise you to
triple your compensation?

205
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,500
- What is he talking about?
- What is this?

206
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,300
Wait. You ran into me the
day before yesterday...

207
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,710
when you were coming out of Choongshim.

208
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,300
- What?
- He went there?

209
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,710
He went there.

210
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,900
Well why did you have to
make this fight so big?

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Do you think you have the
slightest chance of winning?

212
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,800
You're just wasting time.

213
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,900
Gosh.

214
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,000
- What's wrong with him?
- Let him be.

215
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,000
This is not the end.

216
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,370
They will visit you all of you...

217
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,000
and try to persuade you one by one.

218
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,210
If you want to win, you
really have to toughen up.

219
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,500
We'll lose if we fall apart.

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,800
What kind of person did you send for
Tae Soo to find out so quickly?

221
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,710
Tae Soo seemed like he had a hunch.

222
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,710
It's what we've always been doing
so it's not hard to guess anyway.

223
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,940
Tae Soo is always the problem.

224
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,500
Why did he have to get involved
in this and create this mess?

225
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,100
It's annoying...

226
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,100
to see Tae Soo act as if...

227
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,300
as if he represents justice.

228
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,040
Keep a close eye on him and
report to me if anything happens.

229
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,400
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

230
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,900
(SOO MIN'S KIMCHI FRIED RICE)

231
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,970
- Here you go. Enjoy.
- Come again.

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,970
- Good-bye.
- Come again.

233
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,400
It's cold. You should go home.

234
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,770
It's not like we have a lot of customers.
I got this.

235
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,100
I'm just worried that you might get bored.

236
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't you like spending
quality time with your son?

237
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,400
Well, you should go home after an hour.
Aunt Eun Shil is coming.

238
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,700
Okay.

239
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,400
By the way, what's going on with Dad?

240
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,100
- What?
- You said he's helping someone.

241
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm not a kid any more. Tell me.

242
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,100
It has something to do with
Choongshim, doesn't it?

243
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,900
Yes.

244
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,200
They are trying to redevelop
a nearby building...

245
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,400
and he decided to help the tenants there.

246
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,870
It seems like Choongshim is
giving them a hard time.

247
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,900
Wouldn't it be dangerous for him?

248
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,600
Does he have to do it?

249
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,100
Sung Min, your dad gave
a lot of thought to it.

250
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,370
He thinks he's going to regret
it if he doesn't help them out.

251
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,900
I don't like the idea myself,

252
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,500
but I decided to trust him.

253
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,700
So let's give him our support.

254
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,700
Did you talk to Choongshim by any chance?

255
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,100
Well, there's nothing we can do.
You're scared of the gangsters.

256
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Gosh.

257
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm worried. How can we
fight without a lawyer?

258
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,000
I think we contacted almost
every lawyer in this town.

259
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,200
How come everyone says the same thing?

260
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,870
Why are they so terrified of Choongshim?

261
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
They are just worried
that they will be harmed.

262
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,300
Gosh, cheer up.

263
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,500
If we can't find one here, we can
go to Seoul or Busan to find one.

264
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,040
I am sure we can find at least one
lawyer who's willing to help us.

265
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Gosh.

266
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Dad.

267
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,300
- Hello.
- Sung Min.

268
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,500
How did you come here?

269
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,970
Mum said you must've missed your meal.

270
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,700
I'm such a lucky man, aren't I?

271
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll take it.

272
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,900
He's my son.

273
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,000
He's a good student and
he sings really well.

274
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,800
And he's sweet too.

275
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,700
Dad, I will go now. Mum's alone.

276
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,400
Okay.

277
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,970
Thank you and sorry.

278
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,100
Go now.

279
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
Good-bye.

280
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,900
Go now.

281
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,500
(STOP THE REDEVELOPMENT!)

282
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,300
I will wait for you in front
of the terminal at 12pm.

283
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,100
No, don't wait for me.

284
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,900
I won't go there.

285
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,200
I will wait until you come.
I'll be there every day.

286
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,500
Gosh, how can she do this?

287
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
How can she not turn up...

288
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,070
and make me a homeless man?

289
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,600
Mr Bong!

290
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,600
Mr Bong, I'm here!

291
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,400
Mr Bong! I'm here!

292
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,770
I'm here!

293
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Oh gosh!

294
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,200
You're still here?

295
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
Mr Lee!

296
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,700
You stink!

297
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,100
Now, you're not just
frustrating and pathetic.

298
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,870
I now pity you and you also make me mad.

299
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,500
What's the use of waiting for
someone who won't turn up?

300
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,800
Why don't you just go to
her and bring her out?

301
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,700
I heard both the father and son are...

302
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,870
searching me desperately.
They're going to kill me.

303
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,100
So let's leave Daejeon now.

304
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,300
The only way you and I can
survive is to leave this city.

305
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,300
Are you going to quit making films?

306
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,300
We went through so much.

307
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,870
We have to toughen up
and give it another go.

308
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
You are Mr Bong Jin Wook, right?

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,200
Run!

310
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,400
Run!

311
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,400
- Run!
- Oh, no.

312
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh my gosh!

313
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
Ouch. My goodness.

314
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,000
You missed him?

315
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,600
Is it that hard to catch him?

316
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,070
Keep an eye on him.

317
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,700
Make sure he doesn't set
a foot in this area.

318
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,400
Completely shut him off from Ms Oh.

319
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,240
- Father.
- You heard it?

320
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,740
I... I wasn't trying to eavesdrop.

321
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,900
Please don't say anything to Ms Oh.

322
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,900
I'm doing this because I
can't live without her.

323
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,970
But still, how can you put on such an act?

324
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,100
This is wrong for everyone.

325
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,500
It's not just about Ki Beom,

326
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,500
but if Ms Oh finds out about this later,

327
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,000
she will be embarrassed and shocked.

328
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,770
But what else can I do?

329
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,100
If I don't do this,

330
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,300
I know am going to regret it later.

331
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,400
After I Inherit the company to Ki Beom,

332
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,700
my wish is to grow old...

333
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,940
happily with Ms Oh...

334
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
until I die.

335
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,570
I didn't know things
would turn out this way.

336
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,670
What happened between her and Mr Bong...

337
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,770
is something I'll never think about.

338
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Eun Ok!

339
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,000
We came to visit you.

340
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,200
Why did you come?

341
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,740
I told you that you didn't have to come.

342
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,570
What good are friends for?
Of course we should come.

343
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,600
We didn't know what to get you
as a congratulatory gift,

344
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,200
so we got you a small heater.

345
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,000
Thank you.

346
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,970
I'm sorry about everything.

347
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,100
After you left One Mind,

348
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,410
I didn't get the chance to give you a call.

349
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,100
And especially after what
happened with Young Il.

350
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Why are you talking about that here?

351
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,570
I told you we should talk
about it over drinks.

352
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,670
Right.

353
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,500
I'm sorry about my husband.

354
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,570
I heard he was quite mean to Tae Soo.

355
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,300
I don't know the details, but
I can assume what happened.

356
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
No.

357
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,000
There's no need to feel bad.

358
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,600
That's the life of a
gangster's wife anyway.

359
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And I'm here working so that I can...

360
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,840
escape from all of that.

361
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,940
If you feel so bad about it,

362
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,300
help us promote the business.

363
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,170
You should buy some and share it
with your friends. It's cheap, too.

364
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,770
Should we? We should.

365
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,500
Then give me 10.

366
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,300
Me too. I'll take 10, too.

367
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,940
Okay, 20 kimchi fried
rice, coming right up.

368
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,100
I'll make it really delicious.

369
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,300
- Okay - Okay.

370
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,410
Give me a lot.

371
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,840
Give me some ham, too.

372
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,770
Okay, more toppings.

373
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,670
You used to hate the cold.

374
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,200
It's not like you to want to go for a walk.

375
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,410
Although, I'm happy to.

376
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,770
Do you remember?

377
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,200
We first met...

378
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,870
at a park.

379
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,200
Of course I remember.

380
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,500
It wasn't as cold, though.

381
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,500
It was on a warm spring day.

382
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,000
You were sitting on a bench reading a book.

383
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,200
And I went up to talk to you.

384
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,300
- Excuse me, are you an actress?
- Excuse me, are you an actress?

385
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,410
Life was so meaningless...

386
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,970
and boring.

387
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,500
I'd take a walk without
knowing where to go...

388
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,100
and I would eat only to live.

389
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,670
But then, that's when I saw you...

390
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,410
and I wondered how an actress
showed up in our neighbourhood.

391
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,940
Like what the kids say nowadays,

392
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,200
I fell for you the moment
I laid my eyes on you.

393
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,840
Ever since then,

394
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,200
you've been more than caring to me.

395
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,500
I'm sure...

396
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,740
no one else could have done it like you.

397
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,000
It's because you're special.

398
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,410
The last three years...

399
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,740
were full of happiness.

400
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,700
I'm so thankful.

401
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,000
Although, I feel...

402
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,200
more sorry than thankful.

403
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,940
Ms Oh.

404
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,000
What are you trying to say?

405
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,200
Remember when you asked me...

406
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,000
what I wanted?

407
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,940
You said you wanted to
do everything for me.

408
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,200
President.

409
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,410
Will you..

410
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,500
Just let me go?

411
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,410
Ms Oh.

412
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,540
I don't deserve your love.

413
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,200
If I stay here,

414
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,300
your relationship with
your son will be ruined.

415
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,410
And that'll make me feel worse.

416
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,000
This is not what I want.

417
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,700
You understand...

418
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,200
what I mean, right?

419
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Well?

420
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,410
I really...

421
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,870
want to be...

422
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,940
remembered as a good person...

423
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,100
to you.

424
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,840
All right.

425
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,000
I know.

426
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,100
Yes, this is Tae Soo.

427
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,570
Who?

428
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,400
Attorney Kim Min Ho?

429
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,970
How did you...

430
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
What?

431
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Sung Min!

432
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Sung Min!

433
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,000
Have you eaten?

434
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,040
Honey, that's not the problem.

435
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,500
Where's Sung Min?

436
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,840
In his room, why?

437
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,700
We'll talk later.

438
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Hey.

439
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,900
What have you done?

440
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,400
- What?
- What did you say to...

441
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,100
persuade a great lawyer like Mr Kim?

442
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,000
What? He called?

443
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,400
- He really said he'd help?
- What are you talking about?

444
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,840
Sung Min talked to someone
really famous from Seoul to...

445
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,840
help with the Manbok Shophouse.

446
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,400
On top of that, he also said that
he couldn't turn down our son...

447
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,400
and that he won't even take money for it.

448
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,700
How did you do it?

449
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,840
Well,

450
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,770
should I say it's the
power of social media?

451
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,070
Just listening to his voice
made me feel at ease.

452
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,740
I feel like we've already won.

453
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,400
What a great news.

454
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,840
I should work even harder...

455
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,200
for you, Sung Min.

456
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,840
Is that really him?

457
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,770
Yes, right here.

458
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,500
He even won an award as
a human rights lawyer.

459
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,600
I can't believe it.

460
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,200
What do you think? Isn't my son great?

461
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,800
- He looks like a good person.
- Look. Scroll down.

462
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,740
A friend of the evicted...

463
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,500
- He helped out.
- I see.

464
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,200
He gave up his prosecutor
position to stand on the side...

465
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,400
of the weak. Attorney Kim Min Ho.

466
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,300
Excuse me.

467
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
What?

468
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,400
You're attorney Kim, right?

469
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,070
Yes. Are you Mr Yoon Tae Soo?

470
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,000
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

471
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,800
Thank you so much.

472
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,200
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

473
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,400
You must be tired from
travelling all this way.

474
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,700
Not at all.

475
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,400
It's only an hour on the bullet train.

476
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,600
Well, Sir...

477
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,840
- you're a very handsome man.
- Thank you.

478
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,940
Yes.

479
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,800
Since we don't have much time,
let's listen to your story first.

480
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,000
It's a hard fight, but
not an impossible one.

481
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,970
You must know this already, but
collecting evidence is the key.

482
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,170
It's good to have as much evidence
as possible that proves...

483
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,840
Choongshim was disquieting
you or trying to harm you.

484
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,600
Evidence?

485
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,770
Look at this.

486
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,000
We took some photos.

487
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,300
And this is where my dad got hit.

488
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,770
This and...

489
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,940
(POOR APPRAISAL, POOR COMPENSATION)

490
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
This.

491
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,900
Don't you have anything else so
that they can't get out of this?

492
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,600
Hi, I'm Choongshim's Yoon Tae Soo.

493
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,600
It was your boys who were
hired yesterday to disturb...

494
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,000
the tenants at Manbok Shophouse, right?

495
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,770
What do you mean, why?

496
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,300
We just want to hire them one more time.

497
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Was it your boys?

498
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,300
Okay, I got it.

499
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,970
You want me to come in for a questioning?

500
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Why should I?

501
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,840
What did I do to Manbok shophouse?

502
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
What?

503
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,870
Tae Soo, you little...

504
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,570
Tae Soo! Are you crazy?

505
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,200
How dare you sue me?

506
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,740
That's why...

507
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,800
I told you to compensate the
owner of the snack bar.

508
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,300
You really want to play this game, do you?

509
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,570
Should I send the boys again?

510
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,400
Why are you screaming?

511
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,300
I thought you said you didn't do it.

512
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,870
You jerk.

513
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,400
Do you want to die?

514
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,600
Come on, who would want to die?

515
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,200
By the way, Ki Beom.

516
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,070
Do you know that all of
this is being recorded?

517
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,300
My gosh.

518
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,200
My goodness.

519
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,200
What's wrong with you?

520
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
You couldn't take care of this on your own?

521
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,840
I'm sorry, Sir!

522
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,300
It's my wish to never hear
those words from you.

523
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,600
Get out, I don't want to see you.

524
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,740
Sir...

525
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,300
I told you to get out!

526
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,940
You should let it all go.

527
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,600
I'm sure that's what Ms
Oh would want as well.

528
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,600
She left only with what she came in with.

529
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,300
All the bags, shoes and jewellery
that I bought for her...

530
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,200
were all left behind.

531
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,740
That woman...

532
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,300
She received a lot of your love.

533
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,070
It must mean that your
love was enough for her.

534
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,100
You're home late.

535
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,670
Where's your beloved Ms Oh?

536
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,200
Why are you all alone?

537
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,470
Your wish has come true. She left.
Are you happy now?

538
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,940
- Pardon me?
- She left early in the morning.

539
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,600
I don't even want to see you.

540
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,800
Let's try our best to avoid
each other for a little while.

541
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,300
I'll be happier if you don't come home.

542
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,370
Is it my fault that Ms Oh left?

543
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,400
She left because she feels guilty.
Why are you blaming it all on me?

544
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,400
Goodness. How rude...

545
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,470
Dad. Do you have any idea about
what happened to me today?

546
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,100
Tae Soo reported me to the
police so they interrogated me.

547
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,100
While you were talking about your love,

548
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,500
I had to go through all
kinds of crazy things.

549
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,870
- You were at the police station?
- Forget it.

550
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,370
Just continue to think about Ms Oh
and suffer through your heartache.

551
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,500
Did you say you were interrogated
by the police? What do you mean?

552
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,100
Tae Soo filed a complaint against me...

553
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,840
on behalf of the tenants.

554
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,470
Really?

555
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
Does he think he's the warrior of justice?

556
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,000
Why is he always getting in the
way of what Choongshim does?

557
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,740
He makes me so mad.

558
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Are you doing your job properly?

559
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,300
Tae Soo won't do such a
thing for no good reason.

560
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,070
Whose side are you on?

561
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,600
I just got home from being
interrogated by the police.

562
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm not taking his side.

563
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,300
I'm just worried about you and the company.

564
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,500
There was no problem like this
when President was in charge.

565
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,400
Why are these things happening as
soon as you take over the company?

566
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,570
Preventing trouble from the
start is important, too.

567
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,200
It only turned into trouble because
that jerk, Tae Soo, got involved.

568
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,000
My brain is about to explode
because I'm trying beyond my best!

569
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,500
Out of everyone, you should
try to understand me.

570
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,100
Anyway, I won't forgive Tae
Soo for what he's done.

571
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,670
- I will...
- What will you do then?

572
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,000
Are you going to threaten him
with his house like your father?

573
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,000
If not, are you going to risk
putting someone's life on the line?

574
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Dad!

575
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,100
I told you this before.

576
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,740
If you can't make me proud, at
least don't make me embarrassed.

577
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,000
Do you remember me telling you this?

578
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,470
- Hyun Ji.
- Why are you doing this, Hyun Ji?

579
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I want to know what kind
of person you really are.

580
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,600
No, I'm scared of you.

581
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,370
You and Sung Min's dad are friends.
How can you treat him like this?

582
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,100
Have you forgotten about how he saved me?

583
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,800
Hyun Ji, that's...

584
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,200
Mum. Let's move back to our old place.

585
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,000
As soon as possible.

586
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,270
I asked you...

587
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,740
to be a good dad at least to Hyun Ji.

588
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,500
Is it that difficult?

589
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,300
I'm not sure if reuniting with you...

590
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,200
was the right thing to do.

591
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,100
Do Kyung.

592
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,840
Why are you doing this to me?

593
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,940
Why does everyone do this to me?
Am I the only one to blame?

594
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,600
Why does everyone hate me so much?

595
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,300
The number you have dialled
cannot be reached at the moment.

596
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,000
Please try again later.

597
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,740
- Hello?
- Yes. Is this Sung Min?

598
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,100
I'm Hyun Ji's mum.

599
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,940
Yes. Hello.

600
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,770
Sung Min. By any chance, are
you with Hyun Ji right now?

601
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,100
No, I'm not.

602
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,900
Why are you asking?

603
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Well, Hyun Ji hasn't come home yet.

604
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,300
She's not answering my calls either.

605
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,740
Can you call me right away...

606
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,500
if you hear from Hyun Ji?

607
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,840
Sure, I will.

608
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,600
- Thank you.
- No problem.

609
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,700
(MISSED CALLS)

610
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,100
Baek Hyun Ji. Are you trying
to make me worry about you?

611
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,840
Hyun Ji, where are you? Did
something happen to you?

612
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,000
I'll come and get you right now.

613
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,200
(YOON SUNG MIN)

614
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,770
What happened? Do you not know that
your parents are looking for you?

615
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,870
I know.

616
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,370
Don't look at me like that. I'm
already stressed out as it is.

617
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,100
What?

618
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,840
I'll apologise to you on my dad's behalf.

619
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,600
I can't list everything and I'm
sure there's more than what I know.

620
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,100
But I know that my dad has caused
pain for your dad and your family.

621
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,300
I'm sorry.

622
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,000
I totally understand why you've been upset.

623
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,900
And when you told me that you
wanted to break up with me,

624
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,100
I couldn't accept it because I was
angry and I couldn't believe it.

625
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,270
But I've pulled myself together now.

626
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,940
Let's break up.

627
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,500
- Baek Hyun Ji.
- I won't bother you any more.

628
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,470
Good-bye.

629
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,700
I didn't mean to break your heart.

630
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,100
I know.

631
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,070
And I know that you're probably
more stressed than I am, right now.

632
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Sung Min. Promise me one thing, though.

633
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,400
Don't throw out the ring.

634
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,200
This matching scarf, too.

635
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,310
I'll do the same.

636
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,000
You can promise me this, right?

637
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,840
- Hyun Ji!
- Baek Hyun Ji!

638
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,370
You've never done anything like this!

639
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,240
Do you know how worried I was?

640
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,340
Mum. When are we moving?

641
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,310
Hyun Ji.

642
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Ki Beom, you wanted to see me?

643
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,470
Yes, Beob Kyu!

644
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,500
Yes, Ki Beom.

645
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,810
- Beob Kyu, what am I to you?
- Pardon?

646
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,840
You're my boss and the
president of this company.

647
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,200
To me, you're like the Almighty...

648
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,310
- So what can you do for me?
- Pardon me?

649
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,310
Can you die for me?

650
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,200
Can you do everything I tell you to do?

651
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,400
I'm asking you if you can
kill a person for me.

652
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,840
Can you do it or not? Why
aren't you answering!

653
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,500
Yes. I can do it.

654
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Good.

655
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,000
If that's the case, you should...

656
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,940
Stop it!

657
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,000
Boss!

658
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,940
What brings you here, Dad?

659
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,400
Are you bored because Ms Oh isn't around?

660
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,070
You're so dumb. You're such an idiot.

661
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,500
That's right! I'm dumb. I'm an idiot.

662
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,400
Get your hands off everything.
I'm going to take over.

663
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,470
I will finish this.

664
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,870
So you stay quiet.

665
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,400
How come nobody is here?

666
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,370
It's weird.

667
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,000
Nobody is answering their phones.

668
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,900
What?

669
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,200
Welcome.

670
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,310
Have a seat.

671
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,310
Take a seat.

672
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:28,370
Have a seat. Gosh. Go on and take a seat.

673
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,100
My apologies for introducing
myself so late.

674
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,000
I am Baek Man Bo, the president
of Choongshim Construction.

675
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,970
Sir,

676
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,700
- please take a seat.
- You sit first. Gosh.

677
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Actually,

678
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,670
Manbok Shophouse is like my first love.

679
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,000
I used to go there for nearly 30 years.

680
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,200
It's gone now, but...

681
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:58,670
there used to be a small
dumpling place there.

682
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,370
I used to be a regular customer there.

683
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,310
Gosh, I got so nostalgic and
bored you with my story.

684
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,600
I let my son take charge...

685
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,970
and I heard he had disrespected everyone.

686
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Why...

687
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,970
did you want to see us?

688
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,740
I hate beating around the bush.

689
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,000
So I will be frank.

690
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,310
Does anyone of you think...

691
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,200
you can compete with Choongshim and win?

692
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,000
As you know, it's like beating
your head against a brick wall.

693
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,000
I recalculated the compensation...

694
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,370
and it seems like you should be
getting twice the initial price.

695
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,140
I will only apply that price...

696
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,370
to the people who are here today.

697
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,470
So please promise me one thing.

698
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,200
Gosh.

699
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:08,100
Where have you all been?
Is something wrong?

700
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,070
We need to talk.

701
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,940
We've discussed it ourselves...

702
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,670
and we think it's best that you
stay out of this, Mr Yoon.

703
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,700
- What?
- Hey.

704
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,310
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

705
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,700
No matter how hard we think,
we have no chance to win this.

706
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,200
We need someone who will put out the fire,

707
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,000
not someone who will start one.

708
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,970
Don't you agree, guys?

709
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,370
- We agree with him.
- We agree with him.

710
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:38,970
Sir,

711
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,900
why are you acting like
this all of a sudden?

712
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,810
The same goes for you, Sir.

713
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,670
We want you to stay out of
this along with Mr Yoon.

714
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,310
Why are you doing this? You
act like a different person.

715
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,740
Stay out of it, Chul.

716
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,310
This is for the good of everyone.

717
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,770
If this goes wrong, you won't be
able to support your sick father.

718
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,100
After all, it's good for everyone.

719
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,000
Why should we refuse it when
they're doing us a favour?

720
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,040
I guess you met someone in a
high position at Choongshim?

721
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,900
I know what you've been told
and how you've been treated...

722
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,500
even without having to hear it from you.

723
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,900
When I first came to help
you, I told you that...

724
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,770
I worked at Choongshim for 20 years
and that I know it inside and out.

725
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,970
You all are...

726
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,000
getting fooled right now.

727
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,840
We already made a decision.

728
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,700
So please leave us alone.

729
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
Please.

730
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,500
- Yes. Please leave.
- Please leave.

731
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,970
- We already made the decision.
- Leave now.

732
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,670
What's wrong with all of you?

733
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,570
When they build a mall here, all the
shops on the small streets will die.

734
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,570
That's why we decided to protect it
on our own. Isn't that why we began?

735
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,700
We promised to fight until the end.
Why are you doing this now?

736
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,070
We didn't begin this fight for money.

737
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,370
I am very disappointed.

738
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,600
Hey, Baek Ki Beom!

739
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,600
Ki Beom.

740
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,770
- Boss!
- Look who it is!

741
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,600
My son, Tae Soo!

742
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,370
You saved me last time.

743
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,470
And I didn't get to thank you properly.

744
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,200
I am still alive like this...

745
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,340
because you took me to
the hospital right away.

746
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,100
Don't change the subject.

747
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,570
Do you really have to do this?

748
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,840
Do you really have to...

749
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,940
kick the tenants out of Manbok Shophouse?

750
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,500
Watch your mouth.

751
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,970
We are simply following the procedure.

752
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Boss!

753
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,470
Did you think you could help them?

754
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,970
What did you learn from
me in the last 20 years?

755
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,370
I am just very frustrated, you know?

756
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,200
Nobody is strong in front
of money and power.

757
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,770
We're signing the papers tomorrow.
So you should stop and leave.

758
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,970
If you can't manage to go alone,

759
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,810
I will call people to take you home.

760
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,500
I am sorry.

761
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,970
I apologise on behalf of them.

762
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,470
Why would you apologise? I
should be the one to apologise.

763
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,000
If I hadn't done that five years
ago, this wouldn't have happened.

764
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,000
When I look at you, Chul,

765
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:57,670
I feel sorry and thankful at the same time.

766
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,100
I'm thankful that you
grew up as a strong man.

767
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,470
Now Manbok Shophouse is doomed, right?

768
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,870
The tenants already
turned their backs on us.

769
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,670
What do you think is going to
be Choongshim's next move?

770
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,200
It's to sign a memorandum.

771
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,500
It seemed like the leader
of the tenants group...

772
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,470
is most likely to sign it.

773
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,970
What would be the memorandum about?

774
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,870
Is it going to be a legal disclaimer...

775
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,200
which states that you
give up all your rights?

776
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,810
- Yes.
- My goodness.

777
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,100
This is like the modern version of
the Korea-Japan Treaty of 1905.

778
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,740
After a public hearing tomorrow,

779
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,100
it's going to be really the end.

780
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,900
I invited some journalists...

781
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,700
to the public hearing tomorrow.

782
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,700
I am going to make it official.

783
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,500
The leader of the tenants...

784
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,100
will wag his tail and bring the memorandum.

785
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,370
That then will be it.

786
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,370
Tell them to do whatever they want.

787
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,900
They will just make
themselves look like a fool.

788
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,470
Are you just too good or
am I just plain stupid?

789
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,600
Why would you say that?

790
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,640
When we build a mall,

791
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,800
it will run by it itself.

792
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,870
You will get paid for breathing!

793
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,600
I heard Tae Soo visited you.

794
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,400
Yes. He was busy going
around and wasting his time.

795
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,970
He's so naive.

796
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,370
He can never be successful.

797
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,600
He will always live his life
looking down at the ground.

798
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,400
Ki Beom.

799
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
President Baek.

800
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,800
You'll only have to look
at the sky from now on.

801
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,200
Dad.

802
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:43,970
They already discharged you?

803
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,770
I just got discharged a while ago.

804
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,770
What are you doing here?

805
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,000
I am...

806
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,770
How dare you come here?

807
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,870
Get out you scum!

808
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,400
What's wrong, Dad?

809
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,900
He's been helping us.
He's not a gangster now.

810
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,800
Get back to your senses, Chul! You
can never trust a guy like him!

811
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,100
What's this, Dad?

812
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,440
(LETTER OF CONFIRMATION)

813
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,100
You already signed it?

814
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,200
A while ago, Doo Seok came
and stamped my seal on it.

815
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,000
He said all the tenants...

816
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,370
from Manbok Shophouse decided to do it.

817
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,470
We got attacked twice in one day.

818
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,300
Chul, can I meet the leader?

819
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,570
Hey.

820
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:51,970
What are you doing here?

821
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,470
I heard you made my dad sign a memorandum.

822
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,200
You told me to fight instead of my dad.

823
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,300
And you use me to get
him to sign the paper.

824
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,300
You weren't like this before.

825
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Chul.

826
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,200
It's not what we originally wanted,

827
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:08,600
but this is the best
decision we can make now.

828
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,970
This is the best decision?

829
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,600
Surrendering for a couple more
dollars what you call best?

830
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,840
You really don't know who's
getting all the benefits?

831
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,840
I don't want to talk to you guys.

832
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,800
I will go now.

833
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,800
Gosh.

834
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,500
It feels so good.

835
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:36,500
What?

836
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,370
You're still up?

837
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,840
I'm about to go to bed now.

838
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,600
Is the thing with Manbok
Shophouse going well, Dad?

839
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,700
You even got us a lawyer.

840
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,300
I should do better.

841
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,740
Is it really tough?

842
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,000
Not particularly.

843
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,770
But nothing is easy, right?

844
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,870
Cheer up, Dad. Okay?

845
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,500
- I'm going to bed now.
- Okay.

846
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:11,840
Have a good sleep.

847
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:26,300
(PUBLIC HEARING ON THE REDEVELOPMENT
PLAN FOR MANBOK SHOPHOUSE)

848
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,640
The president, Mr Baek Man Bo, is here.

849
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:32,500
- Yes. Hello.
- They're taking photos already?

850
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,300
Don't frown. These photos
will be posted on the news.

851
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,100
Yes! Mr Noh. Long time no see.

852
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,600
Mr Baek, please say a few words.

853
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,800
- Have you found a solution?
- Please tell us.

854
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,200
(BAEK KI BEOM)

855
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,700
Oh? He's the leader of the tenant union.

856
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,500
Have you been able to come to an agreement?

857
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,100
- What is the current situation?
- Please say a few words.

858
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,540
The public hearing on the
redevelopment plan for...

859
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,700
Manbok Shophouse will begin now.

860
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,700
First, Mr Baek Ki Beom
will say a few words.

861
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,970
We, at Choongshim Construction,

862
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,200
will do our very best to contribute...

863
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:05,900
to the economic growth of our region...

864
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,100
through redeveloping Manbok Shophouse.

865
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,700
President, please say a few words, too.

866
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,300
I know how busy all of
you are as reporters.

867
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,500
Thank you for making the
time to join us here today.

868
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,400
When it comes to redeveloping
a commercial property...

869
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,500
like this shophouse, the
most important thing is...

870
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,300
the opinion of the tenants who are
currently occupying the property.

871
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,400
We will respect their opinion...

872
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,800
and find a solution that
benefits both parties.

873
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,000
Now, the leader of the tenants'
union will share his thoughts.

874
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,000
We, the tenants of Manbok Shophouse,

875
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,400
are very grateful for all of...

876
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,400
Choongshim Construction's hard
work and consideration...

877
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,200
that went into actualising
this redevelopment plan.

878
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,940
He's lying!

879
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,500
We're grateful? For their
hard work and consideration?

880
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,240
Have you forgotten the oppressive
and unfair treatments...

881
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,500
Choongshim Construction has put us through?

882
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,870
Hey. Come with us.

883
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,600
Leave him alone.

884
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,570
- Stay out of this, Yoon Tae Soo.
- Get out of here!

885
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,300
Calm down. Let's have the leader
of the union finish his talk.

886
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,200
Let's go.

887
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,300
Among the total of 60 tenants,

888
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,000
over 90 percent wants...

889
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,740
the redevelopment plan to be...

890
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,200
- executed as soon as...
- Hey!

891
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:23,000
I really can't do this.

892
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:28,900
To be frank, I've done...

893
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,100
something that I shouldn't have.

894
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,200
The president of Choongshim
approached me with a proposal.

895
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,500
Thinking that I probably won't
win against them in this battle,

896
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,800
I sold my conscience.

897
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,300
I lied to the tenants and made
them to sign a memorandum.

898
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,100
I gave Choongshim the list of
tenants who weren't cooperating...

899
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,600
and ended up putting them
through severe harassments.

900
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,500
I am very sorry.

901
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,100
- What did the memorandum say?
- Why did you sign the memorandum?

902
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,000
Did it include any unfair provisions?

903
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,000
I can tell you more about it.

904
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,600
I'm the lawyer, Kim Min Ho.

905
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,100
Choongshim Construction...

906
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,100
made Manbok Shophouse tenants
sign this memorandum.

907
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,700
By signing this memorandum, the
tenants agree to not exercise...

908
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,800
any of their rights and will not be
able to sue the company, either.

909
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,100
It was made to make them
give up their rights.

910
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,900
It's like the modern version of
the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1905.

911
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,100
- Did you hear that?
- What's going on?

912
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,340
Goodness.

913
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,200
I don't know about any of this.

914
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,600
It looks like it needs to be investigated.

915
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,200
If the police wants to
investigate this matter,

916
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,500
I'll be more than happy to cooperate.

917
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,500
Last but not least, I think that...

918
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,070
the issue of the Manbok
Shophouse redevelopment plan...

919
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,700
and compensating the tenants
must go back to square one.

920
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,700
The plan must be executed in a
fair and transparent manner...

921
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:47,800
by a different company, not by Choongshim.

922
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,700
That is what we want.

923
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,700
Are you really not going
to regret this decision?

924
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,500
They'll ask you to speak at
the public hearing tomorrow.

925
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,700
Then you'll show them this memorandum...

926
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,700
and say that all tenants who signed it...

927
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,600
have agreed and that you want the plan...

928
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,200
to be executed as soon as possible, right?

929
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,500
And when a shopping complex
gets built right here,

930
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,970
they'll give you a store space...

931
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,200
at a high-traffic area to thank
you for your contribution.

932
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,300
I've seen union leaders like you
during my 20 years at Choongshim.

933
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,400
And a lot of them end up
avoiding to meet people.

934
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,500
They've betrayed everyone whom
they were once close with.

935
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,100
They can't even hold their
heads up and make eye contact.

936
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,600
Many are still living in fear.

937
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,800
Wrong decisions make you
pay a bigger price later.

938
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,200
Just like me.

939
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:54,870
Did Mr Baek Ki Beom send
gangsters to harass the tenants?

940
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,600
Is it really true that there's a
politician affiliated with this?

941
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,500
Mr Baek Man Bo. Please say a few words.

942
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,400
Has the entire process for
this project been transparent?

943
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,000
You know that you can't write your
stories based on something...

944
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,500
that hasn't been proven as a fact, right?

945
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,400
I'm just saying that...

946
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,200
you should write informative
stories based on facts.

947
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,300
As a resident of this district...

948
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,400
and as someone who loves Manbok Shophouse,

949
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,900
I will make sure to correct any mistakes...

950
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,200
and resolve all issues related
to this redevelopment project.

951
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,600
If it is necessary,

952
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,200
we are even willing to take
our hands off the project.

953
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,800
We'll make sure that all
is taken care of...

954
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,800
so I hope you don't write stories
that are unfavourable to us.

955
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,100
Mum! Mum!

956
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,200
- Have you heard the news?
- What news?

957
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,200
(CHOONGSHIM CONSTRUCTION WILL
RECONSIDER ITS PLAN TO REDEVELOP.)

958
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,500
I don't even want to see them in photos.

959
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,900
What is it about?

960
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,740
Their redevelopment plan is
going back to square one.

961
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,200
- Really?
- This means that Dad won! My dad!

962
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,700
Goodness. Sung Min, I'm so happy.

963
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,870
This is such good news.

964
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,500
Isn't it such great news? I'm so happy.

965
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,870
It's not over yet.

966
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,800
Going through ups and downs
is unavoidable in business.

967
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,000
Don't forget that the end
result is all that matters.

968
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,070
Start fresh again.

969
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,800
You have to stay focused
at times like this.

970
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,100
Remember what your father told you.

971
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,540
By the way, you're not photogenic at all.

972
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,200
Don't tease me. I'm not
in the mood for a joke.

973
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,300
Hyun Ji, is there anything
you want to say to your dad?

974
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:23,000
Dad. Next time, I hope the
article will be a better one.

975
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,800
And I hope you look better
in the photo next time.

976
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,000
Honey!

977
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,500
Sung Min! Soo Min! Dad is back.

978
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,670
- Dad!
- You did such a great job.

979
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,870
Yes.

980
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,900
My daughter is all grown up.

981
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,200
Good job, Dad.

982
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,400
I know.

983
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,940
It was a huge job.

984
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:07,000
It's not like you got into Harvard.

985
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,000
Do you know how much each one of us...

986
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,700
had to fill in while you were away?

987
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,100
Of course I know.

988
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,940
I'll do everything from now on.
What should I start with?

989
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,240
Dad.

990
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,740
You should give Mum a hug to start with.

991
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:22,770
Good idea.

992
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,700
Forget it!

993
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:28,100
It's broad daylight. It's
not romantic at all.

994
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,070
Is that so?

995
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,500
We'll leave that for the evening then.

996
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:38,100
It makes me so happy to be with my family.

997
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,500
Me too.

998
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:41,500
- Are you happy?
- Yes!

999
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,640
(FIVE YEARS LATER)

1000
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,800
You want to open the seventh
Soo Min Food Truck?

1001
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,900
Yes, just trust us.

1002
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,640
This work isn't easy.

1003
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,500
You might not be able to do it.

1004
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,300
Come on Tae Soo, don't worry.

1005
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,070
With my beauty and the
little one on the way,

1006
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,600
I'm going to work really hard.

1007
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,770
I tried to stop you, but I
guess you take after me.

1008
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,500
What is it?

1009
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,800
Right now?

1010
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,100
- Honey, let's go.
- What is it?

1011
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,200
We'll talk on our way. Eun Shil,
can you look after the truck?

1012
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,400
Let's go, honey.

1013
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,740
Eun Shil, look after the truck, will you?

1014
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,300
- Okay.
- What's going on?

1015
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,400
Mum, Dad.

1016
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,400
- Hello.
- Hi.

1017
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:44,200
- Please, take a seat.
- Okay.

1018
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,700
What is it that you want
to talk to us about?

1019
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,140
Why are you calling us out?

1020
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:52,100
We need to hear an answer from you today.

1021
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:55,400
We booked our flights.

1022
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,840
- Hyun Ji!
- You two...

1023
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:00,200
We're not asking for your help.

1024
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,100
We'll support ourselves for our education.

1025
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,940
Why won't you let us?

1026
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:06,100
- Because you're going together.
- Because you're going together.

1027
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,800
Isn't it better than for her to go alone?

1028
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,470
I'll make sure to protect her.

1029
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,840
It's you I don't trust.

1030
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,100
Ki Beom.

1031
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,200
What did our son do?

1032
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:20,400
Come on, let's sit down and talk.

1033
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,500
If this is about you going abroad again,

1034
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,200
this is a waste of time.

1035
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,400
All of us are against it.

1036
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:32,700
Hyun Ji.

1037
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:35,000
I already begged you, why do...

1038
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,200
Eun Ok.

1039
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:39,300
You should get your facts straight.

1040
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,100
If Hyun Ji changes her mind,
will it solve everything?

1041
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,740
- What about Sung Min?
- You must not know,

1042
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,740
but Hyun Ji is the one who
lured Sung Min into this.

1043
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,040
No, that's not true.

1044
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,700
I asked her first.

1045
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,300
That's not what you said before.

1046
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:57,240
See, Eun Ok? He says he asked her first.

1047
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,840
I'm sorry to tell you this,

1048
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:03,600
but we'll be leaving in
two weeks as we planned.

1049
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:06,000
- What?
- Oh gosh.

1050
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,700
There's something more important.

1051
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:11,740
Before we go,

1052
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,370
we decided to have a
small wedding with you.

1053
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,500
- What?
- What?

1054
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:17,700
- What?
- What?

1055
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,570
Going abroad is not enough?
Now, it's marriage?

1056
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,400
You just graduated! It's
too early to get married.

1057
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:24,400
Hyun Ji, please come to your senses.

1058
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,500
Think about who will
become your mother-in-law.

1059
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,100
And what about you?

1060
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,500
Eun Ok.

1061
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:32,000
Compared to you,

1062
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:34,140
we're rather wealthy.

1063
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,470
Money isn't everything.

1064
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,870
Gosh, this is crazy.

1065
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,300
Do you really have to do this?
Can't we do this step by step?

1066
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,770
Dad.

1067
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,500
We already registered today
as husband and wife.

1068
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,600
Goodness!

1069
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,500
We'll be living together
when we go study anyway.

1070
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,840
We decided to exchange
rings as wedding gifts.

1071
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,700
Goodness.

1072
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,070
Honey!

1073
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,940
- Do Kyung! Hey!
- Gosh.

1074
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,670
- It's okay, breathe.
- Oh, my.

1075
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,200
What are we going to do?

1076
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,100
- What use is it to raise kids?
- Hey.

1077
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,400
- You little...
- My...

1078
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,000
After finally escaping from
being a gangster's wife,

1079
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,100
I thought there will only
be good days ahead of me.

1080
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,470
And now, the Baek's are our in-laws.

1081
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,500
Why can't we escape from them?

1082
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:34,770
What can we do? They already
registered their marriage.

1083
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,940
You sure seem calm after
all that's happened.

1084
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,200
Anyway, this is the worst thing
that's happened in my life.

1085
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,200
Just wait it out.

1086
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,200
Your spring will come.

1087
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,300
Let's go on a national tour...

1088
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,200
with our food truck this spring.

1089
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,300
We can work and travel at the
same time, what do you think?

1090
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,300
I don't care, that doesn't
make me feel any better.

1091
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,470
I'm just going to think that
we don't have any children.

1092
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,300
I'll live just for Kim Eun Ok.

1093
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,300
You only have me too, right?

1094
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,840
Even if I'm born again,
all I want is Kim Eun Ok!

1095
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,940
I already told you that I
don't feel the same way.

1096
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:09,300
I don't mind.

1097
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,840
As long as I have my beautiful wife,

1098
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,200
my life is like a garden of roses.

1099
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,100
Stop that, you're so sly.

1100
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,970
I'm so upset.

1101
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,570
What would you like to eat,

1102
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,100
my lovely Eun Ok?

1103
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,200
Seriously.

1104
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,200
Do you want me to cook
you something delicious?

1105
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,100
How is kimchi fried rice?

1106
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,600
Are you crazy?

1107
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:33,600
I like cheese.

1108
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:34,740
Do you?

1109
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,770
Then, fried rice with cheese!

1110
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,940
That sounds good. We should
add that to the menu.

1111
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:42,870
Then we'd have cheese with fried egg,

1112
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:45,100
cheese with cutlet, cheese fried rice.

1113
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,800
Stop that.

1114
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,300
(THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
SWEET AND SCARY FAMILY.)

1115
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,200
We'll become rich!

1116
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,500
I'm hungry.

1117
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,000
Let's go eat something delicious.

1118
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:22,270
- Would you marry me?
- Absolutely.

1119
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:31,000
Dear god, please let me meet...

1120
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,970
the man of my life at today's meeting.

1121
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,300
Is being married fun?

1122
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,300
He wants to go to trial for our divorce.

1123
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:39,500
I'm sorry, my heart is too
passionate to love only you...

1124
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:40,570
for the rest of my life.

1125
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,500
(THEIR BEGINNING WAS BRAVE.)

1126
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,640
Seriously, just stay right there!

1127
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,270
Why did you go in?

1128
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,870
From now, you must only
look at me and no one else.

1129
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,600
Keep going! Step on it!

1130
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,670
AND IT WILL ALL END IN HAPPINESS.

1131
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,570
I think I'll have to get remarried...

1132
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,740
with this man.

1133
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,300
"HAPPY ENDING ONCE AGAIN"
