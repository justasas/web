00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,480
Mother! Father!

3
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,210
It's me,Sangnam!

4
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,520
You came!

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,740
I'm sorry, I should've come earlier.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,390
You were in China?

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,010
Huh? Uh, yes.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,980
Thanks to you, we're having rib eye.

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,750
Eat up, mother.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,890
I can't chew with my bad teeth.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,290
Didn't Sedal promise to get me implants?

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,110
Hold on. I'll get them for you.

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,040
- Huh?
- What happened?

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,890
Maybe the light bulb burned out.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,790
Stop, stop! Nobody eat!

16
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,740
Right. Nobody eat.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,950
Should I light some candles?

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,950
Hold on. It'll come back on.

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,750
Nobody's eating, right? 
No cheating!

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,120
Don't eat.

21
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,950
Don't worry. Nobody's eating.

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,820
I got you!

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,640
Oh, I didn't think you'd be eating.

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,450
When did this go into my mouth?

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,890
Did you put it in there?

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,540
I'm busy feeding myself.

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,250
I have no time to feed you!

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,390
You should be ashamed of yourself.

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,290
Incredible.

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,080
Aunt Yeongdal's the only one who yells at father.

31
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,520
I'm so embarrassed, Yeongdal.

32
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,720
Thanks to Sangnam, we're laughing.

33
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,190
Oh, oh. It's heavy.

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,110
Mother, stay strong!

35
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,780
He did?

36
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,310
Yes, he came and had dinner,

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,480
and he gave me money, too.

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,150
Don't worry about us and be happy with him.

39
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,340
Mom, I'm sorry I couldn't even help.

40
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,280
What do you mean?
 You helped plenty.

41
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,810
We have to do well, so you can be confident,

42
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,840
so I'm sorry.

43
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,120
Don't be, mom.
I'm always confident.

44
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,950
Don't worry, mom.

45
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,510
I'll call you again.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,720
The Blabbermouth Sangnam is home.

47
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,410
Oh, I'm exhausted.

48
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,510
I had to work late, so I'm tired.

49
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,120
I had dinner.

50
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,090
I had pork with others at the office.

51
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,310
I'll go wash up.

52
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,220
What is it?

53
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,340
You're the best.

54
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,910
You went to see my parents?

55
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,410
And you even gave mom money.

56
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,610
Who's spreading such rumors?

57
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,610
You're adorable.

58
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,280
Remember what your father said at our wedding?

59
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,780
Couples share their hardships.

60
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,540
Don't take this on by yourself.

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,950
Take advantage of your husband.

62
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,650
I will.

63
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,050
I'm sorry I called you a blabbermouth.

64
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,840
I actually like it.

65
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,510
I like how it feels.

66
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,810
I know.

67
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,310
Oh, right.

68
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,150
Don't tell your father about your mother.

69
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,120
Aunt and I decided not to.

70
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,920
If he finds out, they'll never make up.

71
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,420
I didn't want you to find out, either.

72
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,620
You're such a kind person.

73
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,050
You deserve an award.

74
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,690
I'm at the entrance of the park.

75
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,810
Just a minute. I'll be right over.

76
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,190
You already closed?

77
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,420
I'm sorry.
Can you come back tomorrow?

78
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,850
I'm not here to buy anything.

79
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,340
You know Choi Daese, don't you?

80
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,890
Who are you?
Where are your manners?

81
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,250
Me?

82
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,490
His wife.

83
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,940
His wife?

84
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,620
You got divorced long ago.

85
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,620
You're crazy if you think you're still that.

86
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,920
So?

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,190
Stop seeing him.

88
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,920
It's none of your business.

89
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,440
If you want to see him, there's a way.

90
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,510
A way?

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,640
You know.

92
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,510
If you want to see him, it'll cost you.

93
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,990
Spit your gum out first.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,880
How dare you chew gum in front of me?

95
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,510
Hah!

96
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,910
You're feistier than you look.

97
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,290
How do I look?

98
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,720
Like I'll pas out if someone glares at me?

99
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,280
You wish!

100
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,890
People like you don't scare me at all!

101
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,550
Just who do you think you are?

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,120
I ran a tea house when I was young.

103
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,120
You think I'm a joke?

104
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,640
I ran a hair salon in Myeongdong!

105
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,380
You want to see what I'm capable of?

106
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,340
You want me to crush you?

107
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,550
How dare you?

108
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,620
I can't believe you just did that!

109
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,640
- You!
- Huh?

110
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,450
How dare you!

111
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,010
- You come here!
- Hey!

112
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,620
- How dare you!
- Hey!

113
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,810
The person you have called is unavailable...

114
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,250
How can you not take care of yourself?

115
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,850
It's bad business if you're sick!

116
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,390
I'll try harder.

117
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,010
Why did I hire you in the first place?

118
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,140
Did I wrong you in our former life?

119
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,780
I can't even kick you out.

120
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,850
Looking after you is hard work!

121
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,990
Customers.

122
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,940
Hello.

123
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,620
Oh my! Subak!

124
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,790
What's going on?

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,050
You work here?

126
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,850
You're mistaken.

127
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,550
I didn't. You're Subak. Wang Subak.

128
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,810
I'm not Wang Subak.

129
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,250
What's wrong with you?

130
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,750
If you're not Subak, who are you?

131
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,120
You said you were in the Miss Korea pageant.

132
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,350
So why are you acting like this?

133
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,020
I said I'm not her.

134
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,810
What would you like?

135
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,050
Hey, take them to the table.

136
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,380
Yes, sir.

137
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,940
Please sit over here.

138
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,140
What would you like?

139
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,640
Give us two soft tofu stews.

140
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,880
Okay.

141
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,990
Two soft tofu stews, please.

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,050
What's wrong with her?

143
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,720
Maybe she went mad.

144
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,690
She lost her mind after going bankrupt.

145
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,350
I can understand.

146
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,590
Just look at her working here.

147
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,440
I'd go mad, too.

148
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,020
Enjoy.

149
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,890
Subak, can we talk?

150
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,850
I don't know why you're doing this to me.

151
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,240
I'm not her.

152
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,250
Hey, Subak!

153
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,340
Leave her alone. 
She says she's not her.

154
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,020
I don't believe this.

155
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,250
She's embarrassed.
 Leave her alone.

156
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,890
Can we get some more kimchi?

157
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,990
Don't.

158
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,580
Why? She wants us to treat her this way.

159
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,740
Excuse me!

160
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,410
I'm coming.

161
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,980
Enjoy.

162
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,890
Did you see her face?

163
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,050
How can she be so cool?

164
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,890
She's a great actress.

165
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,690
Leave her be.

166
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,020
The old Subak would've dumped this on us.

167
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,090
Not just that.

168
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,640
She'd dump this hot soup on us.

169
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,350
Oh, I pity her.

170
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,810
What goes around comes around.

171
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,190
Maybe she really is divorced.

172
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,750
Let's finish this and leave.

173
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,080
I feel uncomfortable.

174
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,190
The person you have called is unavailable...

175
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,340
The person you have called is unavailable...

176
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,710
What happened?
Where did you find it?

177
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,550
Where it was found isn't important.

178
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,250
You don't need to know that, father.

179
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,440
That's not true!

180
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,050
It's definitely important!

181
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,440
Tell me where you found it.

182
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,740
I put it away while cleaning and forgot.

183
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,340
Everything you do gets on my nerves!

184
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,110
How can you be so forgetful?

185
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,880
Shouldn't you get nervous around me?

186
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,750
Father, we found it, so it's over.

187
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,340
I think you should stop now.

188
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,510
What?

189
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,190
Father, this will never happen again.

190
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,090
Don't butt in when he's scolding me.

191
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,550
We decided to cover everything up,

192
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,890
and in a way, it was my fault, too.

193
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,690
What happened to her?

194
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,080
I heard she lost her mind and maybe she did.

195
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,440
Did you hear she got divorced?

196
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,190
I pity her.

197
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,910
Mom, you look happy these days.

198
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:21,940
I do?

199
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,480
Yes. Like you met a man.

200
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,780
You!

201
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,650
I'm serious.
You look like you're in love.

202
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,990
Stop reading those weird books.

203
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,580
Now I'm reading about married life.

204
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,740
Sangnam reads books like that?

205
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,610
Yes. Dating and Marriage.

206
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,980
Marriage is the Grave for Romance, I think.

207
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,740
I'm almost finished.

208
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,140
You'll be great at dating and marriage.

209
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,940
Of course.

210
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,740
Miho,

211
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,620
how would you feel

212
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,010
if I married someone?

213
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,150
I'm happy if you're happy.

214
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,190
- Really?
- Of course.

215
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,610
You should get married.

216
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,010
You can't live just for me.

217
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,390
Not when I'm going to marry Daebak.

218
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,890
Oh, you!

219
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,650
Are you asleep?

220
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,410
Not yet. I've been working.

221
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,940
You should stop working and go to sleep.

222
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,480
How's Miho doing?

223
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,840
She's sleeping next to me.

224
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,740
Minjung.

225
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,740
Yes?

226
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,610
Being able to text you whenever

227
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,410
and call you whenever is really nice.

228
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,120
You're making me feel badly.

229
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,740
You should.

230
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,980
I'll make up for everything I've done wrong.

231
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,610
It feels like we're dating again.

232
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,040
Miho says I look like I'm in love.

233
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,580
She's a very sharp girl.

234
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,480
I wonder who she takes after.

235
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,280
Sunjeong, go to bed.

236
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,940
I need to wrap this up.

237
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,810
Oh, wake me up in the morning.

238
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,790
The divorce has been finalized.

239
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,790
Here.

240
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,210
Hello?

241
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,480
It's time to wake up.

242
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,690
Bye.

243
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,790
Hey, hey!

244
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,920
Oh Sunjeong.

245
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,290
That's too curt.

246
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,650
That's how these things are done.

247
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,650
Can't you make it sweeter.

248
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,810
Minjung, peekaboo, time to wake up.

249
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,190
No way.

250
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,420
Waking someone up is just protocol.

251
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,650
Bye.

252
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,250
Have you seen a doctor?

253
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,340
I took some medicine, so I'll be fine.

254
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,940
You can't serve food when you're sick!

255
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,190
Outside of being friendly, what are you really good at?

256
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,610
You make mistakes and you get sick.

257
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,140
This is just too much!

258
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,120
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,840
I'll work harder.

260
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,190
At least I'm good at one thing.

261
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,810
I'll work really hard.

262
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,290
I'll sorry about being sick.

263
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,340
You better work harder.

264
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,520
Everyone's asking why I hired you.

265
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,120
I don't want to hear that anymore.

266
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,010
Okay.

267
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,390
It's a small place but I'm a regular here.

268
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,520
Their soft tofu stew is amazing.

269
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,550
Hello! It's been a while.

270
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,510
Hello. How's business?

271
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,840
Pretty good, thank you.
Right this way.

272
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,850
This way.

273
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,150
Two soft tofu stew?

274
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,510
Yes.

275
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,310
It's really good. Give it a try.

276
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,990
I love soft tofu stew.

277
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,350
Side dishes.
They are special customers.

278
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,490
Okay.

279
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,980
What's wrong with you?

280
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

281
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,420
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,120
She's new and she's still learning.

283
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,650
It's okay.

284
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,390
Get that, too. 
There, there.

285
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,050
What are you trying to do?

286
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,210
You said you'll work harder.

287
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,440
Why can't you even serve side dishes right?

288
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,620
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.

289
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,920
Get new side dishes, hurry.

290
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,710
I will.

291
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,620
Please excuse me.

292
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,350
Yes, Mr. Seong.

293
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,710
Enjoy.

294
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,740
This is your first time here, right?

295
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,110
I hope you come back.

296
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,520
I will.

297
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,980
Try it, Mr. Ko.

298
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,780
Oh, it's great.

299
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,440
Factories used to move to China in the past,

300
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,190
but now they move to Vietnam or Thailand.

301
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,890
You should think about it, too.

302
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,940
I will.

303
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,190
Who cares if you were in the Miss Korea pageant?

304
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,940
You're driving me crazy.

305
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,420
All you do is give me stress.

306
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,240
Just looking at you makes me mad.

307
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,480
Why don't you just quit?

308
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,040
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,580
I'm not feeling so well today.

310
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,120
Then you shouldn't work here.

311
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,250
You cry all the time!

312
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,010
Do you know how many dishes you broke?

313
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,280
If you're sick, it's your fault!

314
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,690
Where are you going, Mr. Ko?

315
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,940
Excuse me, aren't you being too harsh?

316
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,480
Excuse me?

317
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,890
It looks like she's sick,

318
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,480
and I think you're being too harsh.

319
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,480
You don't understand.

320
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,780
It's like she's never worked a day in her life.

321
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,540
She drops and breaks things all the time.

322
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,140
She makes so many mistakes every day.

323
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,320
And now she has a cold.

324
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,220
She's not very professional.

325
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,010
She should take better care of herself.

326
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,110
Don't mind us. I'm sorry.

327
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,480
How much do you pay her a day?

328
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,240
Don't. You're a valued customer.

329
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,780
It's okay. Take it.

330
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,140
I'll give you her daily pay,

331
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,190
so please let her have today off.

332
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,190
Oh, okay. Thank you.

333
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,390
He saved you.

334
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,120
Go to the sauna or something.

335
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,890
You're a very caring man.

336
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,350
That was very kind of you.

337
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,280
Goodbye. I hope to see you again.

338
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,420
Mr. Ko, please think over what I've said.

339
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,890
I'll see you again soon.

340
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,550
Let's do that.

341
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,440
- I'll call you.
- Please do.

342
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,610
You should go home.
Just look at yourself.

343
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,390
You know how worried your parents are?

344
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,190
You're getting the house back?

345
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,350
Be realistic.

346
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,790
Stop this nonsense and go home.

347
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,080
Don't you miss the kids?

348
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,320
You should go home right now.

349
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,240
I can't, not like this.

350
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,020
Minjung,

351
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,650
don't tell them I'm here. Don't.

352
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,510
I can't go home just now.

353
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,150
Mom, it's so great to eat in peace.

354
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,590
I can picture it.

355
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,050
You couldn't have picked a worse family.

356
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,010
I love it there.

357
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,840
How are you doing with that man?

358
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,440
Huh? Who?

359
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,620
The man who sends you texts.

360
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,390
How did you know?

361
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,420
How could I not?

362
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,280
I'm pretty sharp on things like that.

363
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,340
You should get married, too.

364
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,850
Having a husband is so great.

365
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,150
You and I were like two peas in a pod.

366
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,920
but now that I'm married, I worry about you.

367
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,850
I feel like I left you behind.

368
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,120
How can I meet anyone at my age?

369
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,590
I don't want to take care of an old man.

370
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,890
Then meet a younger man.

371
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,550
Forget it.

372
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,810
Is he an old man?

373
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,650
He's not.

374
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,190
But it's over.

375
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,940
Why?

376
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,120
His ex-wife is still in the picture.

377
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,440
Oh, disgusting.

378
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,190
Why is she still in the picture?

379
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,820
I know.

380
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:04,450
From now on, I should meet their first wives.

381
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,510
Oh, it was like a midsummer night's dream.

382
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,690
What good does meeting a man do at my age?

383
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,480
I'll have to cook for them, look after them.

384
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,780
And deal with the ex-wife?
Not a chance.

385
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:22,190
No romance is great enough for me to suffer such humiliation.

386
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,620
It's not like I made them get a divorce.

387
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,850
Don't you think so?

388
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,620
Right. So you broke up with him?

389
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,350
I ended it before it's too late.

390
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,650
Too bad.

391
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,620
It's Don!

392
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,620
Don!

393
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,090
Mother, it's me.

394
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,590
Loser, hi.

395
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,710
Don't call him Loser!

396
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,440
He's Wang Don.

397
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,390
His name sounds like a silk merchant.

398
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,890
You're right.

399
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,480
<i>The silk merchant Wang...</i>

400
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,090
Why are you here?

401
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,720
To pick up my princess.

402
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,210
Princess?

403
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,710
Yes. Don says I'm his princess.

404
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,240
Unbelievable.

405
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,890
Where's Goof-off?

406
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,480
He went to the neighborhood bazaar.

407
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,620
I couldn't believe it.

408
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,120
We're leaving, mom.

409
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,210
Already? Hang out with me.

410
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,580
My mom wants her home.

411
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,320
She gets upset when Yeongdal's gone.

412
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,590
Then why did she get mad about her snacking?

413
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,040
Yeongdal said she almost got indigestion. 

414
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,140
She can't even use the toilet.

415
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,890
And she has to do the dishes, too?

416
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,740
I knew Anggeum would do that.

417
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,040
Don's been protecting me.

418
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,610
Don't let her sleep on the cold floor.

419
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,710
She's pregnant.

420
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,040
We're not sleeping in the living room.

421
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,190
Oh, what's the use?

422
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,150
My daughter's the one who's lost her mind.

423
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,150
Get out of my sight.
Take her home.

424
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,820
Okay.

425
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,320
Let's go, princess.

426
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,820
Okay.

427
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,420
Oh, daughters are useless.

428
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,820
So get married.

429
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,610
She's getting married?

430
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,520
Yes, yes.

431
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,210
Okay.

432
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,440
Hobak!

433
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,420
Congrats, congrats!

434
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,420
You've become the company model.

435
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,440
Me? How?

436
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,010
They had a model contest,

437
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,340
and I submitted you along with me.

438
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,290
And we both got selected.

439
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,940
Oh, really? Oh, my!

440
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,940
Are we going to get paid?

441
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,090
I'm sure we will.

442
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,710
Really? And you're getting paid?

443
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,850
Yes.

444
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,990
I'll be home late tomorrow.

445
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,810
There's a photo shoot.

446
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,290
Wow, that's great.

447
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,540
Become a model and get paid.

448
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,140
What if others want to hire you?

449
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,050
You'll be a new star!

450
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,340
Don't get ahead of yourself.

451
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,090
This is nuts!

452
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,190
Shoot.

453
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,920
Shoot.

454
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,510
Is that true?

455
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,940
You met her today?

456
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,650
Where is she? Where is it?

457
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,290
A soft tofu stew place in the market.

458
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,740
She can't make soft tofu stew!

459
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,690
She's just doing the dishes.

460
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,620
She can't do dishes either.

461
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,850
She told me not to tell you, 
but I thought you should know.

462
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,440
Of course. Lead the way.

463
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,010
Stay home.

464
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,190
I'll go.

465
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,810
Why are you coming with me?

466
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,690
The prince and the princess are a pair.

467
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,020
Father.

468
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,980
Get your things.
You're coming home.

469
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,650
I can't, father.

470
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,690
Not until I get the house back.

471
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,980
You can't do that, not this way.

472
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,120
You're breaking our hearts.

473
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,280
How can I leave you here?

474
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,650
Father...

475
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,780
I can't face the others,

476
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,780
and I can't face you, either.

477
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,340
I know how you feel.

478
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,190
I'm sure it's uncomfortable.

479
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,420
But this won't solve anything.

480
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,350
You have Aeji and Jungji to think about.

481
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,940
How can you do this to them?

482
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,710
They're asking for you.

483
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,920
Jungji's first birthday is coming up.

484
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,510
All the more reason for you to come home.

485
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,590
What is this?

486
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,440
It's a tiny house, but come home.

487
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,320
Good or bad,

488
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,190
you're still my daughter.

489
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,490
Father.

490
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:06,940
Father, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

491
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,780
Please forgive me, father.

492
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,810
Father.

493
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,820
Father.

494
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,950
I'm sorry.

495
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,850
Anggeum, Subak's home!

496
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,390
Oh, Subak!

497
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,190
Mom.

498
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,480
Oh, Subak...

499
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,390
Mommy!

500
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:18,690
Aeji! Aeji!

501
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,890
Mommy...

502
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,090
We should go inside.

503
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,890
I didn't know you had a family.

504
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,690
Your father talked to me.

505
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,820
He said to scold you if you deserve it.

506
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,720
Did you cause trouble?

507
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,650
Yes.

508
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,890
Then you should try to be better.

509
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,690
I've never seen you smile before.

510
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,420
I'm going to commute from now on.

511
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,980
I have to make money.

512
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,280
Yes?

513
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,740
I'm hungry.

514
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,710
Excuse me?

515
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,080
Make me lunch.

516
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,190
I got it.

517
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,880
Father, lunch is ready.

518
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,420
What's this?

519
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,210
Shabu-shabu.

520
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,580
Shabu-shabu?

521
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,190
I have to cook and eat with my own hands?

522
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,320
I don't eat stuff like this.

523
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,480
I can't cook anything yet,

524
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,940
and I couldn't find anything in the fridge.

525
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,740
Father, can you eat this just once?

526
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,080
I'll make you fried rice later.

527
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,490
Or I can get some noodles.

528
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,840
So you want me to have this for lunch?

529
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,520
You should try to make soup or stew.

530
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,590
A family should have a woman who can cook.

531
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,320
That makes men want to come home early.

532
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,950
And this is a family of laborers.

533
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,120
You know how important food is to us?

534
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,690
Why do you think I held that audition?

535
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,150
What's going on, Daese?

536
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,890
Sunjeong, look at this.

537
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,790
Don't I have every right to get mad?

538
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,890
Oh, man!

539
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,790
Some people don't like shabu-shabu.

540
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,010
You should've asked him ahead.

541
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,190
This is why living with in-laws is hard.

542
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,210
You can't do everything your way.

543
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,350
I'm sorry. I don't really know how to cook.

544
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,520
I'm sorry, aunt.

545
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,420
I don't know how to put on makeup.

546
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,620
You should learn.
You're a model now.

547
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,080
You'll look beautiful with makeup on.

548
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,750
You should try it.

549
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,280
What do I need to buy?

550
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,710
I'll pick them out for you.

551
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,120
Makeup is important for a woman.

552
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,010
I know that.

553
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,710
My mother in law runs a shop like this.

554
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,550
But she doesn't give you any makeup.

555
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,320
You're right.

556
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,150
Okay.

557
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,290
To the side.

558
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,820
Oh, this is nice.

559
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,980
No. 505!

560
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,990
Yes, hi.

561
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,020
Come with us to the hot spring next month.

562
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,110
Hot spring?

563
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,980
The whole building is coming. Join us.

564
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,890
But I'm the only man...

565
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,740
We don't care.

566
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,940
To us, you're not a man.

567
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,750
You're coming, okay?

568
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,780
I...

569
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,550
There's a photo shoot.

570
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,610
Sintong, wait for me!

571
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,920
Wait for me!

572
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,820
Here I go!

573
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,110
Sintong! Bangtong!

574
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,010
Dad!

575
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,150
Hold on.

576
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,820
You boys!

577
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,780
Why did you get so much dirt on you?

578
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,650
You know how hard it is to wash them?

579
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,320
These need to be hand washed.

580
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,690
But you told us to run around wild!

581
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,110
I know!

582
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,920
Okay, fine. You do that.

583
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,010
Should we go visit mom?

584
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,980
Wow! How exciting!

585
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,920
Let's ask mom to take us out.

586
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,090
Even more exciting!

587
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,740
Barbecue! Barbecue!

588
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,090
Let's go, let's go.

589
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,950
Yes, mother.

590
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,090
Minjung, can you drop by?

591
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,690
What's going on?

592
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,610
Just drop by. I have something to tell you.

593
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,090
Okay.

594
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,710
Minjung, when are you coming?

595
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,320
I'm making seafood stew.

596
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,240
I just need to boil it now.

597
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,210
Your mother in law called?

598
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,750
Why?

599
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,110
Is something going on?

600
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,210
Okay, Minjung.

601
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,590
I'll wait.

602
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,050
Mom.

603
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,240
Oh, you're home.

604
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,240
Did your boss let you go early?

605
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,440
He had a gathering, so we closed early.

606
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,350
Hold on. Minjung is coming.

607
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,210
You called me for that?

608
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,290
Yes.

609
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,590
Mom, stop this.

610
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,740
Stop what?
You have kids together!

611
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,440
You don't need to say anything.

612
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,720
Subak!

613
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,550
Don't let your pride get the best of you!

614
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,510
This is not time to do that!

615
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,090
You should be begging for his forgiveness!

616
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,820
It looks like I'm having dinner here.

617
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,620
Don't wait for me.

618
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,440
Where did Subak go?

619
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,810
She can't even sit and eat with us.

620
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:28,890
Subak's a considerate, loving girl.

621
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,190
If she didn't care what others think,

622
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,050
she'd be sitting here, as if nothing's wrong.

623
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,780
Who are you talking about? Subak?

624
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,610
Yes, we're talking about Subak.

625
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,650
Stop lying.

626
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,720
Everyone here knows Subak very well.

627
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:45,590
So how can you say she's considerate?

628
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,490
You don't know her that well.

629
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,150
Growing up, she shared her cookies with Don.

630
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,110
No way.

631
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,510
I'm sure she was too full.

632
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,420
She left home because she was sorry.

633
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,380
I'd leave home, too.
How could she stay?

634
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,540
She even got a job to get our house back.

635
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,190
She had it rough.

636
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,920
She should!

637
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,090
Considering what she did to Bong, she should.

638
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,420
Why do you hate Subak so much?

639
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,340
Not in front of Minjung.

640
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,580
I agree!

641
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,820
I ache all over, but I made kimchi casserole for Minjung.

642
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,120
You're sick?

643
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,080
I got sick after Subak came home.

644
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,120
Taking care of the kids must be hard.

645
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,840
It is hard.

646
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,310
But what can I do?
They're your kids.

647
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,450
I wish Hobak and Gwangbak were here.

648
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,750
I know.

649
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:48,150
I called Hobak, but she won't come.

650
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,610
She hasn't come since your birthday.

651
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,150
She works. She's busy.

652
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,110
She thinks she's too good for us now.

653
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,310
She's heartless.

654
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,090
Hobak isn't heartless!

655
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,220
She got us this place.

656
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,280
Gwangbak helped!
She didn't do it alone.

657
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,820
Gwangbak came earlier and gave me money.

658
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:19,780
She said she's working for a magazine, and I felt so sad.

659
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,340
She's working?

660
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,740
She is.

661
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,840
So Gwangbak quit writing?

662
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,040
She doesn't know how to persevere.

663
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,740
She quit teaching only after a few years.

664
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,940
Right, Don?

665
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,320
Right.

666
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,750
Minjung.

667
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,590
Minjung.

668
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,010
Can you take Subak back?

669
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,480
Excuse me?

670
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,590
Look what she did.

671
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,090
She was too ashamed to see you tonight.

672
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,090
She acts mean, but she's soft inside.

673
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,650
I know Subak caused you a lot of grief.

674
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,220
But you had two kids with her.

675
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,350
Many couples reunite after their divorce.

676
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:32,780
Your spouse knows you best.

677
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,190
Divorce isn't the end of a couple.

678
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,610
Mother, we're already...

679
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,010
Just hear me out.

680
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,650
Subak must have learned her lesson.

681
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,240
She's not the same immature girl.

682
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:52,420
I'm not telling you to get back with her now.

683
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:56,150
Take some time and think about it.

684
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,190
Give her time.
Subak will change.

685
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,490
After what happened, I'm sure she will.

686
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,090
There are lots of women worse than her.

687
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,390
There are women who addicted to shopping.

688
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,110
Isn't she better than them?

689
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,450
That's enough.

690
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,880
You're making Minjung uncomfortable.

691
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,190
I'm not! I'm telling the truth.

692
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,610
Minjung comes here to see the kids,

693
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,840
not to listen to you talk nonsense.

694
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:27,810
Divorce isn't a joke.
You can't take it back.

695
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,780
You know it was a hard decision for him.

696
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:33,420
So they should get back together.

697
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,240
You better go.

698
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,550
Come whenever you want to see the kids.

699
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,320
And don't come whenever she calls you.

700
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,450
Don't call him so much. He's busy.

701
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,550
Where were you?

702
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,740
I was at the park.

703
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:13,380
Why did you go there when it's freezing?

704
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,490
Subak...

705
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,450
I know what you're going to say.

706
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,320
But stop it, mom.

707
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,720
I'm not that thick skinned.

708
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,890
Maybe I was before, but I'm not now.

709
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,510
But you have kids.

710
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,740
Even so,

711
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,740
we got a divorce despite them.

712
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,510
He doesn't want to see me.

713
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,610
That won't last long.

714
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,920
It'll all pass.

715
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:45,450
That's why some couples get back together.

716
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,050
What if some other woman takes him?

717
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,050
He's doing well.
He's successful now.

718
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,690
And he'll get his company back.

719
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,950
What woman would say no to him?

720
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,250
Women will line up for a man like Minjung.

721
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,320
So don't lose him.

722
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,780
You have kids together.

723
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,690
Mom, please.

724
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,340
I want to, I do.

725
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,380
But how can I ask him back?

726
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:18,040
And it's not like he'll come back to me.

727
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,780
Oh...

728
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,720
Ugh...

729
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,020
Okay, Daebak.

730
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,550
Goodnight.

731
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,690
Here.

732
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,950
Mom, Subak came home.

733
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,890
She did?

734
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,210
Yes. And her husband went to see her.

735
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,850
Everyone wants them to get back together.

736
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,390
I'm cold.

737
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,190
Dad, I'm hungry.

738
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,510
You said mom would take us out.

739
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,510
I'm sleepy.

740
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,340
Dad, I'm hungry.

741
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:10,310
Hold on and stop complaining.

742
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:14,740
Dad, let's go home. 
She's not coming.

743
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,240
Just hold on.
She'll come any minute.

744
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:21,850
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

745
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,880
Good job.

746
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,740
Oh, I hope I wasn't really bad.

747
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,280
You were really great.

748
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,380
Stiff, but great.

749
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,940
I should go home and practice.

750
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,490
How about a round of beers?

751
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,750
My treat.

752
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,550
Mom!

753
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,350
It's mom!

754
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,920
Stay away. What's wrong with you?

755
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,950
They're my boys.

756
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,940
Uh, honey.

757
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,420
Maybe we should go out another time.

758
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,190
Can we? I'm so sorry.

759
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,280
It's okay. You should go.

760
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,840
Have a good evening.

761
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,980
Hobak, I'll see you tomorrow.

762
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,150
Goodnight.

763
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,280
Bye. Goodnight, everyone.

764
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,250
Bye. I'm sorry.

765
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,090
Oh, it's so cold.

766
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,050
Dad, this is so good.

767
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,550
The best! Better than barbecue.

768
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,240
Boys, slow down. 
Let dad eat, too.

769
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:49,550
Why are my boys such gluttons?

770
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,750
I can't believe you.

771
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,480
Wash your face. 
It doesn't look good.

772
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,990
I can't wash my face.

773
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,090
I've never worn this kind of makeup before.

774
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,390
Where are the kids?

775
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:16,040
I put them to bed.

776
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,350
It's not easy being a model.

777
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,810
It was exhausting.

778
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:24,190
Beautiful, right?

779
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,490
Not really.

780
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,950
- What?
- You don't look good in makeup.

781
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,390
Look in the mirror.
It's weird.

782
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,380
You look strange.

783
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,550
I look pretty.

784
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,550
Just you wait.

785
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,190
When the TV ad comes out, I'll be a star.

786
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,280
I didn't know I was this pretty.

787
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,420
That's what everyone told me.

788
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,420
You shouldn't take them seriously.

789
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,720
Why not? It's the truth.

790
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:59,090
Look. I look amazing.

791
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,720
You must be insane!

792
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:04,990
What if I become a real model?

793
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,520
That won't be good.

794
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,240
Nobody's that crazy.

795
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:12,150
Your company hired you because it was cheap.

796
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,090
Don't do any more of that.

797
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,390
Why not?

798
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:17,310
It's not good to get your face known.

799
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:19,990
No privacy and you can't even fight.

800
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,990
If it's posted online, your life is over.

801
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,050
I feel so sorry for celebrities.

802
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:29,550
And why don't you post pictures of me and the kids on your blog?

803
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,190
When your co-workers stopped the boys,

804
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,010
I got really mad.

805
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,240
Post our family picture up, so they'll know.

806
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,840
You're married.

807
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:44,310
I don't get why people post those pictures.

808
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,450
Why don't they just hang them at the door?

809
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,190
So everyone can see them.

810
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,880
And were you out of your mind?

811
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:53,690
What do you mean?

812
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,320
What were you thinking?

813
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:57,550
The three of you looked almost homeless.

814
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:02,650
Why didn't you dress them up and wash their faces?

815
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,880
Life father, like sons.

816
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:06,080
I was so embarrassed.

817
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,240
You were embarrassed of the boys?

818
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,510
Not the boys, you.

819
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,820
You looked so shabby!

820
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:13,990
What will people think of me?

821
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,850
Put yourself in my shoes.

822
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,880
Wouldn't you feel embarrassed

823
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:20,650
if I should up at your workplace looking

824
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,190
all shabby with the boys?

825
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,510
I wouldn't.

826
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,380
You think you're so great, don't you?

827
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:28,240
What?

828
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,820
You don't care about me or the boy?

829
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,650
Ask anyone!

830
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,780
That's what I should say!

831
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,650
Ask anyone whose fault it was.

832
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:41,840
Fine! I'll dress up the next time I come!

833
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,740
Man.

834
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:25,380
Don, don't go anywhere.

835
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,440
I won't.

836
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,340
Anggeum, good morning.

837
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,550
You should learn to do this alone!

838
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,740
Don't make Don stand guard!

839
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,340
You're jealous, aren't you?

840
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,210
I'll ask Bong to stand guard for you.

841
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,420
Oh, boy.

842
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:45,820
Don't. You can't win.

843
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,220
You were made for each other.

844
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:51,320
Ugh.

845
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:55,950
Man...

846
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:12,650
Honey, honey!

847
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:16,280
Mom, I need some time by myself.

848
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:19,420
Don't worry. I'll stay safe.

849
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:22,950
I just need to sort things out.

850
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,390
I feel relieved now that Subak's back.

851
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,010
Mom, I'm sorry.

852
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,210
Father, I'm sorry.

853
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,240
Why are all our children trouble makers?

854
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:38,740
This must be their hobby or something.

855
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,440
It's because they're our children.

856
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,490
But they didn't learn this from me.

857
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,990
I'm sure she had no other choice.

858
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,250
Don't push her too hard.

859
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,740
But I'm doing it for her.

860
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,980
Be honest with me.

861
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,120
Are you really doing it for her?

862
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,880
She wants to be a captain.

863
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,420
Just think about it.

864
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:03,090
A daughter who's a captain is pretty cool.

865
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,820
You're not worried?

866
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,050
No.

867
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,190
You better not do this.

868
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,690
If you do, I'll kill you.

869
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,110
Oh, incredible.

870
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,620
Bong, you can use the bathroom now!

871
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:19,990
Hah!

872
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,050
Oh, you stop right there.

873
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,390
How dare you steal from me?

874
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,540
What?

875
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,320
I never stole anything.

876
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,950
How old are you?

877
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,350
How dare you act so rude to me!

878
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,010
What?

879
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,510
I'm ninety!

880
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,050
Yeah, right!

881
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,390
If you're ninety, I'm a hundred and twenty!

882
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:57,920
What did you say?

883
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,190
Ouch! Ouch!

884
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,450
Oh! He's killing me!

885
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,290
Help! Help! Oh...

886
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,880
Why are you hurting my mother?

887
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:09,690
Because she's stealing!

888
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,010
These don't belong to you! Finders keepers!

889
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,440
Mother, get up.

890
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,020
She's not doing this because she's all alone.

891
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:22,920
Her children are teachers, judges, and doctors.

892
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,740
She's doing this to keep herself busy.

893
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,150
She's not doing this for money.

894
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,820
Don't look down on her!

895
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,620
Don't! Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

896
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:35,280
Let's go.

897
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:38,650
You saved me. You're the best.

898
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,010
If Bong finds out, he'll be mad.

899
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,440
What if you get hurt?

900
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,450
It'll cost a lot of money, you know?

901
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,520
You're not in pain?

902
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,440
I'm too furious to feel any pain.

903
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:51,550
Oh, don't tell Bong. He'll worry.

904
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:55,820
You really showed him off.

905
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,420
You're a good liar.

906
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:02,590
My children are judges and doctors?

907
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,690
Sometimes one must lie.

908
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:09,240
Right. Sometimes one must lie.

909
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:12,840
Anggeum, want a pancake?

910
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,420
Don't waste your money on pancake.

911
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:18,090
Think about what it took you to make that.

912
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,120
I'm making money to spend it.

913
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,610
Remember how much we wanted one?

914
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,650
Let's get one.

915
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,510
Give us pancake.

916
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,810
Pancake?

917
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:34,720
I'll get you a thick one.

918
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,590
How yummy.

919
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,780
There's no honey in here.

920
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:43,610
But there is. Look.

921
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,440
Oh, you do. But I don't have any.

922
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,050
Watch out.

923
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:50,810
The person you have called is unavailable...

924
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,480
The person you have called is unavailable...

925
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,020
Is something wrong?

926
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:57,820
No.

927
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:59,240
You seem agitated.

928
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,420
I can see it in your face.

929
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:02,740
And you don't whistle anymore.

930
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,550
What's wrong?

931
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,090
I'll be back.

932
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,090
Why won't you answer my calls?

933
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,220
Why are you doing this to me?

934
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:17,250
I deserve to know hwy.

935
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,820
Tell me if I've upset you.

936
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:21,920
You know how I am.

937
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:24,650
I pass out when someone screams.

938
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,280
You passed out? Why?

939
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,840
Who would scream at you?

940
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,210
Your wife.

941
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,490
What?

942
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,990
Your wife came to me,

943
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,890
spit gum at my face, pushed me,

944
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:45,580
and screamed at me not to see you again.

945
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,510
No one has every done that to me.

946
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,610
My heart is still pounding.

947
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,710
She said she'd leave me alone if I pay her.

948
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:57,820
Money? She asked for money?

949
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:00,650
It's not like I'm dying to meet a man.

950
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,010
Why should I expose myself to such brutality

951
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,690
and give money away to see you?

952
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,990
Just leave.

953
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,090
You and I are over...

954
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,010
Be quiet.

955
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:14,010
It's not over for us.

956
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,080
It's me. I need to see you.

957
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:32,840
Why? What's up?

958
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:34,740
I'll tell you when we meet.

959
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,920
Did someone say something to you?

960
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,090
No, nobody said anything.

961
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,650
I have something to give you.

962
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,110
Give me?

963
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:48,080
Okay. I'll see you there.

964
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,610
Oh, he did?

965
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,650
He started nagging about everything.

966
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,050
Don't wear makeup, don't be a model.

967
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,280
Post family pictures on your blog,

968
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:03,550
you're a married woman.

969
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,120
He went all crazy.

970
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,280
He wouldn't let me wear makeup this morning.

971
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:10,090
He's jealous.

972
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,620
- Jealous?
- Yes.

973
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,610
He's jealous because he loves you so much.

974
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,080
No way.

975
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,510
I'm serious.

976
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,690
You two are so funny.

977
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,150
Your roles have completely changed.

978
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,820
Remember when he came

979
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,490
with divorce papers?

980
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,150
Congratulations, manager.

981
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,510
You have the upper hand now.

982
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,340
You should have some fun now.

983
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,980
It'll be great.

984
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:40,550
Oh, that bastard.

985
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:44,190
He should be kicked out in his underwear.

986
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,650
I know how that feels.

987
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,650
Hello?

988
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,820
It's me. I'll be late.

989
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,350
Okay.

990
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:56,110
Why? Why? For what?

991
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,440
I have a work dinner.

992
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:00,750
Again? Where?

993
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:04,420
Hello? Hello? Hobak!

994
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:05,510
I don't believe this...

995
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,010
Good job.

996
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,980
He must be going mad.

997
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,040
Hey, get in.

998
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,890
You won't help me with the seatbelt?

999
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:39,150
They do in dramas.

1000
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,920
Don't watch such dramas.

1001
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,840
They're driving men mad.

1002
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,050
Where would you like to go?

1003
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,780
To the beach.

1004
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,240
Do you have time for that?

1005
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,090
I'll make time, if it's for you.

1006
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:58,890
Where are we going?

1007
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,240
Follow me.

1008
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,090
I told my boss I'd be back in an hour.

1009
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,390
That's not the problem here.

1010
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,110
Where is this?

1011
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,280
Come in. 
This is where Minjung lives.

1012
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,150
Look.

1013
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,450
He says no, but he has a woman.

1014
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,250
He looks better and he dresses better.

1015
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:05,690
Men change when they have a woman.

1016
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,590
I don't think they're living together.

1017
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,320
There's only one toothbrush here.

1018
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:21,720
She comes and goes.

1019
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:24,390
She can't move in just yet.

1020
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,440
Minjung.

1021
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,950
Today's the day we first met.

1022
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,350
We met 20 years ago today.

1023
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:41,690
We did?

1024
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,550
I had forgotten the date.

1025
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,890
It's so nice to be out with you.

1026
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:53,780
I was so excited in the car.

1027
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:01,210
I still make you feel excited?

1028
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,050
Minjung,

1029
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,350
I have something to tell you.

1030
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:10,840
Go ahead.

1031
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:15,310
Minjung,

1032
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:18,440
come to me.

1033
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,510
What are you going to do?

1034
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,840
About what?

1035
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:41,190
You don't care if Minjung gets remarried?

1036
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,010
Seeing all that didn't make you mad?

1037
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:49,150
Wake up or you'll lose him.

1038
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,150
Don't let another woman snatch him up!

1040
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,090
Honey.

1041
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,350
You... You stay right there!

1042
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:26,240
You're dead!

1043
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,110
How can you bring him here?

1044
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,040
Whom I meet is none of your business.

1045
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,510
What if Minjung gets married again.

1046
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,980
How will you take care of the kids?

1047
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,890
If I do get married again...

1048
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:40,340
You're getting married again?

1049
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:44,080
If it weren't for her, we wouldn't be here!

1050
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,590
Oh, please stop!

1051
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,450
I'll go and kill myself!

1052
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,490
Don't butt in when we're talking!

1053
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,550
You're so mean!

1054
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,590
You can't live by yourself.

1055
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,010
I'll raise them.

1056
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,090
What are you going to do?

1057
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,740
I have to catch them in the act.

1058
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,480
I'd rather die than let it go on.

1059
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,090
What do you think you're doing?
