00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,590
You!

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,270
Heo Sedal!

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,060
Wha... What is it?

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,770
What did you do to me?

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,430
What do you mean?

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,430
You!

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,830
I'm going to kill you!

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,100
Hey!

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:30,970
Open the door!

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,100
Open it, right now!

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,570
Open it before I get really man!

13
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,270
What did you do to me?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,040
Calm down, Hobak.

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,360
How can I calm down?

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,630
Open!

17
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,360
So you can beat me up?

18
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,300
You...

19
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,570
You want me to die from being mad?

20
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,830
Huh?

21
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,600
Don't get mad.

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,170
Beat me up, go ahead.

23
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,430
I'm so happy I can go nuts.

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,290
They can't act like newlyweds because of us.

25
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,390
Who'd want to live like this?

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,890
You're lucky she's your daughter in law.

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,960
You should try being nicer to her.

28
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,400
And when you call her, don't say "Hey."

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,600
Call her by name with affection.

30
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,140
Your voice is too loud.

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,130
Try being a little warm to her.

32
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,940
Gwangbak?

33
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,440
Gwangbak?

34
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,260
Gwangbak?

35
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,540
Oh, my baby.

36
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,160
Gwangbak? Darling!

37
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,400
Show me some nice fountain pens.

38
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,100
It's for my darling daughter in law.

39
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,340
Excuse me?

40
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,240
My daughter in law.

41
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,670
You must really love your daughter in law.

42
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,540
She's going to be a writer.

43
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,690
She's going to be really famous.

44
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,100
You must be proud.

45
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,840
Is there anything with hearts?

46
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,940
Ding-dong, a kiss is here for you.

47
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,470
What's up?

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,130
I had a  meeting nearby and I missed you.

49
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,630
Really?

50
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,760
Umm... Let's take our time.

51
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,070
Would you like to go for a drive?

52
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,130
Really?

53
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,670
How exciting!

54
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,040
Where would you like to go, princess?

55
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,040
I didn't know I'd get yelled at for not calling you "princess."

56
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,940
Go wherever you want, prince.

57
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,740
I was having trouble writing.

58
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,390
What were you writing about?

59
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,140
It's a secret.

60
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,400
Stop taking so much time.

61
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,570
It's not good to take so much time.

62
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,370
I can't kiss while I'm driving.

63
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,940
How mean.

64
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,000
Gwangbak.

65
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,960
Gwangbak.

66
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,870
Gwangbak.

67
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,840
Gwangbak. Are you in there?

68
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,770
Gwangbak.

69
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,690
Gwangbak.

70
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,330
I have something to say.

71
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,970
Me too. But go ahead.

72
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,560
Let's have a baby.

73
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,540
I thought we could take our time,

74
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,840
but I think a baby can solve

75
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,790
all the problems we have right now.

76
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,490
If my father had his first grandchild...

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,790
Me too.

78
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,790
I thought that, too.

79
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,730
Really?

80
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,900
You're the best.

81
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,140
Hobak.

82
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,040
Is something the matter?

83
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,040
Huh?

84
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,290
No...

85
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,660
You don't look so well.

86
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,770
Are you coming down with something?

87
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,270
I think I'm just tired.

88
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,400
Uncle, what's up?

89
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,440
Do you have time to have coffee with me?

90
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,760
No, you should make time.

91
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,900
How's Goof-off?
Is he behaving himself?

92
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,790
I don't want to talk about him.

93
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,900
Why? He's been acting up?

94
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,790
It's not that.

95
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,490
He's become weird and narrow minded.

96
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,790
He used to be somewhat charming before,

97
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,060
but not anymore.

98
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,160
I thought you didn't like him acting all charming.

99
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,860
A man should be charming!

100
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,730
Don't be so harsh.

101
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,190
What?

102
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,340
I feel bad for Goof-off.

103
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,600
What do you know?
I'm so upset.

104
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,060
Did you hear something from him?

105
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,760
Yes, he came to talk to me.

106
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,140
I told him to keep it a secret.

107
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,070
Why would he tell you that?

108
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,090
Who else could he talk to?
I'm his friend.

109
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,160
It's nothing to brag about...

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,760
Keep it to yourself.

111
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,140
Don't tell anyone else.

112
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,160
I won't. It's nothing to brag about.

113
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,140
I know. How embarrassing.

114
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,800
But you're the one who made him do that!

115
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,770
When did I make him do that?

116
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,070
He took advantage of me when I was drunk!

117
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,540
What are you talking about?

118
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,970
Huh?

119
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,100
You turned him into a housewife when you were drunk?

120
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,700
Oh...

121
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,270
That?

122
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,640
What did you think I was talking about?

123
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,440
Well, I...

124
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,630
Right. I was talking about that, too.

125
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,690
He doesn't want to be a housewife?

126
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,540
It's not that.

127
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,860
He feels like he's turned into a real wife.

128
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,360
Now that you're successful,

129
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,130
he's scared you'd leave him someday.

130
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,640
That you'd dump him.

131
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,040
He said that?

132
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,700
Yes.

133
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,240
You've taken him back,

134
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,540
so don't make him feel that way.

135
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,970
Have some pity on him.

136
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,470
I used to be more pathetic than him before,

137
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,660
but now, he's far more pathetic than me.

138
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,990
Don't you think so?

139
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,290
What?

140
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,040
Goodbye.

141
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,040
You can't come because you're sick?

142
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,290
She was just fine a little while ago.

143
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,560
Man...

144
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,900
She caught a cold, out of the blue.

145
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,340
She'll be able to go to work tomorrow.

146
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,060
Thank you.

147
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,640
He sounds so mean.

148
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,560
When you were late to school or absent,

149
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,160
I used to call your homeroom teacher.

150
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,770
Why am I still doing this at your age?

151
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,060
Oh...

152
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,160
She didn't go to work?

153
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,160
She's sick.

154
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,330
She's such a cry baby.

155
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,390
Isn't Jungji's 1st birthday party coming up?

156
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,740
Oh, right.
I almost forgot.

157
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,200
Stay on top of things!

158
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,460
You forgot Bong's birthday, remember?

159
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,060
Call him.

160
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,660
Ask Minjung about Jungji's birthday.

161
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,040
You call him.

162
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,770
I don't want to talk to him.

163
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,140
You still have to.

164
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,870
He doesn't even want to see me!

165
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes, mother?

166
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,240
I need to talk to you, so come by the house.

167
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,290
Please tell me over the phone.

168
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,370
I won't bite.

169
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,400
Don't you miss your kids?

170
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,000
Why haven't you visited?

171
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,400
I just missed yesterday.

172
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,340
Your mind is off somewhere else, that's why.

173
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,890
Jungji's first birthday is the day after tomorrow.

174
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,270
You forgot, didn't you?

175
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,560
You're in love, so how could you remember?

176
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,090
I didn't forget.

177
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,190
And you didn't even call?

178
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,190
Come or don't.
Do as you want.

179
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,690
I just called to remind you.

180
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,160
Sunjeong!

181
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,270
Are you okay?

182
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,460
Father, when did you get home?

183
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,190
Father, have you eaten dinner?

184
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,630
What's that?

185
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,470
Did you write that?

186
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,260
Did you?

187
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,430
Yes.

188
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,540
Read it out loud.

189
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,140
Marriage and moving out.
Read that part.

190
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,090
Hurry!

191
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,930
When you get married, you must move out.

192
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:05,190
Marriage is nice if you lived by yourselves,

193
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,860
but living with others makes life difficult.

194
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:17,930
Moving into the in laws house is opening the gates of hell.

195
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,430
What was that?

196
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,270
Gates of hell?

197
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,870
- Father, this...
- That's how you feel?

198
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,370
- I was just...
- Don't make excuses.

199
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,540
You wrote it and you meant it.

200
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,330
I was trying to capture the readers eyes,

201
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,590
for those getting married soon...

202
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,190
I don't want to hear anything else.

203
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,460
Just say yes or no.

204
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,060
Is this how you feel or not?

205
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,240
It is.

206
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,930
How do you feel?

207
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,960
Father, this...

208
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,890
How do you feel?

209
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,840
Everything a writer writes isn't really...

210
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,090
There might be exaggerations, and...

211
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,730
Don't side with her.

212
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,590
I went to buy a fountain pen today.

213
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,240
I told the salesclerk you'll be a famous writer soon, bragging.

214
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,660
I picked out a fountain pen just for you.

215
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,560
And you stab me in the back like this?

216
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,140
Living with me is hell?

217
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,500
You're the one who said you didn't want to

218
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,440
move out because you like living with me.

219
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,040
That was all fake?

220
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,970
Thanks for trying.

221
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,190
It must have been very hard.

222
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,330
Move out this instant.

223
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,630
Father.

224
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,770
Come with me.

225
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,430
Sangnam, that was...

226
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,360
Wait.

227
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,600
Let me ask you one question.

228
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,630
Is this really how you feel?

229
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,040
Like I said just now,

230
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,900
I used to exaggerate expressions to attract...

231
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,140
Enough.

232
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,290
Just tell me how you feel.

233
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,190
Do you really think so?

234
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,860
You have to ask?

235
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,690
I did exaggerate, but I do think so.

236
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,400
I didn't know it would be this bad at first.

237
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,870
I thought if I did my best, it'll work out.

238
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,900
But after I moved in, you know!

239
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,140
I do, but...

240
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,000
When I saw it in writing, I felt sad.

241
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,240
Was everything you did all fake?

242
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,340
Were you just pretending to be happy?

243
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,160
It wasn't like that.

244
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,790
But explaining it clearly is...

245
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,930
This won't work out.

246
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,430
We should

247
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,460
move out.

248
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,860
No, not like this.

249
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,640
That doesn't matter.

250
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,160
I don't want you hiding your feelings.

251
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,590
Sangnam,

252
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,960
I want you to try to understand me.

253
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,960
Now, it's become a huge mess.

254
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,890
Let's move out after I make up with him.

255
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,270
Now isn't the time.

256
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,370
I'll talk to your father.

257
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,160
I didn't know my writing would have such a bad effect.

258
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,000
Can you separate a writer from her work?

259
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,470
Now I'm scared to write anything.

260
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,690
What if people pick on everything I write?

261
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,630
Put yourself in my shoes.

262
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,660
What if I wrote that living with your parents?

263
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,140
Mommy!

264
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,130
You can't go?

265
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,270
No.

266
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,190
But this is such a great chance!

267
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,140
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,400
Why? You won't get another chance like this.

269
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,240
I couldn't sleep because I know that.

270
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,940
Oh, I don't know how to say this.

271
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,540
What is it?

272
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,290
I'm expecting a new addition to the family.

273
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,090
Oh, how embarrassing.

274
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,390
Oh, I'm sorry.

275
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,400
You're expecting a baby?

276
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,100
Yes.

277
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,990
You are?

278
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,940
Congratulations.

279
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,140
I thought you were thinking of divorcing.

280
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,940
Oh, I can't believe it either.

281
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,290
It's a good thing.
Congratulations.

282
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,040
You can go to Italy another time.

283
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,370
Will there be another chance?

284
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,040
I thought my luck changed this year.

285
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,370
Your luck did change.

286
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,070
Not everyone can get pregnant at your age.

287
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,000
Don't bother me.

288
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,500
I'm about to explode.

289
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,940
Why? Did something bad happen?

290
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,060
I wanted to get presents from Italy

291
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,040
for everyone in the family,

292
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,160
but I can't now.

293
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,560
You're not going to Italy?

294
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,040
It's more like I can't go.

295
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,190
How can I go like this?

296
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,290
Really?

297
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,830
You're the best. Come here.

298
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,990
Ugh!

299
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,460
Oh! Agh!

300
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,440
Are you coming from the academy?

301
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,400
Yes.

302
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,460
Are you hungry?

303
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,640
I got some snacks with my friends.

304
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,490
Do you have any glue?

305
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,170
I have some in my room.

306
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,330
Miho,

307
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,160
how is Daebak doing these days?

308
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,870
Is he studying hard?

309
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,730
I don't know.

310
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,560
Why? You don't see him? Did you fight?

311
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,090
We broke up.

312
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,190
Why? Why did you break up?

313
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,270
Is Daebak seeing that other girl?

314
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,590
No. I'll tell you later.

315
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,390
Hobak,

316
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,560
my heart is still pounding.

317
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,930
Are you sure?

318
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,700
I asked Subak and she said it's true.

319
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,940
How could this happen?

320
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,290
This can't be.

321
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,860
Hobak.

322
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,830
We got lucky, didn't we?

323
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,290
I'm glad we signed the contract.

324
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,830
This is a good sign.

325
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,770
Right.

326
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,130
I felt so badly whenever I saw Gwangbak.

327
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,860
Just hold on for two more weeks.

328
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,040
What would you like?

329
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,390
What's going on here?

330
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,760
Hobak.

331
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,160
Minjung.

332
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,600
Sit. Sit down.

333
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,060
Hobak, let's sit down.

334
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,590
My hands are still shaking,

335
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,890
so I don't know where to even start.

336
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,670
I didn't believe it until now.

337
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,500
I was sure it was a  misunderstanding.

338
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,290
But now, I don't know what to say.

339
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,140
You divorced Subak because of her,

340
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,290
didn't you?

341
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,240
Hobak, let's discuss this next time.

342
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,090
There's no need.

343
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,560
It's all out in the open now.

344
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,040
I thought it was Subak's fault.

345
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,270
I really trusted you.

346
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,790
I trusted you, no matter what others said.

347
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,540
I'm sorry, but don't be so hard on him.

348
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,830
It's not his fault.

349
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,240
Don't you start.

350
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,360
I'm trying so hard not to lose my temper.

351
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,360
If it weren't for Gwangbak, I'd be screaming.

352
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,660
I'm trying to stay calm because of her.

353
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,560
Actually...

354
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,770
Aunt Sunjeong, how could you do this to me?

355
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,000
I respected you and I was grateful for you.

356
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:03,060
I relied on you after I got married.

357
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,060
I feel like I've been betrayed.

358
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,930
How...

359
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,570
She's my sister.

360
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,700
He's my brother in law.

361
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,590
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,460
You're sorry?

363
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,560
Do you know how my sister is doing?

364
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,330
Do you know what happened to my parents?

365
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,660
My parents can't sleep at night.

366
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,300
It's not her fault.

367
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,470
You know nothing, so stop this.

368
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,060
- Let's go.
- You can't go like this.

369
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,970
What's wrong is wrong.

370
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,970
Had I known, I would've done something.

371
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,700
I fell for his lies and blamed my sister.

372
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,640
You're mistaken if you think you'll be happy.

373
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,630
It's not too late yet so end it.

374
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,960
Didn't you feel guilty to see me?

375
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,640
You didn't feel guilty?

376
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,390
You're too brazen. I'm shocked.

377
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,990
I'm shocked you could smile at me every day.

378
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,170
Gwangbak, that's too harsh.

379
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,800
She didn't do anything wrong.

380
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,660
It's not like what you think.

381
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,500
Don't side with her.

382
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,270
What you two did is a sin.

383
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,770
You should have nothing to say!

384
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,200
But what about Miho?

385
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,500
Don't you feel ashamed?

386
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,540
She broke up with Daebak.

387
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,590
How could you break her heart like this?

388
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,770
Gwangbak!

389
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,970
I'm disappointed in you, Minjung.

390
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,500
No, I feel betrayed.

391
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,500
You and I know what happened.

392
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,590
How could you stab me in the back?

393
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,430
You fooled Subak.
You fooled everyone.

394
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,900
I never did anything to deserve this.

395
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,960
Be honest.

396
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,900
I am being honest.

397
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,290
You've been seeing her for a while.

398
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,770
We were friends, but we didn't keep in touch.

399
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,360
She looked after your father.

400
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,960
I had no choice so she did me a favor.

401
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,830
I couldn't hire a caregiver,

402
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,290
and Subak refused to do it.

403
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,830
So I had no other choice.

404
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,240
I never did anything wrong.

405
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,060
Believe me.

406
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,240
How can we?

407
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,240
You divorced Subak and you're marrying her.

408
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,470
I don't want to continue arguing.

409
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,770
I don't know how to explain this,

410
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,200
and I don't feel the need to.

411
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,270
I'm leaving.

412
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,870
I'm sorry.

413
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm so sorry.

414
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,670
I'm sorry

415
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,970
I put you through that.

416
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,270
What did you do all day?

417
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,060
I've been to places.

418
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,770
Whenever I didn't feel like going to work,

419
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,200
I wished I could sleep all day.

420
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:49,270
I wished I had nothing to do but hang out.

421
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,590
But having a job is a precious thing.

422
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,930
One never knows unless he loses it.

423
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,200
That's because we're fools.

424
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,560
The media's been talking about how people live to be 100,

425
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,790
but I never paid attention.

426
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,690
I regret not preparing for this.

427
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,330
What am I going to do until I'm 100?

428
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,460
I envy you so much.

429
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,090
How about working as a security guard?

430
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,000
Security guard?

431
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,740
I know someone who owns a small building,

432
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,290
and she needs someone to maintain it.

433
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,860
It'll give you a place to go every day.

434
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,060
You can think about what to do there.

435
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,470
I'm sorry.

436
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,000
I know you've never done anything like it.

437
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,470
I said that out of frustration.

438
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,860
I'm home.

439
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,500
You're home?

440
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,270
- Hello.
- You're home.

441
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,540
Hi.

442
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:11,060
I wanted to be the first to greet him.

443
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,860
Go ahead, Yeongdal.

444
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,190
You're home?

445
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,390
Did you have a drink?

446
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,040
Yes.

447
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,540
You've been drinking every day.

448
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,130
You should quit drinking.

449
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,590
How can you drink at a time like this?

450
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,040
We must make money and buy a house.

451
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,890
I know.

452
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,790
You're right.

453
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,440
Isn't this too hard for you?

454
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,640
When I'm with Don, everything is fun.

455
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,730
You should join us.

456
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,590
He can't do stuff like this.

457
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,270
Why not?

458
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,090
I can do it.

459
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,290
Don,

460
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,360
doing this on a winder night, eating snacks,

461
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,960
is really fun.

462
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,130
Losing a house is making us do weird things.

463
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,490
I know.

464
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,590
Subak, thanks!

465
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,660
That rude little girl!

466
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,740
I'll have to teach her a lesson.

467
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,330
Where's Bong?

468
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,060
Is he sick?

469
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,930
Honey, aren't you having breakfast?

470
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,370
Why aren't you getting up?

471
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,270
Bong, are you sick? Huh?

472
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,590
No. I just feel sleepy.

473
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,830
Oh, boy.

474
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,690
Why are you sleepy all of a sudden?

475
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,870
You always wake up early.

476
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,460
Bong, if you're sick, let's go see a doctor.

477
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,370
The breadwinner can't be sick.

478
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,890
What's going on?

479
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,830
Why don't you get up?

480
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,290
Everyone's here, worried about you.

481
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,590
If you're sick, say it.

482
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,770
- Oh, boy.
- Leave me alone! Please!

483
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,830
Let me sleep.

484
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,630
I could sleep in.
Whats wrong with that?

485
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,270
I...

486
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,630
Why are you screaming when we're worried?

487
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,540
If I'm sick, I'm sick.

488
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,090
I don't have the right to be sick?

489
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,060
Fine! Be sick if you want to be sick.

490
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,200
I can't believe my ears.

491
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,900
All my life, I lived like clockwork,

492
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,630
so I'm trying to sleep in and be sick.

493
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,960
What's the problem?

494
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,400
Bong, is something wrong?

495
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,560
No. There's nothing wrong.

496
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,040
I'm going to work. I am.

497
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,270
Oh...

498
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,330
[Provisional Attachment of Property Notice]

499
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,400
You'll do it?

500
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,590
I can't say no to anything right now.

501
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,430
I don't know why I hesitated.

502
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,900
I still have a lot to learn, I guess.

503
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,360
Who cares if I was a vice principal?

504
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,190
I care.

505
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:14,590
You've always been a teacher, so I know!

506
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,290
But you are a bigger man.

507
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,240
Others would be so conflicted.

508
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,060
Men have a hard time after they retire.

509
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,430
Jangbi,

510
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,900
I only want one thing.

511
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,330
Before I die, I want to

512
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,090
put my name up on my own house again.

513
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,760
Will that day come again?

514
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,740
Haebak and Daebak.

515
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,170
I have to take care of those two,

516
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,590
and to think about moving from

517
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,560
one place to another, at my old age...

518
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,900
Isn't he too old?

519
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,890
Don't judge him by his looks.

520
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,690
He's a meticulous man.

521
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,740
He retired from being a vice principal.

522
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,240
I only care if he'll be a good security guard.

523
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,090
Excuse me.

524
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,970
Yes, yes.

525
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,830
Competition in this field is high.

526
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,740
Everyone wants to do this.

527
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,240
I know. Thank you.

528
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,060
I'll do my best.

529
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,770
Please keep the entrance clean at all time,

530
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,590
and you must clean the restrooms, too.

531
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,130
You never said that!

532
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,630
It comes with the job.

533
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,270
Can you start right away?

534
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,060
Yes, yes, I can.

535
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,100
Hello.

536
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,130
I called because I think we must meet.

537
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,730
There's no need.

538
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,090
I answered to tell you not to call again.

539
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,660
I won't answer when you call.

540
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,940
I'm hanging up.

541
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,370
Excuse me,

542
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,360
I'm older than you, so listen to me.

543
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,390
Why can't you see me?

544
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,560
Did you do something wrong?

545
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,360
No, I didn't.

546
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,230
It's not like we'll never see each other.

547
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,970
Because of Gwangbak and Sangnam,

548
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,440
we because in laws, so don't do this.

549
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,100
We have to meet, eventually.

550
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,130
I'm sorry.

551
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,890
I know what you're going to say,

552
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,890
but I have nothing to tell you,

553
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,890
and to be honest, I don't want to see you.

554
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,540
Are you psychic/

555
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,890
How do you know what I'll say?

556
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,860
When an older person asks you to meet...

557
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,290
I'm sorry, but I'm hanging up.

558
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,590
Hey! How dare you!

559
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,470
What's wrong with her?

560
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,000
Excuse me.

561
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,360
I know you're uncomfortable.

562
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,130
Just hold on a few more days.

563
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,330
And I'll tell Sangnam.

564
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,090
They were selling shepherd's purse.

565
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,500
I'll make soy bean paste soup with it.

566
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,590
That sounds delicious.

567
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,270
My mouth is already watering.

568
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,830
Try smiling. We should.

569
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,040
You and I both know what really happened.

570
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,800
Aeji's grandmother called.

571
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,070
Again?

572
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,040
I told her I'm not going to meet her.

573
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,440
Was that a mistake?

574
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,470
No, you did the right thing.
No need to meet her.

575
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,000
If she calls again, don't answer it.

576
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,940
You know what she'll say.

577
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,670
I have nothing to say to her,

578
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,940
outside letting her beat me up.

579
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,360
I feel guilty.

580
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,830
Don't be.

581
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,340
Why should you?

582
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,000
Go, Minjung. Isn't it Jungji's first birthday?

583
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,090
Yes. I'll be back.

584
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,000
One, two, three!

585
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,190
I'm here.

586
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,930
Hi.

587
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,300
Welcome, Minjung.

588
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,200
- Welcome.
- Dad!

589
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,540
Hi, Aeji.

590
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,540
Oh, Jungji.

591
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,800
Happy first birthday.

592
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:31,170
Now that both parents are here,

593
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:36,270
let's start Ko Jungji's first birthday party!

594
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,860
I've always been paid to host these events.

595
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,690
Sedal, do it for free, for me. Start.

596
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,130
Let's see him choose his future career.

597
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,690
Let's see what he'll become!

598
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:56,770
Time to find out what Jungji will become!

599
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,590
Jungji, grab one! Go!

600
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,670
He picked up the spoon!

601
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,800
That means he won't go hungry!

602
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,740
Good, good!

603
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,390
That's not enough. He should be successful.

604
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,440
Not going hungry is the best!

605
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,670
Maybe he'll run a really big restaurant.

606
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,590
- Take some pictures, Don.
- Okay.

607
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,330
Let's start with Subak's family.

608
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,340
Yes, you should.

609
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,560
- Get closer.
- Closer, closer.

610
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,440
One, two, three!

611
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,090
She's moving out?

612
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,230
She doesn't want to run into me,

613
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,090
so she's getting a room or something.

614
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,400
She'll tell Sangnam later.

615
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,590
She'll try to defend herself.

616
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,460
What happens when Sangnam's father finds out?

617
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,090
He'll hate me.

618
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,060
He loves her to death.

619
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,470
Even so,

620
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,790
he wouldn't side with her.

621
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,840
Oh, who knows?

622
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,500
People put their family first.

623
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,500
I was on Minjung's side,

624
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,190
but now I'm on Subak's side.

625
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,090
We thought everything was Subak's fault.

626
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,000
Minjung is a really bad person.

627
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,730
I didn't want to see him when he came in.

628
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,130
Oh, I can't believe I feel this way.

629
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,540
I'll be going.

630
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:38,000
Why can't you play with the kids more?

631
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,070
I have to go to work.

632
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,470
Aeji, I have to go.

633
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,160
Dad, bye.

634
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,340
- Tell him to come again.
- Come again.

635
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,940
I will.

636
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,070
Jungji, happy birthday.

637
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,900
Daddy has to go.

638
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,200
Can I talk to you?

639
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,770
Bye.

640
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,400
- Bye, Minjung.
- Goodbye.

641
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,960
This is for Jungji's party.

642
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,930
Take it.

643
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,890
Can we go somewhere and talk?

644
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,940
What's there to talk about?

645
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,700
I'm sorry.

646
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,540
For our kids' sake...

647
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,070
Hold on, please.

648
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,240
Let's go somewhere and talk.

649
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,700
It's too late.

650
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,770
I'm leaving.

651
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,690
Subak,

652
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,540
don't even come back again.

653
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,360
If I want to see the kids, I'll come.

654
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,830
So don't come here anymore.

655
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,240
I'll be back.

656
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,890
Why did you let him go?

657
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,000
Why didn't you ask him to talk to you?

658
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,540
Go after him.

659
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,730
Stop it, mom.

660
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,890
If I don't go to work, I'll get fired.

661
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,000
He told me not to be late.

662
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,730
What if you lose Minjung for good?

663
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,060
There's something you don't know.

664
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,870
Now he's visiting to see the kids,

665
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,090
but when he moves in with her, he won't.

666
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,670
He won't want to upset her so he won't see the kids!

667
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,540
What do you want me to do?

668
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,960
I'm sick, so stop pressuring me.

669
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,160
He doesn't want me, so I can't do anything!

670
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,090
Give up. You should give up.

671
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,090
Then what about your kids?

672
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,130
Can you raise them alone?

673
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,560
I will. I can do it.

674
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,300
How can you, when you have no money?

675
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,340
Tell me what you plan to do.

676
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,370
I don't know! I don't!

677
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,690
What's wrong?

678
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,960
Why are you screaming?

679
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,500
How can we help it?

680
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,540
Minjung is awful.

681
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,800
He won't even talk to me now.

682
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,190
How can he change overnight?

683
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,540
He doesn't care about us anymore.

684
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,000
And Subak here is sick.
I can't take this!

685
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,440
He's not family anymore.

686
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,070
Don't expect anything from him.

687
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,540
Father!

688
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,840
Help me.

689
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,640
Please help me.

690
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,560
Oh, when did you get here?

691
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,900
Why didn't you call?

692
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,800
Can we get a drink?

693
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:40,770
Including me, everyone in the family wants you back.

694
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,900
I'm sorry.

695
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,590
It's over.

696
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,470
I know, I do.

697
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,870
You already submitted the papers.

698
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,970
Why wouldn't we want you back?

699
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:05,270
My wife keeps calling you because of that,

700
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,400
and I want to hold on to you, too.

701
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,590
But all we can do is wait.

702
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,940
Minjung,

703
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,200
can you reconsider all this?

704
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,860
I'm begging you.

705
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,860
You should think about the kids.

706
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:31,060
It's better for their mom to raise them.

707
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,770
I'm sure you don't want to see her now,

708
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,900
but it'll pass with time.

709
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,540
That's what being married is like.

710
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,270
Look at Hobak's family.

711
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,400
They are doing okay now.

712
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,360
I'm sorry.

713
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,070
I'm sorry about many things.

714
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,200
But I can't go back.

715
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,160
I'm having a hard time because of that.

716
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,300
But it's harder for Subak.

717
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:06,000
You're meeting someone new,

718
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,400
but Subak was dumped.

719
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,140
You saw her.

720
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,170
She looks awful now.

721
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,360
Can I ask you something?

722
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:24,040
I heard the woman you're seeing now

723
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,770
is Sangnam's aunt. Is that true?

724
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,500
Yes.

725
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,190
And you knew her from before?

726
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,830
Yes.

727
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:44,500
I'm not very happy about that.

728
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:47,440
You said there was no reason when you

729
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,970
divorced my daughter, but that was a lie.

730
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:50,860
That's not true.

731
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,290
I know.

732
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,670
You're not that kind of man.

733
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,170
I believed that.

734
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,970
You told us she was a caregiver and had her take care of your father.

735
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,630
You knew her before you got married?

736
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:13,140
Does your father know about her?

737
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,730
No, he doesn't.

738
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm disappointed in you.
I feel betrayed.

739
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:24,000
How could you do this to me?

740
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,960
How could you deceive your father...

741
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:30,690
Was that why you divorced Subak?

742
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,460
I swear it didn't happen like that.

743
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,590
Subak was...

744
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,440
What did Subak do?

745
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:38,770
Tell me.

746
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,230
It's nothing.

747
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:49,240
But I didn't cause the divorce.

748
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,770
You're truly awful!

749
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,960
You're still blaming Subak?

750
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,930
This is fraud.

751
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,940
I didn't know your true colors.

752
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,840
I was mistaken.

753
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,170
Father.

754
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,830
Have a seat.

755
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,470
I just need to mop the floor.

756
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:23,240
I just saw Minjung.

757
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,300
Have a seat.

758
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,500
Subak.

759
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,000
Yes, father.

760
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,590
I think we need to let him go.

761
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,670
The divorce became official long ago,

762
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,340
but we were all holding onto him.

763
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:57,500
Let's let him go.

764
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,400
Whatever the reason.

765
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,790
Let's do that, okay?

766
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:08,500
Father,

767
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,240
I think I was immature.

768
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:19,900
I regret the way I lived before.

769
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,690
There's no one like Minjung.

770
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,060
I'm so sad,

771
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,640
and I miss him so much.

772
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,790
But...

773
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:36,000
I was so bad to him, so I can't ask him back.

774
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,800
I'm going crazy.

775
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,830
"I did this for you."

776
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:48,140
"I was so good to you."

777
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:53,860
"So you can't leave me."

778
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:57,290
I can't even say any of that.

779
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:03,460
I never cooked for him,

780
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:07,230
and I never did his laundry.

781
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:12,330
I hate myself for that.

782
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:16,970
Bringing up the past will only make you sad.

783
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,540
What about the kids?

784
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,000
I'm going to raise them.

785
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,190
All I have left are the kids,

786
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,860
so I can't give them to him.

787
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:31,940
But you don't have the means to.

788
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,430
Even if you got child support,

789
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:38,940
will Minjung give them to you?

790
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:43,170
Didn't you give him sole custody?

791
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,800
I'm going to get it back.

792
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:48,270
He can have more kids when he remarries,

793
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,400
but it's different for me.

794
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,940
I gave birth to them.

795
00:47:54,950 --> 00:48:00,440
I want to raise them.

796
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:03,300
Father, help me with that.

797
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:18,270
How come you're coming home together?

798
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,590
We were talking.

799
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,170
Talking about what?

800
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,800
To let Minjung go.

801
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,590
Are you crazy?

802
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,860
I can't! I won't!
I won't let him go.

803
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:34,500
Did you marry him?
Let him go.

804
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:37,300
I know how you feel, but it's too much.

805
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,070
I'm too much?

806
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,970
They say you can never really know someone,

807
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,890
but I never knew Minjung would do this.

808
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:48,200
How devious of him!

809
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,590
He had an ulterior motive,

810
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,900
and we well for that.

811
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:54,130
Don't call him names.

812
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,670
It just wasn't meant to be.

813
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,670
Subak's innocent.
How can I just sit here?

814
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,590
Honey, isn't there some law against this?

815
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,330
Ask if we can nullify the divorce.

816
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,470
How can you just sit here, doing nothing?

817
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:12,330
What's the use of holding onto him?

818
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,170
Watch me! 
I'm not letting him do this!

819
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,570
Because this is unfair!

820
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,370
Salla,

821
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:22,630
I rented this whole place just for you.

822
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,090
Stop.

823
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,270
One, two.

824
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:37,070
One, two, three.

825
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,940
Oh!

826
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,770
Mommy!

827
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,870
Can you wrap up?
I'm leaving now.

828
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,940
Okay. Have a good evening.

829
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:53,900
Thanks.

830
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,170
Tada!

831
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,770
What are you doing here?

832
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:06,200
Hobak, let's do something real naughty.

833
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,770
Don't waste money on stuff like this.

834
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,300
I didn't use the living allowance.

835
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,540
I saved money by clipping coupons.

836
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,090
Tell me what you want to eat.

837
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,790
Let's grab some late-night snacks.

838
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,960
Is there a 24 hour barbecue place?

839
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,160
Of course.

840
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,670
Where else would I use my inheritance?

841
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,000
You got inheritance?

842
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:29,230
Sell me and use the money.

843
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,460
- Ugh!
- Oh!

844
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,440
Let's go. Let's go.

845
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,270
Make me a wrap.

846
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,690
Okay.

847
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,660
Hold on, my lady.

848
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,270
Here.

849
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,560
Man.

850
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,040
You must have been really hungry.

851
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,070
It's good.

852
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:03,300
I'm not the one eating.
It's for the baby.

853
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,840
"Crying Out Love, In the Center of the World."

854
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:09,670
Crying out baby, at a barbecue pork place.

855
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,370
Excuse me,

856
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,690
my wife is having a baby. It's our third kid.

857
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,540
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

858
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,730
Thank you.

859
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,040
Hello,

860
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:24,440
my wife's pregnant with our third kid.

861
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:26,770
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

862
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,730
Thank you.

863
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,470
What's wrong with you?

864
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:36,270
I won't tell my family or your family.

865
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,270
It's all gone?

866
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,270
Huh?

867
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,900
Can we get 2 more portions of pork?

868
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:45,240
My wife's eating for 2.

869
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,770
Please.

870
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,940
I'm so happy.

871
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:55,000
I'm so glad you're happy.

872
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,970
We should wait until it warms up, right?

873
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:02,630
- For what?
- Our wedding.

874
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,400
I'm not interested in getting married.

875
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,040
What did you say?

876
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:09,300
I don't want to get married.

877
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:10,840
You fraud!

878
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,970
You were playing with my heart?

879
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,040
Man!

880
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,090
I never did. What did I do?

881
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,540
Why didn't she let me finish?

882
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:23,590
Salla! Salla! Salla!

883
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,170
Salla! Ouch!

884
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,360
Salla!

885
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:31,060
So that's why it felt so awkward.

886
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,800
I never expected that from Minjung.

887
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,440
Maybe that's not the whole story.

888
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:39,070
I have a feeling he didn't.

889
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,970
Maybe he did it to get back at Subak.

890
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:46,460
Oh... If he just met her, maybe.

891
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:49,230
But he's known her for a long time.

892
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,390
They fooled the whole family.

893
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,300
And she even took care of his father.

894
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,470
Oh, it's giving me a headache.

895
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:57,160
That's their family's problem.

896
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,170
You focus on our baby.

897
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,940
How am I going to raise this baby?

898
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:08,500
I thought things were getting better...

899
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,230
I'll raise the baby.

900
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,000
I've been studying, reading books.

901
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:16,090
Giving birth is serious business.

902
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:19,690
You worked all through your pregnancies,

903
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,130
and I feel so sad when I think of that.

904
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:24,240
So you know it's hard?

905
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,830
Why wouldn't I?

906
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,840
I feel guilty.

907
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:31,400
When you had Sintong, I ran away, scared.

908
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:34,570
When you had Bangtong, I wasn't happy.

909
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:38,570
I thought you ruined my life.

910
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,800
I was so immature.

911
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:43,070
I thought the kids were a burden.

912
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,840
I didn't know how precious they were.

913
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,570
I never bought you anything yummy to eat.

914
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,770
I only caused misery for you.

915
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:53,900
Hobak, you should relax and enjoy your life.

916
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:56,540
I'll make it up to you.

917
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,670
I'm serious.

918
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:07,270
I heard women want to be treasured when they are pregnant, and I'll treasure you.

919
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,860
If you want anything done, just ask.

920
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,790
Do you mean it?

921
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:14,270
I do! Why don't you test me out?

922
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,360
Strawberries?

923
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:18,770
I want strawberries.

924
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,800
Okay, strawberries it is!

925
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:27,000
Little darling, hold on.
Daddy will be back.

926
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,130
Salla, hold on.
Just listen to me.

927
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,590
Stop following me.

928
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,430
Let's talk.

929
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:44,770
I have nothing to say.

930
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,270
Why do you always jump to conclusions?

931
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:51,130
You don't want to marry me?
After proposing?

932
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,770
I was going to say that was how I felt before.

933
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,790
Come with me.

934
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:24,540
Man...

935
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,330
Yes.

936
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:28,270
Bong comes out whenever we do this.

937
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,590
Ugh, you should be more careful.

938
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,900
There are other people living here.

939
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:34,570
We didn't do that, you know?

940
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,840
Oh, Anggeum, stop lying!

941
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:40,340
Mom, you were in there?
You saw us?

942
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:41,440
Oh, no!

943
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:42,470
Of course, I did.

944
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:44,460
I didn't want to come out and disturb you.

945
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:46,500
My butt is all frozen now.

946
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,430
Anggeum, you were pretty affectionate.

947
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:54,740
You dragged Bong into the shed and outside.

948
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,860
When? I never even kissed him.

949
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:01,170
Then how did you have 5 children?

950
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,040
Anggeum, you're so cheeky.

951
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:06,900
Bong, did you like kissing Anggeum?

952
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,670
Huh? Well, I...

953
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,240
Answer her.
She's asking if you liked it.

954
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,190
Yes, yes, I liked it.

955
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,230
I actually loved it.

956
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,630
Mother, I'm going to work.

957
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,290
- Yes, see you later.
- Have a nice day.

958
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,290
Hello.

959
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,930
Hello.

960
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:43,130
Yes, manager.

961
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,590
Okay. I'll be right there.

962
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:57,700
What's going on?

963
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,860
We need you at the factory.

964
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,190
Yes, mother.

965
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,790
Minjung, something awful has happened.

966
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,700
Jungji is burning up.

967
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,160
But there's no one home!

968
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,630
Jungji's sick?

969
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,500
Okay, I'll be right there.

970
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,690
I'm sorry, you go first.
I'll come later.

971
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:20,400
But this is really urgent...

972
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:22,200
Please take care of it.

973
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,630
Jungji!

974
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:33,240
Jungji!

975
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,230
You're here already?

976
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,630
Let's go to the hospital. 
The car's ready.

977
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,060
Oh, he's fine now.

978
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,500
He was burning up before.

979
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,940
He was burning up?

980
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:50,440
The fever broke now that you're here.

981
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:54,690
Minjung, go.

982
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,660
Don't come even if my mom calls.

983
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,000
Why not?

984
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:03,360
Jungji's better, so take Subak out.

985
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,860
I have to go to the factory.

986
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:09,230
Take Subak out for a drive.

987
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,540
Mom, what's wrong with you?

988
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:13,570
Don't beg.

989
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,400
My kids aren't bait.

990
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:18,700
And don't call him when he's working.

991
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,040
I don't like it when you do this.

992
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:22,960
You're driving me mad!

993
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,330
I can't believe her!

994
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:27,440
I'm doing this for you!

995
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,190
Mother, please stop this.

996
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,000
I was needed at the factory, but I came here.

997
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:39,070
Why did you lie to me?

998
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,190
You lied to me first.

999
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,960
Didn't you fool Subak first?

1000
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,590
I can't watch you getting remarried.

1001
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,390
You got divorced because of that other woman, didn't you?

1002
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,040
What did Subak ever do?

1003
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,840
It's over now.

1004
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:57,640
I'm not going to let you push me around.

1005
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,590
I'm taking the kids this weekend.

1006
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,500
That's that.

1007
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,730
You can't take the kids!

1008
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,400
How can you do this to me?

1009
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:10,440
I'm taking you to court!

1010
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,800
Fine. Do whatever you want.

1011
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,340
Do whatever I want?

1012
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:17,360
After ruining my daughter's life?

1013
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:19,400
How can you dump her after cheating?

1014
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:22,400
How dare you have the audacity to walk around with your head held up high?

1015
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,040
Please stop this.

1016
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:26,400
I'm taking you to court.

1017
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:28,770
You don't deserve any mercy!

1018
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,770
Fine, take me to court!

1019
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:31,770
What?

1020
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:35,770
Okay. Let's go to the police.

1021
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,940
You should be in prison!

1022
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,970
I won't let you get away with this.

1023
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:42,930
I was good to you! 
How could you!

1024
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:47,000
How could you stab us in the back?

1025
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:48,570
Please!

1026
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:53,860
I wasn't going to say this,

1027
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:56,900
but do you know why I got a divorce?

1028
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:59,340
It was because of Subak.

1029
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:01,600
Subak

1030
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:05,540
had an affair with that company's president.

1031
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,700
What?

1032
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:15,440
I wasn't going to submit the divorce papers.

1033
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,770
For the kids, I didn't want to,

1034
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:23,040
I thought I should let it pass.

1035
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:28,940
But when I found out that she lived with a man in college,

1036
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:30,840
I couldn't handle it anymore.

1037
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:32,800
That's why I got a divorce!

1038
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,440
Thank you. Please come back.

1039
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:40,670
Goodbye.

1040
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,790
It was you! Wasn't it?

1041
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:48,340
- What?
- You told Minjung, didn't you?

1042
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,400
Mom, let's not do this here.

1043
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,230
What's going on?

1044
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,560
What are you going to do about Subak?

1045
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:00,370
Minjung knew about it all along.

1046
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,270
Oh, no.

1047
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,840
Subak cheated on him?
Did she?

1048
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,400
- Oh...
- Mom!

1049
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:34,360
Where were you?

1050
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:37,060
Minjung took the kids.

1051
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,500
He took them all saying he'll raise them.

1052
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:41,670
What?

1053
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,840
Oh...

1054
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:49,460
Mom! What was grandmother saying?

1055
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,590
Minjung took the kids!

1056
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,170
He took the kids!

1057
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,400
What?

1058
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:00,900
Mom!

1060
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,970
Don't touch me.

1061
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,890
I've completely lost my mind!

1062
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,270
You're scaring the kids.

1063
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,940
I'm taking my own kids, so shut up!

1064
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,470
They are Minjung's kids, too.

1065
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:31,500
What are you doing?

1066
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:32,570
Bring the kids out.

1067
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:33,740
She wants them back?

1068
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,930
Mother's still young.
She should remarry.

1069
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:37,770
Please don't talk about my mom.

1070
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,800
If I talk, you're dead.

1071
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:42,970
You want me to beat you up?

1072
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,500
What did you do with your New Year's bonus?

1073
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,900
You're giving money to your in laws now?

1074
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:51,170
I'll be grateful for the rest of my life.

1075
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,770
Please don't come to me again.
