1
00:00:39,597 --> 00:00:41,232
It's cold.

2
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:43,100
Where did you go?

3
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,538
Go back to sleep.
I didn't go out to meet women.
Don't worry.

4
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:51,041
Just try it.

5
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,611
Oppa, I want to go to the toilet.

6
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:55,713
Toilet?

7
00:01:07,158 --> 00:01:08,793
Oppa, don't go.
Stay here.

8
00:01:08,793 --> 00:01:09,493
Okay.

9
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:10,428
You must stay here.

10
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:12,530
Yeah.

11
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:15,800
Oppa!

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,668
Yeah.

13
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:19,303
Are you there?

14
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:22,339
Don't worry. Hurry up.

15
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:23,507
Oppa!

16
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:25,142
I said I'm here.

17
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:28,179
Don't go. 
I'm scared.

18
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:31,682
Don't worry. I won't go.
I won't.

19
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,134
Scared me to death.

20
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:51,768
Brother-in-law.

21
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:53,637
Yeah.

22
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:55,039
What are you doing?

23
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,374
Yeong Dal said she's scared.

24
00:01:57,374 --> 00:02:02,279
Wow. It's not a public toilet.
It's just in the yard.
What's so scary?

25
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:05,082
She doesn't know how to be embarrassed.

26
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,388
Oppa! Oppa, are you there?

27
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:13,491
Oppa!

28
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:34,979
Oppa!

29
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:37,548
I'm not oppa.

30
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:39,416
Is it ajubeonim?
(Elder brother-in-law)

31
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,453
I'm scared.
Wait there for me.

32
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,489
What? 
Yes, yes, yes.

33
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:48,526
Ajubeonim!

34
00:02:48,526 --> 00:02:49,927
Yeah.

35
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:52,730
I thought you left.

36
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,299
I won't leave.

37
00:02:58,102 --> 00:03:00,204
Is someone in there?

38
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:01,605
Sister-in-law.

39
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:03,007
She's still in there?

40
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:05,576
How long has she been there?

41
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:10,481
Hey!
Hurry up and come out.

42
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,751
Consider the person waiting for you.

43
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:15,386
Leave her alone.

44
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:17,955
There are plenty of busy people.
She should hurry up.

45
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:20,758
She is like that occupying position how can?

46
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:22,626
Wait a while longer.

47
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:25,196
She's so tactless.

48
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:27,765
Hurry, come out.

49
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,305
Ajubeonim, are you there?

50
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:36,173
Yes, Sister-in-law.

51
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:38,042
There's no toilet paper here.

52
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:40,377
Please get one for me.

53
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:42,947
Yeah. Yeah.

54
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:49,253
Yah. Yah.

55
00:03:57,428 --> 00:04:00,698
Sister-in-law, toilet paper.

56
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:09,106
Did you sleep well, Mother?

57
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:14,945
Perhaps because we changed house,
I kept having nightmares.

58
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:19,150
You can't rush me.
I'm already suffering from constipation.

59
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,485
Oh my.

60
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,989
Mo-Mo-Mother.

61
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:44,842
Don't do this.

62
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:48,112
Go and submit your application again, Judge.

63
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:49,280
Mom.

64
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,615
You saw how we are, right?

65
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:53,951
You're the only one who can save us.

66
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:56,053
We don't have money to apply again.

67
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:58,622
Even I starve myself to death,
I will support you.

68
00:04:58,622 --> 00:04:59,790
Go and study again.

69
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,527
If you don't want to see me die.

70
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:10,534
It's too narrow, can't open my arms.
It's stuffy.

71
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:14,505
This reminds of the hardship 
when I was a refugee.

72
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:18,943
Back then, there were no tables,
we just spread the newspapers and ate.

73
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,512
The bathroom is the problem.

74
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:26,650
My buttocks were freezing until
it felt like it was going to split.

75
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,453
I thought my buttocks were going to fall off.

76
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:32,022
My buttocks were freezing too.
Ajubeonim, your buttocks were freezing too?

77
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:35,760
What? Yeah.

78
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,730
Oh, yes. Since your an elder,
 I should address it with a "Sir".

79
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,599
Buttocks, sir.

80
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:42,767
No?

81
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:45,336
We should set an order in using the bathroom.

82
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:46,737
This won't do.
I'm so busy in the morning.

83
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:49,774
And someone just hogged 
the bathroom for a few hours.

84
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:52,810
Next time, those who are leaving 
in the morning will use it first.

85
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,146
Those who are not going out will go later.

86
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,182
He ran all the way to school
just to use the toilet.

87
00:05:58,182 --> 00:06:00,284
It's good exercise.

88
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:04,722
You ran all the way there because you had to go.
Is that what you call exercise?

89
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:07,291
Father, Uncle and Dae Bak 
should use it earlier.

90
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,860
The rest of us can take it slowly.

91
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,962
Then she will use it in my stead.

92
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:13,597
I can endure it.

93
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:15,466
Sister-in-law is pregnant.

94
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:17,334
She will get all the convenience.

95
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:18,969
She's number 1, no matter what.

96
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:20,838
Ajubeonim is the best.

97
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:25,042
Hey, we're eating.
Let's stop talking about toilet.

98
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:26,677
Oh my god!

99
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,713
What's wrong? What's wrong?

100
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:32,283
I killed a few yesterday.

101
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:34,385
There's a lot of them.

102
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:37,655
You should practice to catch them.
What's so scary?

103
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:41,392
I can't do that.
Are you going to eat with that hand?

104
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:44,195
Go and wash it.

105
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,632
But Su Bak's not eating breakfast?
Is she on a diet?

106
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:50,267
Don't give her food.

107
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,902
Did she do something good?
Why feed her?

108
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:54,705
Look at her.
She's still sleeping.

109
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,873
She doesn't even show her face.

110
00:06:55,873 --> 00:07:01,712
That girl has a long way to go before 
she comes to her senses.

111
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:05,449
Maybe she's too shy to show her face
because she's sorry.

112
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:10,121
I'm going to wash my hands.

113
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:24,135
Hye Bak, bring this to her.

114
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:27,638
Give it to me.
Aunt will bring it to her.

115
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,112
Su Bak is not here.

116
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:37,681
No?

117
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,119
She's not here either.

118
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:44,688
Where did she go this early in the morning?

119
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:47,258
Come to think of it,
I don't think I saw her this morning.

120
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,426
Me, too.

121
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,929
We were sleeping together in one room last night.

122
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,542
Mom.

123
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:08,746
This.
Her bag is not around either.

124
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:14,819
<i>Mom, sorry.
Father, forgive me.</i>

125
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,088
I left because I just can't stay 
at home any longer.

126
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:20,891
<i>I will earn plenty of money then come back.</i>

127
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:35,840
<i>Mom, I'm a really disappointing daughter.
I'm really sorry.</i>

128
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,277
<i>Please take care of Ae Ji and Jung Ji.</i>

129
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,416
<i>No matter what happens,
I will definitely get back the house.</i>

130
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,686
<i>I won't come back before that happens.</i>

131
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:52,423
<i>Mom, sorry.</i>

132
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:55,459
<i>Father, please forgive me.</i>

133
00:09:00,364 --> 00:09:04,101
She's crazy, crazy.

134
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:09,240
This girl really always worries people.
Always.

135
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,378
Where did she go?
Where can she go?

136
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:16,947
She doesn't even wash her own underwear.

137
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:21,385
She can't even take care of herself.
Where is she going to earn money?

138
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:25,122
She doesn't even have 10 000 Won.

139
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:27,925
What are we going to do, Husband?
What if something bad happens to her?

140
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:31,195
Don't cry. 
You're wasting tears.

141
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,231
She caused all this,
she should be punished.

142
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:37,735
She has to suffer somewhere 
in order to wake up.

143
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:38,669
She'll be 40 in 2 years,

144
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:41,939
and she can't even wash her underwear.
Is that worth showing off?

145
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:45,209
She has 4 limbs.
Why can't she earn a living?

146
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,545
This is all because of you.

147
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,347
She was already trembling with fear
because of what she did.

148
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:53,617
You still reprimanded her.
Would she be able to take it?

149
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:57,354
If something happens to Su Bak,
it will be your fault.

150
00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:58,522
What?

151
00:09:58,522 --> 00:10:03,427
Stop it, Mom.
I hope Su Bak will be all right.

152
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:07,398
She's really immature, 
for someone so old.

153
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:18,142
Are you leaving now?

154
00:10:18,142 --> 00:10:19,310
Yes.

155
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,178
Let's talk for a moment.

156
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:22,813
I have to go to the construction site.

157
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:24,448
You went there at dawn, didn't you?

158
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:27,251
I still have to go. 
Still must then go next transaction reside.

159
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,587
Sang Nam, sorry.

160
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,689
It was my fault.

161
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:35,192
I shouldn't treat Mother like that
but I unconsciously did it.

162
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:37,995
Sorry.
If I put myself in your shoes,

163
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:41,499
if you did that to my mom,
I would get mad.

164
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:44,068
I am really sorry.

165
00:10:53,644 --> 00:10:54,812
Eonni.

166
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:56,447
Can you talk for a moment?

167
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,315
Yes, I'm in my room.

168
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:00,885
Su Bak eonni left from home.

169
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:01,352
What?

170
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,921
She left a letter.

171
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:04,622
Do you have any idea 
where she might be??

172
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:07,658
I don't know either.

173
00:11:07,658 --> 00:11:09,293
What's wrong with her?

174
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,694
I know.

175
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:13,497
What's going to happen to her
running away in the state she's in?

176
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:15,132
She even left the kids here.

177
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,001
Because she's depressed.

178
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:18,869
They moved to that kind of house
because of her.

179
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,971
Will she feel comfortable?

180
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:25,876
She didn't even consider our parents.
This is really driving me crazy.

181
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:27,978
Where can she go?
Think about it.

182
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:29,847
Okay, Eonni.

183
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:40,124
Imagine how sad she must be.
Imagine how depressed she must be 
when she left the kids.

184
00:11:40,124 --> 00:11:44,328
They say 'Hate the crime but not the sinner'.

185
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:50,167
I wanted to kill her, but doing that
will give me a heart ache.

186
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:54,371
Can you think of any places
Su Bak might go to?

187
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:55,539
I don't know either.

188
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:58,109
Can't you think of any place?

189
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:00,911
I can't think of any.

190
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:04,181
Su Bak doesn't have good friend?

191
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,349
I don't know.

192
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:09,553
You've been married for several years,
and you don't know anything.

193
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:11,655
That's right.

194
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:16,794
With her pride,
she won't go to her friend's place.

195
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:19,830
I don't think she keeps in touch
with any of her friends recently.

196
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:26,837
Where can she be?
I'm worried that she might get other ideas on her head.

197
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:30,574
When you went bankrupt,
she wanted to die back then.

198
00:12:30,574 --> 00:12:34,779
According to the context of her letter,
I don't think she'll do that.
There are the children.

199
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:36,647
Trust her and just wait.

200
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:37,815
I'll come back after work.

201
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,019
Did Su Bak call you?

202
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,756
Don't worry too much.

203
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:48,559
Okay.

204
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:57,668
Hey, did you bring it?

205
00:12:57,668 --> 00:12:59,537
Hey, I can't because of that old man.

206
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:03,040
They rummage bags at the school entrance.
Where can I hide it?

207
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,011
How frustrating.
That old man's not going to another school?

208
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:09,113
I don't want to come to school
because I hate that old man.

209
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:10,981
I just forced myself to come
because of assembly.

210
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:14,251
Hey, that old man should be retiring soon, right?
He's quite old.

211
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,521
Why is that old man still loitering here?

212
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:22,893
What did you say just now?

213
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:24,295
Nothing much.

214
00:13:24,295 --> 00:13:25,930
We just said a few words about that old man.

215
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,565
Don't call him old man.

216
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:29,200
What about it?

217
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,535
You call him old man too.

218
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:35,973
Why? 
You're siding with him just because 
you share the same surname?

219
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:39,710
Really.

220
00:13:42,046 --> 00:13:44,148
Really.

221
00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:53,491
What are you doing?

222
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,446
Everyone can go except Wang Dae Bak.

223
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:30,861
Follow me.

224
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:39,036
Tell me the truth.

225
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:41,372
Why did you fight?

226
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:43,007
Just because.

227
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,875
Were you smoking?

228
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:52,817
You should also know...
That Father's really sad these days.

229
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:54,919
What am I going to do
if even you are like this?

230
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:57,955
You even fight now.

231
00:14:57,955 --> 00:15:01,225
Do you have the strength
to take on 3 boys?

232
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:04,261
Do you think I'll be happy
to see you take a beating?

233
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:05,896
Wait till you have your own kids later.

234
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:09,400
See if you'll be happy seeing 
your child being beaten up.

235
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,203
Did you do something wrong?

236
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,604
No.

237
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:14,772
What?

238
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:19,677
Even if I got beaten up,
I don't think I did anything wrong.

239
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:21,312
This child, till the end...

240
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:25,983
If they do that again,
I won't let them off.

241
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:30,888
What do you mean?

242
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,924
Please behave in school.

243
00:15:33,924 --> 00:15:36,494
I'm already ashamed to face the other students.

244
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:39,296
I feel guilty to face the other teachers too.

245
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:41,632
If they found out that you were my son,

246
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:42,566
they'd say that I couldn't 
even teach my own son.

247
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:47,238
How could I teach other students?
There'd be plenty of gossips.

248
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,975
If you keep doing this,
I'll tell them you're my son.

249
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:53,310
Don't do that, please.

250
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,179
So, listen to me.

251
00:15:58,682 --> 00:15:59,850
Go.

252
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:21,105
Are you Yeong Dal?
Do you keep in touch with Wang Su Bak?

253
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,740
Okay.

254
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:26,010
Yeah.

255
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,280
Oppa, can you talk right now?

256
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,382
I'm busy right now,
I'll call you later.

257
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,337
Husband, didn't I give you 30 000 yesterday?
Gone already?

258
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:54,972
How many times are you going 
to take that exam?

259
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,139
Just give up.

260
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:58,708
I'm already frustrated.

261
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,745
Why didn't you answer my calls?

262
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:04,314
Were you with that girl again?

263
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,818
If that happens, it's either you die or I die.

264
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,687
Let's talk later.

265
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:17,161
Hello, Team leader.

266
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,329
What's going on?

267
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,664
I thought about you while 
I was passing by so I came.

268
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,299
As if I'd believe that.

269
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:25,569
Why? 
Anything I can do for you?

270
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,139
You're really fast.

271
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:31,408
I want to work.
Is there any work you can give me?

272
00:17:31,408 --> 00:17:33,277
I heard you got married.

273
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:34,678
Your husband's unemployed?

274
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,547
It's not like that.

275
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:40,985
You even said that I'm supporting
an unemployed husband.

276
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:44,722
I have an appointment.
See you later.

277
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,327
Team leader. Just this time.

278
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:52,663
I need work.

279
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:54,064
You never thought you'd come 
and see me again?

280
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:57,802
You don't want to drink the water you spat.

281
00:17:57,802 --> 00:17:59,670
Take that bread with you.

282
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,706
Just that much.
Why did you have to bother?

283
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:27,932
Hello.

284
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:31,435
Why are you here?
You came to see your husband?

285
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:35,639
Yes. 
You don't visit us these days.

286
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:38,442
I'll just be a burden to you.

287
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:41,479
No.
Come and have dinner.

288
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:43,347
This is for you.

289
00:18:43,347 --> 00:18:47,318
Thank you. I will eat properly.

290
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:49,653
Sang Nam.
I'll be back later.

291
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:51,288
I have a meeting with President Gim.

292
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:53,858
Bye.

293
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:00,631
What?

294
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:02,967
Can't we have lunch together?

295
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,069
I have a prior appointment.

296
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:06,470
How could you come out of the blue?

297
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,105
I'm working.

298
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:25,856
Sorry.

299
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:28,659
Why are you apologizing?

300
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:29,593
Isn't she a college graduate?

301
00:19:29,593 --> 00:19:31,228
Her dad is also a head teacher.

302
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:34,732
Is that how her family taught her?

303
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:35,666
I'll talk to her.

304
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:39,170
It won't happen again.

305
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,505
I was treated like that 
by my daughter-in-law.

306
00:19:41,505 --> 00:19:45,009
I was too upset, I couldn't sleep.

307
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:46,644
I am her mother-in-law.

308
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,848
How could she glare at me like I was a stranger?

309
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:52,483
If she really loves and respects you,

310
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,585
this wouldn't happen.

311
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:56,220
Isn't it?

312
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:03,227
Men these days are too giving to their women.

313
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,096
Don't be like that.

314
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:09,533
I'm really afraid how'd she'd treat
your father in the future.

315
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,635
She is not that kind of person.

316
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:13,971
Is that written on the face?

317
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:15,606
You dated for just a short while.

318
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:18,876
You don't know her.

319
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:20,978
I'm fine.

320
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:26,584
For both your father's sake and yours,
I hope we can settle this properly.

321
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:29,854
I'll make her apologize to you.

322
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:33,824
I don't really want her to apologize to me.

323
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,831
Where did you go?

324
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,466
There's no one at home.

325
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:45,035
Where did everyone go?

326
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,371
I thought Aunt was at home.

327
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,174
Don't you kow that she went to cooking school?

328
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:52,743
Sorry.

329
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:55,312
I don't want this house to be empty all the time.

330
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:58,115
I don't like it, ever since before.

331
00:20:58,115 --> 00:21:01,619
If you have an appointment, 
ask my permission first before you go.
Why did you leave on your own?

332
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:04,188
Brother-in-law. Sorry.

333
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:06,757
Sister-in-law, teach her well.

334
00:21:06,757 --> 00:21:10,728
I have to scold her at each and everything.
It hurts my mouth.

335
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,436
Tell me if you're going to leave.

336
00:21:18,436 --> 00:21:21,472
That way, I'll just stay at home.

337
00:21:21,472 --> 00:21:23,107
I forgot.

338
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:23,808
I had something to do

339
00:21:23,808 --> 00:21:26,143
and I wanted to reconcile with Sang Nam too.

340
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:30,815
Be careful next time.

341
00:21:30,815 --> 00:21:32,917
Please don't cry again.

342
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,252
Crying is not a virtue.

343
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:39,924
Since you're already married, 
it's not good to keep crying.

344
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,559
Yes.

345
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:47,631
You don't have experience and training.

346
00:21:47,631 --> 00:21:49,967
There's nothing except for manual jobs.

347
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:51,135
What kind?

348
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,237
Cleaning or washing the dishes.

349
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:56,273
I can't also make introductions randomly for these.

350
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,945
You must confirm your identity
and a health certificate is needed.

351
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:05,149
Have you done any housekeeping or nannying jobs?

352
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:07,718
I'll do anything you want me to do.

353
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:09,587
If you don't do well,

354
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:14,024
we'll get criticized.

355
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:18,929
Since you're pretty, how about working in
a karaoke lounge or try waitressing?

356
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:21,031
I don't want to do those.

357
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:26,403
You wash dishes here,

358
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:28,506
and collect the bowls as soon as the customers leave.

359
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:31,308
You must be quick.

360
00:22:35,746 --> 00:22:37,381
Welcome.

361
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:46,490
The kitchen is over there.

362
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,658
Sorry.

363
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,935
What are you doing? 
Can't you be more careful?

364
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,541
Even if you cook and wash dishes at home,

365
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:06,110
you can't work outside.

366
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,482
Giving this to you is such a waste,

367
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:13,818
but I'm giving this to you
seeing how pitiful you are.

368
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:17,555
You're lucky that I didn't charge you 
for those broken bowls.

369
00:24:41,872 --> 00:24:44,909
It's so cold.
I'll sleep here for a while.

370
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:50,047
Oh my god!

371
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:17,374
I don't know where she's sleeping.

372
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:22,279
She's making her parents worry.

373
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,250
She'll come back if she can't endure it.

374
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,221
She's not my child, she's an enemy.

375
00:26:01,051 --> 00:26:04,321
Is there anything I can help you with?

376
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:06,190
You see...

377
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,460
Go ahead.

378
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:18,102
Sorry, but can't I stay here until tomorrow morning?

379
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:35,619
Bounce...

380
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:38,422
From family inside came out renga all sing bad.

381
00:26:45,196 --> 00:26:48,466
An ajumma used to work here.

382
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:51,502
because she's old,
she was a total mess.

383
00:26:51,502 --> 00:26:54,305
She was fired in the end.

384
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:58,042
You must listen carefully
to everything I say.

385
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,144
You must always wipe the glass cleanly,
mop the floor well,

386
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:01,779
and clean the toilet.

387
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:02,480
Memorize the menu--

388
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,815
Memorize discount cards and VIP cards.

389
00:27:04,815 --> 00:27:06,684
Don't forget to stamp on the coupons.

390
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:08,085
Don't panic when taking orders from customers.

391
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,954
Remember the customers' orders.

392
00:27:09,954 --> 00:27:12,056
Enough?

393
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:14,391
Welcome. 
What do you want to order?

394
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:15,793
Americano.

395
00:27:15,793 --> 00:27:17,428
What size?

396
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:18,829
A small cup.

397
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:20,464
Did you bring your membership card?

398
00:27:23,734 --> 00:27:24,902
I said, you can't.

399
00:27:24,902 --> 00:27:26,537
You're still young.

400
00:27:26,537 --> 00:27:28,639
I'm sure I'll do well.

401
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:30,741
You're really persistent.

402
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:32,610
How could you beg me for 2 hours?

403
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,412
I must earn money. 
Can I?

404
00:27:38,215 --> 00:27:41,952
Fine. 
Ask your parents to sign this.

405
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,222
Since you're a minor,
you need your parents' consent.

406
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,193
Thank you.

407
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:27,731
Hot, hot.

408
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:30,768
Sorry. Sorry.

409
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:31,702
Sorry.

410
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:33,337
Is this your first time to do this?

411
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,906
No, I've done it plenty of times.
It's hot, so...

412
00:28:35,906 --> 00:28:37,541
Sorry. Sorry.

413
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:41,278
What are you doing?
Clean it up quickly.

414
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:42,913
Yes. Yes.

415
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:48,285
Ajumma, please give us radish.

416
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:51,322
When they say ajumma,
it means you.

417
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:52,723
Do you understand?

418
00:28:52,723 --> 00:28:54,825
Radish.

419
00:28:54,825 --> 00:28:56,694
What radish?

420
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:59,029
Bring it to the customer.

421
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,132
Okay.

422
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,036
~ <i>Bounce. Bounce. </i> ~
Hello, Ajussi.

423
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,438
Yes.

424
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,146
Grandmother!

425
00:29:15,146 --> 00:29:16,547
Those are someone else's.

426
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,415
There's no such thing.

427
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:20,751
First come, first served.

428
00:29:20,751 --> 00:29:25,189
I'll come again tomorrow.
Don't give it to anyone.

429
00:29:25,189 --> 00:29:30,561
~ <i>Bounce, bounce...</i> ~

430
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,897
~ <i>Looking at you.</i> ~

431
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:40,838
Hey. There's nothing here.

432
00:29:40,838 --> 00:29:43,874
Some grandmother took them away.

433
00:29:43,874 --> 00:29:48,546
What? That son-of-a-gun.

434
00:29:52,983 --> 00:29:55,319
For you.

435
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,188
Just this?

436
00:29:57,188 --> 00:29:59,056
That's considered a lot.

437
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:02,093
I gave you a whole bundle.

438
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:04,662
But I still feel good.

439
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:06,791
<i>Do you know what this house means to me?</i>

440
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,929
<i>What tired?</i>

441
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:14,965
<i>She does whatever she wants to do.</i>

442
00:31:14,965 --> 00:31:18,002
<i>You have too much bad luck,</i>

443
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,870
<i>that was why Go son-in-law lost everything.</i>

444
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,140
<i>Just take a look.
After divorcing you,</i>

445
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,009
<i>everything went well again.</i>

446
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:27,812
<i>How could you do something so atrocious?</i>

447
00:31:27,812 --> 00:31:29,447
<i>Are you human?</i>

448
00:31:52,803 --> 00:31:55,139
Sang Nam, I have an important appointment tonight.

449
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:55,840
Okay.

450
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,942
Please tell Father-in-law for me.

451
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:17,328
Boss...
Sorry, but can you give me 100 000 in advance?

452
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:21,766
You just started working and 
you're asking for 100 000.

453
00:32:21,766 --> 00:32:24,802
Do you do this at every restaurant?

454
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:31,108
Then, how about 50 000?

455
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:33,210
I have something urgent.

456
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,312
Please, Boss.

457
00:32:44,188 --> 00:32:46,524
Gwang Bak, how are you doing 
at your in-law's place?

458
00:32:46,524 --> 00:32:47,925
Are you all right?

459
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,560
Of course, I'm fine.

460
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:54,465
Mom, I'll go there for dinner later.
Did you cook Father sea kelp soup this morning?

461
00:32:54,465 --> 00:32:56,567
Kelp soup?

462
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:58,202
Oh my, I forgot.

463
00:32:58,202 --> 00:32:59,603
I'm so forgetful.

464
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,406
I even forgot your father's birthday.

465
00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:05,443
You forgot?
Oh no.

466
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,545
What's the use of living like this?

467
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:11,749
As your granny said,
"Old people should just drop dead."

468
00:33:12,683 --> 00:33:15,019
2nd Eonni and I will bring food over.

469
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:18,055
Let's just have a party tonight.
Bye, Mom.

470
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,398
Daughter-in-law.

471
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:30,668
Today is Bong's birthday.

472
00:33:30,668 --> 00:33:33,003
I just found out after Gwang Bak gave me a call.

473
00:33:33,003 --> 00:33:34,872
What to do?

474
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:37,908
If you don't take good care of people,
it will surely be a big problem.

475
00:33:37,908 --> 00:33:40,478
How could you forget his birthday?

476
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:42,813
You should have told me.

477
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:46,083
Blame this on Su Bak.

478
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:49,587
Just cook kelp soup tonight.
What else can we do?

479
00:33:49,587 --> 00:33:52,389
The children said they're coming.

480
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:55,892
Stop talking about Su Bak.
I don't want to hear it.

481
00:33:55,892 --> 00:33:57,528
You still have to listen even if you don't want to.

482
00:33:57,528 --> 00:34:01,499
You are to blame for your child's wrongdoing.
What else can I do?

483
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:07,805
Just let Mom cook the kelp soup.

484
00:34:07,805 --> 00:34:09,206
Let's do the rest.

485
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:12,008
What are you going to cook?
Beef short ribs?

486
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:15,045
You can do it?
Okay then.

487
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:16,680
You do that and the salad.

488
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,483
I'll do the cake, japchae and some sashimi.

489
00:34:19,483 --> 00:34:21,352
See you later there tonight.

490
00:34:26,957 --> 00:34:28,124
Eonni.

491
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,767
Eonni, what happened to you?

492
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:38,635
Geez.

493
00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:40,971
Where's your bag?

494
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:42,139
You don't need to know that.

495
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:46,110
I was so worried about you.
You don't even answer your phone.

496
00:34:46,811 --> 00:34:49,847
Don't be like this. It's cold.
Let's go somewhere.

497
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:51,949
No, I have to go back right away.

498
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:54,985
This.

499
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:59,190
What is this?

500
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,460
It's Father's birthday today.

501
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:04,562
You haven't forgotten?

502
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:10,868
How can I forget? That's not much.
You must give it to him.

503
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:12,736
Wish him a happy birthday for me.

504
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:17,408
Eonni, come home.
Everyone's worried about you.

505
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:22,079
I can't go back until I succeed.
No, I won't go back.

506
00:35:22,546 --> 00:35:26,517
Ho Bak. 
I'm really grateful to you and Gwang Bak.

507
00:35:26,517 --> 00:35:29,787
You found them a house.

508
00:35:29,787 --> 00:35:32,123
I didn't do my responsibility as the eldest.

509
00:35:32,123 --> 00:35:34,692
I just cause trouble.

510
00:35:34,692 --> 00:35:36,560
Eonni.

511
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,297
Just consider yourself the eldest 
of our family from now on.

512
00:35:40,297 --> 00:35:41,932
Just pretend that I'm not around.

513
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,268
How can you say that?

514
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:48,005
Eonni, where are you and 
what are you doing?

515
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:50,341
Take good care of Mom and Father.

516
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:53,844
And our younger siblings, 
I'll rely on you.

517
00:35:53,844 --> 00:35:58,282
Ho Bak, sorry.

518
00:35:58,282 --> 00:35:59,683
I'm going.

519
00:35:59,683 --> 00:36:02,253
Eonni.
Eonni!

520
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:08,793
Eonni!
Eonni, wait!

521
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:11,362
Wait...
Wait...

522
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:15,566
Wait...
Wait...

523
00:36:15,566 --> 00:36:17,201
Eonni! Wait!

524
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:20,704
Wait, Eonni!

525
00:36:20,704 --> 00:36:22,106
Eonni!

526
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:23,274
Wait!

527
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:26,544
Oh, no. Sorry.
Oh, no.

528
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:27,711
Eonni!

529
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:33,083
Eonni! Eonni!
What do I do?

530
00:36:36,353 --> 00:36:38,689
Your sister is really hopeless.

531
00:36:38,689 --> 00:36:41,025
She's really immature.

532
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:42,426
That's enough.

533
00:36:42,426 --> 00:36:44,295
I was really crushed when I saw how she was.

534
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:47,098
She's the black sheep of your family.
The black sheep.

535
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:49,667
I'm the black sheep of our family.
Right?

536
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:52,470
- Dad!
- Dad!

537
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,805
That's right. 
You're back from cram school?

538
00:36:54,805 --> 00:36:56,674
Wash your hands and 
prepare to do your homework.

539
00:36:59,477 --> 00:37:02,513
Look at you guys.
As if you didn't see me.

540
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,549
Of course. I'm their mother.

541
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:08,819
You're not popular in this house anymore.

542
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:10,921
Sin Dong, Bang Dong,
can't you see Mom?

543
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:12,089
We saw you.

544
00:37:13,491 --> 00:37:16,761
See?
This makes life fun.

545
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:19,330
Delicious smell.

546
00:37:19,797 --> 00:37:20,731
What's this, Dad?

547
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:23,067
You're really...

548
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:24,702
Just one.

549
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:27,972
Don't touch. 
That's for your grandmother.

550
00:37:27,972 --> 00:37:31,008
Who did you take after?
Why are you so naughty?

551
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,344
If you join a 'naughty competition' somewhere,
I'm sure you'd get first place.

552
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:37,548
Our kids won't choke no matter how they eat.

553
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:39,650
I told you to wash your hands
after coming home.

554
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,285
Hurry, go wash and change 
then do your homework.

555
00:37:41,285 --> 00:37:42,219
Okay.

556
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,621
I hate you, Dad.

557
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:45,256
These little brats.

558
00:37:45,256 --> 00:37:47,358
Who did you take after?
You're so disobedient.

559
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,161
Slackers.
Just like their father.

560
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:54,598
What's wrong?

561
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:56,700
Wait, are you like this everyday?

562
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,270
You're like a mother.
You're a total housewife.

563
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,671
Perfect.

564
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:04,175
Of course. 
I do everything perfectly.

565
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:07,678
You hurry up too.
We don't have much time.

566
00:38:07,678 --> 00:38:08,846
Okay.

567
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:21,926
What are you doing?

568
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:23,094
Oh my!

569
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:25,896
Did a man come here to visit you?

570
00:38:25,896 --> 00:38:29,166
My brother's daughter-in-law gets shocked 
all the time because she has a man.

571
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:31,502
What's that?
It smells good.

572
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:33,370
It's beef short ribs.

573
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,239
Are you giving it to someone?

574
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,341
Yes. That.

575
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:40,611
You take things from this house?

576
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:42,246
How could you say that?

577
00:38:42,246 --> 00:38:45,282
Do you feel uncomfortable
because I was spot on?

578
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,852
A cup of tea please.

579
00:38:47,852 --> 00:38:50,888
Please add egg yolk.

580
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:52,756
I don't know how to do that.

581
00:38:52,756 --> 00:38:55,559
I already taught you.

582
00:38:57,428 --> 00:39:00,231
Was it the sushi I ate yesterday
that's causing this indigestion?

583
00:39:00,231 --> 00:39:03,267
Or, I was too ecstatic
because I ate with my son.

584
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:07,004
I won't get hungry even if I don't eat anything.

585
00:39:07,004 --> 00:39:10,741
You ate sushi with Sang Nam?

586
00:39:10,741 --> 00:39:12,843
Sang Nam didn't tell you?

587
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:15,412
We had lunch together yesterday.

588
00:39:16,113 --> 00:39:19,617
Sang Nam was so apologetic because of you.

589
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:24,288
Ha said he married the wrong wife
so he begged me for forgiveness.

590
00:39:24,288 --> 00:39:28,025
Be good to me.
If you want your husband to love you.

591
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:29,894
How could you not be aware of the basics?

592
00:39:29,894 --> 00:39:32,930
You even went to uni.

593
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,733
Did you enter through the backdoor?

594
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:37,134
What?

595
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:38,536
No. 
Forget it.

596
00:39:38,536 --> 00:39:41,572
Whether you entered through the front door
or back door, that's not important.

597
00:39:41,572 --> 00:39:46,243
You are my daughter-in-law
and I am your mother-in-law.
That is important.

598
00:39:46,243 --> 00:39:50,448
Oh. That sounded so cool.
Right?

599
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:54,185
Are you ready?

600
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:59,790
Mother... I didn't say anything because
I don't want Sang Nam to get hurt.

601
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,724
What?

602
00:40:00,724 --> 00:40:02,359
You know.

603
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:05,629
I say you...
Are you going to shift 
the blame on me again?

604
00:40:05,629 --> 00:40:08,666
The more you do this,
the more you need to give me something.

605
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:10,534
I'll just pretend I never heard that.

606
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:11,936
Even if I want to,
I don't have money to give you.

607
00:40:11,936 --> 00:40:14,505
Wait! Ah, I'm thristy.

608
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:16,140
Give me a glass of fresh juice first.

609
00:40:58,649 --> 00:41:00,050
Where are you going?

610
00:41:02,853 --> 00:41:05,422
I just remembered that I have a prior appointment.

611
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:06,824
Cancel the juice.

612
00:41:06,824 --> 00:41:08,459
I don't need to pay you, right?

613
00:41:26,677 --> 00:41:27,845
What are you doing?

614
00:41:28,546 --> 00:41:30,881
You need to mop the floor.
There's no time to sit down.

615
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:32,283
You think you can just slack off.

616
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:35,319
Do you want me to pay you
while you rest?

617
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:36,954
You're too much.

618
00:41:36,954 --> 00:41:40,224
I've been working all the time,
this is my first time to sit.

619
00:41:40,224 --> 00:41:42,326
Although I'm doing this because 
I have some difficulties,

620
00:41:42,326 --> 00:41:44,662
don't be too strict with me.

621
00:41:44,662 --> 00:41:48,165
I was in the Miss Korea pageant.

622
00:41:48,165 --> 00:41:49,800
Miss Korea?

623
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,202
Yes.

624
00:41:51,669 --> 00:41:54,472
What about Miss Korea?

625
00:41:54,472 --> 00:41:56,574
Can they clean and cook tofu soup?

626
00:41:56,574 --> 00:41:58,442
I didn't want to say this but...

627
00:41:58,442 --> 00:42:01,946
In our store, Miss Korea, super models
and actors all came to work here.

628
00:42:01,946 --> 00:42:03,114
You don't even know.

629
00:42:03,114 --> 00:42:06,851
Hurry, mop the floor.
Clean it till it shines.

630
00:42:06,851 --> 00:42:09,887
Until you can see Miss Korea's face clearly.

631
00:42:21,565 --> 00:42:23,667
It's too stuffy.

632
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,536
We're all squeezed in.

633
00:42:25,536 --> 00:42:27,171
Who's crossing their legs?

634
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:33,244
Except Father.
Do it Father.

635
00:42:33,244 --> 00:42:36,280
You're exempted today because it's your birthday.

636
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:38,616
We forgot the cake.

637
00:42:38,616 --> 00:42:40,718
Go son-in-law will buy it.

638
00:42:40,951 --> 00:42:43,754
You should've drank kelp soup this morning.

639
00:42:43,754 --> 00:42:45,623
What to do? 
Sorry, Son.

640
00:42:45,623 --> 00:42:47,491
I forgot too.

641
00:42:47,491 --> 00:42:50,761
I've never forgotten about it all these years.

642
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:53,330
Throw away this useless wife of yours.

643
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:58,002
What's a birthday?
Being together is enough.

644
00:42:58,002 --> 00:42:59,403
Thank you.

645
00:42:59,403 --> 00:43:02,206
Everyone gathered here to celebrate
this inept father's birthday.

646
00:43:04,775 --> 00:43:08,512
I'm to blame for everything.
It's all my fault.

647
00:43:11,782 --> 00:43:14,118
When will we laugh again?

648
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:17,855
Mom.

649
00:43:17,855 --> 00:43:21,125
Father, it's your birthday today.
Why are you crying?

650
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,293
Just like Granny said,

651
00:43:22,293 --> 00:43:25,096
A day will come when you will laugh again.

652
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:26,964
That's right, Hyeongnim.

653
00:43:26,964 --> 00:43:28,599
Hurry, let's eat.

654
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:31,168
Congratulations for being born, Son.

655
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:33,037
Yes, Mother.

656
00:43:39,343 --> 00:43:42,613
If you hate your in-laws,
they will also hate your daughter.

657
00:43:43,547 --> 00:43:45,649
Wait and see, Beautician.

658
00:43:45,649 --> 00:43:47,051
Like mother, like daughter.

659
00:43:47,051 --> 00:43:49,386
I will surely make her cry.

660
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:54,291
My daughter's already married.
What can I do?

661
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:11,575
Yes, Mother-in-law.

662
00:44:13,444 --> 00:44:14,845
You're here.
Hurry, go in.

663
00:44:14,845 --> 00:44:16,013
Yes.

664
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:17,414
Yes, Mother-in-law.

665
00:44:17,414 --> 00:44:19,049
We don't live there anymore.

666
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:20,918
That is because...

667
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:22,787
Hello.

668
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,188
Start.

669
00:44:24,188 --> 00:44:25,356
- Hi.
- Hi.

670
00:44:27,224 --> 00:44:28,392
Welcome.

671
00:44:28,392 --> 00:44:30,261
Just squeeze in.

672
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:32,363
The house is going to explode.

673
00:44:32,363 --> 00:44:36,567
This is the first time I've heard of that in my life.

674
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:37,968
Come and sit down, Brother-in-law.

675
00:44:37,968 --> 00:44:39,370
The divorced Go son-in-law even came.

676
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,005
Where is Choe son-in-law?

677
00:44:41,705 --> 00:44:43,808
He went to China on a business trip.

678
00:44:43,808 --> 00:44:46,377
Father, I made this beef short ribs.

679
00:44:46,377 --> 00:44:48,012
Sin Dong's dad made this.

680
00:44:48,012 --> 00:44:50,114
You can also call him Sin Dong's mom now.

681
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:51,982
House chores is becoming more interesting.

682
00:44:51,982 --> 00:44:54,552
I've finally become a cheapskate house husband.

683
00:44:54,552 --> 00:44:57,822
That's right. 
It gets interesting when you're used to it.

684
00:44:59,457 --> 00:45:02,960
Dad, this too.

685
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:05,296
Is it money?

686
00:45:05,296 --> 00:45:08,566
Eonni wanted me to give it to Father.

687
00:45:08,566 --> 00:45:11,602
You met her? Where is she?
What is she doing?

688
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:14,171
How did you meet her?

689
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:15,806
She called me.

690
00:45:15,806 --> 00:45:18,843
It's your birthday so she asked me 
to pass that to you.

691
00:45:23,981 --> 00:45:25,850
She asked you to pass that to him?

692
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:28,886
Where is she?
What is she doing?

693
00:45:29,587 --> 00:45:32,156
She wouldn't tell me no matter how much I asked.

694
00:45:32,156 --> 00:45:33,791
She said she'd come back after she succeeds.

695
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:36,594
You should find out no matter what happens.

696
00:45:36,594 --> 00:45:39,396
I chased after her but couldn't catch her.

697
00:45:39,396 --> 00:45:40,798
Is she doing well?

698
00:45:40,798 --> 00:45:43,134
She lost a lot of weight.
She just cried.

699
00:45:43,134 --> 00:45:45,236
What to do?

700
00:45:45,236 --> 00:45:47,338
Don't feel sorry for her.

701
00:45:47,338 --> 00:45:52,009
She should go out and suffer
to make her come to her senses.

702
00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:52,943
She's so sly.

703
00:45:52,943 --> 00:45:55,980
She left because she couldn't stomach
living in a house like this.

704
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,717
Do you think she really left because 
the house has become like this?

705
00:45:59,717 --> 00:46:03,220
She wrote in the letter that she's going
to earn money to get the house back.

706
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,855
You believe her?

707
00:46:04,855 --> 00:46:06,724
When can she earn enough money
to buy the house back?

708
00:46:06,724 --> 00:46:09,059
She ran away because of you.

709
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:09,994
What?

710
00:46:09,994 --> 00:46:13,264
She wouldn't have left
if you didn't bully her.

711
00:46:13,264 --> 00:46:16,066
She was already suffering.

712
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:19,103
You kept nagging her 
ever since we moved here.

713
00:46:19,103 --> 00:46:20,971
She was already in pins and needles.

714
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:22,606
She said she destroyed her father.

715
00:46:22,606 --> 00:46:25,643
You kept rubbing it in,
how could she stay here?

716
00:46:25,643 --> 00:46:26,811
Furthermore,

717
00:46:26,811 --> 00:46:30,548
she didn't lose the house to loan sharks.

718
00:46:30,548 --> 00:46:33,350
Go son-in-law's income wasn't enough,
so she just wanted to supplement it.

719
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,219
That happened because she met a swindler.

720
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:37,555
You berated her like that,
would she be able to take it?

721
00:46:37,555 --> 00:46:39,190
You chased her away.

722
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,292
You must be out of your mind.

723
00:46:41,292 --> 00:46:44,562
You kept babying Su Bak turning her like that.

724
00:46:44,562 --> 00:46:47,832
You still can't differentiate shit from miso?

725
00:46:47,832 --> 00:46:49,467
That's enough, Mother.

726
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:51,802
That's right. 
Today is Father's birthday,
let's be happy.

727
00:46:51,802 --> 00:46:55,306
Come, come, come.
Let's gather up all our energy

728
00:46:55,306 --> 00:46:57,875
and sing happy birthday loudly.

729
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:01,145
Granny, Mother-in-law. 
Use all your energy here

730
00:47:01,145 --> 00:47:02,546
and sing loudly.

731
00:47:02,546 --> 00:47:03,948
Come. Start.

732
00:47:03,948 --> 00:47:10,488
Happy Birthday to you.

733
00:47:10,488 --> 00:47:14,225
- To our beloved Father-in-law. 
- To our beloved Father.

734
00:47:14,225 --> 00:47:18,195
Happy birthday to you.

735
00:47:18,662 --> 00:47:20,998
Blow the candles, Father-in-law.

736
00:47:25,202 --> 00:47:30,808
Happy birthday.

737
00:47:33,844 --> 00:47:35,946
Still far away?

738
00:47:35,946 --> 00:47:37,815
We'll be there in a bit.

739
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:41,552
Is it still far?

740
00:47:42,253 --> 00:47:44,121
We'll be there soon.

741
00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:46,457
You kept saying that.

742
00:47:46,457 --> 00:47:48,325
Where the heck is it?

743
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:49,727
That.

744
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,734
Here.

745
00:48:07,711 --> 00:48:12,383
Mom, Hyeongnim...
Come out.

746
00:48:18,923 --> 00:48:20,324
Bag.
=Bag and to poop have same sound=-

747
00:48:20,324 --> 00:48:23,127
I already pooped.
I was first in line.

748
00:48:23,127 --> 00:48:24,762
I told you to pack your bags.

749
00:48:24,762 --> 00:48:25,930
I don't want to.

750
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:26,864
Pack your bags!

751
00:48:26,864 --> 00:48:29,200
Don't yell.

752
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,302
What if something happens to the baby?

753
00:48:31,302 --> 00:48:32,703
Is the baby the problem now?

754
00:48:32,703 --> 00:48:34,805
My daughter is dying.

755
00:48:34,805 --> 00:48:36,907
You're too much.

756
00:48:36,907 --> 00:48:39,710
Your house became like this.
Why didn't you tell me?

757
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,214
How could you let my precious daughter
live in this kind of place?

758
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:44,381
Neighbours!

759
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:46,016
Don't yell, Mother.

760
00:48:46,016 --> 00:48:48,352
Why are you calling the neighbours?

761
00:48:48,352 --> 00:48:49,520
Butt out.

762
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,921
Mom.

763
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:52,089
You too, butt out!

764
00:48:52,089 --> 00:48:53,724
You're both useless.

765
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:55,826
How could you be so treacherous?

766
00:48:55,826 --> 00:48:57,461
In-law, please calm down.

767
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:59,096
Butt out too!

768
00:48:59,563 --> 00:49:01,198
This woman's so arrogant.

769
00:49:01,198 --> 00:49:02,366
Who the hell are you?

770
00:49:02,366 --> 00:49:06,103
That's enough.
It was just a slip of the tongue.

771
00:49:06,103 --> 00:49:07,738
Sorry.

772
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:10,541
There's no need to talk!
Pack your bags immediately!

773
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:12,877
I don't want to.
I don't want to pack my bags.

774
00:49:12,877 --> 00:49:13,811
Oppa.

775
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:14,979
Come here.

776
00:49:15,913 --> 00:49:16,847
Mother-in-law.

777
00:49:16,847 --> 00:49:18,249
What mother-in-law?

778
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:20,818
Loser, does this make any sense?

779
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:23,854
What loser?
Wang son-in-law.

780
00:49:23,854 --> 00:49:25,956
You don't even know how to address him.

781
00:49:25,956 --> 00:49:28,526
Have you forgotten you call my son slip head?

782
00:49:28,526 --> 00:49:29,693
Let's go.

783
00:49:29,693 --> 00:49:33,664
He doesn't even have a house.
Suffering like this here, does it make sense?

784
00:49:33,664 --> 00:49:37,401
How could you let a newly wed couple
sleep on the cold floor?

785
00:49:38,102 --> 00:49:39,970
I said I want to sleep here.

786
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:41,839
That's why I said to let them use the bedroom.

787
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,941
I will sleep on the cold floor.

788
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:46,977
Ask any passerby,
does this make any sense?

789
00:49:46,977 --> 00:49:48,612
Come with me!

790
00:49:48,846 --> 00:49:50,481
Go with Mother-in-law.

791
00:49:50,481 --> 00:49:52,817
No! I'm not going.

792
00:49:52,817 --> 00:49:56,086
She doesn't want to go.
I can't let her go too, Mother-in-law.

793
00:49:56,086 --> 00:49:57,721
What are you doing?

794
00:49:57,721 --> 00:50:00,291
Mom, Mom...
Let's go.
Mom, let's go.

795
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:01,459
Let go.

796
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:03,794
Father! We're going.

797
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:04,728
Come here.

798
00:50:04,728 --> 00:50:07,298
Let's go.

799
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:11,969
Oh my.
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

800
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:20,611
What are you going to do later?

801
00:50:20,611 --> 00:50:23,414
You seduced my daughter so you 
should be responsible for her.

802
00:50:23,414 --> 00:50:27,151
You're 35, no, you're 36 already, right?

803
00:50:27,151 --> 00:50:29,253
You're already 36 years old.

804
00:50:29,253 --> 00:50:32,289
You don't even have money to rent a house.
Does that make any sense?

805
00:50:32,289 --> 00:50:33,924
Mother-in-law, if you wait a bit longer...

806
00:50:33,924 --> 00:50:35,793
Wait for what?
What?

807
00:50:35,793 --> 00:50:38,596
You should at least have a room.

808
00:50:38,596 --> 00:50:40,931
When 2 doors open,
all eyes will be on you.

809
00:50:40,931 --> 00:50:42,566
Furthermore, sleeping on the cold floor,
does it make sense?

810
00:50:42,566 --> 00:50:45,136
It's winter.

811
00:50:45,136 --> 00:50:49,340
I'll find a monthly rental house for you.
Move out.

812
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,975
I can't do that.

813
00:50:50,975 --> 00:50:51,909
Why not?

814
00:50:51,909 --> 00:50:53,778
I don't want to depend on you.

815
00:50:53,778 --> 00:50:57,047
I'm just letting you know.
Se Dal and I are not the same.

816
00:50:57,047 --> 00:51:01,252
What about Se Dal?
Did Se Dal want anything from your family?

817
00:51:01,252 --> 00:51:03,354
Ho Bak's supporting him.

818
00:51:03,354 --> 00:51:04,288
Hey!

819
00:51:04,288 --> 00:51:05,222
He's right.

820
00:51:05,222 --> 00:51:08,492
My wife, my child, 
I will provide for them.

821
00:51:08,492 --> 00:51:09,894
I won't rely on anyone.

822
00:51:09,894 --> 00:51:12,696
How we live is our business.
I'm going.

823
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:14,331
Loser, you...

824
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:16,200
And I'm not loser.

825
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,068
Please call me Wang son-in-law.

826
00:51:18,068 --> 00:51:20,638
If you keep calling me loser,

827
00:51:20,638 --> 00:51:22,273
I will also call you ajumma.

828
00:51:22,273 --> 00:51:23,908
Oh my god, listen to what he said.

829
00:51:23,908 --> 00:51:25,776
Did you hear it?

830
00:51:25,776 --> 00:51:27,178
He didn't say anything wrong.

831
00:51:27,178 --> 00:51:28,579
You are wrong.

832
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:30,681
Since your family lost everything,

833
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:32,550
you should have at least told me.

834
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,418
Bring her back here!

835
00:51:34,418 --> 00:51:37,688
She likes it there.
How can I drag her back?

836
00:51:37,688 --> 00:51:40,724
Let's wait till she can't take it any longer,

837
00:51:40,724 --> 00:51:42,359
then I'll take her home.

838
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:45,162
I think it's better to let her stay there for now.

839
00:51:45,162 --> 00:51:46,330
Ditto.

840
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:47,031
What?

841
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:48,666
I share the same opinion.

842
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:51,469
Mom, don't worry about her.

843
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:54,038
Whether she's rich or poor,
let her take care of it.

844
00:51:54,038 --> 00:51:58,476
When she married me a long time ago,
we had nothing and we used to live in 
a basement room too.

845
00:51:58,476 --> 00:52:00,578
Did her family drag her away?

846
00:52:00,578 --> 00:52:02,446
Are they the same?

847
00:52:02,446 --> 00:52:03,614
Exactly the same.

848
00:52:03,614 --> 00:52:04,782
Carbon copies.

849
00:52:04,782 --> 00:52:07,351
Your children are exactly alike.

850
00:52:07,351 --> 00:52:09,920
Just treat it as fate.

851
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:12,723
I'm really going crazy.

852
00:52:12,723 --> 00:52:14,125
Ouch, it hurts.

853
00:52:33,277 --> 00:52:38,883
I can't afford it.

854
00:52:38,883 --> 00:52:41,452
Uncle has to go to college,

855
00:52:41,452 --> 00:52:48,926
Su Bak is studying far away,
she needs living expenses.

856
00:52:48,926 --> 00:52:51,028
Ho Bak, give it up.

857
00:52:51,028 --> 00:52:52,897
She is your sister.

858
00:52:52,897 --> 00:52:54,064
The eldest of this family.

859
00:52:54,064 --> 00:52:57,334
Father. 
You're too much.

860
00:52:57,334 --> 00:52:59,437
I am better at studies.

861
00:52:59,437 --> 00:53:02,473
I need to graduate from university.
I can't quit midway.

862
00:53:02,473 --> 00:53:04,575
I want to be an announcer.

863
00:53:04,575 --> 00:53:06,444
You really are...

864
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:08,779
I told you many times.

865
00:53:08,779 --> 00:53:11,348
The eldest has to graduate from university.

866
00:53:11,348 --> 00:53:13,684
You keep saying 'Eldest, eldest'.

867
00:53:13,684 --> 00:53:18,122
You just care about the eldest.
It's really unfair.

868
00:53:26,297 --> 00:53:28,165
Su Bak.

869
00:53:28,165 --> 00:53:29,333
Yes, Father.

870
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:31,902
Study hard.

871
00:53:31,902 --> 00:53:36,574
Just think of it as studying for
Ho Bak's part too.

872
00:53:36,574 --> 00:53:41,946
You are the eldest of our family.
My eldest child.
Understand?

873
00:53:58,529 --> 00:53:59,697
Oppa?

874
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:06,470
There's a registered letter for Go Min Jeong.

875
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:08,572
Yes. Thank you.

876
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:24,688
It's only our family here now.

877
00:54:24,688 --> 00:54:27,024
I'm also part of our family too, right?

878
00:54:27,024 --> 00:54:28,659
Of course, Sister-in-law.

879
00:54:28,659 --> 00:54:31,228
Thanks for not going home with your mom.

880
00:54:31,228 --> 00:54:34,265
I know.

881
00:54:34,265 --> 00:54:36,133
Ajussi, wait a moment.

882
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:38,469
Ajubeonim.

883
00:54:38,469 --> 00:54:39,637
I forgot.

884
00:54:39,637 --> 00:54:41,505
I keep forgetting.

885
00:54:43,374 --> 00:54:46,644
This is my salary.

886
00:54:46,644 --> 00:54:49,447
Let us all gather our money together to buy a house.

887
00:54:49,447 --> 00:54:52,249
If we unite together, 
we can buy that house.

888
00:54:53,884 --> 00:54:55,753
Take it back.

889
00:54:55,753 --> 00:54:59,256
No, I'm also part of this family.
I have to contribute.

890
00:54:59,256 --> 00:55:02,059
Just take it.

891
00:55:03,227 --> 00:55:04,628
I'm just saying.

892
00:55:04,628 --> 00:55:07,665
Did you think I would spend her salary?

893
00:55:07,665 --> 00:55:11,402
Just take it as part of Uncle and Sister-in-law's living expenses.

894
00:55:11,402 --> 00:55:15,139
You have to save money and rent a house immediately.
But it's also a problem.

895
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:18,175
You saw how your mother was earlier.

896
00:55:18,175 --> 00:55:21,445
Son, I earned money too.

897
00:55:22,847 --> 00:55:24,949
What did you do?

898
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:26,817
You don't need to know.

899
00:55:26,817 --> 00:55:28,452
Did you pick up scraps?

900
00:55:28,452 --> 00:55:29,854
How did you know?

901
00:55:29,854 --> 00:55:31,489
It's obvious.

902
00:55:31,489 --> 00:55:36,160
I collected a whole bag but
he just gave me that bit.

903
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,496
Mother, don't do that.

904
00:55:38,496 --> 00:55:41,766
If you slip, 
the medical fee will be more expensive.

905
00:55:41,766 --> 00:55:44,568
I won't slip.
I walked very carefully.

906
00:55:44,568 --> 00:55:47,371
Earning money is fun.

907
00:55:47,371 --> 00:55:49,940
Father, I found a part-time job too.

908
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:53,677
In a cafe, taking orders and waitressing.

909
00:55:53,677 --> 00:55:57,648
Be quiet!
I'm not nagging you because 
it's a happy day today.

910
00:55:57,648 --> 00:55:59,283
Go and apply to the review academy again.

911
00:55:59,283 --> 00:56:02,553
Even if I starve to death,
I will send you to university.

912
00:56:02,553 --> 00:56:05,589
Father, you need to sign this.

913
00:56:09,326 --> 00:56:11,195
You're going to work?

914
00:56:11,195 --> 00:56:12,129
Yes.

915
00:56:12,129 --> 00:56:13,764
If you sign that.

916
00:56:13,764 --> 00:56:17,268
Just forget about it. 
What's the role of a student?

917
00:56:17,268 --> 00:56:21,238
To study hard.
That's helping Father.

918
00:56:21,238 --> 00:56:22,873
I'm also part of this family.

919
00:56:22,873 --> 00:56:24,742
Aunt even gave her salary.

920
00:56:24,742 --> 00:56:27,311
I want to help in buying a house too.

921
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:29,180
I'm the eldest son of this family.

922
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,048
I'll just work during winter break.

923
00:56:31,048 --> 00:56:34,318
Dae Bak, you don't have to work.
Plenty of people will do that.

924
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:36,420
Whatever you want to do,
just wait till you're in high school.

925
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,055
I'm also against it.

926
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:41,091
Thank you, everyone.

927
00:56:41,091 --> 00:56:42,960
I'm stronger now.

928
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,829
My legs have strength now.

929
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:47,398
It feels like I will stand up again soon.

930
00:56:47,398 --> 00:56:50,901
Come. Come. 
Ajubeonim will stand up very soon.

931
00:56:50,901 --> 00:56:53,704
Yeong Dal will sing a song.

932
00:56:53,704 --> 00:56:57,441
I will sing a song.
Because I know that feeling.

933
00:57:00,244 --> 00:57:02,346
Bravo.

934
00:57:07,952 --> 00:57:10,988
The atmosphere at home is so much better
because of Loser and Yeong Dal.

935
00:57:10,988 --> 00:57:13,791
What would we do without them?

936
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:15,893
That's right.

937
00:57:15,893 --> 00:57:17,762
Treat In-law better.

938
00:57:17,762 --> 00:57:21,499
He treats her well,
that was why she came here to cause trouble.

939
00:57:21,499 --> 00:57:24,769
It's your day today.
Sing a song.

940
00:57:24,769 --> 00:57:26,871
Singer Wang.

941
00:57:28,038 --> 00:57:30,141
You think I won't sing?

942
00:57:30,841 --> 00:57:33,878
Singer Wang! Wow.

943
00:57:33,878 --> 00:57:36,914
1, 2, 3, 4.

944
00:57:36,914 --> 00:57:44,622
~ <i>The hearts of parents in this world are the same.</i> ~

945

949
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:55,132
Oh.

950

00:58:00,738 --> 00:58:05,876

I'm still young.</i> ~

953
00:58:05,876 --> 00:58:10,080
Really great. Really great.

954
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,117
Wonderful. Wonderful.

955
00:58:13,117 --> 00:58:16,620
~ <i>Dad's youth.</i> ~

956
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:20,357
Bravo.

957
00:58:20,357 --> 00:58:22,693
~ <i>Dad's life.</i> ~

958
00:58:22,693 --> 00:58:25,262
Really good.

959
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:31,569
Singer!

960
00:58:31,569 --> 00:58:33,904
Now? Why?

961
00:58:33,904 --> 00:58:36,240
You'll find out when you get here.

962
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,678
Did something happen at home?

963
00:58:40,678 --> 00:58:42,780
Okay.

964
00:58:57,261 --> 00:58:58,896
Hello.

965
00:58:58,896 --> 00:59:00,297
Have a seat.

966
00:59:05,436 --> 00:59:09,173
What is it, out of the blue...

967
00:59:09,173 --> 00:59:11,976
I think this can't go on.

968
00:59:11,976 --> 00:59:16,180
Apologize to my mother. Hurry.

969
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:32,062
I'm sorry about that day.
It was my fault.

970
00:59:32,062 --> 00:59:34,398
I was really upset that day.

971
00:59:34,398 --> 00:59:36,033
Since you've already apologized,

972
00:59:36,033 --> 00:59:38,602
I feel better.

973
00:59:38,602 --> 00:59:41,172
Let's get along.
Okay?

974
00:59:43,741 --> 00:59:45,609
Sang Nam. Coffee.

975
00:59:45,609 --> 00:59:46,777
Yes.

976
00:59:55,419 --> 00:59:57,288
Did you see that?

977
00:59:57,288 --> 00:59:59,623
My son is on my side.

978
00:59:59,623 --> 01:00:02,893
Don't try to be naughty again.

979
01:00:02,893 --> 01:00:06,630
Sorry. I have to go.

980
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:07,798
What are you doing?

981
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:10,835
There's no one at home.
Then...

982
01:00:23,914 --> 01:00:27,885
This is all my fault.
Who else is to blame?

983
01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:31,155
I can't get my daughter-in-law's respect.

984
01:00:31,155 --> 01:00:33,491
She left already?

985
01:00:33,491 --> 01:00:37,461
Leave her alone.
As long as she apologized.

986
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:41,899
Sang Nam.

987
01:00:47,972 --> 01:00:50,074
Hot.

988
01:00:59,884 --> 01:01:01,519
What are you doing?

989
01:01:02,686 --> 01:01:04,555
Why are you crying?

990
01:01:04,555 --> 01:01:06,657
You're mad because you apologized?

991
01:01:06,657 --> 01:01:09,460
Don't you need to apologize if you
did something wrong to an elder?

992
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,394
I did it.

993
01:01:10,394 --> 01:01:12,263
You can't be like this.

994
01:01:12,263 --> 01:01:14,598
I hope you can apologize sincerely.

995
01:01:14,598 --> 01:01:16,934
You let me apologize out of the blue.

996
01:01:16,934 --> 01:01:19,036
I need to prepare first.

997
01:01:19,036 --> 01:01:20,905
What preparation?

998
01:01:20,905 --> 01:01:24,175
What preparation do you need 
to apologize to an elder?

999
01:01:24,175 --> 01:01:27,211
Sorry.

1000
01:01:27,211 --> 01:01:33,050
She's my mom.
She gave birth to me.

1001
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:35,619
I can't forgive how you disregarded her.

1002
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:38,656
You, for suddenly calling me over to apologize,

1003
01:01:38,656 --> 01:01:41,692
and I, for not apologizing sincerely,

1004
01:01:41,692 --> 01:01:44,495
we're even, so sorry.

1005
01:01:44,495 --> 01:01:46,363
