00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,400
The magazine? 

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,750
- You read it?
- Yes. 

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,930
I read how you turned me into a total bastard,  

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,860
ruined me, and tore me to pieces! 

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,310
Hold on, Sangnam. 

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,710
Hold on! Just listen to me... 

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,250
There's nothing to listen to. 

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,250
What's left to say? 

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,370
- Explanation?
- Excuses, you mean? 

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,380
No, no, I won't make any excuses. 

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,700
Please, give me 10, no, 5 minutes. 

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,970
I'll tell you everything. 

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,190
I'll confess everything. 

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,910
I don't want any excuses. 

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,040
I know how shocking the article was. 

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,960
But that wasn't what I wrote. 

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,700
The editor turned it upside down to attract more readers. 

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,940
It's true women don't like men like that. 

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,380
Not me, but women who are airheads. 

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,500
It was so different from what I wrote  

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,220
that I had a fight with the editor 

23
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,040
and got fired from my part time job. 

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,740
I need to catch my breath... 

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,390
Stop it. 

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,700
I know it's my fault. 

27
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,180
I should've stopped the printing. 

28
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,530
I'm sorry. 

29
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,960
But I never meant to hurt you. 

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,830
Oh, you can come with me to confirm it. 

31
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,770
Yes, I think we should.
Come with me. 

32
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,080
There's no need. 

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,440
I'm disappointed in you.
You betrayed me. 

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,160
I believed you understood who I am. 

35
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,020
But I feel like you stole from me. 

36
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,390
I feel violated. Understand? 

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,490
I know how that feels. 

38
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,290
But I never ever thought that way. 

39
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,740
I never stole from you, never! 

40
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,640
And what else?
Oh, violated. I never did. 

41
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,570
I'm serious.
Please don't think like that. 

42
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,220
Thank you for teaching me. 

43
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,370
The world is full of biased people. 

44
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,240
You made me see that again. 

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,380
Goodbye. 

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,100
Mom, what is it again? 

47
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,820
I can't, I'm busy. Bye. 

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,550
Mom, later. 

49
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,840
Hold on! 

50
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,070
I have proof. 

51
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,100
- Proof?
- Yes. 

52
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,510
We can talk after you see it. 

53
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,050
I'll email it to you, so take a look at it. 

54
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,580
How's that?
See it and decide. 

55
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,890
I'll send it right away. 

56
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,310
Ugh, it stinks in here! 

57
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,510
What's this? Man... 

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,380
How disgusting. 

59
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,710
Incredible. 

60
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,270
I told you never to touch my computer! 

61
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,790
Oh, sorry. Mine's too slow. 

62
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,310
You! 

63
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,360
Hey! Hey! 

64
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,960
I should just die! 

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,050
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo. 

66
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,240
You stop right there! 

67
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,380
I'm not crazy! 

68
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,310
If it caught a virus, you're dead! 

69
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,320
Why don't you go get married! 

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,490
Huh? 

71
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,070
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Wang Daebak! 

72
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,120
Welcome. How may I help you? 

73
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,830
Excuse me, where's the lounge? 

74
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,320
It's over there. 

75
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,990
Where's the lounge? 

76
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,750
I will show you.
It's this way. 

77
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,490
This is the lounge. 

78
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,170
You're very nice. 

79
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,680
I think you're too good for this job. 

80
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,280
Can I have your number? 

81
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,200
Oh, I don't give out my number, 

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,660
but rules are meant to be broken. 

83
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,790
I'm a law major, so I'm good with rules. 

84
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,770
Go, go and take care of it. 

85
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,770
The guests in the next room are complaining. 

86
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,300
Excuse me... 

87
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,210
Who are you? 

88
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,470
I'm sorry. I'm Heo Sedal, and I work here. 

89
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,070
So? 

90
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,840
Is there anything you need? 

91
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,750
Yes. I need you to get out. 

92
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,230
There was a complaint. 

93
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,790
You're like a noisy neighbor, so to speak. 

94
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,760
Get out. Leave me alone. 

95
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,950
I'll take that as a positive sign. 

96
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,130
If you need anything, speak instead of crying. 

97
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,020
What do you think about me? 

98
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,280
What do you mean? 

99
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,440
As a woman, how am I? 

100
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,560
I think you're not bad. 

101
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,410
Not bad?
Do you have a girlfriend? 

102
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,440
That's my dream, 

103
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,590
but my wife is a dragon lady, so I don't. 

104
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,440
You're married? 

105
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,890
I didn't mean to but... 

106
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,320
I thought I'd never get married, but one day 

107
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,890
I woke up and found myself married, 

108
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,340
which is tragic and horrible. 

109
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,610
Who's better, your wife or me? 

110
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,410
You're far better than my wife, of course. 

111
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,650
I can't even compare you to her. 

112
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,670
I don't know what anyone said to you, 

113
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,430
but don't lose hope, 

114
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,050
and please refrain from crying out loud. 

115
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,410
If you really want to cry, you can, 

116
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,620
but please do it under the blanket. 

117
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,300
Enjoy your stay. 

118
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,380
Okay, okay, okay. 

119
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,690
Dad! 

120
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,150
Yes! You even greet me differently now! 

121
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,700
I can hear how happy you are to see me. 

122
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,120
Your dad Sedal came home from work. 

123
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,940
From work, from work, from work, work, work... 

124
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,410
What's all that for? 

125
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,510
Commemorating my first day of work. 

126
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,860
It's a historical day. Write about it. 

127
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,050
Okay! 

128
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,770
I've decided to stay there permanently. 

129
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,210
Watch me.
I won't miss a day. 

130
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,930
This is cake and these are toys. 

131
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,290
Wow! 

132
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,160
- No!
- Mom, you're mean! 

133
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,640
I knew it. 

134
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,600
What's wrong with you? Huh? 

135
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,180
No. I'm exchanging these tomorrow. 

136
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,130
But the cake is okay. 

137
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:17,560
Happy first day of work! 

138
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:24,310
Happy first day of work, dear dad! 

139
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,520
I feel so great!
This is nutty, nutty, nuts! 

140
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,510
So amazing! 

141
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,010
Why are the lights off? 

142
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,280
Did you eat? 

143
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,070
I was always in the middle. 

144
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,410
With studying, with sports, 

145
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,930
with singing, with everything. 

146
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,900
My classmates and teachers, 

147
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,270
not many of them remember me. 

148
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,210
Hobak was a great student, won awards, 

149
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,740
was popular with other students, 

150
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,880
and even the teachers liked her. 

151
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,490
Me, only my mom loved me. 

152
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,730
I was an ordinary child who deserved no special attention. 

153
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,690
I wasn't bad to look at, a quiet girl. 

154
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,160
That was who I was. 

155
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,620
But, 

156
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,770
after I met you, my life changed. 

157
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,760
People started gathering around me. 

158
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,190
Thanks to you, I became Cinderella. 

159
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,590
With a house and furniture like this, 

160
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,950
with three bathrooms, 

161
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,580
a housekeeper and an imported car. 

162
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,380
I was like Cinderella who everyone envied. 

163
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:29,180
But the clock struck midnight. 

164
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,950
With the sound of the clock's chime, 

165
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,580
I must go back to being poor. 

166
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,950
Being driven to poverty like this, 

167
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,060
I can't do it. 

168
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,510
My father said this at an ethics class. 

169
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:57,370
God only gives you what you can handle. 

170
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,550
I can't handle this, 

171
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,740
so why is god putting me through this? 

172
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,660
What am I supposed to do? 

173
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,610
How am I supposed to handle this? 

174
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,650
Let's stay in Seoul. 

175
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,840
Let's rent a room or something. 

176
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,140
In return, give me just 3 years. 

177
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:08,030
I'll have you back here in 3 years. 

178
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,190
You must keep them in shipshape in order for them to last longer. 

179
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,050
They're just like people. 

180
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,900
You can't fix them if it's too late. 

181
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,850
Okay. 

182
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,420
Machines need to be taken care of. 

183
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,520
I'll remember that. 

184
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,790
I replaced two hydraulic jacks last time, 

185
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,290
but I think the others need replacing, too. 

186
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,660
Okay. And check the motor oil. 

187
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,850
Okay. 

188
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,830
Safety. 

189
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,830
First. 

190
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:48,330
I'm very sorry, but the file is gone.
What should I do? 

191
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,950
I didn't want to send this reply, 

192
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,980
but I'm forced to. 

193
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,590
I trusted you, but you fooled me twice. 

194
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,890
Go to hell. 

195
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,570
Hello? 

196
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,820
I understand why you feel this way. 

197
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,300
It may sound like a joke but I swear. 

198
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,090
The file disappeared, 

199
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,650
and I had a print out, but it's gone. 

200
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,560
I'm serious. Please believe me. 

201
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,640
I'll get my computer repaired 

202
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,510
and prove it to you. 

203
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,140
Sangnam? 

204
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,000
Hello? 

205
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,930
Ugh! Wang Daebak! 

206
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:50,970
Here. 

207
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,380
Why couldn't I find it? 

208
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,980
Where are you going so late? 

209
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,240
I have a date. 

210
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,290
I wish! 

211
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,380
I won't be difficult, so get married. 

212
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,150
How about you?
You don't want to remarry? 

213
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,850
Excuse me? 

214
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,250
You can't live alone forever. 

215
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,420
You're still young. 

216
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,790
If there's a nice man, I won't say no. 

217
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,360
Really? 

218
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,240
Daese, I'm happy as I am. 

219
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,000
Unless you're happy, I'd like to leave things as they are. 

220
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,270
But you're lonely. 

221
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,910
I have no time to feel lonely. 

222
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,120
I'm busy taking care of Miho. 

223
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,560
And there's too much to do around the house. 

224
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,010
Taking care of you and Sangnam is a lot of work. 

225
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,090
It's just that I'm worried about Miho, too. 

226
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,490
She needs a father's love. 

227
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,470
I'm trying my best, 

228
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,790
but I'm only her uncle. 

229
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,990
- Would you like me to lift you up?
- Yes. 

230
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,610
Okay. One, two, three! 

231
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,680
Dad, one more time. 

232
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,840
Okay. Are you ready? 

233
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,350
One, two, three. 

234
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,940
Siyeong, you're great!
My little girl. 

235
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,200
Do you want to go to an amusement park? 

236
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,540
Mommy, don't they sell dads anywhere? 

237
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,170
I wish we could go and buy a dad. 

238
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,470
You came here alone?
Can I join you? 

239
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,210
I'm not here alone. I'm sorry. 

240
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,010
What's up? 

241
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,250
Were you working on her? 

242
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,180
I only work at the construction site. 

243
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,490
I wanted to have a drink with you. 

244
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,130
It can't be work. 

245
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,460
Is it a woman? 

246
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,040
It's not. 

247
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,100
You got hurt. 

248
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,070
I really believed 

249
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,670
she understood my work and why I do it. 

250
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,350
Let it go. 

251
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,430
You can't change how people think overnight. 

252
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,660
Do women really dislike technicians? 

253
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,460
It's the society that made them that way. 

254
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,340
They only like white collar workers. 

255
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,300
Did you tell her you own the company? 

256
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,060
No, I didn't. 

257
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,560
Why didn't you? 

258
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,470
Not only do you run it, but you own it. 

259
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,000
What does that matter? 

260
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,760
I started out as a heavy equipment operator. 

261
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,380
I couldn't like a woman who would like me because I own a company. 

262
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,210
Do you like that reporter? 

263
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,260
She's not my type. 

264
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,780
Ugh. 

265
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,430
I'm here. I just need to park my car. 

266
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,650
I'll be right up. 

267
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,220
What are you doing? 

268
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,870
I'm sorry. 

269
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,350
I'm sorry. 

270
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,910
I'm sorry. I'll be up soon. 

271
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,710
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'll pull out. 

272
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,170
I'll help you park. 

273
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,370
I can't do it. 

274
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,680
Just do what I tell you to do. 

275
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,580
- Okay.
- Pull up a little. 

276
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,700
Stop. Turn the handle to the left halfway. 

277
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,830
Back up. 

278
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,660
Stop. Pull up a bit. Just a bit. 

279
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,020
Stop! 

280
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,360
Make the steering wheel vertical. 

281
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,280
Back up. 

282
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,280
More, more, more.
Unwind the steering wheel. 

283
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,560
Okay. Stop. 

284
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,920
Oh, how amazing! 

285
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,320
I did it! I parked my car. Thank... 

286
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,720
Excuse me... 

287
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,810
- This?
- Yes, thank you so much. 

288
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,760
The person you have called is not available... 

289
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,020
There is one new message. 

290
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,660
Press 1 to listen, 2 for information... 

291
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,660
First message. 

292
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,750
I remembered. 

293
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,930
I told you we've met before. 

294
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,790
I went to a publisher last winter, 

295
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,630
and I was having trouble parallel parking, 

296
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,930
and you helped me. 

297
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,070
You helped me parallel park with ease. 

298
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,070
It was so amazing. 

299
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,910
There's something special between us. 

300
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,770
Please call me when you hear this, okay? 

301
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,230
Oh, you can't get a 2 bedroom with that little. 

302
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,020
You can't even get a 1 bedroom. 

303
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,890
They just don't have that. 

304
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,620
I have something that's perfect for you. 

305
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,130
Would you like to see it? 

306
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,820
Yes. 

307
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,720
The owner's in a hurry, so the price is great. 

308
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,290
There are two bathrooms? 

309
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,780
Yes, we're in a hurry, so we're selling it below the market value. 

310
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,790
I see. 

311
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,540
This is the only thing available for that price. 

312
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,880
Okay. 

313
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,760
Subak. 

314
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,800
If you hang new wallpaper, it'd be better. 

315
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,940
We don't have time for that. 

316
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,880
We have to move today. 

317
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,290
Please hold on. 

318
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,630
Subak! 

319
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,160
This is a lucky apartment. 

320
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,420
My kids were healthy and did well at school, 

321
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,700
and now we're moving to a bigger place. 

322
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,790
You are? 

323
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,570
I hope I get that kind of luck, too. 

324
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,840
Thank you. Goodbye. 

325
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,350
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

[Apartment purchase contract
Name: Wang Hobak
Name: Heo Sedal] 

327
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,230
Huh? 

328
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,390
Sis. 

329
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,390
Hobak. 

330
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,700
Minjung doesn't like scallions. 

331
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,670
And he eats instant noodles without eggs. 

332
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,680
How do you know that? 

333
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,440
I worked at your house for many years. 

334
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,680
Put the rice in the soup. 

335
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,380
Minjung, you too. 

336
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,770
Would you like some boiled beef? 

337
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,370
Subak, would you like some?
My treat. 

338
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,200
What's going on? 

339
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,110
You never spend any money. 

340
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,770
I'm just happy to see you. 

341
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,460
Running into you unexpectedly is great. 

342
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,630
If it happens again, 
you just might go slaughter a cow. 

343
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,900
It's just lunch so lets keep it simple. 

344
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,240
Okay, then. 

345
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,550
Minjung, you shouldn't skip your meals. 

346
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,220
You've gotten so thin. 

347
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,180
Is my husband the only person you see? 

348
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,080
You're skin and bones too. 

349
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,400
There's no need to mention it. 

350
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,480
You should eat. 

351
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,020
How can I eat at a time like this? 

352
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,660
I'm barely breathing! 

353
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,780
You eat fine. 
I don't understand why you lost weight. 

354
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,310
People would think I'm stressing you out. 

355
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,090
Did you buy an apartment? 

356
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,480
Huh? 

357
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,650
You told mom you're buying an apartment. 

358
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,310
Well, I... 

359
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,720
Are you buying an apartment? 

360
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,980
No, not yet. 

361
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,910
Then why did you see a realtor? 

362
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,570
I wanted some information. 

363
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,100
Why did you see one? 

364
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,850
We're looking for an apartment. 

365
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,190
That's no apartment! It's just a room! 

366
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,280
You're staying in Seoul? 

367
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,900
Subak can't handle it, so what else could I do other than renting a room? 

368
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,060
Subak, that's great. 

369
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,600
Good for you, Minjung. 

370
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,690
Renting a room is great? 

371
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,590
Can't you be more careful with words? 

372
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,540
That's not what she meant. 

373
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,540
Are you on her side too? 

374
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,370
Oh, Subak. 

375
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,290
Let's eat. 

376
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,660
We must hurry if we want to move today. 

377
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,730
You're moving today? 

378
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,890
We have to move out by today. 

379
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,270
Then you should hurry. 

380
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,270
Where's your apartment? 

381
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,180
I said it isn't an apartment! 

382
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,400
I said it's just a room! 

383
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,070
Subak... 

384
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,220
Let's go. People will show up soon. 

385
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,160
Come on. 

386
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,840
There. 

387
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,880
Oh, my! Oh, my! 

388
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,610
Oh, man... 

389
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,710
It's all built in. 

390
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,220
We'll hang the wallpaper later. 

391
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,920
We'll find time. 

392
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,820
A mouse! Mouse! 

393
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,420
Come back. It's gone. 

394
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,840
No, no! 

395
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,140
It won't bite you. 

396
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,860
I said no! 

397
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,820
I can't live in a place like that. 

398
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,010
I feel bad for the dishes. 

399
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,380
These are all from England. 

400
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,820
What are you looking for? 

401
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,040
There might be mice and roaches. 

402
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,420
Poor Subak... 

403
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,080
Are you happy she's here? 

404
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,910
You're sisters!
You could've lent her money. 

405
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,140
Did you think she'd run off with that? 

406
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,480
Subak paid you $100 to wash the dishes. 

407
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,420
You could buy a house with the money she gave you. 

408
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,490
You saw a realtor earlier? 

409
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,480
Did you buy a place or something? 

410
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,370
I was just getting information. 

411
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,990
How could you pick now to buy an apartment? 

412
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,130
It's like you're trying to stick it to her. 

413
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,610
Don't be disrespectful to Subak. 

414
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,680
I asked around and she has amazing fortune. 

415
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:28,070
Those around her can benefit from her great fortune. 

416
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,310
Do you understand that? 

417
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,550
I'm sure you don't understand. 

418
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,120
Mom! 

419
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,350
How about the bathroom? 

420
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,110
It's communal. 

421
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,520
It's communal? 

422
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,270
The tenants must take turns cleaning it. 

423
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,990
That's not good! 

424
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:53,600
Your sister can't do it so you do it. 

425
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,400
I'll do it on my days off. 

426
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,500
But I've been really busy... 

427
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,320
You'd find time if you're serious about it. 

428
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,690
Hey, you're good. 

429
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,690
I'm great wife material. 

430
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,130
You change her diaper. 

431
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,050
Ugh, incredible. 

432
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,200
You won't change our kids diapers later on? 

433
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Then I'll run away! 

434
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,940
We'll talk about that later. 

435
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,210
Rock, paper, scissors! 

436
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,400
Hold on, Jungji. 

437
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,680
You come back here! 

438
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,170
It smells! Come back here! 

439
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,450
Congratulations on moving into a new place. 

440
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,200
New place my butt. 

441
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,290
This is a house warming party. Applause! 

442
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,290
Applause my butt! 

443
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:21,990
Happy apartment rental... 

444
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:28,160
Happy moving dear Subak and Minjung 

445
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,080
Stop that! Happy rental apartment? 

446
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,380
Why should we applaud? I could cry! 

447
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,050
Why would you cry? 

448
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,230
They just moved, so we should applaud them. 

449
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:44,780
Minjung, Subak, blow out the candle. 

450
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,160
Say something. Thank us for coming. 

451
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,010
You sure are excited. 

452
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,200
Me? 

453
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,320
You're right. 

454
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,040
I'm excited. 

455
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,840
I, Heo Sedal, finally got a job. 

456
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,360
You got a job?
That's great. 

457
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,790
When?
You never told me that. 

458
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,380
I'm telling you now. 

459
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,710
Traitor! How could you do that? 

460
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,190
Where is it? 

461
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,450
The hotel he worked at briefly before. 

462
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:31,080
We sang "Happy first day of work" and blew out a candle, too. 

463
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,560
Why? You'll probably quit any day now. 

464
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,150
Don't worry, mother. 

465
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,850
I promised Hobak I won't quit this time. 

466
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,710
Lots of great things are happening now. 

467
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,550
I got a job and Minjung moved. 

468
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,050
Are you joking? 

469
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,290
Of course not. 

470
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,380
His business is my business, and vice versa. 

471
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,160
I'm just trying to lighten up the mood. 

472
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,530
My heart is being torn apart too. 

473
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,760
There's no need for that. 

474
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,000
You've hit bottom, so the only way to go is up now. 

475
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,550
Yes, sir. 

476
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,620
Actually, living in a place like this will make you love each other more. 

477
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,340
You can't sleep in separate rooms. 

478
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,930
This is better than the place we lived in when we first got married. 

479
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,070
It was much smaller, wasn't it? 

480
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,030
We climbed up from the bottom, 

481
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,880
and you're going down from the top. 

482
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,540
You're climbing up, 

483
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,690
and Minjung's climbing down. 

484
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,340
Will you two meet in the middle? 

485
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,960
You're very smart, mother. 

486
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,530
Life has ups and downs. 

487
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,470
When you're down, you can take a break. 

488
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,840
What's life?
If you don't own, you rent. 

489
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,620
Either unemployed or have a part time job. 

490
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,170
I wasn't going to say that but it came out. 

491
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,240
If you climb up or down, 

492
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,420
own or rent, you two are the most important. 

493
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,290
When you're poor, you get into fights, 

494
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,640
and lots of people divorce because of that. 

495
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,160
I believe in Minjung. 

496
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,310
I'm giving it 3 years. 

497
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,010
We must live here for 3 years? 

498
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,870
You can do it. 

499
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,730
Others live here. 

500
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,920
Who knows?
It might take 3 or 30 years. 

501
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,070
If words were all it took, 

502
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,040
I'd own at least 12 homes by now. 

503
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,060
Sedal, you're right. 

504
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,900
Words mean nothing. 

505
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,210
Oh my poor daughter. 

506
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,870
I raised her as a princess. 

507
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,310
I'm sorry, mom. 

508
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,330
I never wanted you to see this. 

509
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,480
I'm sorry, father. 

510
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,640
I meant to do well. 

511
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,700
I'm sorry you had to see this. 

512
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,750
Oh, mommy! 

513
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,460
- What is it? What?
- Mom! 

514
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,140
What is it? What? 

515
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,310
Oh, it's just a roach. 

516
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,260
How can you kill that with your bare hand? 

517
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,070
We had lots of practice where we used to live. 

518
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,190
She's really good at it. 

519
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,740
She doesn't need any tissue. Ugh. 

520
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,490
You should kill all the roaches for them. 

521
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,340
Oh, she can kill mice, too. 

522
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,750
My poor Subak... 

523
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,480
Why should you feel that way? 

524
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,860
Is her husband or kid dead? 

525
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,820
She just lost money. 

526
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,560
How can she live in an apartment filled with mice and roaches? 

527
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,080
Why not? 

528
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,710
She doesn't work so she can kill the roaches and mice. 

529
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,520
Didn't you see Hobak? 

530
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,970
She can fend for herself because she can kill them. 

531
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:07,190
Who told you killing roaches means you can fend for yourself? 

532
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,450
I did. 

533
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,490
Others live there. 

534
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:15,230
Whatever they do, just leave them alone. 

535
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,230
She'll become a better person. 

536
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,500
Are you saying Subak isn't a good person? 

537
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,650
I can't believe my ears! 

538
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:28,040
She had you take care of her girls and the housekeeper run the house. 

539
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,790
She worked her husband like a slave! 

540
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,670
It's not a crime to have a good life. 

541
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,270
It is. 

542
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,320
When you give birth, you must be a mother. 

543
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,390
She's old but she's a crybaby. 

544
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,770
You tell my mother she spoils Don, 

545
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,950
but you're no different. 

546
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,460
Subak and Don aren't the same! 

547
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,460
How can you compare those two? 

548
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,840
You're still up? 

549
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,700
I must check on my grandson. 

550
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,550
If it weren't for him, 

551
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,660
the family name would have died out. 

552
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,860
Anggeum must treasure him. 

553
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,280
You shouldn't treasure your children. 

554
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,490
You should love them, 

555
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,860
but you must be strict with them. 

556
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,990
You're right. 

557
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,190
If you love your children, you must be strict. 

558
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,840
You're upset about Subak, aren't you? 

559
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,800
You must feel like you lost your right hand. 

560
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,480
You could rely on Minjung before, 

561
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,940
but now, he lost it all. 

562
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,350
When your children are in trouble, it breaks your heart. 

563
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:17,140
Oh, the trouble we're in right now... 

564
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,730
The Korean War was nothing compared to this. 

565
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,630
I wish I could help them out. 

566
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:29,210
You raised them and married them off. 

567
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,020
What else could you do? 

568
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,900
If it weren't for him, 

569
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,280
I would help them out with my severance pay and get them a better apartment. 

570
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,950
Don't be so stupid. 

571
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,350
Excuse me? 

572
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:41,940
Don't let them take advantage of you. 

573
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,500
Don't let your kids suck you dry. 

574
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,890
Leave your severance pay alone. 

575
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:51,700
You need money when you're old. 

576
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,020
Don't give it to anyone.
Hold onto it. 

577
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,170
And don't give it to Anggeum, understand? 

578
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,090
Hello? 

579
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,500
How can you sleep?
How can you? 

580
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,360
Oh, mom. 

581
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,520
Don't you feel bad for your sister? 

582
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,750
How can you sleep after seeing her like that? 

583
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,290
You're heartless. 

584
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:28,630
How could you be like that? 

585
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,870
You're really something. 

586
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:34,850
I feel lost after seeing her like that, and you're sleeping? 

587
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,770
You're heartless. I'm hanging up. 

588
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,810
Ugh... 

589
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,060
Oh, you're Sintong's aunt! 

590
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,970
- Hello.
- Where are you going? 

591
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,240
To my mom's house. 

592
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,700
You look pretty bad for someone who was in the Miss Korea pageant. 

593
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,300
You look awful. 

594
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,270
What happened to you? 

595
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,990
Oh, I heard you have mice at your place. 

596
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,550
Yes and roaches. 

597
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:47,850
But I'm in a hurry. 

598
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:51,710
I heard your husband is in parcel service. 

599
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,990
My son works at a hotel. 

600
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:56,420
I heard. Congratulations. Goodbye. 

601
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,220
It must be really tough for you. 

602
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,660
Why don't you get a job, like Hobak? 

603
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,560
I'm in a hurry. 

604
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,030
I know. 

605
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,520
Should I ask around? 

606
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,140
You have a college degree, right? 

607
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,900
I must get going. 

608
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,630
Why are you sweating? 

609
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,270
You look sick.
Would you like to sit down? 

610
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,970
It's okay.
I'll see you again. 

611
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,240
I'm not going to let her get away with it. 

612
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,220
What's wrong with her? 

613
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,000
Why couldn't she just let her go? 

614
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,380
I can't believe I'm washing poo out of my daughter's pants. 

615
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,670
- What are you doing?
- Mother! 

616
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,460
What are you washing? 

617
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,320
It doesn't concern you. 

618
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,420
Is someone making fermented soybeans? 

619
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,850
Fermented soybeans? 

620
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:15,050
Who's making that? Who? 

621
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,910
It smells really good. 

622
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:20,390
Hey, let's make some too. 

623
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:25,800
I've been craving fermented soybeans for a couple days now. 

624
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,780
Please don't mention that. 

625
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,410
Yes, Daese. 

626
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:54,540
Sunjeong, I'm getting a package today. 

627
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,160
Okay. 

628
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,300
Hello. 

629
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,760
What's up, little girl? 

630
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,930
I'm not a little girl.
I'm Daebak's girlfriend. 

631
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,430
I know. 

632
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:45,200
You're the little girl who's after Daebak. 

633
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,110
I'm not after him. 

634
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:50,860
What do you want? 

635
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,950
Daebak's at the teachers office. 

636
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,980
I need to talk to you. 

637
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:03,470
Me? About what? 

638
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,880
What's this? 

639
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,720
It's a yellow card. 

640
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,180
A yellow card? 

641
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:18,340
They use this when they play soccer. 

642
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,330
You know what it means, don't you? 

643
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,130
Don't flirt with Daebak again. 

644
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,720
If you do, I'm giving you a red card. 

645
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,350
You know what comes after that, don't you? 

646
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:29,350
Expulsion. 

647
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,350
What are you doing? 

648
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,880
What are you doing at my school? 

649
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,460
Daebak, I was waiting for you. 

650
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,190
Let's go, Daebak. 

651
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,720
Hold on. 

652
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,970
Are you going to the academy? 

653
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,180
Daebak! 

654
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,750
Fine, I'm coming. 

655
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,530
Daebak, what should we eat? 

656
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,580
Oh, she's cute. 

657
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,090
She's so funny. 

658
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:59,810
Daebak is incredible. 

659
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,540
Bye, Haebak! 

660
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,750
Hello. 

661
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,720
I want to send this by certified mail. 

662
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,470
Okay. 

663
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:59,900
He asked me for my high school yearbooks. 

664
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,400
So I told him they got lost in the fire. 

665
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,710
Slap them on the mouth when they say that. 

666
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:08,610
How dare they... 

667
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,800
Hey, hey! 

668
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,690
If that's who you'd set me up with, forget it! 

669
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,190
How dare she! 

670
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,330
You can't tell I got work done. 

671
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,640
Everyone gets that much work done. 

672
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,480
You can't tell you got any. 

673
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,890
Don't you agree? 

674
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,050
Excuse me? 

675
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:27,710
You're too young to have worries! 

676
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:29,500
Your face is filled with worries. 

677
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,920
I can tell you have some sad stories to tell. 

678
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,720
Oh. 

679
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,600
There are rumors about you. 

680
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,080
Rumors? 

681
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:44,150
They're saying you living with your brother in law is weird. 

682
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,630
Is it okay to live with your brother in law? 

683
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,380
I guess you could. 

684
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,730
If they're divorced, it should be fine. 

685
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:53,730
It's not like that. 

686
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,640
I have a reason. 

687
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,800
We are still related. 

688
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,390
Aunt Sunjeong. 

689
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,620
Yes? 

690
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,550
Should I wait for you? 

691
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:06,610
It's okay. You go ahead. I'll catch up. 

692
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,510
Okay. Take your time and get more pretty. 

693
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,380
Who's that? The son? 

694
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,300
Yes, he's my nephew. 

695
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,230
Oh, wow. 

696
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,310
This car is... 

697
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,910
It's a wise choice. This car is... 

698
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:35,930
Shh... 

699
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:49,380
Yay! This is nutty, nutty, nuts! 

700
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,910
This is nuts! 

701
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,570
Hey! You stop right there! 

702
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,970
Hey! Come here! 

703
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:10,260
You! Hey! 

704
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,390
Hey! 

705
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,850
Are you out of your mind? Are you? 

706
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:16,960
A car is a man's pride. 

707
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,420
How dare you! 

708
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,190
I'm going to kill you! 

709
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,240
Hey, my shoes... 

710
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,560
So? I can't return it? 

711
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,470
Hey! Who says I can't return a car? 

712
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:40,790
Stop talking nonsense! 

713
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:43,670
Hobak, open the door. 

714
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,920
Hobak. 

715
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,900
Hobak, the door! 

716
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,120
Hobak! Hobak! 

717
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,680
You've been out here all this time? 

718
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,950
Why are you back so late? 

719
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:58,810
Hey! Open the door! My mom's here. 

720
00:52:58,810 --> 00:52:59,860
And the sister. 

721
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,480
My sister's here, too.
Open the door! 

722
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,560
Hobak! 

723
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,870
Open it! 

724
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,190
No! 

725
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:10,790
I need to teach him a lesson. 

726
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,320
You're being really stuffy. 

727
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,030
Everyone needs a car these days. 

728
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,500
We should have one too. 

729
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,770
Of course! 

730
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,280
Open! Open! Open! 

731
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,680
What are you doing? 

732
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:27,260
Open! Open! Open! 

733
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,150
Who doesn't have a car these days? 

734
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:32,950
Mom, go for it. Open! 

735
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:35,840
Open it now! You're embarrassing us. 

736
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,330
- Open!
- He has a job. He can get a car! 

737
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,850
Mother! 

738
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,390
There's so many packages to deliver. 

739
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,730
I don't think I can go home this year. 

740
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,690
That's that, but why can't Subak come? 

741
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,350
I can't send her alone. 

742
00:53:58,350 --> 00:53:59,650
Why not? 

743
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,680
She's acting like that because of you! 

744
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,570
She's been sick lately.
She hasn't been well. 

745
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,490
I'm sorry, Minsuk. 

746
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,400
I'll drop by and see father another time. 

747
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,070
So please take care of... 

748
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:18,110
Minsuk! 

749
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,600
Hello? 

750
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,600
Here. 

751
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,620
What is it? 

752
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,870
A chamber pot. 

753
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:50,920
Use this. 

754
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,220
Using the communal bathroom is hard,  

755
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,820
and you can't run to your mother's place every time. 

756
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,290
I don't want this. 

757
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,570
I heard it's convenient. Use it. 

758
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:00,930
I said no! 

759
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,700
Must you make me feel pathetic? 

760
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,970
What do you mean? 

761
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,020
You're making me feel pathetic. 

762
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:11,070
Did you think I'd thank you for this? 

763
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:12,760
It's embarrassing, humiliating, 

764
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,130
and it feels like my face is on fire. 

765
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:19,130
Do you know how embarrassing it is to not be able to hold it in? 

766
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,430
And now you want me to use a chamber pot? 

767
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:25,390
You know how I get constipated whenever I'm away from home! 

768
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,410
We'll get through it. 

769
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,770
It's only for 3 years. 

770
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:33,510
How can I not poo for 3 years? 

771
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,350
I'm not tell you to do that! 

772
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:36,990
Use this. 

773
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:38,400
Everyone else does it. 

774
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,770
I got this at the market, and it means others use it too. 

775
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,850
That's not embarrassing! Just go here! 

776
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,030
Stop it! 

777
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:48,990
I was in the Miss Korea pageant! 

778
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,510
Oh, man! 

779
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,850
A blind date? 

780
00:55:58,850 --> 00:55:59,830
Yes. 

781
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:02,080
You saw her at the beauty salon. 

782
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,320
I didn't. Is she pretty? 

783
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,760
I would've remembered if she were pretty. 

784
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,760
She's got a face most men would like. 

785
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,640
Would you like to meet her? 

786
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,280
Why not? You're hooking us up after all. 

787
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,030
Not really. She asked me to. 

788
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,930
She fell for you the moment she saw you. 

789
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:19,220
So just give her a chance. 

790
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,880
Okay. 

791
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,880
Sangnam, 

792
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,380
I'm saying this out of concern, 

793
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,740
and I know I might be overreacting... 

794
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,620
Don't beat around the bush. 

795
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,380
Don't hold onto the past. 

796
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,790
It'll only make your life hard. 

797
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,180
Do you still have feelings for her? 

798
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:44,800
She was your first, so it would be hard. 

799
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,400
But she broke your heart, so forget her. 

800
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,670
Sangnam, 

801
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:58,450
I just want you to be happy. 

802
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:01,250
Not pretending to be happy, 

803
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,280
but really, truly happy. 

804
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,890
You know what I mean, don't you? 

805
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,260
I will be. 

806
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:16,330
But I'd like to ask the same of you. 

807
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,620
I want you to be happy, too. 

808
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:22,010
I'm happy. I have everything I need. 

809
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,570
Sangnam, let's go. 

810
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,080
I'm coming. 

811
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,850
Oh, aunt, your hair looks pretty. 

812
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:29,750
You're the best. 

813
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,120
I'm going to hell. 

814
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,890
Bastard. I hope you're happy! 

815
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:59,500
You don't trust anyone, do you? 

816
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,920
I can't seem to be able to become like you. 

817
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,930
It doesn't happen overnight. 

818
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,600
Are you coming from somewhere? 

819
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,540
The academy. I got bored. 

820
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,920
I thought your grades were bad. 

821
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,950
The kid who's head of the class cries when he gets his report card. 

822
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:27,480
I don't get it. 

823
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,480
How much more must you study to not cry? 

824
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:37,000
It seems like you're the only one who can be successful in your family so work hard. 

825
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,610
Okay. I will. 

826
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:41,040
I'm leaving. 

827
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,210
Goodbye. 

828
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,680
Here. 

829
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:53,340
I found it on my sister's desk. Read it. 

830
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,590
She wrote great things about you. 

831
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:57,590
But don't fall for her. 

832
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:59,100
She's not pretty.

The mobile phone has been turned off... 

835
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:40,830
Where are you going? 

836
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:42,140
Hey! Sangnam! 

837
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,090
Answer your phone! 

838
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:58,060
What? 

839
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,860
Why did you turn your phone off? 

840
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,270
I turned my phone off because...

01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,180
Hello? 

843
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,140
Come to the playground right now. 

844
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,350
Hello? 

845
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,710
Hey! 

846
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:30,180
Fine. I'm coming. I am! 

847
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:33,560
You want a piece of me? 

848
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,330
Fine! I'll give you a piece of me! 

849
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:38,210
You reckless bastard. 

850
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,400
This late? Crazy bastard. 

851
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,040
I'm here! What do you want? You bastard! 

852
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:55,790
Why did you want to see me this late? 

853
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:58,780
You don't understand how I feel... 

854
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:02,340
You really shouldn't live like that. 

855
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:06,560
You should learn to trust people. 

856
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,760
You think I would deceive you? For what? 

857
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:15,560
I don't even care about you. 

858
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,220
I cut you out. Snip! 

859
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,280
Are you disgusted? 

860
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,370
I'm the one who's disgusted. 

861
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:28,550
I got fired because of you. 

862
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:32,530
Like my mom said,
I'm having a bad year. 

863
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:37,960
I was going to treat you to dinner with the money from the article! 

864
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,820
But forget it! 

865
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:47,360
I think of you when I open my eyes in the morning. 

866
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,670
What the heck. 

867
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:53,860
When I open my eyes, I think of you. 

868
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:59,060
You! First thing. Crap! 

869
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:03,750
I told you we met before. 

870
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:08,750
You taught me how to park last winter. 

871
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,950
I could park at once. 

872
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,630
You were pretty amazing back then. 

873
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,560
Why would you ignore my texts? 

874
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,530
I'm not playing games, you jerk! 

875
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,480
Is there anything you want to say? No? 

876
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,660
Bye. 

877
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,920
I'm going to hell. 

878
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:36,140
You go to heaven and I'll go to hell. 

879
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:43,410
Let's go. Let's go to hell.

881
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:08,710
I think I got drunk and made a mistake. 

882
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:11,190
I'm not this kind of woman. 

883
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:14,460
I'd love to have a drink but I have plans. 

884
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,510
That's too bad. I'd like to, too. 

885
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,010
Hello? Is this 911? 

886
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:23,110
Are you hiding something from me? 

887
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:25,830
No. Subak, I have to go back to work. 

888
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:28,470
How much longer will you ask your mom to take the kids? 

889

I regret marrying you,

and I regret having the girls! Satisfied?
