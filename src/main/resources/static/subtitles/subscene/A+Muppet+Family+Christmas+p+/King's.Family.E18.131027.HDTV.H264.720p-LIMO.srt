00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,140
My baby, come on, baby.

3
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,130
Oppa!

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,290
This is nuts.

5
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,740
Woohoo!

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,740
Woohoo!

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,540
Will your gaze meet mine?

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,660
My heart bounce, bounces

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,600
I fear it might just jump right out from me

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,100
Woohoo!

11
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,960
Sintong, Bangtong,

12
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,340
let's go out.

13
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,340
Woohoo!

14
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,690
We're going on a picnic, too! How exciting!

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,900
Are we going to an amusement park?

16
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,570
Sure!

17
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,870
Let's go everywhere we want.

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,900
When someone changes suddenly, they die.

19
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,460
Grandmother said so.

20
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,030
I don't care if I die.

21
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,440
I just want to go to an amusement park.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,660
Why would anyone die?

23
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,930
We must go on living with tenacity!

24
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,200
Sintong, Bangtong,

25
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,440
I'm going to live a long life.

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,530
I'm going to live a very long life so I can

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,490
go to your weddings and see your lovely brides and your children.

28
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm going to wait for my turn and pay him back for what he did.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,060
I'm going to live to see that day.

30
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,630
Hey, Hobak.

31
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,190
Oh? Sintong, Bangtong, you're here!

32
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,770
Auntie!

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,660
Come in.

34
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,740
It's okay.

35
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,370
Come in. Who cares?

36
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,840
It's actually father's house.

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,740
Maybe later.

38
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,600
Let's go out.

39
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,630
Go out?

40
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,040
I have a deadline, so I can't go far.

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,060
We were going to go to an amusement park.

42
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,530
Let's go somewhere closer today.

43
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,590
We'll go to an amusement park another day.

44
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,660
I want to go to an amusement park!

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,300
I'll take you next time.

46
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,400
Let's go somewhere close today, okay?

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,770
Daebak's home, isn't he?

48
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,900
His girlfriend is here, too.

49
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,490
Let's take them.

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,660
And,

51
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,960
this.

52
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,190
It's for mom. She likes fried tofu sushi.

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,600
I brought lots of food like glass noodles,  tempura and pork cutlets.

54
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,960
What's gotten into you?

55
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,190
If I have to go on living,

56
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,270
might as well make it fun.

57
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,400
Glad to hear that. Just a minute.

58
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,270
Hold on.

59
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,140
Hobak brought fried tofu sushi for you.

60
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,940
Your favorite, mom.

61
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,590
She left after handing that to you?

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,230
Should I ask her to come in?

63
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,370
No.

64
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,800
Wow.

65
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,640
Anyone can make that.

66
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,440
I just don't bother to make it.

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,190
Why is she sending food over?

68
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,770
She should come and beg me to forgive her.

69
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,870
This is a form of asking for forgiveness.

70
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,270
Just forgive her, mom.

71
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,960
She's not doing so well these days.

72
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,860
Why is that?

73
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,760
Sedal has a good job, she moved to a new place,

74
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,270
and she doesn't have to see me.

75
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,000
If you ask me, she has the best life.

76
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,100
No, she doesn't.

77
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,590
Did something happen to Hobak?

78
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,230
Well...

79
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,340
Don't say anything to mom or dad.

80
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,900
I'm sure she has problems.

81
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,660
She just doesn't like to talk about them.

82
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,770
She doesn't like to talk?

83
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,940
That's the funniest thing I ever heard.

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,360
Nobody is more devious than her.

85
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,960
She's just like her grandmother.

86
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,290
She's not. She's your daughter.

87
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,690
You must have hated grandmother.

88
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,340
They say you take after the person you hate.

89
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,960
You should reach out first.

90
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,700
Not all family members can get along.

91
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,460
You and Hobak are a little off, that's all.

92
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,290
Should I ask her over later?

93
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,130
Why? If she really wanted to, she could.

94
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,660
I'm going to be watching her...

95
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,960
Eat this and get over it.

96
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,070
I'm going on a picnic with Daebak and Miho.

97
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,960
Here.

98
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,400
It's good.

99
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,900
Your grandmother's bored,

100
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,400
so hang out with her.

101
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,590
Grandmother!

102
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,660
Here's the sunlight!

103
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,340
I'm old and my body is getting old, too.

104
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat?

105
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,960
I'm tired of cooking and ordering in.

106
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,590
Being dumped is making me hungry.

107
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm always thinking about food.

108
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,840
When you're lonely, you feel hungry.

109
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,190
Should we go to Sedal's place?

110
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,960
Let's ask Hobak to make us some soup.

111
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,860
Should we?

112
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,200
- You cooked all this?
- Yes.

113
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,090
What a beautiful flower!

114
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,340
Excuse me.

115
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,340
These flowers are so beautiful.

116
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,840
Okay. Come over when you're done.

117
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,070
Uncle's coming, too.

118
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,770
Great. We have lots of food.

119
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,770
Hello?

120
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,370
Hello? I can't hear you.

121
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,460
You should say "Hello, mother,"
instead of "I can't hear you."

122
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,400
Mother, I'm sorry. I'm out.

123
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,200
Out where?

124
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,670
I'm on a picnic.

125
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,290
I thought I'd take the boys out.

126
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,490
You only care about your boys?

127
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,370
You don't care about your mother in law.

128
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,430
What goes around comes around!

129
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,770
Good job, mom. Crush her later.

130
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,240
Should we order black bean noodles?

131
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,960
Order sweet and sour pork, too.

132
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,570
You can think better on a full stomach, so let's eat first.

133
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,460
Oh, it's so nice to be outside like this.

134
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,960
I wish the whole family was here.

135
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,590
let's ask father to have a family picnic!

136
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,840
We should.

137
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,460
Is it good?

138
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,990
Yes. I never had this kind of food before.

139
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,270
I'll tell her to make more.

140
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,660
Oh, eat up.

141
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,490
This bowl makes it even more delicious.

142
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,590
You've changed a lot.

143
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,840
You only ate out of pretty bowls.

144
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,990
I know.

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,130
I was in the Miss Korea pageant.

146
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,640
You say that all the time,

147
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,340
but to be honest,

148
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,670
when I hear it, it breaks my heart.

149
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,230
The others don't know what happened,

150
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,390
and they joke about you getting eliminated,

151
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,230
but you and I know the truth.

152
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,060
Of all days...

153
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,070
Whenever I think about that day,

154
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,070
like grandmother says,

155
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,670
the Korean War was nothing.

156
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,960
Your father almost divorced me.

157
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,770
Hobak won't say anything, will she?

158
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,790
I warned her never to mention it.

159
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,400
She only thinks about what happened to her.

160
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,390
She's forgotten about what she did to you.

161
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,730
Mom, it's all in the past, so let's forget it.

162
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,090
What's the use of dwelling on it?

163
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,070
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

164
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,300
Subak.

165
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,740
Yes. Did you eat? Everyone went out.

166
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,490
I know. I'm joining them.

167
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,070
Do you want to come?

168
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,170
It's okay.

169
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,590
You should eat more.

170
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,570
You lost a lot of weight.

171
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,790
I lost 3 kilograms.

172
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,370
3 kilograms?

173
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,070
You were skinny to begin with.

174
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,900
I was a nervous wreck.

175
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,090
That was me.

176
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,130
They were turning me into a nervous wreck.

177
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,290
What gave you the strength for this picnic?

178
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,440
Because I have to go on.

179
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:16,700
I had to snap out of it,
 so I can take care of them.

180
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,590
Good, Hobak.

181
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,300
This will pass.

182
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,560
I don't know.

183
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,130
This never happened before.

184
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,960
When he falls for something, he loses all his senses, so I don't know.

185
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,060
Will we be able to stay together?

186
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,940
He loses himself when he falls for something,
 but nothing ever lasts with him.

187
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,170
He'll get over it in a few months.

188
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,160
That long?

189
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,570
Every day is a struggle for me.

190
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,230
Hobak, don't worry.

191
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,700
Relationships based on money don't last.

192
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,300
Money is very attractive,
 but that's all there is to it.

193
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,930
Who said that?

194
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,530
Somebody.

195
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,040
A sucker who's really smart.

196
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,070
They went on a picnic together.

197
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,590
The two of them?

198
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,760
He says it's just work,

199
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,440
but how can it be when

200
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,440
a man and a woman are out together?

201
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,290
I packed him lunch.

202
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,570
You packed him lunch?

203
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,860
I should've known.

204
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,070
Are you stupid?

205
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,770
Yes, I must be stupid.

206
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,590
Please stop doing that.

207
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,700
You should be hard on him.

208
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,460
Why are you all scared of him?

209
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,800
That's why Sedal's acting like that.

210
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,770
I'm being patient for a reason.

211
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:19,730
I'm just scared of getting mad because if I did, things might be over.

212
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:31,800
But Gwangbak, I got revenge on him.

213
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,690
Revenge?

214
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,890
He must be going crazy by now.

215
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,140
Golf is really fun.

216
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,630
I've always wanted to play golf,
 but I had no idea how much fun it was.

217
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,060
Let's play a round of golf next week, oppa.

218
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,360
It will be your first real game.

219
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,160
Really? You promise?

220
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,440
Yes. After a round, you'll get a hang of it.

221
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,670
Oh, this is nuts.

222
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,900
I'm going on a golf trip with my friends.

223
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,860
Who gave you permission?

224
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,570
You belong to me.

225
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,540
You can't do anything without my permission.

226
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,800
I think you forget that sometimes.

227
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,040
I won't forget.

228
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,730
Watch me.

229
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,460
Golf is half posture.

230
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,670
Watch me.

231
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,260
Stick your butt out like this, and like this.

232
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,630
Like this?

233
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,030
More, more. Push up.

234
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,800
- Like this?
- Yes. Exert more force.

235
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,390
What is...

236
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,340
I need to go somewhere.

237
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,990
Where? You haven't eaten anything.

238
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,390
I can't eat anything right now.

239
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,340
Oppa! Where are you going?

240
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,030
Someone keeps calling me.

241
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,870
I'm coming, I am.

242
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,090
Yes, Gwangbak, where are you?

243
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,670
Huh?

244
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,730
Excuse me, please hurry up.

245
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,530
I'll give you money. Can you come out now?

246
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,630
Can you put your pants on outside?

247
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,090
Oh, help me.

248
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,040
Yes, yes.

249
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,700
Where are you?
Why aren't you back?

250
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,770
Hold on. I'm coming.

251
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,390
Hurry.

252
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,860
Run, Gwangbak!

253
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,390
The front leg grows!

254
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,300
Mom, mom.

255
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,540
She got you!

256
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,500
What?

257
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,660
Sing! Sing! Sing!

258
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,000
No!

259
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,240
This is nuts.

260
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,770
- Sintong, stop!
- Catch me if you can!

261
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,760
Ugh! Oh, my!

262
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,400
What's wrong with you? Get away from me!

263
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,930
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,990
They are my nephews. I'm sorry.

265
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,170
May I help you clean up?

266
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,890
No. Get the kids away from me.

267
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,360
Apologize.

268
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,230
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,160
Get away from me.

270
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,160
Let's go.

271
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,540
Huh? Uncle,

272
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,700
she's eating the same food we're eating.

273
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,460
Right, I saw, too.

274
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,340
It's the same food.

275
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,500
You guys go back first.

276
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,040
I'm still in the middle of it.

277
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,470
It's me.

278
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,960
I don't think I knew you.

279
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,840
I doubt I know anyone in this restroom.

280
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,240
It's me, Daebak.

281
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,940
What are you doing here?

282
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,690
Did you follow me?

283
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,260
We're here on a picnic.

284
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,740
Leave before Sintong and Bangtong see you.

285
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,440
You understand what I mean, don't you?

286
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,560
Uncle and Gwangbak are here, too.

287
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,590
Your uncle, too?

288
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,660
Yes. I won't tell them.

289
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,190
They can't see you, so leave.

290
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,340
I trust that you'll leave.

291
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,960
Oh, man.

292
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,630
Oppa, where are you?

293
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,390
Something came up. I feel really badly.

294
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,930
But don't ask any questions.

295
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,990
Just do as I say.

296
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,300
Get up quietly and go home right now.

297
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,800
Go home and wait for my call.

298
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,070
Do you understand?

299
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,700
Oppa, oppa!

300
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,340
Tell me what you did to him.

301
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,660
Nope!

302
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,140
Come on, Hobak!

303
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,270
You want to know?

304
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,540
Yes.

305
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,290
Really?

306
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,590
Carefully, carefully.

307
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,000
That hurts!

308
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,270
So funny!

309
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,160
Hobak, you're outrageous.

310
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,090
How did you come up with that idea?

311
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,690
You got him good!

312
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,760
He's probably stuck at the restroom.

313
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,300
So funny.

314
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,540
Good job, Hobak.

315
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,800
Hobak?

316
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,530
Hobak...

317
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,570
Hobak...

318
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,090
Yes, I'll leave it at the front desk.

319
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,130
Drop by anytime.

320
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,690
I'm always home.

321
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,060
I can't call you or text you.

322
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,400
When you get hungry, thirsty or have to use the bathroom, drop by.

323
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,430
I'll keep the door open.

324
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,230
Oh, boy.

325
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,200
Playing is hard.

326
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,230
But I had fun.

327
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,670
Grandmother, you should rest.

328
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,530
Mom!

329
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,770
Anggeum, your grandchildren are here.

330
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,890
- Oh.
- Mom.

331
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,570
Sintong and Bangtong came.

332
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,160
Hello.

333
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,430
Hi.

334
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,360
Why did you bring them?

335
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,340
They came to visit their grandmother.

336
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,930
They're spending the night here.

337
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,930
Go wash up and I will make you a snack.

338
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,360
Okay.

339
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,790
How about her?

340
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,360
She's coming later.

341
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,740
What?

342
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,670
What's this?

343
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,340
Oh, it stinks.

344
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,090
Don't you know?

345
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,240
You know what you did!

346
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,430
What did I do?

347
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,030
You...

348
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,970
Who else could it be?

349
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,840
I had no idea you could be so cruel.

350
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,340
How dare you pull that kind of stuff?

351
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,360
What did you give me? I almost died.

352
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,460
Look at my face. It looks gaunt now.

353
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,900
Look for yourself.

354
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,390
Just wash that. I'm exhausted.

355
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,130
Sedal, let's talk.

356
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,270
Don't lay a finger on me.

357
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,090
This is attempted murder.

358
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,130
I almost called the police on you.

359
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,740
Don't go. I'm sorry.

360
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,340
Why do you think I did that?

361
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,360
I'm a woman, too. Don't do this to me.

362
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,460
You were a loving and kind man.

363
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,840
You ruined the loving and kind man.

364
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,140
You've already crossed the line.

365
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,930
I haven't. I'll be good.

366
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,430
There's no need for that.

367
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,340
You didn't know this would happen?

368
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,470
You treated me like a boy and beat me up.

369
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,570
You never treated me like your husband.

370
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,160
I will never do that again, okay?

371
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,840
Let me go. I'm exhausted.

372
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,590
You're going to make me fall down.

373
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,500
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,670
Let go of me!

375
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,970
This is nuts! Ugh.

376
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,700
Who is it?

377
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,090
It's your brother.

378
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,000
What are you doing here?

379
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,890
I'm sleeping here. Don't ask any questions.

380
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,390
Bring me some blankets.

381
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,300
I don't need to ask any questions.

382
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,590
Why do you always fight?

383
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,460
Madam Park Salla, your son is here.

384
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,730
You had another fight?

385
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,440
I don't know. You should talk to her.

386
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,590
What did you fight about?

387
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,270
You're doing well, making lots of money.

388
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,630
She doesn't know where her place is.

389
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,390
You should've taught her at the beginning.

390
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,300
It was because of money.

391
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,770
A man has to make money to have a voice.

392
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,040
He's making money now.

393
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,390
I'm going to crush Hobak.

394
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,570
I've been waiting for the right time.

395
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,430
This guy I met keeps calling me.

396
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,430
I'm meeting him tomorrow evening.

397
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,590
Hello. How man?

398
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,770
Two.

399
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,090
Would you like a quiet table?

400
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,360
No, we want to sit by the window.

401
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,300
That table looks nice. We'll sit there.

402
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,840
I'm buying so oder whatever you want.

403
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,570
Of course you're buying.

404
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,570
You know how much time I spent getting all dressed up?

405
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,800
If this works out, I'll owe you one.

407
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,660
I can't believe this.

408
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,360
Using me to make your boyfriend jealous?

409
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,000
We've been friends since elementary school!

410
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,840
Imagine how desperate I must be.

411
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,660
But do you think this will work?

412
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,990
I think this is the best way to find out if he really likes you.

413
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,200
And I'm quite handsome, you know?

414
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,170
You're full of yourself.

415
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,430
Well, I guess I can sacrifice myself so you can get married.

416
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,460
Sit straight and look pretty.

417
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,540
Like this?

418
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,500
Don't ask any questions.

419
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,960
Is he here?

420
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,370
Hey!

421
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,190
Just your eyes!

422
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,700
He's here! He's here! What do I do?

423
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,960
Where?

424
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,740
Across the street. What do I do?

425
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,370
Just ignore him. Keep your focus on me.

426
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,540
Focus.

427
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,170
Oh, no.

428
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,030
Hello?

429
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,570
You must be chowing down barbecue.

430
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,570
Oh, how did you know?

431
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,930
I'm enjoying my dinner now.

432
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,790
Come out this instant.

433
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,300
But I have to eat.

434
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,800
Stop eating and just come out.

435
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,090
No. I have to eat.

436
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,090
He just called me.

437
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,500
What did he say?

438
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,200
He told me to stop eating and come out.

439
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,460
What do I do?

440
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,460
Step one worked.

441
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,870
- It's done?
- He took the bait.

442
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,500
We have to finalize it.

443
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,340
How?

444
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,630
Be pretty.

445
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,730
Say, "Ah."

446
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,740
Ah.

447
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,090
Answer it?

448
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,930
Answer it. Turn around.

449
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,130
Hello?

450
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,860
Don't "Hello" me!

451
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,570
Don't eat that lettuce wrap and come right out!

452
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,270
He didn't even wash his hands!

453
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,130
Why would you eat that?

454
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,890
You have no sense of cleanliness.

455
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,360
And you open your mouth for anyone!

456
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,270
If you don't come out, I'm coming in.

457
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,970
I'll count to three. One, two,

458
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,970
three.

459
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,770
He.. Hey!

460
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,700
Hey!

461
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,570
Good job. Looking pretty, ah.

462
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,400
It's working? If you ruin this, you're dead.

463
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,690
He's quiet.

464
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,400
And for the final step.

465
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,800
You have to feed me.

466
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,090
Me?

467
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,300
It's worse then being fed, I'm serious.

468
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,660
If he doesn't react, just dump him.

469
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,660
No.

470
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:57,800
What do I do? I think he left.

471
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:00,270
Don't look around. I'm sure he's here.

472
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,800
But what if he left?

473
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,200
Should I run after him?

474
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,060
You're overreacting.

475
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,390
Aren't you being too desperate?

476
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,130
Who cares if I am? I really like him.

477
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,300
I'm sure you do.

478
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,740
Now feed me.

479
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,540
If this doesn't work, it's your fault.

480
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,040
What if this was a mistake?

481
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,300
What if he found out?

482
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,300
Stop talking.

483
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,630
Okay.

484
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,800
What did I do to deserve this?

485
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,200
I have to look at you like you're adorable.

486
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,460
You know how difficult that is?

487
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,100
Oh, my eyes, my poor eyes.

488
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,770
Just hold on. I said I'll owe you one.

489
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,500
What about him do you like so much?

490
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,170
You never fell for anyone before.

491
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,430
He's not even that handsome.

492
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,490
He is. I just knew it had to be him.

493
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,470
I never felt this way before.

494
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,670
Your feelings are killing me.

495
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,460
Feed me slowly.

496
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,800
Ah.

497
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,770
Ah.

498
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,100
Oh, my.

499
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,430
I'm sorry,

500
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,090
but I have to take her with me.

501
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,690
Oh, my! What are you doing?

502
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,590
Oh, my! Oh, my!

503
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,730
Oh, my! Oh, my!

504
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,840
What are you doing?
You have no manners.

505
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,190
Oh, ouch.

506
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,760
Manners?

507
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,300
How could you drag me out like this?

508
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,130
What if people start talking?

509
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,230
If they think I have a man, I won't be asked out.

510
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,370
Oh, that hurts.

511
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,160
How come you're so strong?

512
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,860
You don't like me because of that?

513
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,230
I do.

514
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:46,070
From now on, the only barbecue you'll ever eat is the one I buy you and the one I barbecue for you.

515
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,840
What do you mean?

516
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,070
Don't ever eat with just anyone,
 and don't ever feed just anyone.

517
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,160
Do it only with me. Just me.

518
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,230
Hey!

519
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,040
- Ugh.
- Hey! What?

520
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,090
- What the heck!
- Come here!

521
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,590
How dare you!

522
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,490
Come here!

523
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,360
Hey!

524
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,200
Hey!

525
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,660
Aagh!

526
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,660
Nice! Yay!

527
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,360
Woohoo!

528
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,590
Why is this happening?

529
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,770
This is nuts!

530
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,470
Yay!

531
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,890
You're home?

532
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,970
You were asleep?
I kept ringing the bell.

533
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,040
Oh, I think I dozed off.

534
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,390
Did you sleep well,
Sintong and Bangtong?

535
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,660
Yes, we slept with uncle Daebak.

536
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,860
They already had breakfast.

537
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,040
Get ready for school.

538
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,390
Okay.

539
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,960
Where's Sedal?
He went to work already?

540
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,270
No.

541
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,090
He didn't come home last night.

542
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,540
What?

543
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,570
How dare they!

544
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,760
Shh!

545
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,230
Lead the way.

546
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,860
Subak, calm down and don't use violence.

547
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,040
Our father's a teacher, after all.

548
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,530
We must behave ourselves.

549
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,960
Don't worry. I'll be civilized.

550
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,140
Just talk to her.

551
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,170
Don't yell, don't swear and no violence.

552
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,760
On TV dramas they splash water and slap people, but you can't do that, okay?

553
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,690
Who is she?

554
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,340
Only rude people do that.

555
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,530
But since our father's a vice principal...

556
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,930
Are you the one who called me?

557
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,240
It's you?

558
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,260
What do you want?

559
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,390
Hello.

560
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,700
We are...

561
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,040
Follow me.

562
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:30,870
I came because you wanted to see me, but why are you here?

563
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,140
This is my older sister,
 and she's Heo Sedal's sister in law.

564
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,070
And I'm the younger one.

565
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,160
Get to the point.

566
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,240
- What do you want from Sedal?
- What?

567
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,340
What are you going to do?

568
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,640
I don't know.

569
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,840
I haven't given it any thought yet.

570
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,160
You haven't thought about it?

571
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,360
Should I start now?

572
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,100
Are you kidding me?

573
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:58,070
Maybe I am, but still,
 a third party shouldn't get involved.

574
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,440
You must have lots of free time.

575
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,660
What?

576
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,860
I can't believe my ears.

577
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,200
You witch!

578
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,930
How rich do you think you are?

579
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,030
I used to live in a huge apartment!

580
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,930
Subak.

581
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,240
You're laughing?

582
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,660
I drove an import car, okay?

583
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,490
Subak.

584
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,700
I don't think there's anything more to say.

585
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,570
Sit down.

586
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,490
Aren't you done?

587
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,960
We need to hear your answers, so sit down.

588
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,390
I answer already.
You should stay...

589
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,740
Hey!

590
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,570
I was in the Miss Korea pageant!

591
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,870
Just who do you think you are?

592
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,940
You know what you deserve?

593
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,870
Did you just laugh?

594
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,570
Subak!

595
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,160
This is the famous water slap.

596
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,360
Go ahead and laugh again.

597
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,130
If you get in my sister's way, I'll kill you.

598
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,840
Stop fooling around.

599
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,490
They are my sister and her husband.

600
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,570
You shouldn't fool around with them.

601
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:16,590
My sister came to you and begged you,
 so she can protect her family.

602
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,440
Enough.

603
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,070
Next time, I won't stop with a water slap.

604
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,990
End it before you get really humiliated.

605
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,340
Really?

606
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,930
Yup.

607
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,760
Hey! I was in the Miss Korea pageant!

608
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,190
Just who do you think you are?

609
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:46,400
And she threw water on her and slapped her and said,
"This is the famous water slap!"

610
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,390
If you get in my sister's way, I'll kill you.

611
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,590
I'll kill you all!

612
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,800
I mean...

613
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,870
Really?

614
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,800
Subak...

615
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,140
Oh, Hobak.

616
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,570
You should've told me about it first.

617
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,660
I'm the eldest daughter.
You think I'm a joke?

618
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,470
No, I didn't think you're a joke.

619
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,240
You're the best.

620
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,500
I felt great watching her.

621
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,360
You were amazing.

622
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,600
You were the best.

623
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,440
I didn't know you'd do that for me.

624
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,840
Hobak,

625
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,660
you'd never know how I feel.

626
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:29,430
No matter what happened between us,
 we're family, and family sticks together.

627
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,970
Don't you feel that way, too?

628
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,200
Of course I do. I'm on my family's side.

629
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,070
You have us, so why didn't you tell us?

630
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,240
Right. Hobak, cheer up. You have us.

631
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,700
We're all on your side.

632
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,840
What are you going to do?

633
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,870
After you decide, we can come up with a plan.

634
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,600
We can beat him up,or you can divorce him.

635
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,540
Hobak doesn't want to divorce him.

636
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,260
You want to stick with a jerk like that?

637
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,340
I don't believe you.

638
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:11,370
I held back because I heard uncle already beat him up, but I could've killed Sedal.

639
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,260
I'm thinking about what to do.

640
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,570
I don't want to regret later.

641
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,600
You're an idiot.

642
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,700
What regrets could you have?

643
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,770
What has Sedal ever done for you?

644
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,300
He's been nothing but trouble.

645
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,300
If it were me, I would've already dumped him.

646
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,240
Yes, mother.

647
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,490
No, I'll come over.

648
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,570
Okay.

649
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,760
It's my mother in law.

650
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,660
Subak, don't tell anyone else.

651
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,600
Mother, I'm here.

652
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,540
Don't you feel anything?

653
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,690
Excuse me?

654
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,760
Why do you think I closed my shop early?

655
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,840
Why do you keep kicking your husband out?

656
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,800
It's become a habit.

657
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,990
Sedal slept here last night.

658
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,090
Why does he keep coming here?

659
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,570
He slept here?

660
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,990
Why did you fight?

661
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,570
It's obvious.

662
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,640
She only gets mad about one thing. Money.

663
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,070
Am I right?

664
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,800
It wasn't because of money.

665
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,140
Wait, I guess it is about money technically.

666
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,340
Stop nagging your husband.

667
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,370
You're always nagging about money.

668
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,670
I don't understand why you're like that.

669
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,160
That won't bring money your way.

670
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,160
Being stingy will do you no good.

671
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:35,360
To be honest, who else but Sedal would stay with you?

672
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,800
Nobody else could, I'm sure.

673
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,260
You're right.

674
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,300
Only Sedal could handle someone like me.

675
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,570
- Is she being sarcastic?
- I'm serious.

676
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,840
I've been thinking about my mistakes.

677
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,570
You should.

678
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,840
Don't ever kick him out again.

679
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,370
Where did you go yesterday?

680
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,600
I took the boys to the park for a picnic.

681
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,200
What's gotten into you?

682
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,340
I'm not going to be stingy anymore.

683
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,100
Mother, have you had dinner yet?

684
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,800
We've been hungry for hours!

685
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:13,140
I'm not getting any customers these days.

686
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,840
Let's order something. My treat.

687
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,660
What's gotten into you?

688
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,700
Being stingy will do me no good, mother.

689
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,930
What would you like?

690
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,770
- Sangnam. 
- Yes, aunt.

691
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,760
You're quite the whistler!

692
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,930
You caught me.

693
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,160
I haven't heart that in years.
Do that again.

694
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,070
Is there any older man like you.

695
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,660
I doubt it.

696
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:08,840
You said you'd introduce me if you ever met someone. Who is she?

697
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,370
Well,

698
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,900
I knew it had to be her.

699
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,030
I'm dying to know. Tell me.

700
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,570
She's easy on the eyes and very warm.

701
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,800
She sees me as I am and doesn't play games.

702
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:26,070
She puts her feelings for me before her pride.

703
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,570
And she respects my job.

704
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:33,300
But most importantly, she makes me laugh.

705
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,200
She makes you laugh?

706
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,070
That's enough, then.

707
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,930
That's important. 
Who makes me laugh.

708
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,590
That's why you can't help but whistle?

709
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,270
You must bring her. I want to meet her.

710
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,460
Your father's curious, too.

711
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,070
I have to get something done first.

712
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,660
What is it?

713
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,470
Something.

714
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,740
Tomorrow's D-day.

715
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,070
Did you start?

716
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,570
Okay. Good.

717
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,140
I'll be there after breakfast.

718
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,930
Did Mr. Park come to work?

719
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,860
Yes, they started working.

720
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:09,440
Sangnam is really good.

721
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,570
Everyone in this field is stubborn,
 but he can convince them, no matter what.

722
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,070
Just like me.

723
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,090
To be honest, he's better than you.

724
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,000
How could you say that?

725
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,930
He's still my son.

726
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,990
Right.

727
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,690
Oh, seaweed soup.
Is it someone's birthday?

728
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:37,570
No, I just wanted it, so I made it.

729
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,700
Where did it go?

730
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,700
I know I bought one yesterday.

731
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,160
I'm leaving.

732
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,660
Have you seen the tofu?

733
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,740
Tofu?

734
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,770
I ate it last night.

735
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:05,890
How could you eat that?

736
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,390
Why would you eat raw tofu?

737
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,890
Why didn't you ask first?

738
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,630
I'm sorry.

739
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,640
I was going to make stew with that.

740
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,740
What do I do now?

741
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:23,470
I didn't know before,
 but you really like to eat.

742
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,870
I'm scared you'll eat everything up!

743
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,900
And it's not like you're pitching in.

744
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,570
What is it?

745
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,490
He ate the tofu I bought to make stew.

746
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,260
Why did you eat that?

747
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,890
I was hungry.

748
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,300
You weren't like this before.

749
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,740
You know how much money I spend on food?

750
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,200
Everything disappears like crazy.

751
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,570
I keep stuffing the fridge. I'm dying here.

752
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:53,930
I know you're flat broke,
 but you should try to pitch in.

753
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,890
Look what you started.

754
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,530
Ask before you eat anything.

755
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,190
I'll go get one.

756
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:10,700
Mother!

757
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,640
Why is Minjung running around so early?

758
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,170
He ate the tofu mom bought for stew.

759
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,630
Do you have to put tofu in?

760
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,340
Of course I do.

761
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,260
Still, how could you ask him to get it?

762
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,840
He has to go to work.

763
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,160
What's wrong with that?

764
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,200
I'm sorry I ate the tofu without asking.

765
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:40,270
I keep feeling hungry since I moved in here.

766
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,090
I'm sorry for eating all the food.

767
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:46,540
And I'll pitch in, starting this month.

768
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,200
I'm supposed to deposit this, but take it. It's $300.

769
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,500
Just $300?

770
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,990
Huh?

771
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,190
Subak, come with me.

772
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,800
Uh...

773
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,490
What have you been up to lately?

774
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,700
I've been taking care of the kids.

775
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,240
You must be bored.

776
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,770
Of course.

777
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:26,390
I used to meet my friends and go on trips,

778
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,160
but now I can't even get a facial or go shopping.

779
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,970
In that case, work around the house.

780
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,200
Cook for Minjung,

781
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:36,390
and raise the kids by yourself.

782
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,590
That's not your mom's job.

783
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,940
How could you let him eat raw tofu?

784
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,300
You should've cooked something for him.

785
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,140
You know how hard his job is?

786
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:47,540
He runs around carrying packages all day.

787
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,190
He gets hungry all the time.

788
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,430
But he has no time for a decent meal.

789
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,360
Did you even know that?

790
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,440
If you can't do the chores, get a job.

791
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,200
You need to make money.

792
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,760
A single income isn't enough these days.

793
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,530
I can't get a job.

794
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:12,430
I've never worked a day in my life, 
so what could I possibly do?

795
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,200
I'll look for a job for you.

796
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,470
If you put your mind to it, you can do it.

797
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,840
Give this back to Minjung.

798
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:24,890
Keep it.

799
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,300
He can't afford this.

800
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,840
Men don't want to live with their in laws.

801
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:37,470
When I asked Minjung to move in,
I wanted him to get free room and board.

802
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,070
Do you understand?

803
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,640
Father, keep it.

804
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,300
We'd feel better if you did.

805
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,740
You don't need to pay to feel better.

806
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,470
You should try to make him feel at home.

807
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,570
How can you tell at him for some tofu?

808
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,760
How much was it?

809
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,890
Was it some special expensive tofu?

810
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,070
Even so, he said he's hungrier now that he's living here.

811
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,800
You're making him stressed.

812
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,800
You used to be so nice to him.

813
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:09,100
How could you be so mean?

814
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:13,660
I can't believe my ears.

815
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:15,260
I'm mean?

816
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,800
Fine, so I am.

817
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,760
We're doing pretty well because I'm mean.

818
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:58,470
Are you going somewhere?

819
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,870
I'm meeting my friends.

820
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,340
Remember Bora?
It's her birthday.

821
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:05,260
We're going to spend the night at a sauna.

822
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,930
Is that okay?

823
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,970
Did you get permission from your father?

824
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,100
I'm going to call him later.

825
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,270
Hey, take me with you.

826
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:13,800
Not tonight, grandmother.

827
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,140
I'll take you next time.

828
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,400
I'll see you later.

829
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,390
Shouldn't you be writing?

830
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,760
Did you quit being a writer?

831
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,090
No, I didn't!

832
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,900
Oh, I don't think you'll become one!

833
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,740
There goes the doctor son in law.

834
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:37,390
The one who will like me

835
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:46,970
The one who will love me

836
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,370
The one!

837
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:58,670
The one who will like me

838
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,490
The one I will love...

839
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,070
Goodbye, grandmother.

840
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,890
Uh, wait a minute.

841
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:28,390
I have no family, so could you pour the rice into the jar?

842
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,740
- Into the jar?
- Yes.

843
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,770
I'm not strong enough, so please.

844
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:35,770
Okay.

845
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:51,860
Minjung.

846
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,540
Here.

847
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,890
Thanks.

848
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:59,760
It's not from me, but it's nice to hear you say that.

849
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,990
Is it from your husband?

850
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,490
No, I bought something for the house.

851
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,070
Why didn't you drop by?

852
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:10,500
There's a route I must take,

853
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,360
so I can't drop by unless there's delivery.

854
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:15,840
And it doesn't really feel right.

855
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:17,390
Why not?

856
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:21,670
Your husband might get the wrong idea.

857
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,630
I'm okay with it, but you might...

858
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:25,770
I should go.

859
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,170
Stay for lunch.

860
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,030
It's okay. 

861
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,070
You haven't had lunch, right?

862
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,070
Just have a bite, okay?

863
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,600
Just one bite.

864
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,270
Look at all these side dishes.

865
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,160
Do you eat like this every day?

866
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,890
Not every day.

867
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,800
It's seaweed soup.

868
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:52,800
Try it.

869
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,240
I thought you didn't have time.

870
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,460
I'm not sure if this is a good idea.

871
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,040
Don't worry about it.

872
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,630
Nobody's home.

873
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,340
It's good.

874
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,930
It is?

875
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,300
I'm glad.

876
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,260
I was so worried because I wasn't sure.

877
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,500
I ordered something so you'd deliver it.

878
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,160
I wanted to cook for you.

879
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:29,630
But you wouldn't come by.

880
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,100
Hurry up and eat.

881
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:32,700
Have some fish, too.

882
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:42,760
I remember how you used to cook seaweed soup for me.

883
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:47,990
You made this on my birthday.

884
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,340
Right.

885
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,300
Today's your birthday.

886
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,870
Happy birthday, Minjung.

887
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,430
You didn't know?

888
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:12,500
You didn't eat seaweed soup for breakfast?

889
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,070
Minjung.

890
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,140
Minjung!

891
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:21,100
Minjung!

892
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,730
I brought some bread.

893
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,870
Share them with the other teachers.

894
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,940
You didn't have to.

895
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,990
Thanks to you, I got more students.

896
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,260
They paid their membership fee recently.

897
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:07,890
I thought I should come and say thank you.

898
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,690
Okay. Thanks.

899
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,800
But don't bring stuff like this anymore.

900
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:19,200
Anyway, is something up with Hobak?

901
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,800
Why do you ask?

902
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:24,900
She comes by sometimes, but I think something's wrong.

903
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:34,340
Oh, my!

904
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,390
Uncle!

905
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,390
What's wrong with this?

906
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,530
Oh, no! What happened?

907
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:45,460
Oh, no! Oh, no! It's broken.

908
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,470
Uncle, what did you do?

909
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,840
It wasn't me.

910
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:52,890
I was in the bathroom, and I ran out because I heard a bang, and I saw this.

911
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,890
Don't lie!

912
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,360
Who else would do this?

913
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,800
I'm serious.

914
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:59,970
Mom.

915
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,070
What happened here?

916
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,990
Uncle did this trying to get it down.

917
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,390
I said it wasn't me.

918
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,360
Who else would do this?

919
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,340
Did mother ask you to get it?

920
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,140
I don't believe this.

921
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,470
Where's grandmother?

922
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,390
I don't know.

923
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,740
She asked you to get it, so she can go to the senior center.

924
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,390
I can't believe this.

925
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,200
Why would she do this?
Is she senile?

926
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:26,840
Anggeum, how could you say that?

927
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:29,490
Do you want my mom to become senile?

928
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,760
And you shouldn't be so mean, Subak.

929
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:34,260
Why can't she take this out sometime?

930
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:35,930
Who cares if she uses it a little?

931
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,700
It'll get used regardless.

932
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:41,000
Shouldn't you apologize first?

933
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,200
What's all the noise?

934
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:47,140
Grandmother, how could you break this?

935
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,240
Oh, boy.

936
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,500
Why is this broken?

937
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,760
Uncle dropped it trying to get it down.

938
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,190
I said it wasn't me.

939
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,770
Was it you, grandmother?

940
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,590
It wasn't me.

941
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,770
I was at the florist's to get some dirt.

942
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:02,690
If it wasn't you. it was uncle.

943
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,970
I told you to wait until Jungji got bigger.

944
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,000
Why can't you do that?

945
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,490
Even if grandmother asked you to bring it down, you should've said no.

946
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,960
Why you little!

947
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,100
How dare you tell at him?

948
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:16,200
He might be younger, but he's your uncle!

949
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,340
But he doesn't act like my uncle.

950
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:19,600
What?

951
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,070
What did you say?

952
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,530
Let's be honest here.

953
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,890
Why do you think Subak said that?

954
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:35,670
He should just explain what happened and apologize, instead of saying he didn't.

955
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,940
It wasn't me, Anggeum.

956
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:41,200
As if I can believe that. How could you lie?

957
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,270
If you were my son, I'd beat you up.

958
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,530
What?

959
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,960
Go ahead, then!

960
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,570
I didn't say I was really going to do it.

961
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,840
Are you talking back at me here?

962
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,970
Fine. Let's see where this goes.

963
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,660
Grandmother, stop it.

964
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,240
Why are you yelling at my mom?

965
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,140
You stop it. She's my mom.

966
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,800
Do you know how mean she is to my mom?

967
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,390
I'm sick and tired of grandmother.

968
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,490
Look at what your mom does to my mom!

969
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,390
Just because she was tough on her in the past, look how she treats her now!

970
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,070
How's that?

971
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,370
Oh, just look at what your daughter's doing!

972
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,370
Uncle is just as bad!

973
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:19,370
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

974
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:22,740
You're both attacking us!

975
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:26,370
Let's see how well you two do without us.

976
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,840
Let's leave this darn house.

977
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,260
Come with me.

978
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,470
Oh, boy.

979
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,530
Oh, man.

980
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,160
Mom, what do we do?

981
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,860
What do you mean?

982
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,640
Father's going to flip out.

983
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:52,770
Let him flip out. I'm not scared.

984
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,660
Oh, boy.

985
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:17,340
Who is it?

986
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,100
The police.

987
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,160
What's going on?

988
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,740
We need to ask you a few questions,

989
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,470
so please come with us to the station.

990
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,590
Excuse me?

991
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,070
She didn't come?

992
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:39,460
Okay.

993
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,760
I called all her friends, but nobody knows.

994
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:44,070
Huh?

995
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,660
What do we do?
Your father will be home soon.

996
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,970
Where did she go?

997
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,070
Uncle left his phone at home.

998
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,640
He never forgot it before.

999
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,240
What do I tell your father?

1000
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,800
He will be furious.

1001
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:59,570
I thought you weren't scared.

1002
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,840
This is all your fault.

1003
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:03,240
Why can't she take the stroller out?

1004
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,000
Why are you turning on me?

1005
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,130
I'm already scared about how father will be.

1006
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,100
Oh, man.

1007
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,240
Catch me if you can!

1008
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,700
Hold on.

1009
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,900
What is it?

1010
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:54,800
I have something to tell you.

1011
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:00,840
I asked to come here

1012
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:06,960
because I wanted to tell you something at a meaningful place.

1013
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,470
My sucker,

1014
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:22,490
please don't say a word

1015
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,970
until I'm done talking.

1016
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:29,470
After you hear me out,

1017
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,840
you can leave me here, if you want.

1018
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:34,930
I won't blame you.

1019
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:40,070
The few months of memories I had with you are enough for me.

1020
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,460
- What is it?
- Shh.

1021
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:48,570
This is really important.

1022
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,490
- Actually...
- Are you married?

1023
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,660
Shh.

1024
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,930
I 

1025
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,170
didn't get much education.

1026
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:01,970
Excuse me?

1027
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:04,340
I never went to college,

1028
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,500
and I didn't finish high school.

1029
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,530
I dropped out of high school during

1030
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:13,340
the summer vacation of my junior year.

1031
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:15,340
I only finished

1032
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,190
middle school.

1033
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:25,200
You went to a nice college and became a teacher, 

1034
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,170
and now you want to be a writer.

1035
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,990
But my education level is awful.

1036
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,570
I only finished middle school.

1037
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,490
But...

1038
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,390
Will you still have me?

1039
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:10,260
If you can, you wait for me here.

1040
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:13,590
If you can't, you can take the bus home.

1041
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:16,770
You were the first person who made me laugh.

1042
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:17,690
Thanks.

1043
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,800
Tell me. What did you do?

1044
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:21,430
What did you say?

1045
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,840
Middle school? An excavator operator?

1046
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:25,070
Are you out of your mind?

1047
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,600
How embarrassing.

1048
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:27,740
Are you really my sister?

1049
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:30,740
I don't need to hear more. Get out.

1050
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,270
Stay with me tonight.

1051
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:35,070
Don't go anywhere.

1052
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,970
Were you crying? You look awful.

1053
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,570
I was just sad.

1054
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:41,340
I'm nothing serious, is it?
