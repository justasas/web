<i>[Episode 7]</i>

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,340
Where's Soo Min?
Where's my daughter?

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,700
How would I know?

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,060
You had me followed.

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,610
You have the wrong guy!

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,550
Your guy fessed up!

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,030
I don't know what you're talking about!

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,990
How dare you, Gi Bum?

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,060
Where's Soo Min? Where is she?

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,300
Is this what you meant when
you said I'd come to regret it?

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,390
Is this what you plotted
with that swindler?

13
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,070
What are you talking about?
Try to help me understand.

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,330
Gi Bum! How can you do this to me?

15
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,960
We may be in a dirty line of work,
but we've got rules here.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,880
That bottom line is that we don't
mess with each others' families...

17
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,250
You want to know what happens
when you don't follow that rule?

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,210
All of you are pieces of garbage!

19
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,880
What the heck are you doing?

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,920
Stop acting like a crazy person!

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,290
Soo Min disappeared!

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,230
And he had me followed.

23
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,610
If it were you, what would you do? Huh?

24
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,560
But you shouldn't suspect me.

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,550
Am I someone who would kidnap
your daughter, and then enjoy my drink?

26
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,890
Be honest. Did you do something
to his daughter?

27
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,210
No, I didn't. I mean it.
Why would do such thing?

28
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,760
If that's a lie, my fist will be
the last thing that you see.

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,850
Honestly, many people are
holding grudges against you.

30
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,050
Don't bark at the wrong guy.
Check everyone on your list.

31
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,570
If it turns out to be you guys,
you better be ready for what's coming.

32
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:13,650
You better be ready for what's coming
if it turns out that it isn't us.

33
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,380
Got that?

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,000
Thank you, Brother. You saved me.

35
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,160
Did you send a guy
to take care of Tae Soo?

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,210
Do you know that my wife
got hurt because of him?

37
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,680
You said it wasn't you.
You said you would cut off your hand!

38
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,780
Brother... that was really
an accident. An accident!

39
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,230
Tae Soo's daughter...
You didn't do that, right?

40
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,860
It's not me. I swear! If I'm lying,
I'll cut off all my own limbs!

41
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,590
Bro...

42
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,270
Please find my daughter! Please!

43
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,510
Please!

44
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,590
This is serious.

45
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,770
Can you think of anyone
who would do this?

46
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,440
I can't. I'm totally clueless.

47
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,550
I can't live without my daughter.

48
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,130
Please! Please find her!

49
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,440
Please?

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,180
Where on earth did she go?

51
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,030
Hello?

52
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,360
Soo Min did?

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,940
- It hurts!
- You should have called us!

54
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,130
Soo Min!

55
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,650
Oh my! Are you okay?
You're not hurt?

56
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,890
I think Mom cracked some of my bones!
Why are you hitting me?

57
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,140
What happened?

58
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,960
Don't even get me started! She--

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,710
Let me explain.

60
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,570
Let me say hello first.

61
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,920
How have you been, my brother in-law?

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,340
What happened?

63
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,990
I had concert tickets,
so I called Soo Min.

64
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,600
But she came to Seoul without
telling you. That's what happened.

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,490
What? Why didn't you say anything?

66
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,100
My phone died! How many
times do I have to say that?

67
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,000
You call that an excuse?
You need a beating!

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,570
- Mom!
- Teach her!

69
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,100
She needs to learn!

70
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,620
I almost had a heart attack!

71
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,270
- Auntie!
- Get over here!

72
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,620
This is exactly what she ran away from!

73
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,320
She begged to not go home.
Can't you be like Scandinavian parents?

74
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,390
- She's right!
- What?

75
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,530
Geez.

76
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,080
You went through a lot, Dad.

77
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,780
Sung Min, you're looking more and
more like your dad as you get older.

78
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,330
You didn't look anything like
your dad when you were little.

79
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,000
That's interesting.

80
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,350
Who else would I look like?

81
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,910
What?

82
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,760
Yeah, you're right.

83
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,180
We can't reach Soo Min.

84
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,670
I understand how desperate you are.

85
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,660
But how dare you suspect me!

86
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,000
Mr. Chairman!

87
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,770
Dad.

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,180
Is it true that Tae Soo
came here to question you?

89
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,680
Geez, that's insane.

90
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,710
He suspected me too!

91
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,950
I had a guest, and he showed up
and caused a scene.

92
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,460
A guest? Who?

93
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,880
Does that matter?

94
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,890
Dad, a dog can bite its owner.

95
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,260
You can't let Tae Soo be
a loose cannon like this.

96
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,150
I already told you.

97
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,200
It's just a matter of time
before Tae Soo gets to us.

98
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,880
See how he accused us,
without even having any evidence?

99
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,870
If he finds anything noteworthy,
he'll chew us up instantly.

100
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,850
Geez... where is everyone?
Mom! Honey!

101
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,610
Geez.

102
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,610
Hello. We are from the realty office.

103
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,080
The reality office? For what?

104
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,040
The owner of the house
put the house up for sale.

105
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,310
- What?
- Please let us take a look.

106
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,120
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

107
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,840
The owner of the house is the chairman
of Choong Shim Construction.

108
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,180
He really built a nice house here.

109
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,980
Mr. Chairman.

110
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,430
It's true. I deserve to die.

111
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,630
I was wrong for having
doubted you like that.

112
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,450
But where would we go during this
cold winter if you sold our house?

113
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,080
Tae Soo.

114
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,840
A food farmer is more diligent
when it isn't farming season.

115
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,180
It forces him to show his heart,
as opposed to just his skills.

116
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,790
The way you're behaving these days...
Are you really the Tae Soo that I know?

117
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,220
That bastard, Cho.

118
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,850
He was hanging around Gi Bum,
so I called the guys from Cheongjoo.

119
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,360
You did?

120
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,010
The Cheongjoo guys didn't want
to be involved, and they went back.

121
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,070
So, you should take care of Cho now.

122
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,520
Unless you want your family to suffer in
the cold winter, you should do it right.

123
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,590
Hello! How are you?

124
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,270
Mr. Yoon! I didn't kidnap your daughter!

125
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,470
Sit down.

126
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,550
Black noodles aren't good when bloated.
So listen and eat at the same time.

127
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,350
I said eat.

128
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:40,000
I heard that you're selling loans
to college kids these days.

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,010
One million won loans,
or something like that?

130
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,400
How do you know that?

131
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,430
Man, you need to live like a person.

132
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,180
You're ruining their lives
over a measly one million won?

133
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,440
I know a detective who desperately
needs to break open a case.

134
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,110
Should I introduce you to him?

135
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,270
Listen carefully.

136
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:09,180
From this point forward,
you don't know Baek Gi Bum.

137
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,330
You don't call him.
You don't answer his calls.

138
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,980
Erase any memory of
Baek Gi Bum from your head!

139
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,330
Got that?

140
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,820
Keep what I told you in mind, okay?

141
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,940
The ballot box will be opened at 7 p.m.
How can you wait that long?

142
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,120
How? Calmly and humbly, like I have to.

143
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,200
It doesn't look good, Eun Ok.

144
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,780
You never know until
the results come out.

145
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,850
Man, what kind of guy are you?

146
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,700
You even questioned my father?

147
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,080
You think we're the kind of people
who would kidnap your daughter?

148
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,860
Don't put it that way.

149
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,150
Be quiet!

150
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,240
You may look loyal, but come crunch time,
you don't trust a damn soul but your own!

151
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,850
I'm not sure how I should
deal with you now! Geez...

152
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,610
You're not entirely innocent.

153
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,900
You hang out with the man
who had me followed.

154
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,950
Is that a problem?
Don't try to change the subject!

155
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,860
Enough.

156
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,410
Don't hang out with Cho.
The chairman is about to explode.

157
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,520
What?

158
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,200
If you see him again, my family
will be kicked out of our home.

159
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,530
Oh! My dad told you to leave the house?

160
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,110
He must have been really upset.

161
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,380
He was agonizing all night.
He couldn't even sleep.

162
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,980
It's all your fault!

163
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,450
Anyway, look, I warned you about Cho.

164
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,800
Why would I hang out
with a guy that hurt Do Kyung?

165
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,780
I'm more worried about
constantly seeing you!

166
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,950
Director Bong.

167
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,580
Geez, what happened to him?

168
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,230
He hasn't been able to sleep for
a few nights because of the script.

169
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,630
How hard can writing be?

170
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,080
More action, more romance!
I told you, that will do!

171
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,050
Stop it with the nonsense.

172
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,990
A good house is built
on a good foundation.

173
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,000
You are the one who
is spewing nonsense.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,640
I'm the CEO here. I'm your boss.

175
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,190
What more is there to say?
You have no respect for your elders.

176
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,510
Stop! Please stop it! Stop!

177
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,020
- What's wrong?
- Crazy?

178
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,970
Writing a script is already hard enough.

179
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,060
You two are always fighting.
He can't relax.

180
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,400
We're begging you, please
communicate with us as a unit.

181
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,050
Geez...

182
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,040
Geez... geez... it feels good.

183
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,280
It feels good!

184
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,100
How is Tae Soo doing?
Is he trying at least?

185
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,820
He took his underlings
with him and warned Cho.

186
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,730
Geez, humans are sly.

187
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,670
They don't recognize it when
someone is being good to them.

188
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,640
They only realize how well they had it
when they're falling off the edge.

189
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,720
By the way, about One Heart...

190
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,260
What about it?

191
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,520
Lee Do Kyung is running for
the chairwomanship of One Heart.

192
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,810
What?

193
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,820
Let's count the votes.

194
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,520
Kyung Mee, please open them.

195
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,170
Yes, Ma'am.

196
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,190
Lee Do Kyung.

197
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,880
Kim Eun Ok.

198
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,010
Lee Do Kyung!

199
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,880
Kim Eun Ok.

200
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,700
Lee Do Kyung!

201
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,240
Lee Do Kyung. Kim Eun Ok.

202
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,750
Fifteen people voted.

203
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,620
There is one vote left.

204
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,080
Yes, there's one left.

205
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,010
Please open it.

206
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,250
Sure.

207
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,620
My goodness!

208
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,990
How dare you step foot in here?

209
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,880
What brings you here at
this hour, Mr. Chairman?

210
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,210
What the heck are you doing now?

211
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,230
We're electing a new chairwoman.

212
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,010
To change things up.

213
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,490
To change things up?

214
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,060
Who told you to do this?

215
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,120
You better do it right.
What the heck is this?

216
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,750
Get out. Everyone, get out!

217
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,700
I told you to disappear quietly.

218
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,150
Yes, you did.

219
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,810
Did you think that I was just
another old fart, nagging away?

220
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,870
What right do you have
to be so greedy like this?

221
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,530
I'm sorry if I was too greedy.

222
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,020
But please stop telling me
what rights I have.

223
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,020
What?

224
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,070
I used to be a part of this
"great" Choong Shim family.

225
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,430
As long as I have Hyun Jee,
I do have a right to be here.

226
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:27,000
Anyway, since the election was
canceled, I have no reason to be here.

227
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,680
I'll leave now, Ma'am.

228
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,170
Look at that...

229
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,350
She can never hide what she is.

230
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,390
Mr. Chairman!

231
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,500
I am so... so disappointed in you.

232
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,220
I never... never imagined you
to be this kind of person.

233
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,770
I trusted you. I depended on you.
And I respected you.

234
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,620
But what happened to you?

235
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,850
Madam Oh!

236
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,220
Thanks to you, I have been...

237
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,240
I have been humiliated and disgraced
in front of all of the members.

238
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,080
How can I face them again?

239
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,410
So humiliating... terrifying... oh...

240
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,310
What are you saying?

241
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,080
My husband is home.

242
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,630
Sit down.

243
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,540
You're drinking?

244
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,180
Oh, what happened with your election?

245
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,030
"How dare you step foot in here?"

246
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,730
"Who said you could
play this kind of stuff?"

247
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,230
"Get out right now!"

248
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,270
The chairman broke it up when
we were opening the ballot box.

249
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,940
Man, what the heck...

250
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,820
Anyway, you worked so hard.
How disappointing.

251
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,580
No, no, no.

252
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,500
Now I can say this.
I was not confident.

253
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,020
She has more money.
She has better qualifications.

254
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,400
I'm lucky that we tied.

255
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,800
At least I was able to save my pride.

256
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,150
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,720
You had so much going on
and I wasn't being helpful.

258
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,820
I'm not really disappointed
about the chairwoman position.

259
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,710
But I'm worried about Sung Min.

260
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,310
I don't know what to do.

261
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,510
<i>What are you doing?</i>

262
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,560
<i>I'm organizing my composition notebook.</i>

263
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,380
Wow, composition notebook?

264
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,110
<i>It's not that different from
playing games in my spare time</i>

265
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,500
<i>You were bragged just moments ago.</i>

266
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,590
<i>When did I do that?</i>

267
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,740
<i>You said that was
your number-one treasure.</i>

268
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,160
<i>Is it more important than me?</i>

269
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,770
<i>Let's stop here.</i>

270
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,750
Geez.

271
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,930
<i>Stop what?</i>

272
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,090
<i>Get over here with your notebook
within thirty minutes.</i>

273
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,260
Well, can't we just support him?

274
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,200
He's never been a troublemaker before.

275
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,040
He's working so hard because he
found something that he really likes.

276
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,060
He's just a kid.

277
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,310
He'll regret it someday.
We have to stop him now.

278
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,790
As his parents, that is our duty.

279
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,080
Geez, hey!

280
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,140
We're talking about
Sung Min, not Soo Min.

281
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,110
He can take care of himself!

282
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,110
Do you really wish for him to stop
studying and become a singer?

283
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,420
He said he would keep studying too!

284
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,300
That doesn't make sense!

285
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,550
You should be on my side
when it comes to their studies.

286
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,260
Now, you make me look bad!

287
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,420
I'm not taking anyone's side here!

288
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,160
I know what's going on.

289
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,070
You don't want any conflicts with him.
You just want to play Nice Dad.

290
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,380
What?

291
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,260
But all you do with them is fight.

292
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,070
It's much better for us to
support him, so we can get along!

293
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,420
If he were your own son, you would
make him study, no matter what!

294
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,030
How can you say that?

295
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,600
It's true.

296
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,240
If he were your own flesh and blood,
would you still be so lenient with him?

297
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,680
Eun Ok!

298
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,000
I want to repay you for what you've done.

299
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,200
I want to raise him well,
so he can make you proud.

300
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,280
That boy is--

301
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,450
Oh, Mom.

302
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,140
Yeah? Oh, I need to go to the bathroom.

303
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,160
My stomach hurts.

304
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,950
Oh... my... oh...

305
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,050
Go to sleep.

306
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,050
Come on.

307
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,160
<i>If he were your own son, you would
make him study, no matter what.</i>

308
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,860
If he were your own flesh and blood,
would you still be so lenient with him?

309
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,470
Sung Min, you're looking more and
more like your dad as you get older.

310
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,940
You didn't look anything like
him when you were little.

311
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,510
That's interesting.

312
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,640
<i>Whose son are you?
You're so smart and handsome!</i>

313
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
<i>You're perfect!</i>

314
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,890
<i>[Baek Hyun Jee]</i>

315
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,150
Where have you been?

316
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,600
Right outside.

317
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,300
Don't go out too late at night.

318
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,350
Mom gets worried.

319
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,350
Hey, look at this.

320
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,500
Mom said she forgot
to do it. So I ironed it.

321
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,090
I'm not very good at this.

322
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,010
Just wear it tomorrow and take it
to the dry cleaner on Saturday.

323
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,900
Take it. My arm hurts.

324
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,610
Good night!

325
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,720
Good night.

326
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,160
Okay.

327
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,630
Why is he being so formal...

328
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,540
Okay.

329
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,430
Have as much as you want.

330
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,880
So this is what it's like to
cook for your own family.

331
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,540
You didn't even cook.

332
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,070
You know what I mean. Geez...

333
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,710
Ma'am, what do you think?

334
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,570
I eat whatever is offered to me.

335
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,810
I eat when there's food.
I starve when there's no food.

336
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,750
Oh, that's bread!

337
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,180
My bread girl is here.
What about Sung Min?

338
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,040
He's gone. He must have left early,
so as to not see Mom.

339
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,580
Geez, how much did you torture him?

340
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,430
He went to school without eating!

341
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,080
Mom, is he a terrorist?

342
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,440
Why would she torture him?

343
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,490
Should I beat your first?

344
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,570
Geez, what's wrong with you?

345
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,210
You made me wait for two hours!

346
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,820
Sorry.

347
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,830
Did something happen?

348
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,910
It did, right? It did!

349
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,670
Were you embarrassed about your notebook?
Were you afraid I might tease you?

350
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,240
Hey, man! Everyone is like that.

351
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,570
No one is good right from
the start, except for me!

352
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,050
Hey!

353
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,370
Do you have time?

354
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,790
Be careful.

355
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,810
You must not have slept well last night.

356
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,900
Actually, I slept very well.

357
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,720
I have a strong mind.

358
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,680
You were amazing, Eun Ok.

359
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,240
You led us to a tie with those
pathetic promises of yours.

360
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,250
Don't say that.

361
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,380
You were amazing enough to earn 7 votes
as a hugely unproven candidate.

362
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,560
Oh, you have a good supporter behind you.

363
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,800
We need a real battle,
rather than this kind of quarrel.

364
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,540
I agree.

365
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,920
The only thing both of us hate
more than losing, is tying.

366
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,320
- Oh, Ma'am!
- Ma'am, you're here!

367
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,270
Unfortunately, yesterday's
election was called off.

368
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,250
The chairman had a minor
misunderstanding, but all is well now.

369
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:36,840
I hope that you won't hold bias
against him after that.

370
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,690
Are we going to resume the election then?

371
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,260
No, we are not. The chairwoman's
position will be vacant for a while.

372
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,380
Then, how are we going to
handle volunteer work?

373
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,660
Since you handled it previously,
you should take care of it for now.

374
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,600
The holiday events and marketing too?

375
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,740
About that...

376
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,920
Do Kyung should take care of those.

377
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,580
Eun Ok does all the dirty work,
and Do Kyung gets all the glory.

378
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,210
Good. I ask you to carry out

379
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:18,210
your respective duties
faithfully and diligently. Okay?

380
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,170
Yes, Ma'am.

381
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,050
Are you crazy? Crazy?

382
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,950
This is the last vote.

383
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,180
Seven to seven. And this one that we
couldn't open because of the chairman.

384
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,870
<i>[Kim Eun Ok]</i>

385
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,460
If Dad hadn't showed up,
Do Kyung would have lost.

386
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,600
Our efforts weren't enough to
change the hearts of the members.

387
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,840
Do you have any ideas
as to what we can do?

388
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:59,690
Why do you ask me that?
Isn't this what you're supposed to do?

389
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,780
What I'm saying is since we are in the
same boat, we should help each other--

390
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,120
You were so sure of it before.

391
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,060
Now that you're stuck,
you want me to get you out?

392
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,190
Madam. Madam Oh Sook Ja.

393
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,410
It's Oh Joo Ran.

394
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,320
Oh Joo Ran!

395
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:28,010
If you want to be called by that name,
do your job, Madam Oh Sook Ja!

396
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,180
Paternity test?

397
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,730
Are you sure? Really?

398
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:41,570
Yes, I want to know.

399
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,370
Show me your test sample.

400
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,100
Why?

401
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,860
I just want to see it!

402
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,780
Are you crazy?
Why did you throw that away?

403
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,500
What will you do after
you take that test?

404
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,790
What?

405
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,860
What will you do after you find out?

406
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,100
What if it is true?
What if it's not true?

407
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,180
I'm sorry about last night.
I said the wrong things.

408
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,600
I wasn't good either.

409
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,310
I am always on your side, no matter what.

410
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,370
I'll bring you a stick.

411
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,280
If Sung Min doesn't study,
you can beat him with it.

412
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,260
You don't really mean that!

413
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,090
What? Are you worried I might run away?

414
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,270
Don't worry. I go this way too.

415
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,040
I'm fine. You should go home.

416
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,720
Are you thinking for me?

417
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,620
Anyway, about today...

418
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,310
Don't worry.

419
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,180
I, Baek Hyun Jee, have zipped my mouth.

420
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,590
Yoon Sung Min!

421
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,100
Go now.

422
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,410
Okay.

423
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,430
Wait.

424
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,330
Hyun Jee.

425
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,040
I have a favor to ask you.

426
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,900
Please stop hanging out with Sung Min.

427
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,430
Mom!

428
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,600
What are you doing,
saying that to a child?

429
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,790
Your parents would not like
for you to see him either.

430
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,940
You understand what I'm saying, right?

431
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,580
What are you doing?

432
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,280
I should ask you the same thing!

433
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,530
Hyun Jee, go home safely.
See you again.

434
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,460
Yes, Sir.

435
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,050
What makes you so confident?

436
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,570
Aren't you embarrassed?

437
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,620
You don't feel ashamed?

438
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,030
I'm not embarrassed or ashamed about
anything concerning your studies.

439
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,470
I'm sure.

440
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,680
That way you don't feel as guilty.

441
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,010
What are you talking about?

442
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,520
Let's talk.

443
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,360
Don't touch me.

444
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,860
And leave me alone.

445
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,600
What?

446
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,250
What?

447
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,480
You stay here. I'll go beat him up!

448
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,600
Want some chicken?

449
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,020
Dad!

450
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,900
It's okay. You're an adult now.

451
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,000
You should learn how to
drink from your dad.

452
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,150
Toast! Man to man!

453
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,730
Okay!

454
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,300
One coke please!

455
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,990
Wow, my son really is
a good student, huh?

456
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,240
Say what you want to say.

457
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,590
I have nothing to say.

458
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,170
Wow, this is good!

459
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:47,400
I get to have drinks with my son!

460
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,060
I did that earlier...

461
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,050
because Mom was harsh on Hyun Jee.

462
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,890
I know.

463
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:58,100
A real man knows how
to protect his woman.

464
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,620
Dad.

465
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,170
Why did you marry Mom?

466
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,750
Huh?

467
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,500
Who proposed? Mom did?

468
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,270
Geez, why do you say that?

469
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,180
You can't say no if someone asks.

470
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,500
Hey!

471
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,080
I'm the one who's drinking.
But you're talking drunk.

472
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,520
Dad.

473
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,940
Why are you good to me?

474
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,370
Why do you always side with me?

475
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:50,140
I side with my child, of course.

476
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,260
Honestly, there were a lot of times
you didn't like me, right?

477
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,440
Don't even get me started.

478
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,510
I didn't like you long before
you were born!

479
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,160
Your mom had really bad morning sickness.

480
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,990
The labor process was horrible
when you were coming out.

481
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,550
My wife was hurting!
Of course I was upset.

482
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,360
"What kind of baby is this?
Come on out!"

483
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,750
But then you came out,
and when you saw me...

484
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,350
You smiled so brightly!

485
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:26,530
Geez, you were definitely my son.

486
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:31,250
You had striking facial features.
You had a big penis!

487
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,860
Dad...

488
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,650
"This boy will be someone great!"

489
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,660
"This boy will make lots of girls cry!"

490
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,770
I need to go to the bathroom.

491
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,950
Eat up!

492
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,850
I was so upset that Father ruined the
election that you would have won.

493
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,170
Take this. "Congratulations,"
and "Cheer Up."

494
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,380
I have no reason to take this.

495
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,730
Honestly, I didn't win the election.

496
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,600
You aren't hurt because
of what happened, are you?

497
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,820
I'll resolve it with Dad soon.

498
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,020
Soon? When?

499
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,540
You said you wanted to show me
how you could change, right?

500
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,630
You haven't changed a bit.

501
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,070
No change, no growth!

502
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:43,550
When I see how you do things, I don't
feel Hyun Jee and I can depend on you.

503
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,180
Does that mean...

504
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,830
there's a small part of you
that wants to get back together?

505
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,170
Mom!

506
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,050
Hyun Jee!

507
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,760
Hi, Dad.

508
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,720
What's wrong? Are you sick?

509
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,560
No.

510
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,010
I don't think that's the case.
What happened?

511
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,880
I said nothing.

512
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,600
- Go home.
- Okay.

513
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,680
Baek Gi Bum!

514
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,110
How dare you insult me...

515
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,720
Oh Sook Ja?

516
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:47,300
It's clear now,
why I can't write.

517
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,020
I'm bad at writing scripts.

518
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,690
I have no talent!

519
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,170
Why do you say that?
Director Bong from Poland!

520
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,830
Hey, I'm serious.

521
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,690
Okay, okay.

522
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,770
I surrender!

523
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,910
You and I are going to be
killed by those gangsters.

524
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,990
Even if we're going to die,
let's order another bottle of wine.

525
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,980
This is an expensive bar.

526
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,240
You have the company
credit card. Use it.

527
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,000
What if they say something?

528
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,660
I'll take care of it.

529
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,050
Anyway, this is red wine.

530
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,180
And my blood is red too.

531
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,930
I'll pay with my blood!

532
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,120
What's the point of living
if I can't even write a script?

533
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,540
Order.

534
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,520
Geez, kill those gangsters.

535
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,050
Kill...

536
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,510
Wow.

537
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:23,930
- Oh, my!
- I'm sorry. I apologize.

538
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:28,210
I was not careful. I'm sorry.

539
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:34,250
Perhaps... you are the movie director?

540
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,500
Wow, you know?

541
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,540
You're Madam Oh,
from One Heart, next door?

542
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,630
By the way, what were you doing here?

543
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,530
I felt I needed to suddenly stop here.

544
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:54,190
The painting that I fell in love with
in Europe is hanging on the wall.

545
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,420
Oh! Jan Van Dyke?

546
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,580
The Arnolfini Marriage!

547
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,620
Crazy!

548
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,750
You know this painting?

549
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,490
- Sure!
- Sure?

550
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,550
This painting!

551
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,760
There's a secret hidden in it.

552
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,760
Hidden secret!

553
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,760
You knew that?

554
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,290
The secret in the mirror!

555
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,690
Huh?

556
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,540
Oh, no! Oh, no!

557
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,200
Who are you? Huh?

558
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,250
Hello, Madam Oh.

559
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:15,860
But what have you done to me?

560
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,800
Oh, no! What's going on?

561
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,980
Calm down! What happened,
already happened.

562
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,670
Happened? What happened? Huh?

563
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,500
Nothing happened between us.

564
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,610
I drank so much last night,
I can't remember anything.

565
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:35,400
And... I... I am an educated man.

566
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,990
Calm down!

567
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:44,070
What you need to do now, is go to the
bathroom, and turn on the shower.

568
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:49,210
When you come to your senses, try to
remember what happened last night.

569
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:52,480
And see if you can still say
those irresponsible words!

570
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,670
Do you know what I'm saying?

571
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,640
Yes, I do.

572
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,820
Okay. Turn around and go to the bathroom.

573
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,580
Hurry up!

574
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,930
Go now. Go.

575
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,590
Go now.

576
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,280
Oh, my God! I'm crazy!

577
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,250
Geez.

578
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:47,570
Josephine was a great politician's
woman, and she was older!

579
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:53,390
But Napoleon loved all of her,
even her soul!

580
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:57,190
He must have known what would
happen to him if he loved her!

581
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,950
Please finish me today!

582
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:06,280
There's nothing to be afraid of
when you risk your life for something!

583
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,520
This is my first time. Please kill me!

584
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,550
<i>I think it was then!</i>

585
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,960
<i>My mind woke up!</i>

586
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,740
<i>So fresh, like mint candy!</i>

587
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,160
<i>I had an overflowing inspiration
for my script!</i>

588
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:30,580
Okay... Okay... Okay...

589
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,900
That's right.

590
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,960
"What were you doing here?"

591
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,600
"I felt I needed to suddenly stop here."

592
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,610
And then I pushed her to the wall...

593
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,440
Geez!

594
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,070
Mr... Chairman...

595
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,180
Well... you haven't gone to work yet?

596
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,210
Don't tell me...

597
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,430
You stayed up all night like that.

598
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,920
Mr. Chairman...

599
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,340
Mr. Chairman...

600
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,170
As a matter of fact, I...

601
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,610
You're home, Madam Oh!

602
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,830
I was so worried that
you might have left me!

603
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,420
Thank you for coming back!

604
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,270
I was wrong.

605
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,330
Wait a moment.

606
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,950
Geez, please stop, Mr. Chairman.

607
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,790
Last night, I...

608
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:15,810
I left the man who couldn't trust me.

609
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:21,060
But today, like a boomerang...

610
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,810
I came back here.

611
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:30,220
Therefore, let's forget...

612
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,230
Our mistakes yesterday.

613
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,700
Thank you, Honey!

614
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,540
Madam Oh!

615
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,370
Mr. Chairman.

616
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,810
I missed you.

617
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,840
I have to go.
I have a marketing meeting.

618
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,120
Oh, okay. Did Director Bong go somewhere?

619
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,820
He's going crazy over the script.

620
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,030
He disappeared at the bar. I'm worried.

621
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,420
I see.

622
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,060
Did you buy that?

623
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,550
No. This is my son's.

624
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,240
Bye.

625
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,810
Bye. Keep up the good work!

626
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:15,980
Thanks.

627
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,850
<i>[Paternity Test]</i>

628
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:30,750
<i>What makes you so confident, Mom?</i>

629
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,830
Aren't you embarrassed?

630
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,030
You don't feel ashamed?

631
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,670
Why are you good to me?

632
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,200
Honestly, there were a lot of times
you didn't like me, right?

633
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,690
I happened to see you.

634
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,220
I just wanted to apologize for my mom.

635
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,640
You don't have to.

636
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,690
I understand why she said those words.

637
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:44,010
Is something wrong?

638
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,500
Are you sick?

639
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,580
Well, I guess you can say I'm sick.

640
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,200
But it's really nothing.

641
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:56,440
I'll tell you if you can stay calm.

642
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,770
Want to know?

643
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,500
You're scared.

644
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,130
Then pretend you didn't see it.

645
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,770
I'll telling you this just
in case you imagine things.

646
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,300
I'm not like a sad dying heroine
in a movie.

647
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,020
So don't go there.

648
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,910
Anyway, did you sort out your thoughts?

649
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,500
Looks like you aren't there yet.

650
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,950
See you later.

651
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:38,310
Okay. Hang in there.
We only have a few boxes to go.

652
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,230
Oh man!

653
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,560
Do Kyung didn't come.

654
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,970
Geez, she was so eager
during the election.

655
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,570
Isn't she being a bit negligent?
Everyone else is working hard.

656
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,980
Why don't you call her, Kyung Mee?

657
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,790
Should I?

658
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,650
I'm late.

659
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,650
Oh, Do Kyung!

660
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,500
Hey...

661
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:10,060
Did you have a good time?

662
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,310
What do you mean?

663
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:16,990
Director Baek asked my husband to buy
flowers for him so he could cheer you up.

664
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:21,140
He was worried you might have
been hurt because of the election.

665
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,550
Maybe the two of you
will get back together.

666
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:29,070
Tell me the truth. Is there a possibility
you'll get back together with him?

667
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,120
Why are you hesitating?

668
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,900
If you become his wife

669
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,830
you'll become the chairwoman
without any need for an election.

670
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:43,500
You don't want that?

671
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,000
Eun Ok, you're really old-fashioned.

672
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,110
You should live your own life.

673
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,970
Why do you keep trying to
piggyback off of your man?

674
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,940
Is that what you want from Tae Soo?

675
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,550
Anyway, are you looking
for a place to live yet?

676
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,800
Do you even have time
to be here right now?

677
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:02,920
What do you mean?

678
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,550
What is she saying?

679
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,620
- Kyung Mee!
- Oh, my.

680
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,990
Tell me.

681
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,110
I'm not sure if it's accurate.

682
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:20,720
But my husband said...

683
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,040
The chairman told Tae Soo
to leave the house.

684
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,530
Are you okay?

685
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,340
Well... I need to get going.

686
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,820
Sun Young, please take care o
the rest for me.

687
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:43,840
Do Kyung...

688
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,400
Why did you say that?

689
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,820
I don't know.

690
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,980
Yes, the owner put it up for rent.

691
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,290
Did the chairman come
speak to you, himself?

692
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,530
His secretary came.

693
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:58,340
He said the chairman would
like to have a new renter.

694
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,230
Have you gotten many inquiries?

695
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,210
This neighborhood is popular these days.

696
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:08,390
I think it will be rented out
before springtime.

697
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:10,940
You will need to look for a new place.

698
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,480
Why are you outside? It's cold!

699
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,780
Why didn't you tell me?

700
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,230
Huh?

701
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,880
Oh... it's just that...

702
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,820
The chairman told us to leave the house?

703
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,500
What do we do now?

704
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,210
Geez, I'm dying from running!

705
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:41,430
You're worried we're going to
freeze to death on the street?

706
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:44,000
I thought you came out
because you missed me.

707
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,180
What? It's not true?

708
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,180
Do you not know that he
thinks of me as his own son?

709
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,900
No father would kick out his own son.

710
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,570
He was just upset with me because
of what happened with Soo Min.

711
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,820
I was rude to him.

712
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,000
I went to see the realtor.

713
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,400
Secretary Ma told him to
take care of it soon.

714
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,030
The secretary was exaggerating!

715
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:11,570
He only knows how to look serious.
He can't take a joke.

716
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:15,050
The realtor must be disappointed.

717
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,000
Are you sure?

718
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,830
Are you sure that that's the case?

719
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:21,460
Geez, how many times
do you want me to tell you?

720
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,610
Do you want to talk to the chairman?

721
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,840
Do you want to ask him yourself?

722
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,690
Forget it.

723
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,360
Do you know how scared I was?

724
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:36,110
I was worried to death!
Renting a house is expensive.

725
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,520
Let's go in. It's cold.

726
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,940
Did the kids come home?
What about Sung Min?

727
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,130
I don't know. He won't
come out of his room.

728
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,570
What about Soo Min?

729
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,210
Sung Min.

730
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,060
What?

731
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,110
I have a lot to do.

732
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:29,630
You asked me why I married your mom.

733
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:32,660
As a matter of fact...

734
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,490
I held onto her and begged.
That's how I married her.

735
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,010
If I hadn't done that

736
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:46,240
how else would I be able to marry a woman
as beautiful and smart as your mom?

737
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,000
You wouldn't agree?

738
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,650
Sung Min...

739
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:59,570
No matter what you may know,
or what you might have heard...

740
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,250
Nothing changes.

741
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:07,000
I am your father, and you are my son.

742
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,480
The 16th generation of
the Yoon family from Pal Bong.

743
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,240
Yoon Sung Min.

744
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:23,570
It's not good to hurt
your mom because of that...

745
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,150
Let me tell you something.

746
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:30,260
A man should remain calm in any
situation he may find himself in.

747
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:37,480
You know what I'm saying, right?

748
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:48,910
Okay. Eat some. I peeled them.

749
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,400
<i>[Keep us safe today.]</i>

750
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:44,620
Wow!

751
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,210
This is it! It has it all!
It's so good!

752
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,620
<i>[A Man of Two Faces]</i>

753
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,470
- You mean it?
- Would I be celebrating if I didn't?

754
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:59,120
Fists, Napoleon, Josephine?

755
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,150
It's a love story.
But it's so refreshing!

756
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:06,050
Big time! It sounds great!

757
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:10,380
Promise me an autograph when you
become director beloved by the nation.

758
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,000
I was right! Please,
from now on, trust him.

759
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,190
Good job, Director.

760
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,940
Thank you!

761
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,960
I... I went through a lot.

762
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,780
Until I could write this story--

763
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,360
Is this your story?

764
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,100
Huh?

765
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,060
The dialogues and the situations...
they're so real!

766
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:38,210
You must have a lot of
experience with women!

767
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,300
Fess up!

768
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,200
Director Bong, congratulations!

769
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,420
Good job!

770
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,690
Tae Soo!

771
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:52,710
Things started working out
ever since I became CEO, right?

772
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,880
Sister, I'm going to have
dinner with a friend.

773
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,140
Aren't you going back to Seoul?

774
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,050
What now? Tae Soo said
I can stay as long as I want.

775
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:08,580
Be quiet! Go back to
Seoul tomorrow. Okay?

776
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,960
I'll be back, Ma'am.

777
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,210
Your face is pretty and
your clothes are pretty.

778
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:21,310
That looks nice. It looks warm.

779
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:24,850
Enjoy your dinner.
She must be cooking deodeok.

780
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,620
It's been so long since we had deodeok.

781
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,810
My mouth is getting watery
just looking at them.

782
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:37,060
Mother, this is for the chairman.

783
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,110
I'll make some for you tomorrow.

784
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:41,340
Forget it.

785
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:44,980
I don't deserve to eat deodeok.

786
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,610
I can eat rice with water.

787
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,340
Do you have something to say?

788
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,690
No, of course not.

789
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:20,850
Just say it. It's better
that way for the both of us.

790
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:27,850
I'm not going to the senior center
until springtime.

791
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:32,050
- Do you want to go somewhere else?
- Go where?

792
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:36,350
I just want to stay home.

793
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,150
Yeah? Why?

794
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:40,260
It's cold...

795
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,230
And I don't like how Hye Sook's
mom brags about everything.

796
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:45,300
Brags about what?

797
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:50,690
Don't get me started!
She's a mean old hag!

798
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:53,770
She's boasts and boasts.
Her son bought her a mink coat.

799
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:59,340
When she wears that mink coat,
she has this strange look in her eyes.

800
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:02,120
She wags her bottom,
this way, and that way.

801
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,750
She won't take off her coat
while she's eating, or in class.

802
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,500
She's the only one
sweating in her seat.

803
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,740
What a scene!

804
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:17,270
So what can I do? I should stay
home if I don't want to see her.

805
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:22,290
I wish I could buy you a mink coat!

806
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:23,600
I'd like one too.

807
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,860
Don't misunderstand!
I'm not asking for one.

808
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,150
I guess the prices went down.

809
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,960
I see your sister has one too.

810
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:43,540
Geez, my body feels cold.
My heart feels cold.

811
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:47,940
Geez, when is Spring coming?

812
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:52,110
Geez.

813
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,150
Yes, Teacher?

814
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:05,650
Blank paper?

815
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,050
What do you mean?

816
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,310
Why would Sung Min
turn in a blank paper?

817
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:26,060
What's on your mind
that you don't even know I'm here?

818
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,490
Oh... you are here.

819
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:31,760
It's been a while.
You called me out here for a drink.

820
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,100
It's nothing. Take this.

821
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,140
Is it about your family?

822
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:47,340
Drink it first.

823
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:56,400
Geez, why am I feeling so sad
all of a sudden?

824
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,570
You're worried your family
might lose the house.

825
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:02,980
Tae Soo The Great had to call me
out here to buy me a drink.

826
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:07,900
You know the situation I'm in currently.

827
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,350
I'm living month to month.

828
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:14,600
I would be in big trouble if I didn't
hit the earnings quota for the month.

829
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,270
If I lose my home, we'll definitely
be living on the street.

830
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:23,500
Gi Bum, please speak
to the chairman for me.

831
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,670
Please?

832
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:29,630
You were all over me last time,
and now, now what's this?

833
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:33,980
Don't worry. I'll talked to my father.

834
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:37,850
Gi Bum, thank you!

835
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:45,690
But I'm not sure...
if my father will listen to me.

836
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:49,120
The whole world knows that he
likes you more than he likes me.

837
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,980
He already disowned me.
What should I do?

838
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,710
Like you say, I feel like
dying from running.

839
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,830
By the way, Tae Soo...

840
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:03,590
You've worked for over twenty years.
You must have some savings to your name.

841
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:05,340
You should have owned a house by now.

842
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,700
Did you spend it all?

843
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,870
I have two children and my mother.

844
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,870
It's expensive to raise kids!

845
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:17,610
Don't yell at me. Did I give them to you?

846
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:23,190
With my salary, it would take over ten
years to save enough to buy a house.

847
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,250
That's not my business.

848
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:28,740
There are so many condos everywhere.

849
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:31,630
I don't understand why more
people don't own homes.

850
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:34,500
I hear tons of units remain unsold.

851
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,870
It's a mystery.
How unfair is that, right?

852
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:39,520
Don't you agree?

853
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,830
Yoon Sung Min!

854
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:20,940
You turned in a blank test paper

855
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,940
turned off your phone,
and skipped cram school!

856
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,450
How dare you come home?

857
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,390
Should I leave?

858
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:31,760
You've gone insane!

859
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,920
What's wrong with you?

860
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,240
Aren't you going to college?

861
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,590
I'll take care of it. You leave me alone.

862
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:42,210
I'm your mom.
That's why I can't leave you alone.

863
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:44,120
I can't forgive you this time.

864
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,560
Forgive?

865
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:48,490
Do you have the right to say that?

866
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,070
I have the right because I'm your mother.

867
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:52,680
I gave birth to you, and I raised you!

868
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,420
Only an innocent mother can say that.

869
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,540
Honey!

870
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:09,230
How dare you! Did I ask you not to?
