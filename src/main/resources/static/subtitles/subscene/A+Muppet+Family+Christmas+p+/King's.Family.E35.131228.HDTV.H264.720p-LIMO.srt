00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,440
Oh, my...

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,400
What's all this?

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,860
I mean,

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,200
how could you buy so much?

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,770
That's not the $100,000 limit credit card!

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,990
Please don't mention the past.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,390
It's nuts.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,030
Then help me not bring it up.

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,190
Follow me.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,970
Receipts.

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,970
Here.

13
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,500
Household accounting book.

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,640
I haven't yet...

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,770
Not yet?

16
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,670
I'll do it.

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,140
When everyone goes to sleep.

18
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,590
I can focus better when everyone's asleep.

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,060
I used to study for exams after everyone...

20
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,060
Fine!

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,800
Just look at these.

22
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,840
You don't know anything, do you?

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,990
Why? What's wrong?

24
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,090
Everything is wrong.

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,530
How can you use a month's budget on one day?

26
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,240
How are we supposed to live?

27
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,240
But I only bought what we need.

28
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,640
Mr. Heo Sedal.

29
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,640
We used to live on $300 a month.

30
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,070
Look here.

31
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,890
I told you to refer to how I spent money!

32
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,800
Stop nagging on him.
That's enough.

33
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,470
Mom, please go to your room.

34
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,890
Stick to the budget.

35
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,160
You'll make us go bankrupt if you don't.

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,770
I'm going to check the book once a week.

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,970
Okay.

38
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,860
You're being too harsh on him.

39
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,770
Why are you kneeling?
You should relax.

40
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,570
I'm relaxed.
Mom, I'm fine. Go to bed.

41
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,370
You're driving me mad.

42
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,170
You're being too mean.

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,800
You should praise him for his efforts.

44
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,740
Were you great from the beginning?

45
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,990
Instead of explaining how to do it,

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,030
you make him sit on his knees,

47
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,800
as if he's one of your sons.

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,540
Mother.

49
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,970
Mom, go to your room.

50
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,860
Why are you butting in our business?

51
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,930
Your business?

52
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,300
Have your bodies switched or something?

53
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,360
What do you mean?

54
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,430
Hobak, you should get a check up

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,990
to make sure you're not a man.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,660
Sedal, you too.

57
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,440
It's like if you switched roles with each other.

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,160
That's because we're married.

59
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,240
Idiot.

60
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,040
You have no balls.

61
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,740
I can't believe I gave birth to you.

62
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,540
Why did I even bother?

63
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,900
But we work well together and that's good.

64
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,270
Right, honey?

65
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,590
How can you use violence?

66
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,640
I want a divorce.

67
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,140
I'm moving out.

68
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,800
Don't tell your parents yet.

69
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,770
I'm pregnant.

70
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,700
What's wrong?

71
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,000
Did you have a bad dream?

72
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,990
I wish!

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,300
Go back to sleep.

74
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,570
You almost scared a baby out of me!

75
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,540
You too? That can't be.

76
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,970
What?

77
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,430
Don't talk to me about any babies.

78
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,830
Why you little, just go to sleep!

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,860
You have no wife or children to support.

80
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,640
Your brother is supporting you,

81
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,300
so why can't you sleep well?

82
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,970
Wife and children.

83
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,800
Mom's words are hitting me really hard.

84
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,860
Hobak.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,390
Yeongdal.

86
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,430
Sintong, Bangtong.

87
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,560
Why are you calling them?

88
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,760
Please don't tell the boys.

89
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,890
I was checking to see if they're asleep.

90
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,800
They are fast asleep.

91
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,100
Yeongdal, be honest with me.

92
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,970
About what?

93
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,840
I've been suspicious of you lately.

94
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,940
You are, aren't you?

95
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,190
No, I'm not even married.

96
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,090
Don't just deny it.

97
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,700
Be honest with me,

98
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,260
so we can figure things out.

99
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,530
What if your stomach starts to grow?

100
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,940
Shh!

101
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,860
Oh, boy...

102
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,360
Hobak.

103
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,860
You shouldn't cry.

104
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,630
You have to pull yourself together.

105
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,860
I have experience in this.

106
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,390
You're scared, aren't you?

107
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,760
How many months?

108
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,030
Have you gone to the doctor's?

109
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,860
No, I'm too scared to.

110
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,100
I only did a home pregnancy test.

111
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,130
Whose is it?

112
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,190
Heo Yeongdal. It's mine.

113
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,990
Not you! The baby's dad.

114
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,540
Oh, tell me, so we can figure things out.

115
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,430
Yeongdal, is it...

116
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,670
Is it what?

117
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,470
That you don't know who the dad is?

118
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,670
Huh?

119
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,600
I mean, did you get drunk and...

120
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,100
Hobak,

121
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,360
I've always had a lot of men around,

122
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,130
but I was never that crazy.

123
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,630
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,760
Then who is it?

125
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,630
Did you tell him?

126
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,840
And?

127
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,240
He won't take care of you? He won't?

128
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,760
That bastard!

129
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,060
Tell me who he is. I'll kill him.

130
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,960
Please don't.

131
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,570
Who is it? Huh?

132
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,360
We should beat up a bastard like that.

133
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,760
My uncle? Ugh...

134
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,740
Hobak. Shh!

135
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,990
This can't be.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,100
You hate each other.

137
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,860
It just happened.

138
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,630
Hobak, what do we do?

139
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,560
- Mom! 
- Mother.

140
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,740
What are you doing?
Why aren't you in bed?

141
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,540
I was asking Yeongdal something.

142
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,300
Mom, let's go.

143
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,430
Now you're yelling at your sister in law, too?

144
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,540
She's not yelling at me.

145
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,840
Mom, let's go.

146
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,100
The stew came out really delicious.

147
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,490
It's perfect for winter.

148
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,540
Yes.

149
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,970
Minjung didn't come home, did he?

150
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,640
Huh?

151
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,160
No.

152
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,490
He didn't even call last night.

153
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,560
He would've come home, if he could.

154
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,490
He must be really busy.

155
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,890
It's because it's the end of the year.

156
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,760
Bring him some clothes.

157
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,100
Okay.

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,100
You're really getting a divorce?

159
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,130
What else can I do?

160
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,290
You're getting a divorce over that?

161
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,660
Your husband must be really petty.

162
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,930
Didn't you complain about me being married?

163
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,840
I'm actually glad.

164
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,170
I was really scared when it happened,

165
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,160
but now I feel relieved.

166
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,160
You're not happy I'm getting a divorce?

167
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,700
Fine, I am. Boy...

168
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,800
I got a divorce, but it's not good.

169
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,690
You should try to make things work for the kids.

170
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,170
But I can't.

171
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,030
Is anything up at home?

172
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,460
Nobody has dropped by or called?

173
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,340
No, why do you ask?

174
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,300
It's nothing.

175
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,990
It's just over that hill there.

176
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,260
Right this way.

177
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,900
It's perfect for one person.

178
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,360
Would you like to move in?

179
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,900
Yes, mother.

180
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,860
You didn't come home.

181
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,790
You must be really busy.

182
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,990
I am.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,570
I made ground bean stew for you.

184
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,170
Are you coming home late tonight?

185
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,030
I'm going to make kimchi stew for you.

186
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,560
We made kimchi together,

187
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,300
so we should eat it together.

188
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,290
I got mackerels at the market.

189
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,830
I'm going to boil it with some kimchi,

190
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,670
and it'll be perfect with rice.

191
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,960
Makes your mouth water, huh?

192
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,990
That thing you do,

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,840
when you see something delicious.

194
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,740
Drop by for dinner, okay?

195
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,890
And drive carefully.

196
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,490
The streets were so slippery that I almost slipped and fell.

197
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,660
I was carrying Jungji on my back, so if I'd fallen,

198
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,260
I would've made a pancake of your son!

199
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,890
So watch out and don't slip.

200
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,240
You must be busy. I'm hanging up.

201
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,240
Okay.

202
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,890
Goodbye, mother.

203
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,100
So, will you move...

204
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,340
I will.

205
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,570
Yeongdal!

206
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,990
I need to ask you something.

207
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,030
I dropped by on my way to a shop.

208
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,190
Did my uncle call?

209
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,030
He hasn't?

210
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,690
Oh, man.

211
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,360
Yeongdal, let me ask you one thing.

212
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,600
Do you love my uncle?

213
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,630
And you want to marry him?

214
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,360
How can you do that?

215
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,070
How can you make her cry and do nothing as if it's none of your business?

216
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,940
What else could I do?

217
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,170
You have to take responsibility, like a man.

218
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,130
I want to, but...

219
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,530
But what?

220
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,960
Why are you making excuses?

221
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,170
You know how pathetic you look if you ignore the issue and disappear?

222
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,690
She'll remember that forever.

223
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,540
I know that.

224
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,530
But I haven't disappeared on her.

225
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,240
Not texting or calling her after hearing that is disappearing on her.

226
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,740
I wasn't being literal, you know?

227
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,600
You don't get it at all, do you?

228
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,390
I'm furious so imagine how she feels.

229
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,560
What am I supposed to do?

230
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,990
You really don't know?

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,790
You have to marry her.

232
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,060
But it's not like I have a job.

233
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,040
Then why did you sleep with her?

234
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,660
I didn't want to do it. I got drunk.

235
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,990
Don't blame the alcohol.
You sound like a loser.

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,130
Don't live up to your nickname!

237
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,860
You!

238
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,990
Then don't act like a loser.

239
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,130
Uncle, be honest with me.

240
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,660
Do you love Yeongdal?

241
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,860
Even if I do, it doesn't matter.

242
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,470
She got furious saying she felt dirty.

243
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,740
That's not true!

244
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,860
She said she loves you.

245
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,240
She did?

246
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,260
She loves me?

247
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,260
Yes.

248
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,560
That can't be.

249
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,860
I'm not her type. You know that.

250
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,100
Her ideal man is a rich man.

251
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,540
Who marries their ideal?

252
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,740
The important thing is that she loves you.

253
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,360
Although I don't know why.

254
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:16,790
From my experience, the man who takes care of me is the best man in the world.

255
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,130
Being poor means nothing, if there's love.

256
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,740
That was how I felt, uncle.

257
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,360
But she's not you.

258
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,760
All women are the same.

259
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,360
Thanks, Hobak.

260
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,430
Thanks, Hobak.

261
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,530
Yeongdal.

262
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,930
Yes?

263
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,890
Don't let this baby ruin your life.

264
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,240
If you end up with me, your life will become miserable.

265
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,670
You called me to tell me that?

266
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,860
You made me here in silence for 30 minutes,

267
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,490
and that's all you have to say?

268
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,390
Fine.

269
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,860
I'm going to have this baby alone.

270
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,600
Don't even say hi to me from now on.

271
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,690
This wasn't what I planned.

272
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,790
This is crazy.

273
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,460
What do you want?

274
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,240
I...

275
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,100
I can't buy you brand name handbags.

276
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,290
Is that okay with you?

277
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,840
Don!

278
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,490
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

279
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,390
The baby, careful.

280
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,670
You must be busy with your son's wedding.

281
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,060
I am.

282
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,860
Oh, my...

283
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,470
Meet me after the wedding.

284
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,170
I'm on fire, thanks to you.

285
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,830
You're the hottest man.

286
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,390
I can tell just looking at you.

287
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,030
I came to say hi today.

288
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,430
I can't go a day without seeing your face.

289
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,740
Okay.

290
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,470
Is your ex-wife coming to the wedding?

291
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,360
She wants to, but...

292
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,290
My husband died, so I don't know,

293
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,190
but how does it feel to meet your ex-wife?

294
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,970
I don't feel anything.

295
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,760
It's like meeting a robot.

296
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,890
- A robot?
- Yes.

297
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,100
Okay.

298
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,490
You can call me or text me.

299
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,700
My phone is always on.

300
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,860
Okay. Bye.

301
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,700
Who was she?

302
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,400
The makeup store owner.

303
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,330
Whatever.

304
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,970
Father.

305
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,240
No more.

306
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,290
How much is it?

307
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,970
It's not much, but it's the best I could.

308
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,400
What do you take me for?

309
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,200
Excuse me?

310
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,260
You think I'm a beggar?

311
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,030
This is the best you could do?

312
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,790
You take me for an idiot, don't you?

313
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,390
- That's not true.
- Mother.

314
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,340
Mother.

315
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,660
Why do you think Sangnam introduced us?

316
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,490
He wants you to treat me like a mother!

317
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,760
You don't get it, do you?

318
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,700
Did I give you a list of things to buy?

319
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,760
Haven't you heard of what people do?

320
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,860
What kind of wedding gifts they buy?

321
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,000
Then you should at least show some courtesy.

322
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,290
$5,000? That's it?

323
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,940
Is that for my chewing gum?

324
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,400
If I wanted to,

325
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,370
I can cancel this wedding.

326
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,360
Mother,

327
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,640
this isn't a wedding gift.

328
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,340
We're not giving each other wedding gifts,

329
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,470
and I'm going to stick to that.

330
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,670
This is a little gift I'm giving to thank you for bringing Sangnam into this world.

331
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,140
For bringing him into the world?

332
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,530
I told you to act like my daughter in law.

333
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,200
How dare you act this way?

334
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,470
You want a piece of me?

335
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,170
I was infamous when I ran a tea house.

336
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,100
Who do you think I am?

337
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,930
Fine. I'm calling Sangnam.

338
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,460
Look at you!

339
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,370
Do you really want me to call him?

340
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,740
If you want to, go ahead.

341
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,170
What?

342
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,340
I don't think this is right.

343
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,060
I won't answer to any more unjust demands.

344
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,490
I thought you were a reasonable person,

345
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,060
and I wouldn't have come had I known better.

346
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,200
Whatever you want to tell Sangnam,

347
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,790
you can go ahead and tell him.

348
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,760
I brought this for you,

349
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,260
so I'll leave it with you.

350
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,640
I can't believe her!

351
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,970
Hey! You!

352
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,290
I think you should show your father in law

353
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,290
a token of appreciation for raising Sangnam up so well all alone.

354
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,060
But don't tell Sangnam about it.

355
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,690
I like this one,

356
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,470
but would my father in law like it?

357
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,900
You have great taste.

358
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,300
It's a popular gift item for the groom's father.

359
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,990
You can wrap it in the traditional quilt.

360
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,290
Then I'll take the box and wrapping quilt, too.

361
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,140
How about your letter?

362
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,200
My letter?

363
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,490
Brides write letters to their in laws.

364
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,030
What do I say?

365
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,240
Things that are nice to hear.

366
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,560
Thank him for his son, and for bringing you into the family.

367
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,530
And say that you'll be good to the family.

368
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,590
Who wouldn't like that?

369
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,590
They'll be so happy.

370
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,360
Here is a sample letter.

371
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,160
Some people put rice paper over it and trace it, too.

372
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,940
You can decorate it with pressed flowers.

373
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,490
Talk about earning points, right?

374
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,240
Is he here?

375
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,860
Where were you?
We closed a long time ago.

376
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,740
Oh, I met some friends.

377
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,640
Don, come in.

378
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,890
Hello.

379
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,300
It's you, Loser.

380
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,560
How come you came with Yeongdal?

381
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,700
I ran into him outside.

382
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,260
Sedal is in the kitchen.

383
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,330
Your friend is now a housewife.

384
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,490
Hold on.
I'm almost done with the dishes.

385
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,030
Whoa!

386
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,130
You look nice, uncle.

387
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,840
Wow, you look really handsome in that suit.

388
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,590
I heard you're busy these days.

389
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,890
Yes.

390
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,240
You'll be making lots of money soon.

391
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,030
Dad's setting up a pizza shop for you when you get your license, right?

392
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,490
Women will line up for you, uncle.

393
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,360
You went a little too far.

394
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,090
There are so many pizza shops now that they go bankrupt every day.

395
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,060
Mom!

396
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,740
Don't talk about going bankrupt! It's bad luck.

397
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,090
How can you talk like that to your mom?

398
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,830
Sorry, mom.

399
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,990
I can't believe you're listening to Loser.

400
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,060
Don't stand there like that. Sit.

401
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,860
Okay.

402
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,170
Loser, you look different tonight.

403
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,260
It's because you've only seen him delivering pizza.

404
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,290
He's actually tall and stylish.

405
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,940
Oh, here.

406
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,030
Oh! Uncle! You're so kind!

407
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,700
You'll make a great husband!

408
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,100
Right, mother?

409
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,090
Where did you get the money to buy this?

410
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,290
I know you can't afford it.

411
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,090
You should save every penny you make,

412
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,630
if you want to get married some day.

413
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,640
He can afford this.

414
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,140
I won't let you spend money on me.

415
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,900
That's like stealing from the poor.

416
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,470
I know you don't make that much.

417
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,530
I'm saying this as your friend's mom.

418
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,590
Okay.

419
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,090
You don't know how life will turn out.

420
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,600
He might become rich selling pizza.

421
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,160
Words are easy.

422
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,760
Anyway, why are you sitting so closely?

423
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,790
Huh?

424
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,560
Oh, my!

425
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,430
You actually look really good together.

426
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,990
I'm actually offended to hear that.

427
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,090
What do you take Yeongdal for?

428
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,700
Loser,

429
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,100
don't be offended by mom's words.

430
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,030
Just let it pass.

431
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,290
Why should he?

432
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,860
He should pay attention to every word,

433
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,570
so someone will marry him someday.

434
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,090
It'd be so sad if he gets old and dies alone.

435
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,890
See if you can find a widow with kids.

436
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,140
Who knows?

437
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,900
He might get drunk like me and get some poor woman knocked up.

438
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:30,440
What kind of idiot would get knocked up by someone who's unemployed and penniless?

439
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,200
That's nonsense.

440
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,440
I agree.

441
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,760
Unbelievable.

442
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,740
Wasn't Hobak funny?

443
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,260
She tried to make her uncle look good.

444
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,130
As if I would ever even consider him.

445
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,870
No way!

446
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,360
Don't hang out with Loser, okay?

447
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,900
Don't even say hi when he visits.

448
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,800
You can't get involved with him, okay?

449
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,830
I know.

450
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,290
Hey.

451
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,390
How's your back?

452
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,370
It's much better.

453
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,530
I can get around now.

454
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,030
But the weather must affect it.

455
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,670
I go to the sauna sometimes.

456
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,900
What brings you by?

457
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,530
I just wanted to see you.

458
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,960
Is something wrong?

459
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,240
What is it?

460
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,790
Father...

461
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,470
I...

462
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,440
I'm getting a divorce.

463
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,760
I'm sorry, father.

464
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,970
Is living at her parents house too hard?

465
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,290
It's not that.

466
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:06,540
I've moved out.

467
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,030
I got a room.

468
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,640
How about the kids?

469
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,270
I'm worried about them.

470
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,300
Whoever raises them,

471
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,260
they'll grow up with only one parent.

472
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,260
Not being able to be there for them really breaks my heart.

473
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:37,490
I want to be able to provide for them.

474
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,590
When I think of them...

475
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,640
Dad!

476
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,890
My little girl.

477
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,340
Dad, why won't you come home?

478
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,760
Are you busy?

479
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,830
I've been really busy.

480
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,630
I won't be able to come home. 
Is that okay?

481
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,940
No! Dad, come home.

482
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,870
I will soon.

483
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,000
Do you want to go on a trip next Sunday?

484
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,900
Really?

485
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,700
Yes, really.

486
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,100
You're really getting married?

487
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,290
Yes.

488
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,060
Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

489
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,530
I married off two daughters before her,

490
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,940
but it's never been this difficult.

491
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,170
It was off and it was on. Off and on.

492
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,740
Like if it's some kind of a light switch.

493
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,830
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

494
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,790
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo!

495
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:52,860
I've never seen anything like it or heard of any daughter in law audition.

496
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,060
I'll be great to her to make up for that.

497
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,560
Of course you should.

498
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,530
Of course.

499
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,740
If you two are happy, it'll be worth it.

500
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,060
When dating, only the two of you matter,

501
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,890
but in marriage, you share responsibilities.

502
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,590
That's the difference between dating and marriage.

503
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,030
You'll face heartaches and difficulties,

504
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,890
and you'll be disappointed in each other.

505
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,570
You know our family motto?

506
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,670
Read it.

507
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,560
Put yourself in other's shoes. 

508
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,130
That will prevent lots of arguments.

509
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,870
I'll remember that.

510
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,400
Me too.

511
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,570
Don't try to take advantage.

512
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,330
Try to give more.

513
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,330
Think of what you can do for each other.

514
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,590
Remember what your father's saying.

515
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,530
We will.

516
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,060
Don't pay attention to each others families.

517
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,990
You won't have time for that.

518
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,170
You'll be busy building your own family.

519
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,970
We're all doing pretty well. so don't worry.

520
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,600
Right.

521
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,430
What do you mean by that?

522
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,700
They shouldn't draw any lines.

523
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,400
There has to be a relationship.

524
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,040
Nothing's changing for his family,

525
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,740
but we're losing a daughter.

526
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,640
Put yourself in our shoes.

527
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,770
I'm losing a daughter I've raised for 30 years.

528
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,360
Are you trying to do business with your kid?

529
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,800
It's okay.

530
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,490
I'll remember that.

531
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,760
Don't take my mom too seriously.

532
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,990
I don't know why she's acting like that.

533
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,330
I thought she was funny.

534
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,890
It won't be funny for so long.

535
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,870
My brother in laws are all tired of it.

536
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,800
You've trained me well, so I'm good.

537
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,290
I'll see you tomorrow.

538
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,240
What are you going to do tonight?

539
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,560
I'm going to spend my last night being single partying all night.

540
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,700
Oh, you will? 
Wow...

541
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,760
We'll finally be married tomorrow.

542
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,030
But what is this feeling?

543
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,330
Aren't you really happy?

544
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,240
You know how honest I am, right?

545
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,040
I shouldn't feel this way,

546
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,390
but I'm only human.

547
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,260
What do you mean?

548
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,790
Now that I know you'll be mine,

549
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,630
I don't feel anything when I hold you.

550
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,240
There's no excitement anymore.

551
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,290
What?

552
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,660
How mean!

553
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,940
I'm going to get you for this!

554
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,490
Oh...

555
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,900
I didn't see anything.

556
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,640
So continue on.

557
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,960
I'll see you tomorrow, uncle.

558
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,170
How embarrassing.

559
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:07,570
Father, how come you're not in bed?

560
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,040
I will, soon.

561
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,090
What are you doing up?

562
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,670
I can't fall asleep.

563
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,290
Father, thank you.

564
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,490
I should thank you.

565
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,640
Gwangbak,

566
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,740
I'm always on your side.

567
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:35,370
I've never opposed anything you did.

568
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,800
Except for this wedding.

569
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,030
I know.

570
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,890
You've always been on my side,

571
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:49,070
even when I quit my job to become a writer.

572
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,260
You've always been behind me all the way,

573
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:58,990
and knowing you were there gave me all the confidence I needed.

574
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,090
Thank you so much, father.

575
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,240
My little girl.

576
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,260
You're leaving me now.

577
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,440
You're not my daughter anymore.

578
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,740
You're a man's wife

579
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,760
and a daughter in law of another family.

580
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:25,070
Times change, but all parents want one thing.

581
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,240
A happy marriage life for their children.

582
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,740
I'll be happy, father.

583
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,440
I know you will be.

584
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,290
Be wise.

585
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,090
Everyone loves those who are good to their parents.

586
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:46,560
Respect and love your father in law.

587
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:50,530
Then Sangnam will treasure you.

588
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,890
That's how you become family.

589
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,240
I will, father.

590
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,200
Don't worry about us.

591
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,530
We have your sisters and Daebak.

592
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,760
It's okay if you're not here.

593
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:08,030
If you build a happy family,

594
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,890
I will be happy for you.

595
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,940
I'll try my best.

596
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,890
Oh, I knew it.

597
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,970
Why aren't you in bed?

598
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,290
A groom needs his beauty sleep.

599
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,930
I want to have a drink with you.

600
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,260
Come inside, father.

601
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,700
Sangnam.

602
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,840
I only have one thing to say.

603
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,600
Good luck, son.

604
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,600
Father.

605
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,590
Thank you for raising me.

606
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,330
I'm the one who's thankful.

607
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,100
Thank you for growing up to be a good man,

608
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,830
and thank you for being by my side.

609
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:24,970
To me, you were a friend, brother,

610
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,290
son and wife.

611
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,700
Actually,

612
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,470
I was able to make it because of you.

613
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,270
I don't know where I'd be if it weren't for you.

614
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,100
Father.

615
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,390
Father.

616
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,890
Thank you, father.

617
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,740
You grew up without a mom.

618
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,070
Thinking about it breaks my heart.

619
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,470
It's okay.

620
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,390
You were mom and dad to me.

621
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,530
I'm a good man because of you.

622
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,370
Father,

623
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,600
I've always been proud of you.

624
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:25,540
I gave up education and followed your path because I was proud of you.

625
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,890
You are the greatest man to me.

626
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,940
I want to live like you.

627
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,990
You shouldn't.

628
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,940
You should live happily with your wife.

629
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,600
I will.

630
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,330
So happy that you'll be jealous.

631
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,560
Good.

632
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,270
Father.

633
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,370
Thank you.

634
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,030
Why aren't you asleep?

635
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,870
I want to sleep with you, mom.

636
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,370
Mom, you're sad, aren't you?

637
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:56,330
This is my third time, so not really.

638
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,770
Compared to Subak and Hobak,

639
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,270
I had bigger hopes for you.

640
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,270
Growing up, you were a stubborn girl.

641
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,370
You never once gave in.

642
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,040
You never once listened to me.

643
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,890
I'm sorry, mom.

644
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,200
I was nothing but trouble for you.

645
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,140
I want you to be happy.

646
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,170
That's all I want.

647
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,890
I will be.

648
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,160
I promised father earlier.

649
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,660
I told you I won't give you allowance,

650
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,590
but I will, secretly.

651
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,590
You will?

652
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,790
Of course.

653
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,600
I'll skim money and give it to you.

654
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,940
And I'll buy you boxes of dollar undies.

655
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,160
Oh, you're the best.

656
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,470
Have lots of children.

657
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,740
It's hard to raise many kids,

658
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,890
but once they're grown up, it's nice.

659
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,530
If one child makes you sad,

660
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,000
another makes up for it, and so on.

661
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,800
I'll have at least five.

662
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,790
You'll raise them for me, right?

663
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,290
No thank you!

664
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,790
Can I get some sleep here?

665
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,600
You weren't asleep?

666
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,560
I couldn't.

667
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:27,660
You're teaching your daughter to skim money.

668
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,060
So how can I sleep?

669
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,500
Oh, no, Jungji's up.

670
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,770
Oh, no.

671
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,940
Bark for him before you get married.

672
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,770
Oh, boy.

673
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,560
- How pretty.
- Bounce. bounce.

674
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,760
Let me use the toilet.

675
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,640
Where's my necktie?

676
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,760
It's on the dresser.

677
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,840
Okay.

678
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,040
Excuse me, excuse me.

679
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,140
Hey, Gwangbak.

680
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,700
Letter?

681
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,200
Okay.

682
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,060
Put it in and wrap it up?

683
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,030
Okay.

684
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,970
You go ahead first.

685
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,200
Miho, go with your uncle.

686
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,540
Why?

687
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,100
I have to do something before I go.

688
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,400
Go ahead without me.

689
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,390
You have to greet the guests.

690
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,030
Okay. Let's go, Miho.

691
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,870
Where are you?

692
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,440
I'm about to leave.

693
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,260
Then come to the house.

694
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,160
Why?

695
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,290
Come. We have no time.

696
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,660
- Come.
- Why?

697
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,570
You need to wear hanbok.

698
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,660
I have to wear hanbok?

699
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,470
Were you going to wear that cheap outfit?

700
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,200
Come to my dress room and change.

701
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,470
You have a dress room?

702
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,600
I turned the basement into my dress room.

703
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,560
Girl,

704
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,240
you're enjoying all the luxury I could've.

705
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,470
It's a bit creepy here.

706
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,470
Come in.

707
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,740
It's too dark in here.

708
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,970
Turn the lights on.

709
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,740
Where are the clothes?

710
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,870
Hey! Sunjeong!
Why are you doing this?

711
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,240
Sunjeong!

712
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,160
I'm sorry, but stay there.

713
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,470
I put water and a chamber pot in there.

714
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,370
So stay there until the wedding's over.

715
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,870
You little!

716
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,330
Hey! Sunjeong!

717
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,990
Open this door! Open it!

718
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,100
I'll kill you!

719
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,870
I can't die just yet.

720
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,790
Sangnam invited you because he's naive,

721
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,530
but Daese and I won't let that happen.

722
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,440
I won't let you ruin Sangnam's wedding.

723
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,330
Hey! Sunjeong!

724
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,700
When I get out of here,

725
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,160
I'll kill you!

726
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,560
What took you so long?
We're about to start.

727
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,370
Hello.

728
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,600
Yes, hello.

729
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,440
It's my little sister's wedding.

730
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,360
Try to act like we're a loving couple,

731
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,740
so nobody will suspect anything.

732
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,200
I think everyone's here.
How do we start?

733
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,240
We'll have a simple ceremony and have lunch.

734
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,390
Okay. Go ahead and start.

735
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,440
I'll be the host.

736
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,970
I know how it's done.

737
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:07,240
This is the wedding style the government

738
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,160
wants us to have,

739
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,830
so there's no preacher or emcee.

740
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,790
It's cozy and nice.

741
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,430
Now, everyone,

742
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,030
focus and clap your hands!

743
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:22,140
If you don't, you'll be fined a dollar.

744
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,030
I will be the emcee because...

745
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,470
Well, someone has to do it.

746
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,270
Let me introduce myself.

747
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,270
I'm the bride's brother in law, Heo Sedal!

748
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,560
Sedal, keep it short, please.

749
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,970
I spent the last three days planning this,

750
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,160
but due to the groom's protest,

751
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,990
I'll keep it simple.

752
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,300
Today's lunch is Korean cuisine buffet,

753
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,760
so you can eat after the ceremony.

754
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,670
If you're caught eating before everyone else,

755
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,160
there'll be a dollar fine.

756
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,560
First!

757
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:10,290
We were supposed to sing the national anthem,

758
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:16,370
but we're going to skip to the blessings of the fathers in honor.

759
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,590
Please go first.

760
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:25,640
You should go first.

761
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,400
Okay.

762
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,940
Have lots of kids and be happy, no matter what.

763
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,170
Ditto.

764
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:42,560
Vice Principal, you should give a speech.

765
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:46,260
Speeches are boring if they're too long.

766
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,870
I've already said everything last night.

767
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,240
You'll get the answer if you put

768
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,270
yourself in other's shoes.

769
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,370
Ditto.

770
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:08,400
Next is the wedding rings...

771
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:16,670
But the bride and groom got impatient and already put them on.

772
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:22,740
Next is the announcement of the marriage.

773
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,870
I, Choi Sangnam.

774
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,140
And I, Wang Gwangbak.

775
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:29,540
Have become husband and wife!

776
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:44,340
We'll have lots of kids and live happily.

777
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,640
And when we make mistakes, let us know.

778
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,170
And guide us in the right direction.

779
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,700
That concludes Choi Sangnam...

780
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:54,930
And Wang Gwangbak's.

781
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,160
Wedding ceremony.

782
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,160
Oh, man.

783
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,700
What the heck!

784
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,540
Aunt,

785
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,600
it's small, but please give it to father.

786
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:39,140
I will. Thanks.

787
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,600
No. Thank you for your advice.

788
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,490
Aunt where is she?

789
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:52,500
It's almost over.

790
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,340
Well, I'm not sure.

791
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:07,770
Gum, gum.

792
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,240
Oh, no, oh, no.

793
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:15,740
For the bride and groom. Cheers!

794
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,240
Cheers!

795
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,740
Eat up.

796
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,000
You too.

797
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,470
Let me know if you want anything.

798
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,790
I'll get it for you.

799
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,160
Okay.

800
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,270
Hurry up and go.

801
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,270
Drive carefully and call us later.

802
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,340
We will.

803
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,540
You're leaving as two, but come back as three.

804
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,140
- Oh.
- We'll do our best.

805
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,830
We'll see you later.

806
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,970
Aunt, bye bye!

807
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,290
Sunjeong, good job.

808
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,530
It was nothing.

809
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,640
Congratulations on getting a daughter in law.

810
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,600
Oh, I put her gift in your room.

811
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,670
Take a look.

812
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:43,370
By the way, wasn't their eldest son in law the parcel service guy?

813
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:45,330
You're right.

814
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,200
I almost didn't recognize him.

815
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,290
He looked pretty handsome today.

816
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,930
How interesting.

817
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,970
Open this door! Open!

818
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,270
What was that?

819
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:02,200
Who do you think you are?

820
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:06,000
I missed my son's wedding because of you!

821
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,300
You!

822
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,370
What are you doing?

823
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,090
Sangnam is my only son.

824
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:24,040
You made me miss my son's wedding!

825
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,940
I won't ever forget this.

826
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,530
That was so mean.

827
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,700
You have no pity for me?

828
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,890
I won't ever see him again.

829
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,590
How could you...

830
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,330
What you did was wrong.

831
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:46,140
He's my own son.

832
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,870
I know I've done some bad things,

833
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,560
but how could you lock me up in the basement?

834
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:59,040
I'm addicted to chewing gum,

835
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:01,900
and I can't go a moment without it...

836
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:09,600
I'm sorry about locking you up, but your appearance would've been bad for Sangnam.

837
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,660
Fine. I'm the problem here.

838
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,790
Who can I blame?

839
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,030
You can see him tomorrow.

840
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,370
Really? I can do that?

841
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,970
Honey, thanks.

842
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,740
It's so much fun!

843
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:11,970
Don, run!

844
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,500
Run! Run!

845
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,700
Yeongdal, are you having fun?

846
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,870
Huh? Are you?

847
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,440
Yes!

848
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,370
Ouch.

849
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:34,830
It hurts.

850
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,260
Ouch.

851
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,260
Hey!

852
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:54,700
Giddy up! Giddy up!

853
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeongdal, are you having fun/

854
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:57,200
Yes!

855
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:58,430
Faster! Faster!

856
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:04,670
Don!

857
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,160
Don!

858
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:11,790
- Are you okay?
- Yes...

859
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:18,430
What was that?

860
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,830
Hey! Why are you laughing?

861
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,430
I can't breathe.

862
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,370
Sangnam.

863
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,670
Sunjeong, thanks.

864
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,990
But you did all the work.

865
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:32,200
You raised your son alone, and now he's

866
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,560
all grown up and married. You're amazing.

867
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:36,600
That's all because of you.

868
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:39,740
You've been like a mom to Sangnam.

869
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,640
I've always been grateful to you.

870
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,270
Please don't say that.

871
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,470
I'm indebted to you.

872
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,430
I'm going to be nice to Gwangbak.

873
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,240
She's my son's wife, so I shouldn't hate her.

874
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,100
Good for you, Daese.

875
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,200
But why did you tell Manjeong to stay?

876
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:58,970
Why didn't you just send her away?

877
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:04,100
Who knows what she might be up to?

878
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:07,400
I thought she should meet him one last time.

879
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,560
I've always felt badly about Sangnam's scars.

880
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:14,030
He's finally getting over them,

881
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,600
and I didn't want to get in the way.

882
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,870
We can't go back to the way things were,

883
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,790
but whenever they miss each other,

884
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,140
I think they can meet as mom and son.

885
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:27,370
And I think she's changed a lot.

886
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,830
Don't worry too much.

887
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,390
She'll only see them after the honeymoon.

888
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:43,700
What are you doing?

889
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,030
Reading a book on pregnancy.

890
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,660
And your mom?

891
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,160
She's meeting her friends.

892
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,260
Are you craving anything?

893
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,060
I am.

894
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,600
Excuse me,

895
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,830
can I buy a bowl of blood sausage soup?

896
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,990
But we're closed.

897
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:23,040
Just one bowl, please.

898
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,370
My wife is pregnant,

899
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,600
and she really wants blood sausage soup.

900
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,270
- She's pregnant?
- Yes.

901
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,670
If she doesn't eat it, our baby will be ugly.

902
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:35,660
Ma'am, you're very pretty.

903
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:36,660
Ugh...

904
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,530
This is only because you're so nice.

905
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,570
Thank you.

906
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,470
Thank you.

907
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,660
Yeongdal.

908
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,370
Don!

909
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,560
Let's have lots of fun.

910
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,660
I have a favor to ask.

911
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,630
You have to make me breakfast.

912
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,940
I can't work if I don't eat breakfast.

913
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,330
I promise.

914
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,100
I'll cook for you.

915
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:26,470
And instead of doing something the other likes,

916
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,700
let's not do what the other doesn't like.

917
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,900
Right. That shows how much you care.

918
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,290
Let's tell each other three things we hate.

919
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,490
You go first.

920
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,940
Don't talk badly about my family when we argue.

921
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,030
Don't look at other women.

922
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:45,700
Don't come home late without letting me know.

923
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,660
No silent treatment, no matter how mad.

924
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,390
No swearing or hitting, no matter how mad.

925
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,840
No spying on each other's phone. Okay?

926
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,660
Promise.

927
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,490
Copy.

928
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:03,640
Laminate.

929
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,600
Is it good?

930
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,160
Yes.

931
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:14,700
You carried it inside your jacket, so it's warm.

932
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:19,370
You'll get indigestion. Slow down.

933
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,900
My beautiful princess.

934
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,790
I'm a beautiful princess?

935
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,970
Yes, that's what I saved you in my phone as.

936
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,970
Then I should call you my handsome prince.

937
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,940
I feel sad for my princess.

938
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,700
Your friend must be having a great time

939
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,060
at a warm hotel room,

940
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:46,760
but you're eating soup out in the cold,

941
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,940
when you're much prettier.

942
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,290
I am?

943
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,290
To be honest, Gwangbak's not pretty.

944
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,660
She's skinny like a cotton swap.

945
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:58,860
Look at her eyes.

946
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,600
It's a miracle her eyeballs don't fall out.

947
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,790
I used to envy Gwangbak's good grades.

948
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,290
Why would you envy that?

949
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,740
Oh...

950
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:17,940
I'm sorry you got knocked up by me.

951
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,760
What's wrong with you?

952
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,400
There are so many rich men.

953
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,560
You're in serious trouble, girl.

954
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:28,890
That's not true. I'm the luckiest girl.

955
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:33,740
Thanks, Yeongdal.

956
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,630
Your mother doesn't know, does she?

957
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:43,940
No.

958
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,470
How do we tell her?

959
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:50,740
She hates me.

960
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:54,270
Let's work toward each other's dream.

961
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:58,200
I hope your China deal goes well.

962
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:01,000
And I want you to continue writing.

963
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:04,870
I can have a few hours a day to myself?

964
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,140
Of course.

965
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:09,640
I'll talk to father and be very supportive.

966
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:15,100
Shall we work on our parents request?

967
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,500
Oh, no!

968
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,490
Hold on.

969
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:43,540
Why?

970
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,040
I have a confession.

971
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,500
There's more?

972
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:50,900
I get scared when you say that.

973
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:55,030
There's something else I need to know?

974
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,200
Yes.

975
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:02,070
It's okay, you know?

976
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:03,890
I'm already yours.

977
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,060
I can't run away now.

978
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:10,070
I've never told anyone this before.

979
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,940
I've been saving this.

980
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,700
I love you.

981
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:25,240
Me too.

982
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:28,560
I love you, too.

983
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,930
Let's see...

984
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:11,030
Oh!

985
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,100
Sunjeong! Sunjeong!

986
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,100
Look! Look at this!

987
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,970
How can she send this to me?

988
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:46,100
I am so offended! 
This is no gift!

989
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:47,790
I'm sure she made a mistake.

990
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,240
You can't make a mistake like this!

991
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,430
She's thoughtless!
Completely thoughtless!

992
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,590
She's not careful, has no respect,

993
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:54,970
and has no manners!

994
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,660
How can she put this in the gift?

995
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:01,260
This shows she didn't pay any attention!

996
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,600
Daese, calm down.

997
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:04,790
I can't calm down! I won't!

998
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,370
I was planning on being nice to her!

999
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:11,100
How can she disappoint me like this?

1000
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,060
This is how she's going to act?

1001
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:24,470
- Is it good?
- It's so good.

1002
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,700
Slow down.

1003
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,500
Say ah.

1004
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:31,270
Is that you, Yeongdal?

1005
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,740
Don, wait for me!

1006
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:38,540
Hey!

1007
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:45,100
Stop! You! Loser!

1008
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:46,500
Loser!

1009
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,170
Thief!

1011
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,540
I was so upset I couldn't sleep.

1012
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:14,400
I was so nice to her!

1013
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,530
We should make it official.

1014
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,800
You're impossible.

1015
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,760
You don't want to divorce me?

1016
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:19,800
Shut up.

1017
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,260
You have to do everything I say.

1018
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,140
I want to divorce now so I can marry you.

1019
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:24,470
You want to marry me?

1020
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,160
Bong, please help.

1021
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,290
She won't even consider me.

1022
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,100
What is wrong with you?

1023
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:34,100
You said you'll be good to me!

1024
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:34,900
Yes.

1025
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,830
You're not doing this for the family.

1026
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,390
This is your revenge!

1027
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,660
This is my revenge.

1028
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:41,790
I can't take Sedal back just like that.
