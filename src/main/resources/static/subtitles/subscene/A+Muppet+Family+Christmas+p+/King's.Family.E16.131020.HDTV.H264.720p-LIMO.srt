2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,240
I want to be free.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,240
What?

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,540
What did you say you want?

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,910
Why do I have to repeat myself?

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,950
I am free spirited.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,700
I've been locked up in a cage called Hobak,

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,010
and I'm dying to get my freedom back.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,270
What do you mean by that?

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,300
You don't understand Korean?

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,600
Like I said, freedom.

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,670
Give me freedom or give me death.

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,410
Are you cheating on me?

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,400
That's where all women jump to.

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,850
When did you meet her? Who is she?

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,510
Come clean when you can.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,100
Don't ask me too many questions.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,510
I don't have anything to come clean about.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,550
It's simple. Give me freedom.

20
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,400
You...

21
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,170
Do you want me to beat you up?

22
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,080
Marriage isn't a joke!

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,170
How can you say that after having 2 kids?

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,850
We didn't get married out of love.

25
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,150
We did because you got pregnant.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,380
Instead of "I woke up one morning and found myself famous,"

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,910
I woke up one morning and found myself married.

28
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,140
Let's go back to who we used to be.

29
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,870
Back to being free, before we met.

30
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,180
Crazy bastard.

31
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,980
Don't swear. A man and a woman can...

32
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,480
We're not a man and a woman.

33
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,700
We're husband and wife, crazy bastard.

34
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,540
See how we can't communicate?

35
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,640
Don't try to resolve this by calling us that.

36
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,740
We're actually a man and a woman.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,610
I'm a man, you're a woman. Didn't you know?

38
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,100
She doesn't even know she's a woman.

39
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,510
Enough.

40
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,510
You already decided everything for me and

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,100
fed me the food I have never had before,

42
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,270
and now you want to be free?

43
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,180
How dare you!

44
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,070
I'm going to kill you.

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,600
A man like you deserves a good beating.

46
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,670
Hey.

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
You're embarrassing me! Use words!

48
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,680
How can I use words? How?

49
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,070
Come here. Come here!

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,950
Don't use violence! This is why I hate you.

51
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,780
Don't just stand there. Stop her!

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,170
What? What?

53
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,140
You can't do this here.

54
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,400
Don't grab me. Grab her, her!

55
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,540
Her, her! Her, her!

56
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,410
This is nutty, nutty, nuts!

57
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,380
Bastard!

58
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,280
Daese.

59
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,910
Are you busy?

60
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,180
No, do you want something?

61
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,070
You're not going out, are you?

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,850
I'm just going to the market.

63
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,710
Why?

64
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,540
It's because I'm getting a package today.

65
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,880
Who is it?

66
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,540
Please sign here.

67
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,180
Okay.

68
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,700
What about Mr. Ko Minjung?

69
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,570
Oh, something came up.

70
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,550
Okay.

71
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,900
Hello. May I help you find something?

72
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,640
Well, I... Uh...

73
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,400
Is it a present?

74
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,540
Uh...

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,050
It's for my wife.

76
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,650
She's lucky. May Ii suggest something?

77
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,340
How about these?

78
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,840
Oh.

79
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,270
Well, I'm looking for a dollar undies.

80
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,010
Excuse me?

81
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,810
Uh, I mean...

82
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,840
Do older women like these?

83
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,340
When you turn around...

84
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,740
Pants, pants...

85
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,340
I'm home, mother.

86
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,700
Hi.

87
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,810
Did you have dinner?

88
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,380
I lost my appetite.

89
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,200
Why didn't you make something special?

90
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,810
What's that behind you?

91
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,070
Oh, I brought some documents from school.

92
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,770
I need to get some work done.

93
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,640
When you come home, I look at your hands.

94
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,810
To see if you brought any food.

95
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,880
I'll bring you something delicious tomorrow.

96
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,180
Okay. Go to your room and rest.

97
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,750
Okay.

98
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,640
When you turn around, pants, pants...

99
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,340
What is it?

100
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,910
Are you going to yell at me about not making mother good food to eat?

101
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,300
If you deserve it, I should.

102
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,640
Here.

103
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,970
What is it?

104
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,900
Open it.

105
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,410
What's this?

106
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,450
Oh, my.

107
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,510
Are these for me?

108
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,900
Do you like them?

109
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,510
I've never seen anything like these before.

110
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,110
Why didn't you just get dollar undies?

111
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,510
These must be expensive.

112
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,270
I was going to get you a box full of dollar undies, but they looked prettier.

113
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:12,480
You actually went to a women's underwear shop and bought these?

114
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,370
Oh, I was sweating so hard.

115
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,380
I still can't believe I did that. Oh, boy.

116
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,550
Oh, darling old man!

117
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,250
Why...

118
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,450
No one's looking!

119
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,770
But this is poison, isn't it?

120
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,640
Yes, it is.

121
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,250
Living with Minjung must be hard.

122
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,750
I can escape to school,

123
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,110
but you have to take care of things.

124
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,480
Don't even get me started.

125
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,540
You're having a hard time,

126
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,610
but Minjung is also having a hard time.

127
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,180
Please be nicer to him.

128
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,910
I'm feeding him and raising his kids.

129
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,970
How much nicer do I have to be?

130
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,100
Do it for Subak.

131
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,500
Just think about it.

132
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,300
When mother's mean to you, how do I look?

133
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,780
- I'd love to beat you up.
- See?

134
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,780
Oh, I must be crazy for accepting this,

135
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,880
knowing this is poison.

136
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,340
Where am I going to go wearing these?

137
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,500
You're going to wear them outside?

138
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,040
But these are too nice to wear at home!

139
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,600
Where are you planning on

140
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,240
flashing your underwear?

141
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,400
You'll ruin people's eyes!

142
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,050
I heard the front door.

143
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,450
I did, too.

144
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,000
You heard the door?

145
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,570
Hello! Welcome home.

146
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,910
- Welcome home.
- How was your day?

147
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,200
- What's...
- Must've had a tough day, huh?

148
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,680
How are you?

149
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,550
Oh, Minjung, did you have a hard day?

150
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,180
Providing for your family is hard, isn't it?

151
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,340
It's not easy delivering packages.

152
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,000
It's hard enough having to live here,

153
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,900
but nobody waits for you when you come home

154
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,480
and you get into trouble with me

155
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,700
trying to make noodles,  making cat noise.

156
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,970
And I make you sleep outside.

157
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,740
I made you cry just the other night.

158
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,400
I know how hard it must have been.

159
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,310
How was that?

160
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,280
Did you go inside Minjung's head?

161
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,500
We all waited up for you.

162
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,500
You did that for me?

163
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,100
Yes, Minjung.

164
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,700
We usually go to sleep early,
but we stayed up for you.

165
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,950
Thank you so much.

166
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,870
You didn't have to do this.

167
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,950
I'm very sorry about the other night.

168
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,650
Are you really?

169
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,700
We were in shock that night.

170
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,570
Don't be. We're sorry.

171
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,680
No.

172
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,310
Can I go to bed now?

173
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,970
Why don't we order some snacks?

174
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,870
Why? You hate ordering food.

175
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,300
Dad, pizza!

176
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,050
- Okay.
- We can ask uncle to

177
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,550
- bring some home.
- Yes, let's do that.

178
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,000
- Call him.
- Okay.

179
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,180
Oh, boy.

180
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,170
It's so nice to sit together like this and to eat pizza late at night.

181
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,600
Yes, I can't stop smiling!

182
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,740
I wish we could eat like this every night.

183
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,970
Why can't you focus on studying?

184
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,970
Don't yell at my precious grandson.

185
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,600
Father, let's do this once a week.

186
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,740
We can also have a family meeting.

187
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,450
Yes, let's do that.

188
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,680
Tonight's topic should be that.

189
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,100
Tell your father to leave your mom alone.

190
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,600
We're the only family whose father is still in power.

191
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,640
What good will destroying his ego do?

192
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,350
You don't know how good you have it.

193
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,650
When your husband is strong, people don't look down on you or your children. Got it?

194
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,610
Don't get it.

195
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,070
Why you little...

196
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,570
You should know how lucky you are.

197
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,180
I lost my husband really early,

198
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,810
and I lived as a widow all those years...

199
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,370
Mother.

200
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,970
Mom.

201
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,700
As you get older, you get more wrinkles and tears.

202
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,280
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

203
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,680
Grandmother, in other families,

204
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,970
when the wives make noise when doing

205
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,640
the dishes, the husbands get nervous

206
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,810
and try to think about what they did wrong.

207
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,380
I know.

208
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,180
I know this guy from school, and he's now a gangster, but he's afraid of his wife.

209
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,880
While we're afraid of him.

210
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,970
Who cares about how other families are?

211
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,180
I know some husbands even buy underwear for their wives.

212
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,100
I'd like to see what they look like.

213
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,680
Minjung, let's drink.

214
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,150
Thank you for making this happen.

215
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,310
Okay.

216
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,910
What's there to life?

217
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,850
This is happiness, being with family like this.

218
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,470
Of course, of course.

219
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,570
Didn't your father say anything?

220
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,070
He didn't even come in.

221
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,480
What was that?

222
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,070
Minjung's father was here? When?

223
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,810
A few days ago.

224
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,450
He brought chestnuts,

225
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,740
but he turned around and went home.

226
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,840
I forgot to mention it.

227
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,570
How could you?

228
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,310
Come with me!

229
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,310
I can't believe this.

230
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,470
Grandmother, why did you bring that up?

231
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,240
You know how father gets.

232
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,200
Why are you blaming my mom?

233
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,050
You should've told me.

234
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,650
I could've at least called him.

235
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,050
He must be really upset.

236
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:18,010
Can't you imagine how he must have felt when he left them by the door?

237
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,470
Why are you changing into this weird person?

238
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,070
I don't know.

239
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,600
I don't know why I'm changing like this.

240
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,910
I guess people get rotten when they get old.

241
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,810
What?

242
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,340
Having to take care of a mean mother in law,

243
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,570
a tough husband, and five children turned me into this. So?

244
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,370
What?

245
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,900
There you go with that, "what?" What?

246
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,680
And I don't understand him either.

247
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,380
How can he just drop by without calling?

248
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,450
He didn't want you to go to any trouble preparing for his visit!

249
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,280
Don't you know how important he is?

250
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,910
I can't believe my ears.

251
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,480
Are your children important or not?

252
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,470
Of course they're important.

253
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,770
What a stupid question.

254
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,850
How do you manage to teach?

255
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,400
Aren't they the most important?

256
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,070
They're as important as my own life. So?

257
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:19,550
You and him have shared with each other children who you value as much as life itself!

258
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,280
That's what in laws are. Understand?

259
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,780
That's how special the relationship is,

260
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,850
so how could you cause conflicts?

261
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,140
You say "that beauty salon woman,"

262
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,570
and you belittle her all the time.

263
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,910
How would Sedal's mother feel about that?

264
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,950
She'll call me annoying vice principal's wife.

265
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,500
At least you know.

266
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,240
Put yourself in their shoes.

267
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,170
You'd know the answer right away.

268
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,010
I don't want these underwear.

269
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,470
Fine. I'll give them to mother.

270
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,810
They won't fit!

271
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,340
They are free size.

272
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,400
They'll fit anyone in any size.

273
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,550
Ugh!

274
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,950
He hasn't called you?

275
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,550
No.

276
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,500
And he won't answer my calls.

277
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,300
Should we call the police?

278
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,240
Don't worry.

279
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,570
He'll come home when he's ready.

280
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,300
How is she doing?

281
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,610
She's running a small beer house.

282
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:01,140
It looked like she's deep in debt.

283
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,400
I guess people don't change.

284
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,850
She should be doing better.

285
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,310
Why did you go there?

286
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,510
What did you expect from her?

287
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,970
I'm sorry, Daese.

288
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,740
What did she say to Sangnam?

289
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,100
Why is he acting like that?

290
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,110
Be honest with me,

291
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,680
although I can guess.

292
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,000
She broke Sangnam's heart.

293
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:32,870
How could she be so cold after 20 years?

294
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,180
How could she say those mean things?

295
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,200
She's not human.

296
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:43,470
I would've found her if she were.

297
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,950
She was into gambling and was cheating on me.

298
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,770
She stole every penny I had and left.

299
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,540
When I was at work,

300
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,700
she invited him to my house and...

301
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:03,540
She exposed our little boy to that.

302
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,610
It's all my fault.

303
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,810
Don't worry too much, Daese.

304
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,470
Sangnam just needs to clear his head.

305
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,380
If

306
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,070
anything happened to Sangnam,

307
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,310
I couldn't go on living.

308
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,800
That will never happen, Daese.

309
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:34,950
I'm worried to death about him being somewhere, thinking some stupid thoughts.

310
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,950
You can't grab me there!

311
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,040
Huh?

312
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,950
Hey, Goof-off.

313
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,500
You better come home, or else!

314
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,210
Stop talking nonsense, and come home.

315
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:24,650
If you don't, you're dead. Understand?

316
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,500
She still has no clue. Oh, boy.

317
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,970
How to get rid of your wife of 10 years.

318
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,180
How can she kick her husband out?

319
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,380
I should go and teach her a lesson.

320
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,880
Leave her alone.

321
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,680
Why isn't Yeongdal home?

322
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,270
Mom.

323
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,640
Hey, you should come home early!

324
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,850
Why are you yelling at my house?

325
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,710
And stop using my things.

326
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,050
You're sleeping here?
You had another fight?

327
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,950
I don't even want to talk about it.

328
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,350
Why are you coming home so late?

329
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,250
I had a blind date.

330
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,910
I thought you were getting married.

331
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,610
You can't just see one man. That's dumb.

332
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,970
It's always better to have options.

333
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,270
- Oh, boy.
- I'm not the only one doing it.

334
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,100
Me do it, too.

335
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,780
Mom, did you ask Sedal?

336
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,180
Ask me what?

337
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,500
Sedal, can you lend me some money?

338
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,650
Money? For what?

339
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,350
I could expand my beauty salon

340
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,680
or try something completely different,

341
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,580
but I need some dough.

342
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,280
Since the director likes you,

343
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,100
maybe you can ask for a loan.

344
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,510
Can he be cheating on you?

345
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,200
He says he's not.

346
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,200
And I believe him.

347
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,910
He doesn't have the guts to cheat on me.

348
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,380
But you never know.

349
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,150
He's kind of charming.

350
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,610
Charming my butt.

351
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,010
If he were a boy, I could beat him up.

352
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,450
Why is he suddenly crying for freedom?

353
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,680
Sedal is kind of immature, don't you think?

354
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,500
Why don't you just talk to him?

355
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,680
I'm too furious to talk to him.

356
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,740
He won't even come home after what he did.

357
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,650
I think you should try dressing up a bit.

358
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,950
You can't ask for freedom because of that!

359
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,800
I'm sure it's not that...

360
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,300
Hobak, don't get me wrong.

361
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,850
He must see beautiful women at the hotel.

362
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,610
And you've been together for a decade.

363
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,200
As a man, he could be getting ideas.

364
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,270
So dress up a little, don't scream at him,

365
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,370
and be more feminine and nicer to him.

366
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,050
Even I think you're too much sometimes.

367
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,980
Don't wear stretched out shirts or Sedal's old boxers.

368
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,610
Talk to him and just humor him.

369
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,950
Don't scream, be more feminine and nicer.

370
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,610
After the beep you will go to voice mail.

371
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,850
Sedal,

372
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,310
I'm sorry I got mad at you.

373
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,700
And I'm sorry about beating you.

374
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:45,700
I guess we've hit a difficult time, so let's try to work things out.

375
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:50,850
I won't scream and I won't wear your old boxers or stretched out t-shirts.

376
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,200
I was wrong.

377
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,850
And...

378
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,780
I'll make glass noodles so come and take it.

379
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,470
Is something going on with Sedal?

380
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,840
Why?

381
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,350
He asked Hobak to let him go.
Set him free.

382
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,270
Goof-off, how dare you...

383
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,950
Do you know something?

384
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,510
Tell me. You know something, don't you?

385
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,380
You're home already?

386
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,880
Hobak, it's me.

387
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,200
What are you saying?

388
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,850
He's cheating on me?

389
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,910
Calm down, Hobak.

390
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,470
He can't because he has no money.

391
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,840
Money doesn't affect cheating, it seems.

392
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,610
Oh, I had no idea.

393
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,910
Sintong's way smarter than me!

394
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,200
Who is it?
How long has it been?

395
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,610
Hobak, calm down.

396
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,700
How can I calm down?

397
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,450
Tell me everything.
Hurry up and tell me.

398
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,200
You actually know her.

399
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,380
I know her?

400
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,450
Who?

401
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,970
One of my friends?

402
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,880
The director.

403
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,510
What?

404
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,970
It's the director.

405
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,040
That can't be.

406
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,500
Hobak...

407
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,000
How can that be?

408
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:30,470
So that means that... That he's...

409
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,770
I had no idea.

410
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,970
Uncle, did you know?

411
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,410
I found out recently, too.

412
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,380
I heard it's a noticeable trait from childhood!

413
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,240
He wasn't like that when he was younger, right?

414
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,740
Can it happen this late?

415
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,610
How sad! And he couldn't tell anyone.

416
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,150
He didn't tell you.

417
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,000
He must have been tormented.

418
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,200
Oh, I thought this only happened in movies.

419
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,300
Oh, what do I do?

420
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,540
Hobak, what are you talking about?

421
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,410
You said he likes men.

422
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,910
What? Why would Sedal like men?

423
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,650
You said he's seeing the director.

424
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,950
That director's a woman.

425
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,980
The director is...

426
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,070
A woman?

427
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,680
You didn't know?

428
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,970
Oh, man!

429
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,910
Oh, hello, Mr. Ko.

430
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,680
I heard you came but I didn't ring the bell.

431
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,270
I'm so sorry.

432
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,140
You could've called me.

433
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,200
I didn't want to trouble you.

434
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,300
I just brought some chestnuts.

435
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,670
You must miss your granddaughters.

436
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,080
I sent Minjung and the girls to your house.

437
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:03,080
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

438
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,980
Thank you for being so kind.

439
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,110
Yes, Jungji.

440
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,770
You wouldn't answer my calls.

441
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,450
I'm sorry. It was all my fault.

442
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,000
I'll answer my phone before the third ring.

443
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,910
Things are complicated, but I'm sorting them out.

444
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,450
Director, she's made glass noodles.

445
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,450
Glass noodles?

446
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,240
Yes, Koreans' favorite, glass noodles.

447
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,800
I'll go home and get it right away.

448
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,100
Hey, glass noodles, glass noodles.

449
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,310
I'm in a hurry. Get it.

450
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,300
Why didn't you tell me?

451
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,570
What? I asked you to make me some.

452
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,710
That director's a woman?

453
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,380
It's not like you ever asked.

454
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,880
I never lied to you.

455
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,350
I told you where I went with the director,

456
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,480
and I told you about the amusement park.

457
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,500
You never asked me any questions.

458
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,410
I never lied to you.

459
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,240
Crazy bastard.

460
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,680
Did you like sharing the rice rolls I made with her?

461
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,000
Was it nice to hang around with her?

462
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,470
I wasn't going to say this but...

463
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,610
You gave me $3 a day,

464
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,410
but she gave me a $100,000 credit card.

465
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,770
It was like she opened up my world.

466
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,950
I couldn't believe my luck,

467
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,240
so I live everyday in gratitude.

468
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,000
It was just for the money?

469
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,470
Just?

470
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,450
Do you know what money can do?

471
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,650
Do you know the power of money?

472
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,350
Of course you don't.

473
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,980
Do you know what men want these days?

474
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:31,650
They want some rich women to appear and rescue them from their miserable reality.

475
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,880
I never felt this way before.

476
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,850
Your mother called me "my Sedal,"

477
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,700
and my friends started calling me every day.

478
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,800
When I go out, people respect me.

479
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:48,770
When I go to a restaurant or a bar, they treat me like a king. Did you know?

480
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,800
You're totally crazy.

481
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,900
Yes, let's say that I am.

482
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,240
I'm not supposed to be poor.

483
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,910
I'm supposed to become the president.

484
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,080
And you were a frog in your previous life.

485
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,480
You're worse than a tadpole.

486
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,700
I didn't know you were this hopeless.

487
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,800
Get a hold of yourself, crazy bastard!

488
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,480
Get out of my house!

489
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,470
I don't need you.

490
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,340
I'm embarrassed to call you my sons' dad.

491
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,150
How can you go completely crazy?

492
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,200
You gold digger!

493
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,140
Hey, Minjung!

494
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,540
Welcome!

495
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,070
Grandpa!

496
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,780
Oh, my darling Aeji.

497
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,850
Thank you for coming, Subak.

498
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,150
- She was fidgeting.
- Oh, no.

499
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,910
You can take her to the bedroom.

500
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,970
I'm trying to catch a chicken for you.

501
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,680
Careful. Don't get hurt doing it.

502
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,740
I used to be good, but not anymore.

503
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,770
They think I'm a joke because I'm old.

504
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,700
What do you mean?
You're not old.

505
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,150
Aeji, let's go and catch a chicken.

506
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,970
Let's go.

507
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,550
Aeji, come here. Grab that one.

508
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,680
Where are you coming from?

509
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,410
The market. You?

510
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,610
A party.

511
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,950
Is your back broken? What's that?

512
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,350
You don't know how comfortable this is.

513
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,580
Your sons haven't gotten you a stroller yet?

514
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,150
My son bought me this.

515
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,410
I have one more from my daughter at home.

516
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,080
Ugh.

517
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,650
Why I should...

518
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:11,610
I should just die! Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

519
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,700
I'm the one who doesn't have a stroller.

520
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,180
Isn't anyone home?
Come out!

521
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,740
Why you little!

522
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,410
Oh.

523
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,870
Hey, come out.

524
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,080
Why? I'm eating rice cake.

525
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,810
Eat that later.
Get the stroller for me.

526
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:57,900
You're going to ride it?

527
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,910
No, I'm going to push it.

528
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,550
- Go straight.
- Straight.

529
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,870
And turn right. Turn this way. Yes.

530
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,310
What are you doing?

531
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,450
Can't you tell?

532
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,540
I'm exhausted.
Don't talk to me.

533
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,450
Mom's going to drive this.

534
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,410
What?

535
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,580
I'm the only one without a stroller.

536
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,980
Even the dogs have them.

537
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,000
I can lean on it, so it's very comfortable.

538
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,150
I saw others push this around,

539
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,110
and I didn't know why they were doing it.

540
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,080
You can't.
Do you know how much this was?

541
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,110
Why not?

542
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,970
It's for Jungji.

543
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,410
But I never saw Subak use is.

544
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,470
I can push this around and break it in.

545
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,680
Subak will be furious.

546
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,200
Uncle, take this back home.

547
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,410
And wash the dirt off the wheels.

548
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,200
Okay.

549
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,300
Leave it!

550
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,400
Hurry up.

551
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,240
Uncle.

552
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,410
I said leave it!

553
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,850
Uncle!

554
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,410
Oh, I give up!

555
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,550
Do you need any help, father?

556
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,540
Don't even think about it. I'm an expert.

557
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,900
Aren't you hungry?
It's almost done.

558
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,950
Wow, that looks delicious.

559
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,880
Here you go.

560
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,550
Aeji, eat up.

561
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,270
Is it good?

562
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,000
Yes, it's good.

563
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,500
Make sure you chew it thoroughly.

564
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,500
Go get Subak.
Jungji must be asleep.

565
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,370
Okay.

566
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,080
Did something happen?

567
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,880
My back hurts.

568
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,240
Your back hurts?

569
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,780
I'll take you to see a doctor tomorrow.

570
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,680
I don't need to see a doctor.

571
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,040
What's wrong with Anggeum?
What is she on?

572
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,450
I don't think she's on anything.

573
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,040
I just came home.

574
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,540
Why do I bother living?

575
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,870
Everyone, even the dogs, push them around,

576
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,700
and I'm the only one without it.

577
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,680
Without what?

578
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,450
A stroller.

579
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,380
About the stroller...

580
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,580
Leave it alone.

581
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,950
I'm going to push it around.

582
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,770
I know how it's done.

583
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,740
But you're healthy.

584
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,550
My back hurts, too.

585
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,950
You push it around later,
and let's give it to mother for now.

586
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,210
Do you know how much it was?

587
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,180
What if she takes it out one day and someone steals it?

588
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,870
Mother doesn't have much time left.

589
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,840
Just humor her.

590
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,240
I've been hearing that for 40 years.

591
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,450
You're pretty good for a first timer.

592
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,600
Oh, this is so comfortable.

593
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,950
You're the best.

594
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,600
Hey, go straight, go straight.

595
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,040
Watch out.

596
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,970
We need to go.
What's taking him so long?

597
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,380
Father, we're leaving!

598
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,800
Hold on.

599
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,310
Hold on a second.

600
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,110
It's the girls.
We should've left earlier.

601
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,870
I should've packed these for you earlier.

602
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,640
- Oh.
- What is all this?

603
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,840
These are what I harvested.

604
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,750
Some sesame oil, perilla oil, beans and sesame seeds. Take them.

605
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,910
I know you can buy these in Seoul,

606
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,750
but I grew them without using pesticides.

607
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,210
Thank you, father.

608
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,050
My mother in law will love them.

609
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,950
Minjung, I forgot the diaper bag.

610
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,270
I'll get it.

611
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,700
Oh...

612
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,710
Subak.

613
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,610
Oh, my darling Jungji.

614
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,040
Subak, hold on.

615
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,580
Let's clean the table and do the dishes.

616
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,080
Right now?

617
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,610
But it's late.

618
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,700
It won't take long.

619
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,510
Just leave them and go.

620
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,180
I've been doing chores for over 10 years.

621
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,100
I'm an expert now.

622
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,300
We can do it really quickly.

623
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,500
We don't have time.

624
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,700
Even if we leave now, we'll get home late.

625
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,710
- The girls must go to bed.
- Yes, just go.

626
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,740
We'll go then, father.

627
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,650
Grandpa, goodbye.

628
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,800
Yes, Aeji, come see grandpa again.

629
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,380
Minjung, drive safely.

630
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,200
Subak, goodbye.

631
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,100
I'll call you. Go in.

632
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,470
Okay. Go.

633
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,080
What's wrong?
Why are you so quiet?

634
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,310
Is it because we didn't do the dishes?

635
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,650
Yes. Why couldn't we just do it?

636
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:22,200
If you really want to, go back and do it.

637
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,650
You're all pouting.

638
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,000
I just feel badly about it.

639
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,370
Father said he'll do it.

640
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,200
He even caught a chicken for us,

641
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,850
cooked it and made porridge.

642
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,770
He did all of that alone,

643
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,100
so why couldn't we at least do the dishes?

644
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,570
Then why didn't you hurry up?

645
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,180
Why did you waste all that time talking?

646
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:46,610
You weren't this chatty when you were busy working.

647
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,740
But we haven't visited him in a long time.

648
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:57,470
And why couldn't you say thank you when he packed us all that food?

649
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,780
You could've at least pretended.

650
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,680
I can't pretend.

651
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,370
What?

652
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,500
I'm not thankful at all.

653
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,540
We could just buy them in Seoul.

654
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm not sure why he does it,

655
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,240
but the stuff he gives us aren't very fresh.

656
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,540
They're half eaten by bugs,
or they are all wilted.

657
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,470
I can go to the market and get fresh ones,

658
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,980
so why does he even bother?

659
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,480
I don't like them.

660
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,310
Now my mom has to throw them out.

661
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,850
What's wrong?
You startled me.

662
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,970
What is it now?
What's the problem?

663
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,050
What's wrong with what I said?

664
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm tired so don't annoy me.

665
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,180
You know how stressful it was for me?

666
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:59,500
You don't know because it's your father's,

667
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,000
but I wasn't because of Jungji.

668
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,950
I wanted to leave, but you only got up after dark,

669
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,540
and now you're pouting because we didn't do the dishes and I didn't say thank you!

670
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,770
Do you know how hard farming is?

671
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,240
Farming is the hardest job in the world.

672
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,310
You have to start working in the spring,

673
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,450
take care of the crops all summer long,

674
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,000
and you never get a moment's rest.

675
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:32,140
Try standing in a field for an hour in the middle of summer.

676
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,240
You couldn't do it if you tried.

677
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,840
Even with the farming equipment, you must take care of most of the things with your hands.

678
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,850
And even after the harvest,

679
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,710
you must shake the trains off by hand,

680
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,610
dry them, peel them and rub them.

681
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,540
They don't grow by themselves.

682
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,740
My father,

683
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,710
he's been a farmer all his life.

684
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,150
He's old, and it's hard for him,

685
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:04,050
but he still tries and sends whatever he harvests to his children.

686
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:08,100
He grew them organically.

687
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:13,950
And that's all you can say about them?

688
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,350
You might think farmers are below you,

689
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,650
but I have nothing but respect for him.

690
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,200
My father who's a farmer.

691
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,480
So?

692
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,980
I can't speak my mind?

693
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,010
Don't eat them.

694
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,080
Don't eat the food my father gave me.

695
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,540
I won't.

696
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,680
Why did you have  to tell me that here?

697
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:32,100
We're standing in the middle of the road!

698
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,600
You overreact whenever I talk about him.

699
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:38,540
How lucky you are to have a father like him!

700
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,810
Let's go.

701
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,910
You're not going to get them?

702
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,350
Leave them for my coworkers.

703
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,000
Whatever! How stubborn.

704
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,770
What?

705
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,450
Why is that out here?

706
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:26,000
Why is the stroller outside, covered in dirt?

707
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:29,270
Don't ask. I don't want to talk about it.

708
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,600
Why?

709
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,810
Grandmother, do you know how much that is?

710
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,750
It's not something you can just push around.

711
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,850
Didn't you know?

712
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,810
Don't ever take it out again, okay?

713
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,850
What the heck was she saying?

714
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,500
I still have water in my ears.

715
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,310
Oh.

716
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,850
Sangnam.

717
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,540
Good morning.

718
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,240
You should take time off.

719
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,980
Should I take over Mr. Kang's excavator?

720
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,080
Take a break.

721
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:25,710
I already did.
I'm dying to go back to work.

722
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,580
This was supposed to be finished yesterday.

723
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:30,710
Oh, things just don't get done without me.

724
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,210
Right. Without you, nothing gets done.

725
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,110
So be nice while you have me.

726
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,100
People are dying to hire me.

727
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,500
Let's grab a drink after work.

728
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,270
I'll buy this time.

729
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:53,380
I'll see you later.

730
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,370
Okay.

731
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,910
- Have a good day.
- Number 1 at school!

732
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,350
- And Haebak.
- You have a date, okay?

733
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:01,980
Gwangbak is meeting someone?

734
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,010
Yes.

735
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,810
I don't know what happened,

736
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,040
but she asked me to set her up.

737
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,540
I thought you becoming a writer came first.

738
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,970
Who knows when she'll become one?

739
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:16,080
Getting married is a hundred times better.

740
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:17,880
Can I think about it for a few days?

741
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,240
What?

742
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,680
You're totally out of your mind!

743
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,310
Meet him and marry him.

744
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,210
He's from a good family.

745
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,880
She hasn't even met him yet.

746
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,910
He has a good job, his parents are set, and they have some money.

747
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,500
They can even buy them a house.

748
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:38,080
But money isn't everything in a marriage.

749
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,500
It's the most important thing.

750
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,240
Without money, there's no love.

751
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,110
There are more important things than money.

752
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:50,040
Become a writer after you're married.

753
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:52,680
I can't handle two kangaroos at once.

754
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,850
I'm already tired as I am.

755
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,210
I can't have my say because of you!

756
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,710
I can't pick on Don because of you!

757
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,910
I'll meet him.
But let me decide my marriage.

758
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,750
I'm working.
I have to get back soon.

759
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:27,300
Come home.

760
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,380
How can I when you're beating me up?

761
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,180
Would you if you were me?

762
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,810
I can't take it anymore.

763
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,110
Are you living with her?

764
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,680
How dare you!

765
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,770
I'd never do anything like that.

766
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,240
It's like you don't know me at all!

767
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,550
That's why I can't stand you.

768
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:52,680
Sedal,

769
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,610
I'm sorry.

770
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:57,470
You should be.

771
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:58,780
You have no manners at all.

772
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:02,000
You beat me up in front of strangers.

773
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,040
I'll change.

774
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,610
I won't do anything you don't like.

775
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,850
And I know I was too much to handle.

776
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,450
And I understand why you chose money.

777
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,000
You do?

778
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:23,580
Women lose their heads over luxury brand bags,

779
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,150
so of course you lost yours over that credit card.

780
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:30,740
I'd lose my head, too,
although no man would give me such a thing.

781
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,780
Of course not.

782
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:38,600
I got in your way, I know.

783
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,680
If I wasn't pregnant with Sintong,

784
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:42,100
we would've never gotten married.

785
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:43,700
Of course not.

786
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,880
You're a good man.

787
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,680
You made buying that apartment possible.

788
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:54,210
You survived on $3 a day,

789
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,780
wore clothes I got from the salvage bin,

790
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,600
and stood by me all those years. Thank you.

791
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,840
Stop that. You're making me cry.

792
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:11,850
And that's how we got here.

793
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:18,970
Now that we bought an apartment,

794
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:21,480
I'll be less frugal.

795
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:25,770
I won't wear your old boxers and try to be more feminine.

796
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,200
Stop that, please.

797
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,180
That won't help.

798
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,250
I don't want to listen to that sob story.

799
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,410
Sedal.

800
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,350
It's too late. I can't live with you.

801
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,310
I feel nothing for you.

802
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,750
What?

803
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,100
I wasn't going to say this,
but you stopped being a woman to me.

804
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,770
You're just scary.

805
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:53,640
You're more like a sister, a mother or a witch.

806
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:56,970
You make me feel little.
How could this work?

807
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:02,510
Hobak, please set me free. Please.

808
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,680
Ugh...

809
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,100
If you belittle her

810
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,840
and break her heart,

811
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,000
I won't stand it.

812
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:37,580
She is,

813
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:41,250
she is my woman and my wife!

814
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:54,840
I won't see him, even if he came.

815
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,710
I don't mind getting a divorce.

816
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:03,080
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.

817
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:05,980
Dad, please leave me alone.

818
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:09,580
Being your puppet for 30 years was enough!

819
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,910
Hello?

820
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,500
Hello.

821
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,700
Are you director Eun Miran?

822
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,050
Who is this?

823
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,150
I'm Heo Sedal's wife.

824
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,500
So?

825
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:33,000
I'd like to see you, if you don't mind.

826
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,470
Me? Why?

827
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,000
I'll tell you in person.

828
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,700
I'm at the lobby.

829
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,450
Then come up.

830
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,800
Hello.

831
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,850
I just called...

832
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,640
Sit down.

833
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:31,100
What's up?

834
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:39,410
I wasn't sure if I should come.

835
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:44,000
I thought about how to handle this before coming to see you.

836
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:49,100
Thank you for being good to my husband,

837
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:52,000
and paying him a good salary.

838
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,640
Get to the point.

839
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,870
I'm a busy woman.

840
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,980
Okay.

841
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,910
I don't think you started it.

842
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,080
Why would a woman like you want my husband?

843
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:11,480
He's acting like that because he's immature.

844
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:13,180
But that's not true.

845
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:14,710
Oppa may be immature,

846
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,280
but that's very charming.

847
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,350
Oppa?

848
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,910
Of course.

849
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,870
We've had good times.

850
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,980
I heard women call their boyfriends "oppa" in Korea.

851
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:33,010
Wait, he said his wife is much older.

852
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,350
You're older than him, right?

853
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,110
He said I'm much older?

854
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:41,700
I think he said by five or six years.

855
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:46,770
I'm one year older.

856
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,050
By birthdays, it's even less than that.

857
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:59,700
And by law, he's married with two sons.

858
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,810
What you're doing is against the law.

859
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,250
I'm not sure how it is in the States,

860
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,480
but in Korea, this is a crime.

861
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,650
Oppa and I didn't do anything.

862
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:13,600
We didn't break any law.

863
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,040
And that's why I came to ask for a favor.

864
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:18,870
Before you break the law,

865
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,650
stop this, please.

866
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:25,180
You have everything a woman would want,

867
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:28,710
so why get involved with a married man?

868
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,310
People will criticize you.

869
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:36,210
I'm sure you can find handsome men.

870
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,780
But he's fun. Didn't you know?

871
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,370
He's fun?

872
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,540
He almost drove me crazy.

873
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:48,200
You'd get sick of him in less than a month.

874
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:52,880
You have no idea how charming he is.

875
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,000
I feel bad for him.

876
00:53:55,010 --> 00:54:01,140
I never felt this way before,
but now I feel like giving it a try.

877
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,100
It was nice meeting you.

878
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,950
I have an appointment.

879
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,850
How much do you want? For oppa?

880
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:38,410
He's not for sale.

881
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:02,240
Mom, I'll see you later.

882
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,550
Good luck.

883
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,370
Try not to speak your mind and be demure.

884
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,640
Oh, you're going on that date?

885
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,000
Aunt, you have a date?

886
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,610
Now that even your niece knows,

887
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,600
you have to get married within this year.

888
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:19,270
Do you understand?

889
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,270
Ask about his salary, buying an apartment,

890
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,080
and where his parents will live.

891
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:26,880
And check what kind of car he drives.

892
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,500
I have to check his car, too?

893
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,410
But I'm meeting him for the first time!

894
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,210
What else could you talk about?

895
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,910
Your purpose is getting married.

896
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,210
And they are the most important things.

897
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:41,000
Were you planning on asking about his hobbies or his army stories?

898
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,580
I'm different from you.

899
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:44,000
What?

900
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,310
Whatever.

901
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,310
Oh, my. Did you hear that?

902
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,950
Even she won't take me seriously.

903
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,270
Gwangbak, where are you going?

904
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,680
Dinner plans.

905
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:04,370
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

906
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,240
It's okay. It's just around the corner.

907
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,550
Oh, Gwangbak!

908
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:10,370
I thought we could get coffee or something.

909
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,950
I'll see you at Yeongdal's wedding.

910
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:15,950
You fell for it,too?

911
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,980
That was a lie.

912
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,840
That was a lie?

913
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,080
Yes. That's what she does.

914
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,850
She always puts on a show like that.

915
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,610
She posted a picture saying he proposed,

916
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,700
and that they had fish stew together!

917
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,110
He never proposed to her.

918
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,450
She hasn't seen him in days.

919
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,500
I met up with Yeongdal yesterday.

920
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:39,540
It was some fantasy she created.

921
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:43,700
Don't you remember?
She's done it before.

922
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,410
I'll see you again.

923
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,810
- Gwangbak.
- Later!

924
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,080
Gwangbak!

925
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,180
Hey, munchkin.

926
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,870
What are you doing?

927
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:59,680
I can't find the answers.

928
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:01,350
About what?

929
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,210
She got dumped.

930
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,280
Huh?

931
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,470
She was sobbing and I felt so bad for her.

932
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:10,880
He's marrying some other woman.

933
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,300
He's a real jerk, isn't he?

934
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,950
So she's meeting someone today.

935
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,410
And she's going to get married.

936
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,450
I'm sorry about disappearing without calling.

937
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,310
I'm not the kind of man who'd do that.

938
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:24,110
Even if we broke up, I'd talk to you.

939
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:27,000
I won't disappear or send you a text.

940
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,180
I wouldn't do that to you.

941
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,540
I thought you wouldn't do that to me,

942
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:38,140
but you did, and it was a huge shock.

943
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:47,640
That night,

944
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,950
I went to see someone.

945
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,810
Who?

946
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:57,450
The woman who was my mom once.

947
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,910
Remember I told you that growing up,

948
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,770
I never knew mom's love?

949
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,710
She never cared for me and when I turned 9,

950
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:17,350
when my father was struggling during

951
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,850
the national financial crisis, she left us.

952
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,210
I thought I should meet her at least once.

953
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,470
I believed she had a reason for leaving.

954
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,650
But when I met her,

955
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,640
she had no reason to offer.

956
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:44,340
She was just a selfish and mean woman.

957
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,450
She didn't care about her son.

958
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,140
You know those bad moms on the news?

959
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:52,600
She was one of them.

960
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,540
You can stop now.

961
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,500
And you can stop being hurt.

962
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,680
I'm here.

963
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,040
I'll protect you.

964
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:15,140
You can rely on me and believe in me.

965
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:20,750
I'm not sure if I can believe in you.

966
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:26,240
I'm serious.

967
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,210
Where are you going all dressed up?

968
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,600
Are you meeting a man?

969
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:35,950
No, I'm not meeting a man.

970
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,080
I'm not that desperate.

971
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:41,000
This is bad.

972
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:43,080
Just because you couldn't reach me,

973
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,480
you came up with stories in your head

974
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,050
and are now meeting a man.

975
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,770
How can I believe in you?

976
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:53,850
I am meeting a man, but I'm not desperate.

977
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,680
I was just upset.

978
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,450
And you were going to have an affair?

979
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,750
How can you...

980
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,850
It's not like you're my husband!

981
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,950
Let's get dinner and talk about whether or not we could call it an affair.

982
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,250
I'm hungry.

983
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,710
Me, too. I haven't eaten much in days.

984
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:14,950
Then why would you meet another man?

985
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,310
One more thing.

986
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,810
Don't ever hug any other man like that.

987
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,450
- I'll get angry.
- When did I do that?

988
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,350
You did just now.

989
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,040
You're such a player.

990
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,770
You didn't ask for permission to hug me.

991
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,000
You didn't even call me.

992
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:35,200
You even said that I was your destiny.

993
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,780
When did I do that?

994
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,770
That's what it says in your phone.

995
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,100
You showed me when we were fishing.

996
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,410
Call me.

997
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:50,850
Read it.

998
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:53,770
You,

999
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,680
are,

1000
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,750
my,

1001
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,450
sucker?

1002
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,180
You are my sucker?

1003
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,350
Yes.

1004
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,350
Stop! Stop right there!

1005

Subtitles by KBS World

1006
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:02,850
You met her?

1007
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,540
You should've beaten her up!

1008
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,770
I can't even begin to compete with her.

1009
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,950
The human heart has a mind of its own.

1010
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,540
I feel like giving it a try.

1011
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:14,140
Let's be friends.

1012
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:15,700
Friends?

1013
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,350
Drop by anytime.

1014
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,000
I'm always home.

1015
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:21,540
I'll be waiting.

1016
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,140
Yeongdal's getting married.

1017
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:25,000
That's a lie.

1018
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,140
How can Yeongdal beat you?

1019
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:29,180
Pack me lunch tomorrow.

1020
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,600
I'm going hiking.

1021
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:32,180
All together?

1022
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:34,710
Not you. Just me and the director.

1023
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,780
It tastes...
