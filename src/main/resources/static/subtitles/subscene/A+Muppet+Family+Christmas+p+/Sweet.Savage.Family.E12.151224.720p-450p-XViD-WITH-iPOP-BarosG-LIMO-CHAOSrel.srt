00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,094
I had met many people
while following you around

3
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:18,829
carrying bagfuls of money
earned from all of those clubs.

4
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:23,300
National assembly members,
civil servants, prosecutors and police!

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,399
When those bastards were
greeting us with smiles...

6
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,245
You told me this.

7
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:34,776
"They've fallen into our traps."

8
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:39,331
But...

9
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:42,679
I thought about it the other way.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,496
And the person in the worst position
is you, Mr. Chairman.

11
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:50,156
Tae Soo, you punk!

12
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:53,366
Compare that to the original
that you have.

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,805
As for the German tape recorder
you put in my pocket...

14
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:02,886
I'll be taking good care of it.
Don't you worry.

15
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:04,296
Why you...

16
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:06,231
Just like I learned from you...

17
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:10,426
I am trying to survive from you.

18
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:14,415
Now, let's cut our ties completely!

19
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:18,897
I am leaving you, Mr. Chairman.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,662
As of today, it seems
that I am no longer your dog.

21
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:34,772
Still, we share a long history together.

22
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:39,013
You don't want this to get dirty, do you?

23
00:01:39,472 --> 00:01:41,762
There's nothing I want from you either.

24
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:44,953
I do have one shield
to protect my family.

25
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:48,283
And that's what I came to show you today.

26
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:50,584
Mr. Chairman.

27
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:58,153
I wish you... a long, healthy life.

28
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,187
<i>[EPISODE 12]</i>
What did you just say to my father?

29
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:32,223
What kind of crap were you just saying?

30
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:33,971
If you don't know anything,
then move over.

31
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:35,522
Why are you acting like this?

32
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,962
Why are you acting out,
being angry like some little girl...

33
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:38,962
I said move!

34
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:43,045
My dad spent so much money
on you, and invested in this movie.

35
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:46,443
You created this mess.
Now you're going to pull out?

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
For the past 20 years,
I managed places with neon signs.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,710
Why aren't you considering those
bags full of cash that I brought in?

38
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,710
You little...

39
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,010
Don't treat me without care.

40
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,491
I simply won't take it anymore.

41
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:33,129
Geez, Soo Min, hurry and load it up.

42
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,919
What is this? Some sort of cart?

43
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,590
Stop complaining and load everything up.

44
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,694
My knees hurt and I can't walk properly.

45
00:03:40,694 --> 00:03:42,877
Mom, just sit over here.

46
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:44,876
Dad, where are we going now?

47
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:47,705
We're going to
a warm country in the south.

48
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:03,754
Geez... It's a mountain I need to climb
at some point anyway.

49
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:06,233
Just let it out and tell them.

50
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,329
Get your clean slate. Start over.

51
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:29,665
Oh my, oh my!
What do I do about my money?

52
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,035
What is it, Mother?

53
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:38,230
Dad, Grandma lost money. 20 million won.

54
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:42,310
What happened?

55
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:48,560
Mother, please get up.
This won't bring your money back.

56
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,048
Just leave me alone!

57
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:54,329
I'm just going to go die!

58
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:57,019
Why did you deal with those
financing groups?

59
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:58,420
How many times is this now?

60
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,528
I didn't do it for my own good!

61
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:04,783
I wanted to help with Sung Min's
college tuition later.

62
00:05:04,783 --> 00:05:08,800
How else can I get my hands on big money?

63
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,709
Goodness, I'm going to die.

64
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:15,353
Tae Soo, find the woman
who took my money.

65
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:19,827
Get the people who work
under you to go find her.

66
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:26,874
Tae Soo!

67
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:44,031
Geez, that old lady upsets me so much.

68
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:52,137
By the way, Honey.

69
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:55,290
I have something to tell you.

70
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,264
If it's about your mother,
I don't want to talk.

71
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:59,435
That's not it.

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,298
What?

73
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:04,019
The thing is...

74
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,593
Well, actually...

75
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:08,225
Is it about the house?

76
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:10,725
Then I don't want to talk even more.

77
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:12,069
Hey, Eun Ok.

78
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:15,199
I'm going to read the script
and sleep in Soo Min's room.

79
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:25,785
<i>Just like I learned from you...</i>

80
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:29,843
I am trying to survive you.

81
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:32,725
Now, let's cut our ties completely.

82
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:36,951
I am leaving you, Mr. Chairman.

83
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,071
Come in.

84
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:50,988
Yes, come in.

85
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:53,535
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Chairman.

86
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:00,480
You ought to be with your pregnant wife.

87
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,360
I'm sorry to call you out
at this hour. It's late.

88
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,930
It's not a problem, Mr. Chairman.

89
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,029
I'm ready to come running,
whenever you call for me.

90
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:14,678
Since you say that,
I'll get straight to the point.

91
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,951
Tae Soo has turned
his back on me and left.

92
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,557
What? Tae Soo?

93
00:07:23,557 --> 00:07:26,067
I wanted us both to live
and I made us a hiding spot.

94
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,725
But he wants to ruin me
and live happily on his own.

95
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,312
No good will come from
bothering him any further.

96
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:37,716
I want to end this by getting
my hands on something covert.

97
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,088
I was hoping you would
do it for me, Manager Song.

98
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:43,315
Manager?

99
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:45,947
Let's try to work together.

100
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,206
Manager Song.

101
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:50,869
Are you good at treasure hunting?

102
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:53,586
Do you know what Do Kyung said to me?

103
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:56,836
She felt that I was genuine
in my efforts towards her.

104
00:07:57,153 --> 00:07:59,889
But she said to give up on her,
because she can't endure my father.

105
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:02,572
What have you been doing,
that things turned out this way?

106
00:08:02,572 --> 00:08:06,163
Don't speak that way, Director Baek.

107
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:09,603
Even with the audition and the scene

108
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:11,956
I did the best that I could.

109
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:15,447
The Chairman dislikes
Lee Do Kyung that much.

110
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:19,278
How could I have possibly known that?

111
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:24,016
I need to go head-to-head
with my father immediately.

112
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:26,576
You're going to pour gas on a fire?

113
00:08:26,576 --> 00:08:33,046
The chairman is very traumatized
because of Director Yoon.

114
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,147
Don't make this into a bigger issue.

115
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,855
Wait a little longer until
things get a bit better.

116
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:40,023
Okay?

117
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:53,450
By the way, Director Baek...

118
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,091
I noticed that there is a CCTV
in the chairman's office.

119
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:00,562
Do you know anything about that?

120
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:03,321
Why do you ask?
Have you done something wrong?

121
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:07,107
What kind of question is that?

122
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:10,750
If that wasn't the case, why would
you care if there was or wasn't?

123
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:14,427
I'm trying to protect my privacy.

124
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:18,072
Everything is being
recorded all of the time.

125
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:22,428
Doesn't that make you feel
a little strange, just sitting there?

126
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,029
You are very suspicious.

127
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:30,052
You have the expression of a thief
that has been caught in the act.

128
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:36,871
You are the one who has been
very suspicious lately.

129
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:38,349
What?

130
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:42,068
From what I know, the chairman
is no longer giving you any money.

131
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:44,597
But your spending habits haven't changed.

132
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:48,918
Did you, by chance,
empty a safe or something?

133
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:51,206
Why are you saying such nonsense?

134
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:57,866
Geez... I was only joking!
There's no need to get so upset.

135
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:59,317
My goodness.

136
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:09,269
This is truly good news.

137
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:13,616
A spot investment during times like this,
when making films is so difficult.

138
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:17,309
Though he could not be with us today,
to Director Byung Nam...

139
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:21,153
I mean Director William.
Let's give him another hand.

140
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,929
Director, we should announce
the news about the scene revision.

141
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:26,985
You...

142
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,356
Well, it's nothing really.

143
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:40,326
We asked Senior Ahn
to monitor the scene.

144
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:43,307
How do I say this?

145
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:48,500
We were told that the new character
was slightly problematic.

146
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,350
This makes me very upset!

147
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,985
Using investment as bait...

148
00:10:53,985 --> 00:11:00,450
I will not let a foreigner
control our project.

149
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,529
This is the authority of the writer.

150
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,566
I feel the same way.

151
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,658
I believe we need
to respect the creative work.

152
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:12,835
They just want the film to be better.

153
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:15,434
I don't think the intent
is to look down on the writer.

154
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:18,405
Nevertheless, isn't it wrong
to put down the writers' morale?

155
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:20,654
We don't have the luxury
of discussing morale.

156
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:22,782
First and foremost,
the film has to succeed.

157
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,833
Now that you brought it up...

158
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:31,799
Kim Eun Ok, I'm not sure you have
the luxury to sit here like this.

159
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,989
What? What does that mean?

160
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:37,864
Last night...

161
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:43,288
Your husband cut ties with the chairman
and left, after 20 years together.

162
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:45,702
Didn't you hear about it?

163
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,802
What do you mean, cut ties?

164
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:50,422
Let me phrase this differently.

165
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,659
Should I say... betrayal?

166
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,299
<i>[RESIGNATION]</i>

167
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:19,005
Resignation?

168
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:22,537
I heard about you cutting ties
with the chairman.

169
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,738
It's true, isn't it?

170
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,399
I was going to tell you myself.

171
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,402
I guess you heard elsewhere.

172
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:33,394
It just worked out that way.

173
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:34,484
Honey.

174
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,782
I'm glad you quit.

175
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:41,562
For years, I haven't been able to sleep
until you arrived at home safely.

176
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:48,261
But, I don't think this is a decision
you should make without preparation.

177
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:51,751
I waited as long as I could,
and endured as much as I could.

178
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:54,724
I thought hundreds and thousands of times
before I making my decision.

179
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:58,000
Still, how could you make a decision
like this without talking to me first?

180
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,174
Don't you know what I've done
in order to protect that house?

181
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:03,022
I'm doing this because I do know.

182
00:13:03,022 --> 00:13:05,846
I don't want you to get pushed
around by the chairman either.

183
00:13:05,846 --> 00:13:08,293
Honey, think carefully.

184
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:12,125
This isn't about pride.
It's about living and surviving.

185
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,067
We give up the house
and our value is gone.

186
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:15,544
There are loans and interest rates.

187
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,595
We have nothing saved. How will we live?

188
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:19,447
Have you forgotten that you're
the head of a family of five?

189
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:22,991
I held on this long because
I'm the head of a household.

190
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:26,826
I had fingers pointed at me because
of what I did but I had my family.

191
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:29,775
You think I don't know
about your hardships?

192
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,205
I'm asking for time to prepare!

193
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:34,095
At least until Sung Min goes to college.

194
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:36,024
If it's about money, don't worry.

195
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:40,245
No matter what I have to do, I'll keep on
earning what I've been earning.

196
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:42,865
Honey!

197
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,940
You should go. I'm busy.

198
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:53,948
Sister-in-law.

199
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:57,350
Hello. Are you going to work?

200
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,789
Yes, I heard about Tae Soo.

201
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,350
It was so sudden for me too.

202
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,697
Yes, I know.

203
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:08,172
I'm worried that things might
become dangerous for him.

204
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:12,397
I've heard that the chairman has called
on people from other districts.

205
00:14:12,397 --> 00:14:14,216
People from other districts?

206
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:17,537
With the way things are right now,
I think you should get prepared.

207
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:21,765
I know Tae Soo is not a weak person,
so I'm sure he's getting prepared.

208
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:25,917
Is there anything he has
told you, in particular?

209
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:28,946
Or something he gave you, in secret?

210
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:32,126
There's nothing like that.

211
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:35,416
But why are you suddenly
asking me questions like that?

212
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,586
Because I want to help you.

213
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:41,985
He's always confided in me,
all of this time.

214
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:47,105
Anyway, please take care of Tae Soo
and call me if you need anything.

215
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,253
Bye then.

216
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:16,662
I said I don't want to meet up.
Why did you call me?

217
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:19,062
I couldn't sleep for a second
last night, Do Kyung.

218
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:22,024
Don't bother me then,
and go back to sleep.

219
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:23,721
I won't be able to sleep tonight either.

220
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:26,796
- Why not?
- You won't let me sleep.

221
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:28,902
Are you playing around?

222
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,769
Do Kyung, you didn't mean
what you said to me, right?

223
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,759
Please say you didn't mean it.

224
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,870
That's the only way
I can eat or sleep, Do Kyung.

225
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,850
Stop acting like a child.

226
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:47,139
I meant what I said yesterday,
and I can't forgive the chairman either.

227
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:51,422
And if you continue with this behavior,
I might stop living here altogether.

228
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:53,303
I'll move away with Hyun Jee.

229
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:55,417
Do you really want to see me die?

230
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:58,462
Give me a chance, and trust me!

231
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:04,041
I'll cut all my ties with my father.

232
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,751
Cut your ties?

233
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,525
Then he'll bother me even more
absurdly than he did before.

234
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:13,304
Please think about the consequences
before you take any actions.

235
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,283
Did you find out where the CCTV's are?

236
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:36,498
I tried to find out from Director Baek,
but he was suspicious of me.

237
00:16:36,498 --> 00:16:38,048
So I gave up.

238
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:41,706
The server was in the basement,
so where could it be?

239
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:45,765
Lower your voice.
We're being filmed right now.

240
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:46,888
Geez.

241
00:16:46,888 --> 00:16:50,894
Madam, only the video gets filmed.

242
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:52,681
The sound doesn't get recorded.

243
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,528
I made a mistake for a moment.

244
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,892
Are you really
going to revise the script?

245
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,623
Are you not going to stick by my side?

246
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:05,703
Madam, this is not about
whose side I take.

247
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:07,317
We're shooting a film here.

248
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,575
A film with common sense.

249
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:10,878
What common sense?

250
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:18,031
Why do you enter without knocking?

251
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:20,132
I did knock, but I don't think you heard.

252
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:24,000
Mr. Chairman is not feeling well,
so he told me to bring you a snack.

253
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:27,705
By the way, Mr. Ma...

254
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:29,781
Yes, Madam.

255
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:34,654
Do you know anything about
the CCTV system in this house?

256
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,644
I need to know for the script.

257
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:40,645
Do you anything about
the server location, or anything similar?

258
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:44,266
After the Director Cho incident,
we installed them in the rooms.

259
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:51,654
But due to a scheduling issue,
the servers haven't been installed.

260
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,688
What?

261
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:55,228
I'm sorry I couldn't
be more helpful. Goodbye.

262
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,564
Director.

263
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:06,871
Madam.

264
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,818
We must make sure that the light are off.

265
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:13,114
Let's get out of here for now.

266
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:17,492
Oh, we're free now!

267
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:20,080
We no longer need to live in terror!

268
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,385
Let's be careful now.

269
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:23,837
Let's look for another location now.

270
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:29,382
- So cute, cute!
- Cute!

271
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:47,971
Don't come any closer!

272
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:49,375
Are you okay?

273
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,156
Well... I didn't see anything.

274
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:53,858
I didn't see a thing.

275
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:56,248
You saw everything!

276
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:58,886
Producer Kim! Come back!

277
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:12,527
<i>Nothing about you needs to be erased.
Do you know how I feel?</i>

278
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,902
<i>I call after you...</i>

279
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:19,453
<i>It's finally the concert tomorrow.</i>

280
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:21,604
<i>I assume you're very well prepared.</i>

281
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:24,644
<i>Just don't be totally shocked
when you see me tomorrow.</i>

282
00:19:24,644 --> 00:19:26,605
<i>I'll be looking forward to it.</i>

283
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:28,205
<i>Bye for now.</i>

284
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,045
What are you doing, Daughter?

285
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:34,423
Just sitting here.

286
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:40,955
How about a date with your mom tomorrow?

287
00:19:40,955 --> 00:19:43,184
I planned a full-course meal.

288
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:46,646
We can watch a movie in the morning,
then brunch, then go shopping!

289
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:49,726
I've run out face cream.
You need gloves too.

290
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:53,809
You can get a massage at
the nail shop in the evening.

291
00:19:54,378 --> 00:19:57,097
What do you think?
The day will be over so fast.

292
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:58,137
Mom.

293
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:00,807
I have plans tomorrow.

294
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:04,048
Plans? With who?

295
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:09,596
I'm not going to be depressed
at home on Christmas anymore.

296
00:20:10,796 --> 00:20:12,837
So don't worry, Mom.

297
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:16,064
Are you really okay?

298
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:17,641
I am.

299
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:21,280
Geez, I'm worried about you.
You'll be bored alone.

300
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:25,213
Why not go on a date with Dad?

301
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:28,060
What? Forget it. What date?

302
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,721
Why not? He's cute in his own way.

303
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:32,530
I feel bad for him too.

304
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,271
So just accept him already.

305
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:40,795
Anyway, I don't know
what your plans are.

306
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:44,494
But don't come home too late.
I'll make you pasta.

307
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:46,086
Pasta?

308
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,319
Yeah!

309
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:55,820
Hyun Jee.

310
00:20:57,929 --> 00:20:59,946
Wait. I miss you.

311
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:05,782
Let's have a fun Christmas tomorrow.

312
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:18,411
I deserve to be left alone
to die in an open tomb.

313
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,431
Yet, here I am,
getting all of my meals in a warm room.

314
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:25,549
I don't know if I deserve this.

315
00:21:25,904 --> 00:21:28,211
You need to eat to get strong.

316
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:30,574
You're right.

317
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:34,739
Mother.

318
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,939
Actually, I have something to tell you.

319
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:42,550
Don't even mention the money that I
brought you without letting Tae Soo know.

320
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,554
I have no money to give you and
I just want to jump into a lake.

321
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:50,567
Mother... Tae Soo is quitting his job.

322
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:53,855
You need to stop him.

323
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,056
He can't do that so suddenly.

324
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:57,980
What do you mean, he can't?

325
00:21:58,507 --> 00:22:02,096
Are you saying Tae Soo will be in danger?

326
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:04,874
No, I'm not saying something
will happen to him.

327
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:07,933
It will be hard for us to make ends meet.

328
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:09,933
You know how things are for us.

329
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:12,324
We have nothing planned.

330
00:22:12,904 --> 00:22:14,554
We have to give up this house.

331
00:22:14,554 --> 00:22:18,748
Oh my, this house is the problem.

332
00:22:22,587 --> 00:22:24,729
Oh, is everyone sleeping?

333
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,500
Tae Soo, see me for a moment.

334
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,930
What are you doing here alone?

335
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:36,368
Sit for a moment.

336
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:40,150
Geez.

337
00:22:42,426 --> 00:22:45,509
I can't catch that person
who took your money.

338
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:46,710
I'm not the police.

339
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,240
How can I catch someone who
made plans to run like that?

340
00:22:49,886 --> 00:22:51,323
Just give up on it.

341
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:54,461
I heard that you're quitting.

342
00:22:57,932 --> 00:23:01,169
My resignation will be processed soon.

343
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:05,742
I'm sorry that I couldn't
tell you beforehand.

344
00:23:06,032 --> 00:23:07,597
Okay.

345
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:12,199
You're past the age to be doing that.

346
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:15,688
You didn't have parents
who could send you to college.

347
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:19,597
You go around taking care of all
of the problems in this household.

348
00:23:20,188 --> 00:23:23,468
You've suffered so many hardships.

349
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:29,659
You have enough money saved up
to buy a house like this, right?

350
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:31,182
What?

351
00:23:31,182 --> 00:23:33,635
Since we're going to move,
let's just move into an apartment.

352
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:36,976
Hae Sook's Mom's apartment
looks pretty nice.

353
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:40,326
This house has high
heating costs, after all.

354
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:43,494
Mom, we don't have enough for that.

355
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:46,026
We have just enough for us
to avoid rainy wind.

356
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:50,044
Enough for us to get cozy
and sleep comfortably.

357
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:52,491
The body needs to be comfortable
for the heart to at ease.

358
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:55,892
Do you think we will happy sleeping
comfortably in a tiny house?

359
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,163
Mother.

360
00:23:57,163 --> 00:24:00,241
Didn't you start working there in order
to not live like your father?

361
00:24:00,241 --> 00:24:02,321
So we lived well until now.

362
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:06,259
I'm not saying this so that
we can continue to live well.

363
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:09,550
Even when you go to the mineral spring,
you have do to warm up exercises first.

364
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,151
Even when you get a shot at the doctor,
you need to prepare your heart first.

365
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:17,051
You're starting a brand new life.
Don't you need to prepare?

366
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:19,579
Mom, I'm not a child.

367
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:21,930
Don't you think I've thought about it?

368
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:25,087
I even found a job.

369
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:28,198
Your son is very competent.

370
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,339
I'm the Home Mart delivery man.
Are you home right now?

371
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:38,903
Yes, I'll be right there.

372
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:42,304
Wallpapering? Yes, I have experience.

373
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:44,766
Yes, please call me.

374
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:47,336
I'll only be driving
on the weekends, right?

375
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,240
Yes, of course it's possible.

376
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,443
Yes.

377
00:24:52,443 --> 00:24:54,290
Collecting on loans?

378
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,701
Geez, it's just that I have a soft heart.

379
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:01,508
Yes, sorry about that.

<i>[THE TWO FELL MADLY IN LOVE.]</i>

384
00:26:00,807 --> 00:26:04,491
Do Kyung and Hyun Jee,
this is how I feel for you.

385
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:07,941
Please accept it.

386
00:26:14,722 --> 00:26:16,002
Are you going somewhere?

387
00:26:16,811 --> 00:26:18,207
I have plans.

388
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:20,452
You shouldn't go out on days like today.

389
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:22,523
Have dinner at home.

390
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:25,271
It's busy because of the script at home.

391
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:27,154
It feels empty at home.

392
00:26:28,064 --> 00:26:33,203
You should have been good to your
daughter-in-law and grandchild then.

393
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:36,853
Christmas should be spent with family.
Don't you know that?

394
00:26:36,853 --> 00:26:38,164
I'll be going now.

395
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:42,728
Why, that little...

396
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,758
Mr. Chairman, I'm here.

397
00:26:51,758 --> 00:26:54,885
Yes, Manager Song.
Have you done your treasure hunt?

398
00:26:54,885 --> 00:26:57,875
I think Tae Soo has hid it very well.

399
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,145
His wife has no idea about it.

400
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:02,237
For now, I've just dropped hints.

401
00:27:04,618 --> 00:27:08,000
It would have been good
to end it quietly.

402
00:27:08,347 --> 00:27:11,557
He just has to create a confrontation.

403
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:25,089
- Yes?
- <i>Delivery from Home Mart.</i>

404
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:26,117
Okay.

405
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:35,627
Tae Soo.

406
00:27:37,163 --> 00:27:39,979
You live here?

407
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:44,693
Oh, it's nice here.

408
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:47,640
Where should I put this?

409
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,730
- Just give it to me.
- Oh, no, no! It's heavy.

410
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,990
Where do you want it?

411
00:27:52,814 --> 00:27:55,709
- The kitchen.
- Okay.

412
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:03,380
I'll be going then.

413
00:28:04,689 --> 00:28:06,096
Tae Soo.

414
00:28:11,544 --> 00:28:13,285
I heard.

415
00:28:15,003 --> 00:28:18,763
The chairman's people
eventually leave this way.

416
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:25,453
It seems like Gi Bum
is making a lot of efforts.

417
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:29,634
Do Kyung, you should think positively,
with Hyun Jee in mind.

418
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,057
I'll be going then.

419
00:28:33,057 --> 00:28:34,577
Bye then.

420
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,955
What are you doing here?

421
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:44,876
I came to deliver stuff.
Don't get the wrong idea.

422
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:47,819
You made such a fuss
and this is what you're doing?

423
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:49,355
Gi Bum!

424
00:28:50,226 --> 00:28:51,605
I'll be going then.

425
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,893
When, exactly, are you going to grow up?

426
00:28:57,893 --> 00:29:01,541
I'll be embarrassed for Hyun Jee
if you keep hanging around, so leave.

427
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:06,112
Wait, Do Kyung! Look at this, Do Kyung!

428
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:08,479
I wrote it all and made it myself.

429
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:15,695
Geez, Tae Soo ruined my plans.

430
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:22,757
Tae Soo, you have a knack for
involving yourself in my life's affairs.

431
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,986
- What?
- My Christmas plans were ruined by you.

432
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:29,061
- What are you going to do about it?
- Just move.

433
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:30,714
I have no time for you.

434
00:29:33,412 --> 00:29:36,818
Hey, you were a guy who controlled
Daejeon with your fists.

435
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,661
Now you've turned over a new leaf
and you're working hard.

436
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:42,660
It looks like fake marketing
for others to see.

437
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,999
It brings tears to my eyes.

438
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:47,035
Then cry on my behalf.

439
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,299
What does your family say?

440
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,280
Hey, do you have a new house?

441
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,101
It must be tearing your wife up inside.

442
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:58,861
What are you doing, Little Missy?

443
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,305
I told you not to call me that.

444
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:04,515
Don't talk to me.
I'm really zoned in right now.

445
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:08,942
Stop trying so hard to do
things you can't do, Little Missy.

446
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:12,832
Seriously, I'm annoyed enough
that I can't do it.

447
00:30:13,741 --> 00:30:17,026
You'll see. I'll get it soon.

448
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:21,153
I don't know about other things,
but you can't look as good as I do.

449
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,313
What? I've seen you without makeup.

450
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:25,972
I was totally shocked.

451
00:30:25,972 --> 00:30:27,529
Hey.

452
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,811
If you have nothing to do,
let's go to Sung Min's concert.

453
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:34,390
- Sung Min has a concert?
- Yeah, with his girlfriend.

454
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,621
It's secret from Mom.

455
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:40,063
There's no need for that
because she's not home.

456
00:30:46,893 --> 00:30:50,349
I was sad because I had nothing
to do on Christmas Eve.

457
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,849
Now, I get to see a concert,
thanks to my niece.

458
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:54,398
I'm the best, right?

459
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:57,269
So, stop calling me names.

460
00:30:57,269 --> 00:31:00,239
Just make sure to eat it diligently.

461
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,969
We'll be late. Let's go.

462
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:05,159
Uncle Song, are you sure
you saw him here?

463
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,578
I'm looking for him,
but he's not here.

464
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:11,478
Let's talk later.

465
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:15,089

00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:32,352
I'm worried that things might
become dangerous for him.

468
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,473
I've heard that the chairman has called
on people from other districts.

Do you even know that the chairman
is having you followed?

473
00:32:07,113 --> 00:32:10,722
You came because you
were worried about that?

474
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,453
Wow, you really are the best.

475
00:32:14,453 --> 00:32:16,916
Walking away is good
and earning money is important too.

476
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:18,916
But your safety is the most important.

477
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,820
If you are in danger,
I'm going to tell you to not walk away.

478
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,733
Isn't it dangerous to do that work too?

479
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:29,892
Don't worry. I have everything prepared.

480
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:32,851
What is it that you prepared that
you're so confident like this?

481
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:35,221
Geez, I'm busy, so go.

482
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:38,309

Yeah, I'm on my way now.

Hey, what color do you like?

488
00:32:57,348 --> 00:32:59,237
Just tell me quickly.

00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:03,022
Okay, I'll be there in ten minutes.

490
00:33:04,294 --> 00:33:05,914
- Please give me two of these.
- Okay.

491
00:33:11,112 --> 00:33:12,471

- Thank you.

497
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,588
She's on her way. I just spoke to her.

498
00:33:54,588 --> 00:33:55,713
Hi, Sung Min.

499
00:33:56,854 --> 00:33:59,663
Oh Nephew, you look very good today.

500
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,015
You guys should eat something.
It'll start very soon.

Geez, I feel bad for you.

502

I'm hungry. Should we eat?

503
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:15,726
Sung Min, isn't it getting late?
People are waiting for the concert.

504
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:19,456
Oh, we'll start soon.

505
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,096
You must be waiting for Hyun Jee,
but I think you should end it with her.

506
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:33,244
What do you mean?

507
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:36,820
I saw with her with some guy
at the park on the way here.

508
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,748
The guy was holding her hand.

509

What? What guy was this?

510
00:34:41,681 --> 00:34:45,032
Forget about him.
You're much better than him.

511
00:34:45,032 --> 00:34:48,231
He was so slimy,
with yellow bleached hair.

512
00:34:48,894 --> 00:34:50,324
Yellow hair?

513
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:52,643
What's your relationship with
that female student?

514
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,639
You're just friends, right?
You're not her boyfriend?

515
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,813
Why do you ask something like that?

516
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,469
I just thought I would.

517
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:13,628
Please let go of me.

518
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:17,791
What's wrong Hyun Jee?
I know you missed me.

520
00:35:19,972 --> 00:35:22,311
That's why I came here on Christmas.

521
00:35:22,313 --> 00:35:24,802
Don't you remember
that restraining order?

522
00:35:24,802 --> 00:35:26,983
You're breaking the law.

523
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:30,780
Breaking the law?

524
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,789
How could you do that to me?

525
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:40,139
You liked me. You always smiled at me.

526
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,827
You practiced dance
until late all the time.

527
00:35:41,827 --> 00:35:45,673
I even praised you to the chairman
so that you'd debut faster.

528
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:47,269
Are you crazy?

529
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:50,532
Hey, Baek Hyun Jee!

530
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,427
Hyun Jee, Hyun Jee!

531
00:35:58,177 --> 00:36:00,934
Hyun Jee, Baek Hyun Jee!

532
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,490
Baek Hyun Jee?

533
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,972
Are you going to be like this?
Why are you making things so difficult?

534
00:36:13,425 --> 00:36:14,838
Hyun Jee!

535
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:18,407
Sung Min.

536
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:21,670
- Who are you, Mister?
- Me?

537
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,902
- I'm Hyun Jee's boyfriend.
- No, he's not!

538
00:36:23,902 --> 00:36:25,597
He's a crazy stalker.

539
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:27,795
Seriously, Hyun Jee. Come here!

540
00:36:27,795 --> 00:36:29,277
Let go of her!

541
00:36:29,277 --> 00:36:30,626
What's with you, punk?

542
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:31,757
Sung Min!

543
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:33,632
Hyun Jee, let's talk.

544
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,592
You little punk!

545
00:36:38,914 --> 00:36:40,400
Let go of me!

546
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,592
Sung Min!

547
00:36:41,592 --> 00:36:44,561
Hyun Jee, just talk to me.

548
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:46,302
- Hyun Jee, hurry! Get out of here.
- Sung Min.

549
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:48,097
You jerk.

550
00:36:48,097 --> 00:36:49,574
Hyun Jee... Hyun Jee.

551
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,003
Please get out of here, Hyun Jee.

552
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:52,789
- Let go of me.
- Hyun Jee, hurry!

553
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:55,414
- Hyun Jee, hurry up and go.
- Let go of me.

554
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,442
Hyun Jee, Hyun Jee!

555
00:36:59,452 --> 00:37:01,485
- Sung Min.
- Hurry!

556
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,699
Hello, Yoon Tae Soo.

557
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:25,277
- Mister, this is Hyun Jee.
- Who?

558
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:27,427
Hyun Jee.

559
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:31,460
- Mister!
- Where, where?

560
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,652
Over there.

561
00:37:33,373 --> 00:37:37,023
Get over here, you punk.

562
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:40,646
What's with you?

563
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:43,940
You dare lay a hand on my son?

564
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,197
Who the heck are you?

565
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:47,210
I'm Santa, you punk.

566
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,728
Santa?

567
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:51,217
Chinese language academy?

568
00:37:51,217 --> 00:37:55,527
Dad, this guy has been stalking
Hyun Jee since Seoul.

569
00:37:55,527 --> 00:37:59,445
What? You piece of garbage!

570
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:04,057
You're going to have to
get a beating from Santa today.

571
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,509
Get up. Get up now.

572
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,255
Get over here.

573
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:16,635
Come on.

574
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:26,505
Come get a beating from Santa.

575
00:38:27,192 --> 00:38:30,403
How dare you touch my son?

576
00:38:30,403 --> 00:38:36,253
How dare you think you can lay
a hand on my son, you little punk?

577
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,340
Get up now!

578
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,391
You're dead.

579
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,442
You think you can bother my son?

580
00:38:46,442 --> 00:38:48,442
You can taste my fist tonight.

581
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:54,614
I really didn't do anything wrong.

582
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:57,449
I just wanted a quiet conversation
with my girlfriend.

583
00:38:57,449 --> 00:39:00,338
This man appeared
and suddenly started attacking me.

584
00:39:05,398 --> 00:39:07,512
May I make one phone call?

585
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:11,798
My uncle is a prosecutor.

586
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,103
What is this? What the heck?

587
00:39:19,103 --> 00:39:23,197
- Die, die, die you punk!
- Wait, Mister.

588
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:24,579
Die you jerk!

589
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:26,951
You dare stalk my daughter?

590
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:28,860
You're dead!

591
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,166
You're totally dead!

592
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:34,420
Die, die, die!

593
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,134
- Die, die!
- Wait, Mister!

594
00:39:41,342 --> 00:39:44,356
- Calm down.
- That's enough now.

595
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:46,603
That's enough.

596
00:39:50,244 --> 00:39:53,068
You better get over here now.

597
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:55,954
How could you do that to my Hyun Jee?

598
00:39:55,956 --> 00:39:57,913
Get over here now!

599
00:39:57,913 --> 00:40:00,699
You're dead you punk!

600
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:03,701
You little punk.

601
00:40:19,278 --> 00:40:20,632
Get over here now!

602
00:40:20,632 --> 00:40:23,385
Anyone who bothers my daughter is dead,
and I'm going to die too.

603
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:26,164
Get over here right now!

604
00:40:26,164 --> 00:40:30,126
Father, Hyun Jee liked me a lot
when she was a trainee.

605
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:31,597
She likes me too.

606
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:32,860
What did you say?

607
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,641
You must really want to die.

608
00:40:36,786 --> 00:40:39,402
Please give us your blessings.

609
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:41,731
We're in love with each other.

610
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,983
You're going all out, aren't you?

611
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:47,498
This is a police station. Just calm down.

612
00:40:47,498 --> 00:40:52,592
If you keep this up, I'll arrest you
for obstruction of justice, okay?

613
00:40:54,355 --> 00:40:58,268
Policeman, get me a phone.

614
00:40:58,268 --> 00:41:02,708
My uncle is a district prosecutor.

615
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:06,297
You guys are all dead.
I'm going to put you all in jail.

616
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,208
I'm going to sue you!

617
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:10,369
Shut your mouth!

618
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:13,958
I told you I'd kill you
with my own hands if you showed up again.

619
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:15,887
How dare you show up again.

620
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:16,961
Do Kyung, Do Kyung.

621
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:19,268
Who are you to show up here!

622
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,876
- Do Kyung, Do Kyung.
- You garbage.

623
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:24,043
I'm going to kill you myself.

624
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:26,393
- Do Kyung.
- You can't let that guy go.

625
00:41:26,393 --> 00:41:29,864
He can't be showing up here.

626
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:31,775
You punk!

627
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:33,914
- Calm down.
- Mom!

628
00:41:33,914 --> 00:41:35,577
Hyun Jee!

629
00:41:38,032 --> 00:41:39,702
- Hyun Jee.
- Mom is here.

630
00:41:41,494 --> 00:41:43,204
It's okay now.

631
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:44,715
Are you all right?

632
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,088
It's all right.

633
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,280
We'll need the statement,
so please follow me.

634
00:41:49,282 --> 00:41:51,811
- Okay, let's go.
- Yes.

635
00:41:57,367 --> 00:41:58,592
Dad.

636
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:01,922
Sung Min, are you hurt at all?

637
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:03,996
I'm all right. How about you?

638
00:42:03,996 --> 00:42:05,894
I'm just fine.

639
00:42:05,894 --> 00:42:09,623
Geez, what a relief!

640
00:42:15,523 --> 00:42:17,974
- Honey.
- Mom.

641
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,992
You make me worry all by myself.

642
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:30,492
Is this what you wanted?

643
00:42:33,023 --> 00:42:34,974
I really don't like this.

644
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:37,931
Mom.

645
00:42:56,603 --> 00:42:57,960
Mom.

646
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:02,538
It's all right. It's over now.

647
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:04,927
For real?

648
00:43:05,726 --> 00:43:07,981
He's not going to come back again?

649
00:43:09,027 --> 00:43:13,302
Of course, you saw what your dad did.

650
00:43:13,818 --> 00:43:15,777
He won't even try anymore.

651
00:43:16,445 --> 00:43:19,807
Maybe I should have told Dad
earlier and given him an SOS.

652
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:24,768
He would've caused an incident
and created complications.

653
00:43:27,277 --> 00:43:28,646
I suppose.

654
00:43:29,445 --> 00:43:33,226
But I did feel
more protected when I saw Dad.

655
00:43:34,288 --> 00:43:35,496
Did you?

656
00:43:38,806 --> 00:43:40,166
What is this anyways?

657
00:43:41,126 --> 00:43:43,644
Dad left this here earlier today.

658
00:43:44,436 --> 00:43:46,751
I guess he got the idea from somewhere.

659
00:43:47,684 --> 00:43:51,085
Look through it. I'll make warm tea.

660
00:43:57,445 --> 00:44:00,485
<i>There was a man and a woman.</i>

661
00:44:03,302 --> 00:44:05,751
<i>They fell madly into a hot,
passionate love.</i>

662
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,820
<i>Like this.</i>

663
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:15,762
<i>However, the man was stupid and
the woman ended up leaving him.</i>

664
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,961
<i>But the woman returned.</i>

665
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:29,351
<i>Bringing with her a beautiful jewel,
that is.</i>

666
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,561
<i>The man made a vow to protect these
two women.</i>

667
00:44:39,557 --> 00:44:42,235
<i>Even if they both become like this.</i>

668
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:01,278
It must have been so hard
for that young thing.

669
00:45:02,016 --> 00:45:04,875
I'm sorry, Hyun Jee.

670
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:07,612
It's all your dad's fault.

671
00:45:07,612 --> 00:45:10,233
Sorry, Hyun Jee.

672
00:45:11,498 --> 00:45:13,831
It will be okay now.

673
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:16,438
He's in jail now.

674
00:45:16,438 --> 00:45:18,653
I'm just trash.

675
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:22,403
My daughter was getting stalked.

676
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:25,753
And she came here because
of her emotional trauma.

677
00:45:25,753 --> 00:45:27,721
But I couldn't even protect her.

678
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:30,681
I have no right to be a father.

679
00:45:30,681 --> 00:45:35,719
I should just bang my head
on the wall and die right here.

680
00:45:36,952 --> 00:45:39,402
All you need to do
is take care of her from now on.

681
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:43,039
But I have no right to face Do Kyung.

682
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,900
How much did she not trust me?

683
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,561
That she didn't even
say a word after coming to Daejeon.

684
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:52,971
I didn't even know anything.

685
00:45:55,289 --> 00:46:00,929
Once I get out of this place,
I'm going to get back together with her.

686
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:02,695
I really am.

687
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:09,110
Wipe up, would you? Wipe your face.

688
00:46:14,931 --> 00:46:16,648
Thanks, Tae Soo.

689
00:46:17,288 --> 00:46:22,038
If it weren't for you,
Hyun Jee could have been in trouble.

690
00:46:22,038 --> 00:46:24,856
How did you know to run over?

691
00:46:24,856 --> 00:46:28,335
I was working when I got a call.

692
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:29,467
What work?

693
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:31,449
Wearing that?

694
00:46:31,898 --> 00:46:34,518
You're doing something else
besides delivery work.

695
00:46:37,168 --> 00:46:41,364
Do you have to do this?
Isn't it hard?

696
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:45,007
If you think about it,
I've been living too comfortably.

697
00:46:45,007 --> 00:46:49,998
Isn't it just better
to come back to my father?

698
00:46:49,998 --> 00:46:53,416
I saw your wife back there.

699
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:57,407
I've never seen such a cold look
on her face before.

700
00:46:57,407 --> 00:47:00,501
All you know is your family.

701
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:03,409
How much can you really make
wearing this and working?

702
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:06,407
Think of your family and come back.

703
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,708
Dad would take you back.

704
00:47:11,177 --> 00:47:14,798
You're probably tired. You should sleep.

705
00:47:15,382 --> 00:47:17,965
Yeah, I am pretty tired.

706
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:22,835
Geez, I'm so sorry Hyun Jee.

707
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,213
I've heard that the chairman has called
on people from other districts.

708
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:41,322
You came because
you were worried about that?

709
00:47:41,322 --> 00:47:44,242
You really are the best.

710
00:48:32,173 --> 00:48:36,117
What? My son is at the police station?

711
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:40,887
Oh my, I'm embarrassed Chief.

712
00:48:40,887 --> 00:48:43,327
Please send him home in the morning.

713
00:48:43,327 --> 00:48:44,373
What?

714
00:48:45,512 --> 00:48:47,632
He had a friend with him
when he was arrested?

715
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,340
Who? Yoon Tae Soo?

716
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:00,851
Baek Gi Bum.

717
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,663
- Baek Gi Bum!
- Yes.

718
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:06,175
Oh me?

719
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:07,969
Yeah, come on out.

720
00:49:13,155 --> 00:49:14,612
Geez, it's cold.

721
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,806
Hey now.

722
00:49:17,806 --> 00:49:18,951
What is it?

723
00:49:18,951 --> 00:49:20,594
Not you, Yoon Tae Soo.

724
00:49:20,594 --> 00:49:23,704
What do you mean?
We came in together.

725
00:49:23,704 --> 00:49:26,471
Those were the orders
that came down. Go inside.

726
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:29,251
I have to go out. I have work to do.

727
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:33,835
Hey, Gi Bum. Gi Bum! What is this?

728
00:49:33,835 --> 00:49:35,585
You'll be out soon.

729
00:49:35,585 --> 00:49:37,228
- Hey, Gi Bum.
- Let's go.

730
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:41,556
Hey, Gi Bum! Gi Bum!

731
00:49:45,086 --> 00:49:50,099
Dad, where's my present?
You said you'd buy me shoes.

732
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:53,161
Yeah, where is your dad?

733
00:49:53,161 --> 00:49:55,753
He had business to take care of.

734
00:49:55,753 --> 00:49:59,574
What is this? He didn't give me
my Christmas present and left?

735
00:49:59,574 --> 00:50:01,349
Just go upstairs.

736
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:04,581
Why are you getting mad at me?

737
00:50:07,342 --> 00:50:09,400
Did Tae Soo not come in?

738
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:14,739
Dad.

739
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,164
Why did you bother coming at all?

740
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:24,594
Hyun Jee's dad is out.
Why aren't you out?

741
00:50:24,594 --> 00:50:29,186
Oh, that's because I have a harder
fist than her dad.

742
00:50:29,186 --> 00:50:30,625
When are you coming out?

743
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:34,007
Don't worry. I'll be out tonight.

744
00:50:34,007 --> 00:50:36,806
For sure, right?
You're coming out tonight?

745
00:50:36,806 --> 00:50:39,755
Then should I live here or something?

746
00:50:39,755 --> 00:50:43,135
Or do you want to come in too?

747
00:50:44,606 --> 00:50:49,036
Don't worry about a thing and
you go about your business.

748
00:50:49,036 --> 00:50:50,744
Console Hyun Jee, as well.

749
00:51:12,016 --> 00:51:13,394
Oh, Sister-in-law.

750
00:51:13,394 --> 00:51:15,237
What's going on?

751
00:51:15,237 --> 00:51:16,867
Your feeling was correct.

752
00:51:16,867 --> 00:51:19,731
The chairman is planning
something against Tae Soo.

753
00:51:19,731 --> 00:51:22,268
I hear he's setting Tae Soo up
to take the fall.

754
00:51:22,648 --> 00:51:24,485
Take the fall for what?

755
00:51:24,485 --> 00:51:27,336
Everything that the chairman got
Tae Soo to do on his behalf...

756
00:51:27,336 --> 00:51:30,050
he is trying to make is look as if
Tae Soo did it all on his own.

757
00:51:30,094 --> 00:51:34,123
I knew it when the chairman
called in Young Il.

758
00:51:34,123 --> 00:51:36,344
What do you mean?

759
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:37,936
What about Uncle Young Il?

760
00:51:37,936 --> 00:51:42,016
Young Il has completely betrayed Tae Soo.

761
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,195
He has stuck onto Chairman's side.

762
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:48,452
Like Tae Soo said,
it's the last stop of the last bus.

763
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:52,420
- I have to do something now.
- No.

764
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,572
You stay put.

765
00:51:55,134 --> 00:51:56,481
I'll do it.

766
00:52:11,025 --> 00:52:13,956
As for Tae Soo suddenly leaving you...

767
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:17,626
I don't it was proper and I know
the rights steps weren't taken.

768
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:20,255
Chairman.

769
00:52:21,235 --> 00:52:23,927
It still doesn't call for you
to run him down in this manner.

770
00:52:23,927 --> 00:52:26,246
You come to me out of nowhere.
What are you saying?

771
00:52:26,246 --> 00:52:28,885
He served you for 20 years.

772
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:33,097
He isn't asking for anything.
Can't you let him go quietly?

773
00:52:33,797 --> 00:52:35,536
Why are you going so far?

774
00:52:35,536 --> 00:52:37,677
Do you think I wanted to go this far?

775
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:40,356
Tae Soo came after me.

776
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,356
I want to let Tae Soo go too.

777
00:52:44,356 --> 00:52:46,918
Why would I hold onto someone whose
heart isn't in it?

778
00:52:46,918 --> 00:52:50,434
He was half like a son to me.

779
00:52:52,097 --> 00:52:55,503
It's good to end things
and tie things up.

780
00:52:56,204 --> 00:52:59,755
So what is it that you want?

781
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:02,659
A recorder.

782
00:53:03,443 --> 00:53:06,365
It looks like a pen and you can wear it.

783
00:53:07,882 --> 00:53:11,992
If you bring that to me,
Tae Soo lives and everyone lives.

784
00:53:11,992 --> 00:53:14,311
Everything is put back into place.

785
00:53:15,143 --> 00:53:17,702
You're smart so you know what I mean.

786
00:53:20,942 --> 00:53:24,331
What is this? What are you doing?

787
00:53:25,731 --> 00:53:29,331
The moving truck is downstairs
and movers will come.

788
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,083
Just put the important things
in here for now.

789
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:33,072
I'll tell them to move the rest.

790
00:53:33,072 --> 00:53:35,291
- Gi Bum.
- Move into the house.

791
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:37,650
I can move you in half a day.

792
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,952
Why do you do whatever you want?
Why would I go into that house?

793
00:53:40,952 --> 00:53:45,179
I can't live apart from you two
because of my anxiety.

794
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:47,731
Is there another way? I have to
have you with me to protect you.

795
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:50,655
So you do this without a word to me?

796
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:55,001
Do you think your dad will welcome me
if I go into that house?

797
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,108
Even you will get kicked out.

798
00:53:57,581 --> 00:53:59,246
Leave that to me.

799
00:53:59,246 --> 00:54:00,889
Madam Oh will help us too.

800
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:03,246
Those are your thoughts.

801
00:54:03,246 --> 00:54:06,849
I think I'll suffocate just from thoughts
of seeing your dad's face.

802
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:09,396
I'm not going and neither will Hyun Jee.

803
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:12,295
Are you going to make me out to
be a bad father right until the end?

804
00:54:12,295 --> 00:54:14,525
I can't ever give up so just know that.

805
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:26,461
Me?

806
00:54:26,802 --> 00:54:28,893
The star has finally arrived.

807
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:33,432
To my friend who manages to stay
pretty even after a difficult time...

808
00:54:33,432 --> 00:54:36,432
I stayed up two nights so I could
dedicate this song.

809
00:54:36,432 --> 00:54:38,222
I'm not sure if she'll like it.

810
00:55:46,202 --> 00:55:48,882
It was a little bit cheesy.

811
00:55:48,882 --> 00:55:50,793
But I totally liked it.

812
00:55:53,293 --> 00:55:55,472
Are you feeling okay now?

813
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,693
You must have been quite shocked too.

814
00:55:58,612 --> 00:56:00,733
You even have a cut on your face.

815
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:03,742
Are you hurting anywhere?

816
00:56:05,063 --> 00:56:07,733
It wasn't a big deal. I'm all better.

817
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,163
Can you tell your
mother and father that I'm sorry?

818
00:56:12,693 --> 00:56:15,873
Because of me,
their Christmas was ruined.

819
00:56:16,652 --> 00:56:21,353
Especially your dad,
I'm apologetic and thankful.

820
00:56:22,143 --> 00:56:23,362
I will.

821
00:56:25,092 --> 00:56:27,972
Ah, I have something for you.

822
00:56:45,452 --> 00:56:47,012
Christmas present.

823
00:56:49,722 --> 00:56:52,152
Yup, it is a matching couple scarf.

824
00:56:55,483 --> 00:56:58,932
I have something for you too.

825
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:02,603
Wasn't the song from
before your gift to me?

826
00:57:17,483 --> 00:57:19,393
Merry Christmas.

827
00:57:29,713 --> 00:57:32,512
Mom, can you come here? Hurry!

828
00:57:33,422 --> 00:57:34,873
What happened?

829
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:38,043
Dad must have stayed like this overnight.

830
00:57:38,043 --> 00:57:39,853
He's completely frozen.

831
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:43,123
Seriously, do you want
to die or something?

832
00:57:43,123 --> 00:57:45,563
Why are you acting this way?

833
00:57:46,483 --> 00:57:49,143
Even if I freeze to death

834
00:57:49,753 --> 00:57:51,963
I'm going to stay
next to my wife and kid.

835
00:57:53,092 --> 00:57:55,893
I won't ever be separated.

836
00:57:56,302 --> 00:57:59,052
Stop saying nonsense and go home now.

837
00:57:59,052 --> 00:58:01,143
At this rate, you'll seriously get ill.

838
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:05,222
I'm not going! I won't go.

839
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:09,632
I can't... I can't go.

840
00:58:10,213 --> 00:58:12,833
- Oh my! Dad! Dad, are you okay?
- Gi Bum!

841
00:58:13,242 --> 00:58:14,552
Dad! Are you all right?

842
00:58:14,552 --> 00:58:16,753
Gi Bum! Wake up!

843
00:58:16,753 --> 00:58:18,193
- Dad!
- Gi Bum!

844
00:58:20,112 --> 00:58:21,632
It's a recorder.

845
00:58:22,163 --> 00:58:25,092
It looks like a pen that
you can put on your clothes.

846
00:58:33,373 --> 00:58:37,003
If you can bring it to me,
Tae Soo can live and everyone else too.

847
00:58:37,003 --> 00:58:39,132
Everything will be resolved.

848
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:54,032
I'll get released soon.
Why did you bother coming?

849
00:58:54,643 --> 00:58:56,313
You won't be able to come out.

850
00:58:56,932 --> 00:58:58,023
What?

851
00:58:58,023 --> 00:58:59,563
I met with Chairman.

852
00:59:00,523 --> 00:59:03,172
Give it to me. The recorder.

853
00:59:03,742 --> 00:59:05,123
Only if you do, you can come out.

854
00:59:05,123 --> 00:59:07,563
Does it make sense to give up
your weapon during a war?

855
00:59:07,563 --> 00:59:10,472
That's only when you're up against
an opponent you can handle.

856
00:59:10,472 --> 00:59:11,983
This isn't one of those times.

857
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:16,992
What happens if I lose my weapon against
someone who's stronger than me?

858
00:59:19,503 --> 00:59:21,597
Living as a wife of a gangster...

859
00:59:22,269 --> 00:59:25,476
I longed and waited for the day
I would be free from all these things.

860
00:59:26,632 --> 00:59:28,614
But when that day actually came...

861
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:31,943
I didn't welcome it.
I found myself pushing you back into it.

862
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,132
I hated the person I had become.

863
00:59:38,152 --> 00:59:39,902
I felt like I became a really bad person.

864
00:59:41,793 --> 00:59:46,842
But Honey, I'm doing this because I can't
watch you be in danger anymore.

865
00:59:46,842 --> 00:59:50,742
What exactly did you hear?
Why are you acting this way?

866
00:59:50,742 --> 00:59:52,523
You will end up losing a lot.

867
00:59:54,012 --> 00:59:56,112
I hear Young Il is gone too.

868
00:59:56,112 --> 00:59:58,083
I'd been preparing for it.

869
00:59:58,612 --> 01:00:02,043
I'm prepared to sacrifice
whatever I need to.

870
01:00:15,463 --> 01:00:17,253
Are you awake now?

871
01:00:23,733 --> 01:00:27,813
I can't even die.
I just create heartaches for others.

872
01:00:28,483 --> 01:00:32,822
I can't even protect my wife and my kid.
What would I be good for?

873
01:00:34,032 --> 01:00:36,552
Enough already.

874
01:00:36,952 --> 01:00:39,213
I'll do what you want.

875
01:00:41,853 --> 01:00:45,023
Are you being serious?
Are you coming home with Hyun Jee?

876
01:00:45,023 --> 01:00:48,003
Nope. You come here.

877
01:00:48,003 --> 01:00:50,583
- What?
- Didn't you say you'll protect us?

878
01:00:50,853 --> 01:00:52,842
Come live with us, Dad.

879
01:00:53,632 --> 01:00:58,233
Yeah! No more sufferings.
This is the start of happiness!

880
01:00:58,233 --> 01:01:02,003
All right, Hyun Jee.
Your Dad will protect you!

881
01:01:05,003 --> 01:01:07,072
I'll protect you!

882
01:01:07,072 --> 01:01:09,123
Prepared to sacrifice
whatever you need to?

883
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:13,452
If I can't get free this time,
I'll be tied down forever.

884
01:01:13,452 --> 01:01:15,172
I'll be living as their dog.

885
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:19,032
To become human,
I have to pay whatever the price.

886
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:21,353
Even if I'm the price?

887
01:01:22,023 --> 01:01:23,152
What?

888
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:24,913
Honey.

889
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:28,842
I don't think I can do this anymore.

890
01:01:30,342 --> 01:01:34,253
I think I'm going to die. My heart
is torn into pieces because of you.

891
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:40,242
"After this time, it'll get better.
After that passes, it'll be okay."

892
01:01:41,233 --> 01:01:43,463
I lived like that for 20 years.

893
01:01:44,193 --> 01:01:46,483
I don't have enough heart left to
feel anxious anymore.

894
01:01:49,722 --> 01:01:51,342
I can't live like this.

895
01:01:51,342 --> 01:01:55,103
Come on. Why are you doing this?

896
01:01:55,103 --> 01:01:58,193
Why are you acting
like a different person?

897
01:01:58,552 --> 01:02:00,472
What I said wasn't
in the heat of the moment.

898
01:02:01,005 --> 01:02:02,581
I thought about it a lot.

899
01:02:04,422 --> 01:02:08,693
If you keep this up, it's obvious that
our kids and I will be covered in wounds.

900
01:02:08,693 --> 01:02:10,172
Everything will be ruined.

901
01:02:12,092 --> 01:02:13,983
If that's the alternative, I'd rather

902
01:02:16,873 --> 01:02:18,302
that we get separated.

903
01:02:21,663 --> 01:02:24,782
Eun Ok! Eun Ok! Hey, Eun Ok.

904
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:29,083
Eun Ok! Eun Ok! Eun Ok!

905
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,342
Eun Ok!

906
01:02:41,608 --> 01:02:51,608
