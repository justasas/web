2
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,100
He looks excited.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,590
Daebak, is your brother in law having an affair?

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,630
Is that what he's doing?

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,460
You really have no idea, do you?

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,990
How would Hobak feel if she found out?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,230
She'd feel bad.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,690
This is divorce bad.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,760
A kiss isn't worth a divorce.

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,770
If you like each other, you could kiss.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,570
How can a married man kiss another woman?

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,940
It wasn't me.

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,230
Will you when you get married?

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,370
I'd have to wait and see.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,660
If you do, I'll destroy you.

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,460
Go ahead.
I hate scary women!

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,840
You must get back at her, okay?

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,930
But we're family.

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,560
Why you little!

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,440
You have to squash Anggeum, okay?

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,060
How can I squash my older brother's wife?

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,130
Sit on her?

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,190
Get a job right now.

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,430
I'm delivering pizza.

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,160
That's not what I mean.
Look at Goof-off.

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,260
He's not any better than you!

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,270
Look at the job he has right now.

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,970
He got a job, so why can't you?

29
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,960
He's such a disloyal friend.

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,690
Why can't you find a job like his?

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,100
I know.

32
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,370
You're always home, looking for snacks,

33
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,560
and that's why she looks down on you.

34
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,030
Even her kids treat you like crap.

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,290
Don't you feel angry?

36
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,840
I know.

37
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,400
Why you little!
Who do you take after?

38
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:48,170
How come nothing bothers you?

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,560
It's because you were a grandma when you had me.

40
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,900
I wasn't a brandma when I had you!

41
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,670
I'm young enough to have another child!

42
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,230
Father's looking down on us,
so who's child would you have?

43
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,870
Do you have someone in mind?

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,460
Am I getting a step dad?

45
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,430
I don't want to see you face. Get out!

46
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,640
Did you have a good day?

47
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,070
Yes.

48
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,140
Mother.

49
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,370
Oh.

50
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,670
I'm ho...

51
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,630
Oh, no.

52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,700
Are you ill?

53
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,100
Oh...

54
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,630
Why do I bother living?

55
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,400
What is it?
You lost your appetite again?

56
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,490
It's not that.
I should just die.

57
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,340
Was it Anggeum again?

58
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,030
Oh...

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,900
I can't do this anymore.

60
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:58,630
Anggeum and Subak paired up and attacked me ferociously!

61
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,500
I just can't take this anymore.

62
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,400
Since Subak moved in, Anggeum's been really mean to me.

63
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,560
Don and I are nothing to them.

64
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,690
But I'm too old to fight back.

65
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,640
I just have to sit and take it.

66
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,340
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

67
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,960
What can I do?
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo...

68
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,060
- You.
- Just one more word!

69
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,240
How was the amusement park?

70
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,400
Was it fun?

71
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,070
We should take the boys sometime.

72
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,800
It's just an amusement park.

73
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,130
Wasn't it weird for two men to go there?

74
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,440
Didn't people stare at you?

75
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,460
They said we looked good together.

76
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,360
They did?

77
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,840
They must have thought you were friends.

78
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,290
Uh,

79
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,770
should I take a shower?

80
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,160
Do whatever you want.

81
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,430
It's your body.
Why would you ask me?

82
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,460
Hey, don't start getting ideas.

83
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,840
I'm really tired tonight.

84
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,070
Oh, I'm exhausted.

85
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,370
Hold on.

86
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,840
For what?

87
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,140
Oh, man!

88
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,300
Do you know how tiring today was for me?

89
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,130
I had to wait in lines for hours,

90
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,640
get sick on the rides,

91
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,440
fetch cotton candy,

92
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,440
and put on a hairband.

93
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,160
Hairband? For two men?

94
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,060
Huh?

95
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,040
He said he wanted to try it.

96
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,700
He never tried it in the States.

97
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,530
It must have been really funny.

98
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,570
It was. I'm laughing.

99
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,460
Let me take a shower.
Wait for me.

100
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,360
Shower...

101
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,790
This is nuts!

102
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,270
You'll break your neck!

103
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,640
Get me a pain relieving patch.

104
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,460
For what?

105
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,990
I threw out my neck.

106
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,540
Really? Where?

107
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,930
Don't touch me!

108
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,340
Ugh!

109
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,860
I knew it.

110
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,730
You can't go to work like this!

111
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,370
It's hurting like crazy.

112
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,960
You joked about a neck spinning license.

113
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,290
It serves you right!

114
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,340
I know how impatient you are so

115
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,570
this is so that it won't be too hot.

116
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,800
You're ugly...

117
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,490
impatient and foul mouthed.

118
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,000
What else?

119
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,660
Of five cards, three are bad,

120
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,770
but the other two are pretty decent.

121
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,570
So far, at least.

122
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,700
What are they?

123
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,200
They are a secret.

124
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,640
That's not fair!
You have to tell me.

125
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,570
Just like that?

126
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll pay for the noodles. Hurry.

127
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,770
I'm really curious about what good qualities I have.

128
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,660
Shh!

129
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,730
The noodles are getting soggy. Let's eat.

130
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,460
I wanted fish stew.

131
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,130
You caught a cold.

132
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,800
I had it with someone else.

133
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,400
But you said you'd have it with me.

134
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,840
Ouch! Hot!

135
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,890
I told you to blow on it.

136
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,570
How did such a nice guy become a player?

137
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,290
I'm not a nice man.

138
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,840
Those who were hurt become players.

139
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,840
I told you when you interviewed me.

140
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,960
That I don't live with my mom.

141
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,200
Growing up, I never knew mother's love.

142
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,640
After my mom left,

143
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,870
I couldn't trust women.

144
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,170
I'm suspicious, obsessive,

145
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,290
afraid of them leaving,

146
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,560
and scared of getting dumped.

147
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,990
It's from experiencing lack of attention.

148
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,960
Don't look at me like that.

149
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,700
I decided to become a player.

150
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,270
I won't let anyone in.

151
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,340
Because if I do,

152
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,760
I'll get hurt.

153
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,460
I never told anyone this before.

154
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,200
How weird.

155
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,860
Maybe it's something I ate.

156
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,070
It's autumn now.

157
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,530
Don't try to look pretty.

158
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,640
Just wear something warm.

159
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,300
And don't catch a cold.

160
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,230
I used to be scared of autumn.

161
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,030
When the leaves fall,

162
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,090
my heart would break.

163
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,590
Don't we scared anymore.

164
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,230
You have me.

165
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,860
Even when the leaves fall,

166
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,800
I'll hold your heart together

167
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,000
so it won't break.

168
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,360
Poor player.

169
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,960
Mommy! A bug, a bug, a bug!

170
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,860
A bug! Agh!

171
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,730
- Mommy!
- It wasn't a bug.

172
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,570
It was a leaf.

173
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,170
Agh! It was a bug!

174
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,870
How can you...

175
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,460
- Hey!
- Agh! Don't!

176
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,170
Uncle, uncle.

177
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,900
Open the door, please.

178
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,130
Uncle!

179
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,090
Oh, it's like torture every morning.

180
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,960
Getting up early in the morning is so hard.

181
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm used to it and it's still hard for me.

182
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,460
You can nap when your father goes out.

183
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,960
This is expired. Should I dump it?

184
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,960
Don't dump that.

185
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,130
You can still drink it.
It won't kill you.

186
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,360
Someone drank it yesterday.

187
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,590
Minjung didn't come home last night.

188
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,140
What?

189
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,260
Minjung, Minjung.

190
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,860
Why are you sleeping out here?

191
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,570
Did you and Subak have a fight?

192
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,300
No.

193
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,440
The door was locked.

194
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,030
Why didn't you call me, then?

195
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,230
I did, but nobody answered.

196
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,570
And I didn't want to knock when everyone was sleeping.

197
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,990
Where are you coming from?

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,590
I'm not coming from anywhere.

199
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,360
Now you're sleeping somewhere else?

200
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,660
What's wrong with you/

201
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,070
Peekaboo. The morning air is very nice.

202
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,400
Poor player came to work.

203
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,360
Are you still in bed?
Can we talk?

204
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,630
Peekaboo.

205
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,530
So hard working.

206
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,270
You're already at work?

207
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,430
- Of course, I'm a laborer...
- I know.

208
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,540
So you must wake up and eat on schedule.

209
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,160
You're talking like a laborer's wife.

210
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,940
What are you doing today?

211
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,160
I'm meeting a friend who is getting married.

212
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,700
I have to be her bridesmaid.

213
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,640
And I'm going to start writing today.

214
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,490
I'm supposed to get published this year.

215
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,230
Oh, I can't wait to read it.

216
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,130
But can you?
When your love life is a mess?

217
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,440
Let me be the first to read your book.

218
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,230
If you lie about it again, I'll get mad.

219
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,990
Have a good day.

220
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,200
Are the dried corvina gone?

221
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,490
What dried corvina?

222
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,130
The ones we got for Chuseok.

223
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,860
Of course they are gone.

224
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,760
Chuseok was a long time ago.

225
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,230
You should've left them for Bong.

226
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,790
How could you eat them all?

227
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,840
What a great housewife you are.

228
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,070
There weren't that many to begin with.

229
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,540
We didn't get many gifts this year.

230
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,440
He's not popular any more.

231
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,200
People don't bring him gifts anymore.

232
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,960
Being a teacher is not a popularity contest.

233
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,390
And the economy is bad.

234
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,790
I used to get gifts from old students,

235
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,460
but now it's hard to find jobs.

236
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:15,240
When I was young, on holidays,
we used to have so many guests.

237
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,070
Did your family get many gifts, too?

238
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,460
Of course.

239
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,360
The gifts we got lasted until next Chuseok.

240
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,890
People with gifts lined up for 10 meters.

241
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,760
Hey, don't brag about a measly 10 meters.

242
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,530
Our line was 20 meters.

243
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,460
But it wasn't just one line for us.

244
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,170
There were 4 lines of 10 meters.

245
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,740
- What?
- Mom, eat your breakfast.

246
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,260
Why you little! You eat yours!

247
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:50,800
Our shed got so filled with gifts that we had to build a new one every holiday.

248
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,670
Have you heard of the five sheds?

249
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,700
We had five sheds,
and that's where the phrase came from.

250
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,090
Really? Impressive.

251
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,390
It was quite impressive!

252
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,840
Mother, have you been to the bank?

253
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,460
I have. What about it?

254
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,760
You know how they give you numbers?

255
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,760
Stop that.

256
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,430
Why are you talking about numbers?

257
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,860
Mother, eat your breakfast.

258
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:24,440
My family started that number system.

259
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:31,240
People had to get numbers to enter our house if they wanted to give their gifts to us.

260
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:39,430
My father would stay up all night making the number tickets before the holidays.

261
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,590
We got sick of getting gifts.

262
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,170
How did your father live without sleeping?

263
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:58,300
From what you've told me, it looks like your father never got any sleep.

264
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,070
She's bluffing, mother.

265
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,970
I'm not bluffing.

266
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,260
Mother, you can't beat me,

267
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,300
so stop talking about your family.

268
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,700
If you stop, I'll stop too.

269
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,860
Did Minjung have breakfast?

270
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,690
I'm going to have to talk to Minjung.

271
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,630
What for?

272
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,460
He didn't come home last night.

273
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,070
Since he lives with us,

274
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,090
he should be more careful.

275
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,660
How could he not come home?

276
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,800
That's not what happened.

277
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,640
Was he with you?

278
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,770
No.

279
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,900
He got locked out, so he slept outside.

280
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,860
He called but nobody answered.

281
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,730
He couldn't knock because we were asleep so he slept outside.


282
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,090
He still could've knocked.

283
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,960
And why didn't he tell us?

284
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,670
Who locked the door last night?

285
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,660
Who locked it while someone was still out?

286
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,430
How can we not these days?

287
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,530
Then you should've waited for him.

288
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,940
And why didn't you hear the phone ring?

289
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,130
Subak, you went to sleep

290
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,090
while your husband was still at work?

291
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,660
She can't wait up.
They're not newlyweds.

292
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,340
How can you lock the door and sleep
while your husband was still out working?

293
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,070
You should've waited up for him.

294
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,240
Why do both of them have to suffer?

295
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,070
We always kept the door open,

296
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,630
but someone locked it by mistake last night.

297
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,440
Are you Subak's spokesperson?

298
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,460
I knew he'd yell at you.

299
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,740
From now on, no matter how late,

300
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,800
wait until Minjung comes home.

301
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,070
And get him something to eat.

302
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,090
Delivering parcels is a hard job.

303
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,040
Subak has it hard, too.

304
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,890
She's raising two kids.

305
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,860
Subak, starting tonight,

306
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,660
have the girls sleep in your room.

307
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,430
She can't because they get cranky.

308
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,230
She's their mother!

309
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,670
Right. She should sleep with her kids.

310
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,860
Look at me.
I'm sleeping with my kid.

311
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,930
I know.

312
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,960
After a hard day's work,

313
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,840
it's nice to see the kids.

314
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,440
But he goes to work early and comes home late, so when can he see them?

315
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,840
And it's not easy to come to our room.

316
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,070
- Understand?
- She did!

317
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,360
Subak, you answer.

318
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,040
Stop glaring.
Your eyes might pop out.

319
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,440
Uncle, why did you bring that up here?

320
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,290
You knew your brother would get mad.

321
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,540
Why are you getting angry at him?

322
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,670
You were the one who brought it up.

323
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,200
Daebak, did you tell Hobak?

324
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,990
No. I forgot.

325
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,090
Daebak, listen to me carefully.

326
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:56,500
If they get a divorce, Hobak has to take care of Sintong and Bangtong alone.

327
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:01,860
Daebak, you have to nip this in the bud.

328
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,000
Welcome.

329
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,900
Daebak.

330
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,160
Sedal.

331
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,090
What brought you here?

332
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,430
Have you eaten?

333
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,290
Not yet.

334
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,860
Let's get some food. My treat.

335
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, boy...

336
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,340
Daebak!

337
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,340
Eat, Daebak.

338
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,570
Do you eat this every day?

339
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,540
Not anymore. I'm sick of it.

340
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,630
Drop by sometime. My treat.

341
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,990
Eat.

342
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,300
Yes, it's your honey speaking.

343
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:09,070
I have a guest. I'll call you back.

344
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,270
Me too.

345
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,630
Sedal.

346
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,840
Yes?

347
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,590
I'll give you all the game items I have.

348
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,270
I got lots of items,
and you can have them all.

349
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,940
Why? I don't need stuff like that anymore.

350
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,070
Still, take them.

351
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,470
And this.

352
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,770
What are they?

353
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,340
Coupons.

354
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,690
We go to the same internet cafe, right?

355
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,490
These are the Chinese restaurant coupons,

356
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,860
and one more will get you free noodles.

357
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,570
There are 9 here.

358
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,630
Daebak, what's wrong?

359
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,070
Don't divorce my sister.

360
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,630
What?

361
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,430
You think I'm going to divorce your sister?

362
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm worried about my nephews.

363
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,300
For the sake of their dreams, don't do this.

364
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,840
Their dreams?

365
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,300
You don't know?

366
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,890
They never told me.

367
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,300
What are their dreams?

368
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,270
Sintong's is buying his own house.

369
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,670
Bangtong's is having a retirement plan.

370
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,840
Until Sintong buys a house and Bangtong

371
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,770
gets a retirement plan, you must help them.

372
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:40,590
If there's anything you don't like about Hobak, tell me.

373
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,630
I'll make sure she changes.

374
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,340
There are a lot of things I don't like.

375
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,390
She looks down on me because I'm younger,

376
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,630
talks back at me, and has no respect for me.

377
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,040
Did you know she gave me $3 a day?

378
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,200
It was heartbreaking.

379
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,090
Even I couldn't survive on $3 a day.

380
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,390
I know.

381
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,160
And just look at how she dresses.

382
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,460
She's not feminine at all.

383
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,670
She wears stretched out shirts.

384
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,890
And why does she wear my old underwear?

385
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,360
They have holes in them.

386
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,070
That's not attractive at all.

387
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,590
When you get older, you'll understand.

388
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,000
I understand.

389
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,740
Sedal, thank you for putting up with her.

390
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,090
I'm happy you understand how I feel.

391
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,570
Oh...

392
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,900
Oh.

393
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,430
Eat up, Daebak. Eat.

394
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,270
Daebak.

395
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,430
You should dress up more.

396
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,660
What?

397
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,300
Just because you're a year older,

398
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,040
don't look down on him.

399
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,630
People hate being treated like a child.

400
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,360
And Sedal's old.

401
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,670
And dress nicely.

402
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,860
And don't wear Sedal's old underwear with holes in them.

403
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,460
Men are all alike.

404
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,570
We like pretty women.

405
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,490
Did you see Daebak today?

406
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,640
Yes. Why?

407
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,090
What did you tell him?

408
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,040
Something he needs to hear.

409
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,240
But he's only in 7th grade.

410
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,400
Why would you tell him about

411
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,040
how I treat you like a child

412
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,630
or your underwear?

413
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,540
He already knows everything.

414
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,740
I knew everything when I was his age.

415
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,590
You should take his advice.

416
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,960
The director is here. Bye.

417
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,140
Hon, let's go shopping.

418
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,130
Okay.

419
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,500
Please sign here.

420
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,840
Thank you.

421
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,190
- I'm sorry, but...
- Yes?

422
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,630
Can I use your bathroom?
I really need to.

423
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,930
Oh, no.

424
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,790
Hello, ma'am.

425
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,890
There's no package for us, right?

426
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,800
Right.

427
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,500
May I use your bathroom?

428
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,240
Oh, you can't.

429
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,170
Why don't you check down there?

430
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,260
Yes, parcel service.

431
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,130
I left it at the front desk.

432
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,190
Okay.

433
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,360
Hello.

434
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,390
I deliver parcels here,

435
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,300
and I'm sorry,

436
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,740
but may I use your bathroom?

437
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,570
I really need to...

438
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,260
Go ahead.

439
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,160
Thank you.

440
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,160
Thank you so much.

441
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,690
I'm very sorry.
Please excuse me.

442
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,340
Goodbye.

443
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,200
Open your eyes.

444
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,890
Do you like it?

445
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,860
It's so pretty.

446
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,560
We met

447
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,340
one year ago today.

448
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,890
I'm sorry all I can afford is this.

449
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,840
Don't be.

450
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,390
I'll wear this until I die.

451
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,090
Don't do that.
Wear it for 3 years.

452
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,500
You always say 3 years.

453
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,840
What will get me after 3 years?

454
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,190
Umm...

455
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,690
I'll buy you one with a diamond this big,

456
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,260
so heavy that you can't hold your head up.

457
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,700
Really?

458
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,360
You promised.

459
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,890
Parcel service.

460
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,340
Yes, I'm on my way.

461
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,840
You'll be home, right?

462
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,390
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

463
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,540
Mom.

464
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,230
Why did you come?

465
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,590
I came because I missed you.

466
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,800
Mom, don't be upset.

467
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,470
I'm sorry.

468
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,590
I got off work early to come and see you.

469
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,460
I brought your favorite snacks.

470
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,500
You like the chicken from the market.

471
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:12,160
I don't want it. You eat it.

472
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,700
Mom.

473
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,000
Would you be able to get over it like this?

474
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,900
Because I sure can't.

475
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,360
You can't apologize after yelling at me.

476
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,900
You said you'll never see me again.

478
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,760
You said you won't come back.

479
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,740
I'm going to pretend I never had you,

480
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,200
so do whatever you want to do.

481
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,790
I didn't mean it, mom.

482
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,040
Don't force yourself.

483
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,240
You don't want to see me.

484
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,770
I don't want to see you or hear your voice.

485
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,090
We'll be like enemies from now on.

486
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,800
Isn't this what you really want?

487
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,900
Don't ever come back.

488
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,660
What's up?
You got off work already?

489
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,190
Yes. I left early.

490
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,790
I didn't want to work myself to death.

491
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,840
And it's been a while since I saw you.

492
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,590
I missed you, too.

493
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,270
Is everything okay?

494
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,500
Yes.

495
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,090
Share this with the other teachers.

496
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,690
I bought some chicken, sausages, and buns.

497
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,300
Did you visit home?

498
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,470
These are your mom's favorites.

499
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,040
Hobak,

500
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:53,270
I think she needs more time.

501
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,130
She'll come around someday.

502
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,740
So don't try to think about anything
and just go on with your life.

503
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,740
How did you get in?

504
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,700
Is that your hello?

505
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,160
I got in by opening the door.

506
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,130
You should say hello.

507
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,660
How did you know the code?

508
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,570
I should know the code to my son's place.

509
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,200
It's the date of your wedding.

510
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,990
I don't like you dropping by unannounced.

511
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,360
What's wrong with that?
We're family.

512
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,070
You won't say that when you get married.

513
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,870
You never come visit me anymore.

514
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,870
How can you make me come visit you?

515
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,570
My comforters need washing.

516
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,930
Come and wash them on your day off.

517
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,740
We'll be having dinner here from now on.

518
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,890
Mom, I'm hungry.

519
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,890
Don't you have anything to eat?

520
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,360
She's hungry. Go make her dinner.

521
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,170
Where are you?

522
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,430
You skipped your private lessons?

523
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,740
Do you need me to remind you again?

524
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,540
My bat's crying for you, okay?

525
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,660
Come home right now!

526
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,360
I'm busy. Bye.

527
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,970
Hey! Wang Daebak! Hey!

528
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,240
Thank you. Thank you.

529
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,760
Goodbye!

530
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,030
Hello.

531
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,400
Yhank you, sir.

532
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,860
Sir?

533
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,740
I'm sorry. We'll take good care of you.

534
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,770
Go ahead, then.

535
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,070
Loser,

536
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,600
let's go.

537
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,390
Drink!

538
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,640
Let's soak our souls in this!

539
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,170
Soak! Soak! Soak!

540
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,160
Bottoms up!

541
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,140
Soak it all the way!

542
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,500
Let's get on with the casting.

543
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,030
My dream, retirement plan.

544
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,870
Buying my house.

545
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

546
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,190
It's time for your tip.

547
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,300
Come and get it!

548
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,430
Hooray for Sedal! Hooray!

549
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,590
Did you think that was it?

550
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,370
There's more!

551
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,530
- You'll hurt your wrists.
- Oh, I will?

552
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,860
Slowly, slowly.

553
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,270
One, two.

554
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,990
- One, two.
- Right. One, two, three.

555
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,190
- One, two, three.
- And.

556
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,970
Duck.

557
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,470
Oh!

558
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,300
Right.

559
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,470
Okay, one, two.

560
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,430
One, two.

561
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,630
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

562
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,930
That was too much.

563
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,090
Mine went a lot further than
yours since we were kids.

564
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,500
Remember? We had a competition.

565
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,930
Not that.

566
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,390
The money you spent tonight.

567
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,470
How much do you make a month?

568
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,800
The director gave me a bonus.

569
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,070
Sedal,

570
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:33,430
can I please meet your director?

571
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,160
Why would you meet my director?

572
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,740
What do you want to know?

573
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,100
I don't want to know anything.

574
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,470
I really want to be like you.

575
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,890
Can I be your people?

576
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,590
You're mistaken.

577
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:53,640
You and I are completely different people.

578
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,770
I'll mention you,

579
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,960
but don't get your hopes up.

580
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,860
How does it feel?

581
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,140
It's pretty nice.

582
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,270
I'm not sure about the effect though.

583
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,800
Now that I'm old, I'm gaining weight.

584
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,340
I eat the same food,

585
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:19,890
but my belly and arms are getting fat.

586
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,970
But you look healthier than before.

587
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,760
You've seen me before?

588
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,840
Yes.

589
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,930
Mr. Wang told me about his daughters.

590
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,530
And I ran into you many times.

591
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,090
You probably don't remember.

592
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,070
That feels a little strange.

593
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,990
I was weird, wasn't I?

594
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,370
You weren't that weird.

595
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,540
Oh, no. I always look weird.

596
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,960
Tell me, what was I wearing?

597
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,570
I can't.

598
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,140
Oh, no!

599
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,740
You're mean.

600
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,040
Oh, man!

601
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,660
Designated driver!

602
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,360
Thanks.

603
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,930
My father would pass out if he found out I was living this way.

604
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,590
Sorry, sorry.

605
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:12,740
I'm completely drunk.

606
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:18,500
I'm so happy that I'm going nuts.

607
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,360
Pay up.

608
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,300
Tell me what you want.

609
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,800
A hug? A piggyback ride?

610
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,530
A piggyback ride.

611
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,860
Get off.

612
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,640
But you're drunk.

613
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,270
I am,

614
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:36,630
but I can still give you a piggyback ride.

615
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,770
Okay.

616
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,630
Come on.

617
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,470
Whoa!

618
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,640
Come and get it!

619
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,840
How dare you!
I'm your brother's friend.

620
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,970
Honey, sorry.

621
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,570
Hon, you're the best.

622
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,200
Oh, man!

623
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,240
Here.

624
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:54,930
Oh, man! This is nutty, nutty, nuts!

625
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,800
Oh, man.

626
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,130
Why aren't you in bed?

627
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,100
What about you?

628
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,600
I'm not sleepy.

629
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,900
It's because you don't have a dream.

630
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,740
You...

631
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,770
Stop talking about dreams.

632
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,300
I'm already angry.

633
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,990
What's wrong with you?

634
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,760
It can't be about school.

635
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,990
Tell your uncle.

636
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,300
Can I?

637
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,660
Of course!

638
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,490
If anyone's picking on you, I'll stop them.

639
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,070
Who is it?

640
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,700
Harder.

641
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,360
Do a good job.

642
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,000
Yes, sir.

643
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,130
Will this make my skin white?

644
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,870
Yes, sir.

645
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:35,170
If it does, I'll give you a big tip.

646
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:38,340
Goodbye, dark complexion of mine!

647
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:43,760
Can you make my eyes less bulgy?

648
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,860
- Oh, no!
I'm sorry.

649
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,430
Oh, you startled me.

650
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,070
Who are you?

651
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,270
What's going on?

652
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,570
I'm sorry.

653
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,100
Oh, man.

654
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,700
I'm not going back to the States, dad.

655
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,930
I'm going to live here.

656
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:20,100
I'm tired of being your little puppet.

657
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,440
I never got to do anything I wanted.

658
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,360
I did everything your way.

659
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,840
School and marriage.

660
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,970
I ran away because I had to.

661
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,240
Just leave me alone, please!

662
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,890
I want to be free.

663
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,630
What are you doing?

664
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,870
You...

665
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,470
Why are you doing this?

666
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,470
Tell me why you're hitting me!

667
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,130
Oh, man...

668
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,540
Oh, I'm dying here! Help!

669
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,390
You bastard!

670
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,260
Loser! I mean, Don! Are you mad?

671
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,730
Please don't hit my face.

672
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,600
My face is what got me my job.

673
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,600
I know you're jealous of me...

674
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:32,640
But please don't hit me on my face.

675
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,040
Just let me keep my face, okay?

676
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,570
I'll talk to the director and get you a job.

677
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,160
Hey! Don! Don! Don't do this!

678
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,030
Don, it's me. Sedal.

679
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,570
Heo Sedal. Goof-off Sedal.

680
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,340
We're friends.

681
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:50,470
I'll get you a job, okay?

682
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,500
Don't ask that woman.

683
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,800
End it before Hobak finds out.

684
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:58,740
If you hurt Hobak,

685
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,700
I won't forgive you.

686
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,930
Hey, hey, it's not like that.

687
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,340
There's been a misunderstanding.

688
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,260
It's not like that.

689
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:24,100
Oh, man. I'm bleeding.

690
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,390
Mom!

691
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,730
You're unbelievable.

692
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,770
Let's say I lost my head because of money.

693
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,570
Still, how could you use such violence...

694
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,430
This is against the law, did you know?

695
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,490
Don't you remember the old days?

696
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,090
I was so good to you.

697
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:53,040
When we entered middle school,

698
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,800
you and I sat together.

699
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,430
They were doing a survey about our families.

700
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,840
[Father:passed away, Mother: Park Salla]
I glanced over,

701
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:18,070
and you wrote in the parents' section,

702
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,970
father, Wang Chang,

703
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,340
and mother, An Gyesim (Don't have one.)

704
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,570
So I thought you didn't have a mother.


705
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,160
This is nuts, man.

706
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,240
I shared my lunch with you.

707
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:43,570
I gave you all the good side dishes.

708
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:47,240
That's why you're bigger than me.

709
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,200
If you forgot that, you're not even a man.

710
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,390
Why you little! Where were you?

711
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,360
Congratulations.

712
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,730
I'm starving. Let's go out for Chinese.

713
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,240
- Chinese?
- Okay.

714
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,660
Let's go.

715
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,970
Who's that?

716
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,930
My mom.

717
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,660
You said you don't have a mom.

718
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,200
No way.

719
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:14,370
You wrote "An Gyesim (don't have one)."

720
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,670
My mom's name is An Gyesim.

721
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,890
That was her name?

722
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:22,490
This is nutty, nutty, nuts.

723
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,730
I thought you didn't have a mother,

724
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,660
so I was nice to you for 3 years.

725
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,740
Are you angry?

726
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,160
I never told you I didn't have a mother.

727
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,390
I'm not angry,

728
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,630
but go easy on me.

729
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,800
Goof-off,

730
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:44,490
I can let you get away with anything.

731
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,190
You can trick me,

732
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,740
and you can steal from me.

733
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:54,300
I can take you treating me like a loser.

734
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:57,200
But

735
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:59,770
not Hobak.

736
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,170
After today,

737
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:05,840
if you betray Hobak again,

738
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,660
I won't let you get away with it.

739
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,740
Oh, man...

740
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:35,930
Oh, it's me.

741
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,640
Are you craving for something?

742
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:38,970
How did you know?

743
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,340
I'm a player.

744
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:43,370
I won't be if I didn't know stuff like this.

745
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,340
That thing we never got to eat.

746
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,930
Which one?

747
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,030
There were so many of them.

748
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,160
Fish stew. I want something spicy today.

749
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,760
I'll see you there.

750
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:57,160
Okay.

751
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,360
Aunt.

752
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,300
You're home early.

753
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,600
I have to go back out.

754
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,470
I have plans for dinner.
I'll go wash up.

755
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,640
Okay.

756
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,460
It's me, Sangnam.

757
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,470
Are you sure?

758
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,140
I'll be right over.

759
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,760
Aunt,

760
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,130
he found her.

761
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:27,600
I'll see you later.

762
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,760
Sangnam!

763
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,600
One fish stew.

764
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,870
Okay. Just a minute.

765
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,070
Can we have some kimchi?

766
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,370
Okay.

767
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,170
Take her order.

768
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,240
She can't have that table and not order.

769
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,660
We have a business to run.

770
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:27,070
Im sorry. Let me wait a little more.

771
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,070
Are you sure?

772
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,160
Yes, I'm sure...

773
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,390
You're really sure?

774
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,930
Yes, I am.

775
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,970
- Did you ask?
- Yes.

776
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,870
Why don't you order something?

777
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,340
You've been sitting here for an hour.

778
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,370
This is a restaurant.

779
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,370
I'm sorry.

780
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,170
I'll come back another time.

781
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,570
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

782
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,200
We're not open yet.

783
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,090
We're not open.

784
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,270
Do you recognize me?

785
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,570
Of course I do.

786
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,990
You look old.

787
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,300
How many years has it been?

788
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,300
How did you know I was here?

789
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,200
Why wouldn't I know?

790
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:38,740
It's a small country.

791
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,640
You sound mad.

792
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,630
Do you recognize him?

793
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,530
You must be Sangnam.

794
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,690
You're all grown up.

795
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,200
If I ran into you in the streets, I wouldn't recognize you.

796
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,700
Are you married?

797
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,570
I'm not.

798
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:07,570
You must be needing something,

799
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,740
but you've come to the wrong place.

800
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,100
This is how I live.

801
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,600
I can't give you any money.

802
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:18,390
It's been 20 years,

803
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,630
and that's all you can say to your son?

804
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:22,100
What am I supposed to say?

805
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:25,000
- Sis.
- Why? What?

806
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,890
Then why did you come to me?

807
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,660
There's nothing for you here.

808
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:30,990
I'm barely making ends meet.

809
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,800
We're not here to get anything from you.

810
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,070
Why can't you spit that gum out?

811
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:38,200
Stop picking on me.

812
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:40,340
You saw me, so go.

813
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,700
I don't want my neighbors seeing you.

814
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:46,670
And don't blame me for anything.

815
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:49,430
I had my reasons.

816
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,090
You dad probably painted me as a witch,

817
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:58,400
but you'll understand when you get married.

818
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,260
Are you 30? 31?

819
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:07,300
I'm 20.

820
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,370
You are?

821
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,600
Why did you look for me?

822
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:16,500
I'm barely making a living here.

823
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,490
I'm barely getting by.

824
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,630
I can't believe you!

825
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,800
Aunt.

826
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,760
Let's go.

827
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,700
We should've have come.

828
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,340
I'm sorry.

829
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:37,240
I'm sorry for coming to see you to see if you can help us out.

830
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:45,370
How could you say that?

831
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,240
He came to see you because you're his mom!

832
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,470
Is that all you can say?

833
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,870
How can you be so mean?

834
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,540
Why didn't you ask him to sit down?

835
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:59,160
How can you talk to him while chewing gum like that?

836
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,490
What's wrong with you?

837
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,260
He thought of you as his mom...

838
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,570
From the way I feel right now.

839
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,390
I could just slap you.

840
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,590
Go ahead. Slap me.

841
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:12,770
How can you say that to your older sister?

842
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,300
You're not my sister.

843
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,990
Do you even know what you did to my life?

844
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,590
What did I do?

845
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,100
You married a rich man, thanks to me.

846
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,170
Why would you end it?

847
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,300
I heard you divorced him.

848
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:26,970
You had an affair, stole money from Daese,

849
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,140
borrowed money under our parents name,

850
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,640
and sold your own little sister.

851
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:33,140
And you're still living with that bastard!

852
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:36,700
Bastard? He's your brother in law!

853
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,340
Brother in law?

854
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:41,240
Yeah, right.

855
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,160
Because of you, I was sold.

856
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:46,490
I had to dump the man I love

857
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,860
and marry for money to pay your debt.

858
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,940
You're crazy.

859
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,200
You married a rich man and had a good life,

860
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:57,660
but instead of thanking me, you cry.

861
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,760
I knew you were a wretch,

862
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,990
but you're worse than I had remembered.

863
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,800
Don't you feel bad for what you did to Sangnam?

864
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:14,140
Don't you feel guilty as his mom?

865
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,700
Aren't you grateful he grew up to be such a nice man after you abandoned him?

866
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,640
Instead of cooking him dinner,

867
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,340
you had him stand here and kicked him out!

868
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,770
Sangnam can't even date anyone because of you.

869
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:31,260
Did you know that?

870
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:33,590
How can he meet anyone?

871
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,670
He seems to be doing really bad.

872
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:38,090
Like father, like son.

873
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:41,440
He'll be poor for the rest of his life.

874
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,930
You must have come to ask for money,

875
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,570
but as you can see, I don't have any.

876
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,760
Is that all you can say?

877
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:51,530
We didn't come for money!

878
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,360
Why did you come?

879
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:57,370
Because you're his mom! His mom!

880
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,200
To be honest,

881
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:01,240
I was going to let bygones by bygones

882
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,640
and forgive you and I hoped

883
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:07,370
Sangnam would finally get a mother.

884
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,270
Are you afraid of your family breaking up?

885
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:10,800
You call that a family?

886
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:12,260
Is your child with him your only child?

887
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:14,630
Sangnam is your child, too!

888
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:16,930
God will punish you.

889
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,470
You shouldn't do that to your own child.

890
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,000
Don't ever come to us.

891
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,800
Daese told me never to find you.

892
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:29,800
Now I know why.
I shouldn't have come.

893
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,840
Have a nice life, you wretch!

894
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,240
Hey!

895
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,160
Hey!

896
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,840
Hey! Ugh!

897
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,840
What are you looking at?

898
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:12,800
Wow, that's a very expensive car.

899
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:15,840
Who is he?

900
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:44,390
Let me give you a tip.

901
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,890
Don't fall for me.

902
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,930
I hate it when a woman cries.

903
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,160
We had fish stew tonight.

904
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,890
The most delicious fish stew in the world.

905
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,890
And girls, congratulate me.

906
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,160
He finally proposed to me.

907
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,990
Yay!

908
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,630
I finally met him.

909
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:35,570
The man who says he'll do anything for me.

910
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:38,470
Today is the happiest day of my life.

911
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,200
Father.

912
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,070
Where are you?

913
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,760
I'm out.

914
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,160
You have to come quickly.

915
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:24,490
We have to fix an excavator,
but the service center is closed.

916
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:29,800
We'll have to fix it tonight if we want to use it at the construction site tomorrow.

917
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:31,100
Okay.

918
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,860
Sangnam, check if there's oil leaking.

919
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,470
Okay.

920
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,490
Here.

921
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,800
Check the connecting pump.

922
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:57,740
Where? Here?

923
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:01,870
This won't do.

924
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,570
Sangnam, go fetch the rope.

925
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:10,070
Pull! Pull harder! Harder!

926
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,260
- Pull!
- One, two!

927
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:14,260
Sangnam, tie that up over there!

928
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:23,960
Pull! Harder! Sangnam, pull!

929
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,000
Pull harder! Harder!

930
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:30,340
Pull harder!

932
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:11,000
I'm left breathless from running around all day, in search of love, in search of life

933
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:19,410
Beneath the skies of Seoul I get closer to my dreams

934
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:27,040
Both love and friendship coexist under the sky

935
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,690
I'll meet that man. As soon as possible.

936
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:33,200
He should tell you where he's going.

937
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:35,470
When we're married, I'll destroy him.

938
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,600
I went to see the director.

939
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:38,940
What did you say?

940
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,390
Is your father the only person who matters?

941
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,660
Are you crazy?

942
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,800
Was sending $200 to my father crazy?

943
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:46,970
I want to be treated like a human being.

944
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:50,140
I never see any of your faces.

945
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:53,400
I go to work alone and I come home alone.

946
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,240
Am I not your family?
