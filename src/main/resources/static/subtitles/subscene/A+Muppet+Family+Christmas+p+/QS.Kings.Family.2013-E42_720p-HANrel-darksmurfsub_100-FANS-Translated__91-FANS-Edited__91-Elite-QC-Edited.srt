1
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:19,745
Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sang Nam.

2
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,219
What are you going to do about this? 
This is all because of you.

3
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:30,956
If you didn't leave the house,
this would never have happened.

4
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,058
What happened?

5
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:35,394
Your father's gold key has been stolen.

6
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:36,094
What?

7
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:39,364
The tie clip he received as bridal gift and 
and his gold cufflinks are also gone.

8
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:41,934
I told you not to leave the house,
but you wouldn't listen.

9
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:44,036
Was that an ordinary key?

10
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:45,904
Let's report this to the police, Father.

11
00:00:45,904 --> 00:00:48,240
Yes, let's report it, quick.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,510
Brother-in-law...
Reporting this to the police is a bit...

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,911
What's wrong?

14
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:55,481
It'll complicate things.

15
00:00:55,481 --> 00:01:01,320
The police will have to come here and investigate.
You need to go to the police station too.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,356
If it weren't for you,
this wouldn't have happened!

17
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,567
Did Eonni come here?

18
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:16,735
Yes.

19
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:18,137
She entered Brother-in-law's room, right?

20
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:20,239
Yes.

21
00:01:20,472 --> 00:01:23,275
No way.
That's impossible.

22
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:28,180
I'm sure of it.
It felt strange so I didn't 
want to call the police.

23
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,048
What if the police says Sang Nam's mom is the culprit?

24
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,683
What embarrassment will that bring?

25
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:34,720
How about the hurt it will bring to Sang Nam?

26
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:37,990
She's really an enemy.

27
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,457
Really.

28
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:41,026
Aunt!
Wait.

29
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:42,895
Let me settle this problem.

30
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,931
Just pretend you don't know.
I have a plan.

31
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,448
Oppa, I left without waiting for you.

32
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:07,653
I couldn't reach you these days.
Hope there's no problem.

33
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:09,988
The court sent you a mail.

34
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:13,725
Re-heat the stew.
You must eat.

35
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:24,703
<i>If you present it to the district office,
you'll be divorced right away.</i>

36
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:28,907
<i>If you don't present it,
the divorce will be considered null and void.</i>

37
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:43,388
What are you doing?
You're not sleeping yet.

38
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:45,023
Why did you come out?

39
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:47,126
Bathroom.

40
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:49,928
Happy birthday, Husband.

41
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,300
I don't know where one of my child is.
Whether she's alive or dead.

42
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,271
Does it make sense for me to celebrate
my birthday as a father?

43
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:01,840
Don't worry. 
She won't die.

44
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,643
She gave you 50 000 Won, didn't she?

45
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:11,884
So many things have happened,
if not for Hye Bak and Dae Bak,
I really want to give up.

46
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:14,453
Don't say that.
Mother is still here.

47
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:18,423
Don is also married now.
I can say whatever I want.

48
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:24,029
How can you do that?
Even if you want to abandon your kids,
you can't abandon Mother.

49
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:28,000
Without you, Mother will collapse immediately.

50
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:30,803
What about you?

51
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:33,138
What do you think?

52
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:35,007
You'd surely be happy... celebrating.

53
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:40,612
Of course. If you don't want me to get mad,
stop saying nonsense. Stay alive.

54
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:46,451
Don't go, Oppa.
I'm scared.

55
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,086
What did you say?

56
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:53,459
Uncle stays outside the toilet
to protect Sister-in-law.
Do that for me too.

57
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,130
I will never do that.
I might as well run away from home.

58
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:02,099
How cold-blooded.

59
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:37,369
Dae Bak. Dae Bak.
Didn't you ask me to wake you up?

60
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:41,340
What are you doing?

61
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,376
Nothing, Hyeongnim.
Go back to sleep.

62
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:49,281
But the floor is too cold.

63
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:51,383
Your knees must be cold.

64
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:53,952
Sleep in the room.

65
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:56,989
Sorry. I should sleep here instead.

66
00:04:56,989 --> 00:05:02,828
If I let you sleep here,
In-law will kill me.

67
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:11,236
Hyeongnim, not there.

68
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,652
Mother, it's me.

69
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:28,287
Hurry, lie down beside me.

70
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,856
Oh, you must be freezing.

71
00:05:30,856 --> 00:05:33,192
No.

72
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:14,066
It's cold.

73
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:17,336
There's hot water in the kitchen.
I've already boiled some.

74
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,372
Is that so?
There was none.

75
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:22,241
None?

76
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:24,810
This angle.

77
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:29,948
One more.

78
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:32,050
Did you finish all the hot water in the kitchen?

79
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,620
Yes, I washed my hair.

80
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,722
How could you finish it?

81
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:40,459
I boiled that for people leaving in the morning.

82
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:42,795
What happened to ranking?

83
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:46,532
Stop scolding her.
She's our family's treasure.

84
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:49,568
This is the first time I've ever
heard that in my life.

85
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:52,371
She's not our treasure,
she's a troublemaker.

86
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,940
Then what are you?

87
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,743
Kimchi jar.
Right?

88
00:06:57,743 --> 00:07:00,779
Right! Kimchi jar.

89
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:04,283
I think my stomach's getting bigger each day.

90
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:06,618
How big can your stomach grow?

91
00:07:06,618 --> 00:07:09,655
It looks different every time I take a photo.

92
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:11,056
Have a look.

93
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,625
Forget it.
How can that be possible?

94
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,727
It will only grow big on the 5th month.

95
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,129
Let me see that.

96
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,764
It's true.

97
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:21,333
Right?
It looks bigger than yesterday.

98
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,603
Ajubeonim, look at my stomach.

99
00:07:25,537 --> 00:07:26,939
Stop showing off.

100
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:27,873
Be more sensible.

101
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:30,909
You don't show that to your brother-in-law.

102
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:36,515
- Son, it seems like you're not eating much.
- I don't have an appetite.

103
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:41,186
How can he have an appetite?
Sleeping on cold floors in winter,

104
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:45,157
he can't use the toilet in the morning,
he has to run all the way to school just to poop.

105
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:49,128
The hot water was also stolen by Sister-in-law in the morning,
he had to use cold water to wash his face.

106
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:51,697
At his old age, 
what strength does he have?

107
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:54,967
Can he eat sumptuously?
Of course, he won't have an appetite.

108
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:59,404
It's because he's full.
Try and starve him,
he will surely eat--

109
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:07,112
Yes, Sister-in-law.
It's probably because I'm full.

110
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:11,550
If I get hungry, 
I will surely eat ravenously.

111
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,586
For me, it's really fun to eat here.

112
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:19,023
The whole family eats together so I have to eat fast
otherwise there'll be nothing left to eat.

113
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:20,191
It makes it so much fun.

114
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:21,826
I'm really going crazy.

115
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:23,929
Eat more.
Don't be afaid.

116
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:26,031
Will I let you starve?

117
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,367
If only you can contribute
more to living expense.

118
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:30,936
There are several meals in a day.

119
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:32,337
If you don't exercise and just eat,

120
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:33,972
the baby will become very big.

121
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:39,111
We have a kimchi jar in our house
so food is really delicious.

122
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:41,914
Hey, but we're missing a person.

123
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:42,848
Dae Bak.

124
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:44,483
Dae Bak ran away from home, too?

125
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,585
He's studying.

126
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,921
Dae Bak?

127
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,985
Hurry up.
The lunch time customers will be here soon.

128
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:21,854
Is earning money easy?

129
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:24,189
Other ladies finish it in 30 minutes.

130
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,058
It takes you an hour.

131
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:28,861
Only I can endure you.
Try and go somewhere else.

132
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,028
You're almost out the door.

133
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,598
I was already chased away.

134
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:36,802
Thank you, Boss.
You will be blessed.

135
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:41,240
You participated in Miss Korea.
What happened to you?

136
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:43,342
It's a long story.

137
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:45,444
Life has no answer.

138
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:48,013
Looks like you have a bundle of stories to tell.

139
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:51,984
What's a bundle?
It's a truckload.

140
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:40,098
It's me, Mother-in-law.

141
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:44,069
I want to see you for a moment.
I have something to say.

142
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:45,938
I want to see you too.

143
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,040
Your call came just in time.

144
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,908
When can you come?

145
00:10:49,908 --> 00:10:52,711
- Now.
- Now?

146
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,813
Turn around.

147
00:10:56,915 --> 00:10:58,784
Why are you so surprised?

148
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:02,054
Your family gets shocked whenever they see me.

149
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:04,389
I came just in time right?

150
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:08,127
I locked the gate.
How did you come in?

151
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:12,097
This. 
If I have this, there's no door that I can't unlock.

152
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:16,301
You didn't apologize to me sincerely,
so I couldn't sleep.

153
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,104
Have a seat.
I'll prepare some tea.

154
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,206
Mother-in-law.

155
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:24,476
Mother-in-law.

156
00:11:24,943 --> 00:11:27,045
What did you say?

157
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:29,615
The gold key.
Give it back.

158
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:33,352
Including tie clip and gold cufflinks too.

159
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:34,753
Are you dreaming?

160
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:37,789
I know you took them.

161
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:42,694
Oh my god.
Who the hell are you?
I took them away?

162
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:46,198
You dare accuse your mother-in-law of stealing?

163
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:48,767
This won't do.
I need to call Sang Nam.
This won't do.

164
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:51,103
Call him.

165
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,271
What?

166
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:56,008
Do you want to call Sang Nam and 
go to the police station together?

167
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,212
How dare you?
Hey!

168
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:01,613
I'm not 'Hey'.

169
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:05,117
I won't give up until you give them back.

170
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:07,452
That's not an ordinary key.

171
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:12,825
That's a gift given to him by his staff to commemorate 
10 years of his hard work at the company.

172
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:14,460
It 's an evidence of Father-in-law's hard work.

173
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,795
How could you steal that?

174
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:20,065
That's not just gold.

175
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,868
Give it back while I'm talking nicely.

176
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,904
This matter will get bigger
if I call the cops.

177
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:27,306
Are you really going to do this?

178
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:28,240
Did you see me take it?

179
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,043
You entered his room that day.

180
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:33,612
You accuse me of being a thief
just because I entered his room?

181
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:35,247
You're really hopeless.

182
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:40,853
How could you report your mother-in-law to the police?
Fine! Let's go to the police station. Let's go!

183
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:42,254
You really want to go?

184
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:44,122
Yes, let's go!

185
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:46,692
Who's afraid?

186
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:52,998
Fine, since you're like this,
I have no choice.

187
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:56,502
I'll buy that.

188
00:12:58,137 --> 00:12:59,538
What?

189
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:02,574
You won't get much money
if you sell those.

190
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,844
I'll pay double the market price.

191
00:13:05,844 --> 00:13:07,946
Do-double?

192
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:10,282
Yes.
I won't tell anyone.

193
00:13:10,282 --> 00:13:13,552
Just pretend I caught you.
Sell it to me.

194
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:16,822
You won't lose anything.

195
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:24,530
I will keep my promise.
I'll keep this a secret from Sang Nam and Father.

196
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,398
Re-really?

197
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:30,836
Of course.
It's troublesome to report this to the police.

198
00:13:30,836 --> 00:13:33,872
Then, give me triple.

199
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:36,909
That's too much.
How could you ask for triple?

200
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:40,879
Instead, the tie clip and cuff... that thing.

201
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,514
I'll give them to you.

202
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:46,251
I won't get much money if I sell those.

203
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:50,455
Fine.
I have to give you money anyway.

204
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,725
I'll give you triple.
In cash.

205
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:55,828
Give them to me.

206
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:58,864
I can't now.
They're at home.

207
00:13:58,864 --> 00:14:02,835
Come by tomorrow.
When there's no one around.

208
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:05,871
Don't regret it.

209
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:08,440
Don't worry.

210
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:17,783
This.

211
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,688
What are you doing?

212
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:25,023
These are good clothes.

213
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,958
Can I take these?

214
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,060
You can't.

215
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,928
I'll let you off this time.

216
00:14:29,928 --> 00:14:32,498
Take those other good ones too.

217
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,600
It's coffee time now.
Do you want to come?

218
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,702
The pretty ajummas are all 
gathering together.

219
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:38,337
I'm not interested in those ladies.

220
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:39,505
Let's go.

221
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,906
What are you doing?

222
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:43,242
I'm really going crazy!

223
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:45,577
Hey, hey, hey!

224
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:47,679
This is our new member, No. 505.

225
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,781
- Hi.
- Hi.

226
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:50,949
Hello.

227
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:53,285
I'm Heo-Heo Se dal.

228
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:56,555
We don't need names here.
Numbers will do.

229
00:14:56,555 --> 00:14:59,591
I am No. 505.

230
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:00,993
How handsome.

231
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:05,197
Oh, there's no need to be shy.
We're all the same.

232
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,598
Come and have a seat.

233
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:08,934
Yes.

234
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:11,036
So... What happened?

235
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,372
What else?
She searched his cellphone.

236
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:17,576
Then caught him right away,
then she splashed it with water immediately.

237
00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:19,211
Well done.

238
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:21,547
She must have felt 
so much better after that.

239
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,817
Nowadays, you can catch an affair
by searching the cellphone.

240
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:26,685
You can't leave men alone.

241
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:30,422
Once outside, they will roll 
their eyes here and there.

242
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,561
No. 505. Try it.
Roll your eyes around.

243
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,130
You'll be good at it.
Your eyes are so protruded.

244
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,933
- That's right. 
- That's right. He can surely do it.

245
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,305
Like this? Roll here. Roll there.

246
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:47,940
Well done.

247
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,742
You passed.

248
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,779
But which family are you talking about?

249
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,881
We're talking about a drama.

250
00:15:55,881 --> 00:16:01,019
Ah, everyone was so serious,
I thought it was real.

251
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:05,691
Nowadays, women are also like that.
You know that No. 103 is having an affair, right?

252
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:08,260
The guard was the first one to find out.

253
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,129
He saw how she was dressed.

254
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:14,800
The in thing nowadays is
"Office wife and office husband".

255
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,435
What is that?

256
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:19,938
They act like husband and wife at work.

257
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,442
Is to get engage in affair use English have said 
seems like how about it the same?

258
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,712
Oh...

259
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,492
It's me.
Are you going to be late tonight?

260
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:41,894
I have a company dinner tonight.

261
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:43,295
Around what time will it end?

262
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,463
I don't know.

263
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:45,397
Will there be drinking?

264
00:16:45,397 --> 00:16:47,266
There will be since it's a company gathering.

265
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:49,368
Who will go?

266
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:51,470
Why are you asking those questions?

267
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,505
So what if there's drinking?
Why do you want to know who's going?

268
00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:56,841
You have nothing to do at home.

269
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:59,178
Sin Dong's mom!

270
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:02,915
Really.

271
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:05,951
It suits you.

272
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:08,287
Newly wed's memoir.
How about it?

273
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:10,389
Newly wed's memoir?

274
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:13,192
You can interview other people
or base it from your experience.

275
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:17,162
The topic is,
"Things we don't know about married life."

276
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,731
Let's reveal the true facets of marriage.

277
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:24,169
What do you think?
This will make all the old maids happy.

278
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,571
But you just got married,
I don't think you qualify.

279
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:28,140
No, I think I have plenty to say.

280
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,943
I'm giving you work since I feel bad for you.
Do it well.

281
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:32,578
Thank you, Team Leader.

282
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:36,548
Bread?

283
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:40,052
I ate it.
I'll buy you another one
after I get my pay.

284
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:42,387
Mom.

285
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:46,825
Mi Ho.
Oh, you're back.

286
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:49,862
How was it? Did you have fun?
You didn't get hurt, did you?

287
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,497
I'm going to see Oppa first.

288
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:56,401
Geez. Children are useless.

289
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:06,678
Oppa, what happened to you?

290
00:18:06,678 --> 00:18:09,948
I kept calling you but I couldn't reach you.

291
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:11,116
Are you having an affair?

292
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:12,518
I don't even have time to have an affair.

293
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:15,554
What have you been up to these days?
You saw any pretty girls?

294
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:18,824
You'll get it from me
if I catch you.

295
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:21,627
I don't have time to look at pretty girls.

296
00:18:21,627 --> 00:18:23,028
We moved house.

297
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:25,364
You moved?
When?

298
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:28,634
It's too long to talk about it.
I need to go in and study.

299
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:30,269
Studying is the only path I can take.

300
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:31,904
Are you sure you're all right?

301
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,071
Did you get beaten up?

302
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,407
I'm perfectly fine.

303
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,509
My family is totally bankrupt.

304
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:38,911
What?

305
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:41,947
Mom, Mom.

306
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:44,983
Really?

307
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:48,720
Dae Bak's family lost everything and
they moved to another place.

308
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,340
Is it going well?

309
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,442
No.

310
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,311
Eat this while you write.

311
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:13,946
Thank you, Aunt.

312
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:19,551
What topic are you writing about?

313
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:25,157
Nothing.
It's just, I write whatever's asked of me.

314
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:30,062
Why didn't you tell me?
I just heard from Mi Ho.

315
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:32,631
I heard your family's having a hard time.

316
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:36,602
You heard?

317
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:41,273
It must be very hard on you.
You just got married and this thing happened.

318
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:48,981
What to do?

319
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:53,886
Even if you're married now,
with what happened to your family,
you must be really worried.

320
00:19:55,521 --> 00:19:57,389
I know how you feel.

321
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:06,732
It was my father's birthday yesterday.

322
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:09,768
If I told him,
he might have come with me.

323
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:12,337
I couldn't tell him.

324
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,907
You should have told me.

325
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:20,512
Please keep this a secret from Sang Nam.
Don't tell Father-in-law either.

326
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:24,483
I don't want them to find out
about what happened to my family.

327
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:29,388
I know. 
It hurts the pride and 
you'll feel dejected too.

328
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:32,891
I know how it feels since I've
experienced it from my sister.

329
00:20:32,891 --> 00:20:37,095
No wonder you don't look good these days.
I thought you were having a hard time here.

330
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:38,964
Who knew it was like this?

331
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:44,803
Please don't tell Sang Nam.
I'll find a chance to tell him.

332
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:12,131
Please give me 2 hoteoks.

333
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,101
~ <i>Pretty princess.</i> ~

334
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:21,006
Is it delicious?

335
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:23,108
Yes, delicious.

336
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:27,779
Rotten brat.
Who did he take after?
So stingy!

337
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:30,582
He only bought 2 hoteoks?

338
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:33,852
That's discrimination.

339
00:21:33,852 --> 00:21:37,823
I'm not eating this.
It's our Wang Dal that's eating this.

340
00:21:37,823 --> 00:21:39,458
Who's Wang Dal?

341
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,494
My baby's nickname is Wang Dal.

342
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:45,297
Are nicknames still popular?

343
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:48,333
Is there honey inside?

344
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,435
I don't know.
I think it's just sugar.

345
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,238
It's sugar.

346
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:56,975
Is there pine nut as well?

347
00:21:56,975 --> 00:22:00,245
I think so.
I can't let you try it though.

348
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:07,019
It must be delicious.
Watching other people eat is 
the most annoying thing to do.

349
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:09,588
Don't look.

350
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:12,858
I can't help it,
my eyes keeps lingering there.

351
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:16,829
I have bad luck today.

352
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:21,266
I wanted to share this actually
but this is not enough.

353
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:26,638
I wasn't like this before. Ever since I have Wang Dal,
I really don't know why I keep thinking about food.

354
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:29,675
I'll eat this inside.
I'll annoy you if I stay here.

355
00:22:32,478 --> 00:22:33,879
See, Mother?

356
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:37,616
Babying your youngest is useless.

357
00:22:37,616 --> 00:22:41,587
Since he's buying,
why not buy a few more to let you try.

358
00:22:41,587 --> 00:22:45,090
I'm not saying this because I want to eat.

359
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,360
You told me to love your children in your heart.

360
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,097
But you're being totally ignored now.
It's going to happen more often next time.

361
00:22:52,097 --> 00:22:55,134
That kid, really...

362
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:03,075
Give me your baby.
I'll take care of him.

363
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:04,710
- Thank you. 
- It's nothing.

364
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,812
Just give me 10 minutes.
10 minutes is enough.

365
00:23:06,812 --> 00:23:08,914
This kid.

366
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:11,016
Take care of the baby.

367
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:12,417
Yes.

368
00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:34,606
<i>You don't miss the children?</i>

369
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:36,475
<i>Take care of your kids.</i>

370
00:23:36,475 --> 00:23:38,811
<i>The kids like my mother more.</i>

371
00:23:38,811 --> 00:23:40,913
<i>I can't attend Ae Ji's program today.</i>

372
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:45,584
<i>I regret marrying you.
I also regret having the children.
Good enough?</i>

373
00:23:55,394 --> 00:24:00,532
Red light, green light, white light.

374
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:08,707
Red light, green light, white light.

375
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:25,991
Where the heck were you?

376
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:29,495
You're too much.
I pay you on time every week.

377
00:24:29,495 --> 00:24:32,297
The customers are coming
and the vegies are not cut yet.

378
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:33,699
The bowls are not washed yet.

379
00:24:33,699 --> 00:24:36,969
You said you'd come back in an hour.
What time is it now?

380
00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:39,538
Sorry.
I'll do it right away.

381
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:43,275
Do you think it's easy to earn money?

382
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:46,545
I know.
I know it very well.

383
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:08,527
~ <i>Go to sleep.
My Jung Ji is really obedient.</i> ~

384
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:12,264
I wonder where your mom is 
and what she's doing.

385
00:26:12,264 --> 00:26:19,271
Is she eating properly?
Is she sleeping well?

386
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:23,008
Jung Ji. 
Ask your mom to come back soon.

387
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:25,577
Say, "Hurry, come back, Mom."

388
00:26:25,577 --> 00:26:30,949
"Hurry, come back, Mom."

389
00:26:48,934 --> 00:27:02,948
Nuna!

390
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:26,071
She has a heart too.
Just to give her child food to eat,

391
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:32,377
she left this milk at the entrance and left.
Imagine how heartbroken she must have felt.

392
00:27:32,377 --> 00:27:37,049
She must be having a hard time
living alone.

393
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:40,786
Only people who have experienced work should work.

394
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:43,589
She has never even washed her own underwear.

395
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:48,961
Where is she and what is she doing
to buy her child this powdered milk?

396
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,398
This girl, really...

397
00:27:57,836 --> 00:28:02,274
I feel bad for Su Bak.
I used to hate her before.

398
00:28:02,274 --> 00:28:03,909
Why did you stop chasing her?

399
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:06,245
I was yelling "Nuna, Nuna" while running,

400
00:28:06,245 --> 00:28:09,515
but it was so dark and I couldn't see clearly.

401
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:13,952
Husband, let's find Su Bak.

402
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,689
Let's go to the police.

403
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:22,828
Just wait.
She'll come home when it's time.

404
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:27,032
Since she already came,
we know she's alive so there's no need to worry.

405
00:28:27,032 --> 00:28:30,068
Come, let's go to sleep.

406
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:34,973
Why isn't Mom back yet?

407
00:28:34,973 --> 00:28:36,375
She'll come.

408
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:41,513
Dad, be careful. Mom is pretty.
What if other men like her?

409
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,615
Mom is not pretty at all.

410
00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:48,520
She is.
Other men are all looking at her.

411
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,557
Mom might get stolen away.
Right?

412
00:29:02,768 --> 00:29:06,038
Come, let's have a toast.

413
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,439
For the sake of our success.

414
00:29:07,439 --> 00:29:10,242
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

415
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,519
Manager.

416
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,387
- Cheers. 
- Cheers.

417
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:25,657
=The number you dialed is unavailable.=

418
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:27,292
Oh, come on.

419
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,306
Why didn't you pick up?

420
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:42,941
Where are you?
Who are you with?

421
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:44,109
Did you drink a lot?

422
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:45,744
Are you with another man?

423
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,751
Hey, hey. Wang Ho Bak!

424
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,620
I'm really going crazy.

425
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,436
What to do?
I had lots of fun today.

426
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:12,838
- I'm going.
- What the?

427
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,210
What are you doing?

428
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,546
Why did you come out?

429
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:23,115
Say hello.
He's my children's father.

430
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:25,217
Hello.
Although, I can't bear to part with her,

431
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:27,319
I'll leave Department Head with you.

432
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:27,553
I'll leave Department Head with you.

433
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:32,691
Please take care of us, Department Head.

434
00:30:32,691 --> 00:30:37,362
Fine. Take care.
See you tomorrow.

435
00:30:37,362 --> 00:30:39,465
Department head.
You were great today.

436
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:40,165
Sweet dreams.

437
00:30:40,165 --> 00:30:42,267
Okay.

438
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:53,946
Sin Dong mom. Hey.

439
00:30:53,946 --> 00:30:58,617
Lie down.

440
00:31:09,595 --> 00:31:11,230
<i>Department head. 
Did you get home safely?</i>

441
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,098
<i>You were awesome today.</i>

442
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:14,967
<i>Department head, you were so cool.</i>

443
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:18,470
<i>You were really sexy.
Did you get home safely?</i>

444
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,740
<i>My Department Head, I love you.
Fighting.</i>

445
00:31:38,323 --> 00:31:39,258
Are you crazy?

446
00:31:39,258 --> 00:31:46,965
Ouch.

447
00:32:06,118 --> 00:32:08,687
Open the door.

448
00:32:08,687 --> 00:32:14,059
Open the door.

449
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:15,694
Why aren't you opening the door?

450
00:32:15,694 --> 00:32:18,030
Open the door for me.

451
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,431
Why aren't you opening it?

452
00:32:20,132 --> 00:32:23,635
Are you sleeping, Oppa?

453
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:26,905
Wang Dal wants to eat noodles.

454
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:28,774
Tell him to sleep.

455
00:32:28,774 --> 00:32:31,109
He's not sleepy at all?

456
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:36,482
Are you going to do this?
Our Wang Dal wants to eat it.

457
00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:38,584
Fine.

458
00:32:57,736 --> 00:32:58,670
Sister-in-law!

459
00:33:02,174 --> 00:33:03,575
Eat.

460
00:33:07,312 --> 00:33:09,414
Hot, hot.

461
00:33:09,414 --> 00:33:13,852
Drink slowly.
Mix some rice.

462
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:18,524
Well done. Good job.
A woman who drinks outside.

463
00:33:18,524 --> 00:33:20,859
The husband who makes bean sprout soup.

464
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:23,662
This family is really something else.

465
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:28,333
How refreshing.

466
00:33:30,903 --> 00:33:32,771
I can live now.

467
00:33:32,771 --> 00:33:35,340
That punk who took you home last night,
who is he?

468
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,209
Someone took me home?

469
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:38,377
You don't know?

470
00:33:38,377 --> 00:33:40,012
I don't remember.

471
00:33:40,012 --> 00:33:41,647
This is a big problem.

472
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:43,515
You really don't remember?

473
00:33:43,515 --> 00:33:44,449
This woman...

474
00:33:44,449 --> 00:33:46,785
What if someone kidnaps you?

475
00:33:46,785 --> 00:33:49,354
Who will kidnap me?

476
00:33:49,354 --> 00:33:52,623
A young punk drove you home.

477
00:33:52,623 --> 00:33:56,594
Who was it? 
Oh, yes. My staff.

478
00:33:56,594 --> 00:33:58,697
How could you call him young punk?

479
00:33:58,697 --> 00:33:59,631
How mean.

480
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:02,668
Every time he opened his mouth,
he kept saying, "My Department Head."

481
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:04,536
I couldn't take it anymore.

482
00:34:04,536 --> 00:34:06,872
Why am I so freaking mad 
at that word, "My"?

483
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:09,208
I get mad everytime "My Go son-in-law" was mentioned too.

484
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:15,980
Don't tell me you two are playing
"Office wife, office husband"?

485
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,083
Where did you hear that from?

486
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:20,652
The ajummas told me.
They said it's the in-thing nowadays.

487
00:34:20,652 --> 00:34:24,623
Don't bother about that.
You have nothing to do everyday,
you keep sticking to those ajummas.

488
00:34:24,623 --> 00:34:27,893
Why did you say that?
There's plenty of things to do at home.

489
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:29,061
Don't talk like that.

490
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:30,462
It hurts my pride.

491
00:34:37,002 --> 00:34:40,739
Text messages kept coming all night.
Ding dong, ding dong.

492
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,075
Why are you invading my privacy?

493
00:34:43,075 --> 00:34:46,578
And also,
why did you keep calling me yesterday?

494
00:34:46,578 --> 00:34:48,213
I told you I had a company dinner.

495
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,315
What exactly did you do on
your company dinner?

496
00:34:50,315 --> 00:34:54,753
"Department head is sexy, cool, awesome."

497
00:34:54,753 --> 00:34:55,687
You really want to know?

498
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:58,724
Yes, otherwise, do it in front of me again.

499
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:01,059
I will really do it.

500
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,001
How about it?

501
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:12,271
Oh, come on.

502
00:35:12,271 --> 00:35:17,176
You... Don't do that despicable act of
peeking at my text messages again.

503
00:35:17,176 --> 00:35:18,343
Despicable?

504
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:21,146
Yes, when have I ever done that despicable act?

505
00:35:21,146 --> 00:35:23,248
I don't even have a cellphone.

506
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:25,818
Even dogs have cellphones now.
Only I don't have one.

507
00:35:25,818 --> 00:35:29,555
So? Are you unhappy?

508
00:35:29,555 --> 00:35:30,722
N-no.

509
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:32,591
Don't hang out with those ajummas.

510
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:35,394
They talk about nonsense all day long.

511
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:37,963
Which apartment's wife is doing what?
Which apartment's husband is doing what?

512
00:35:37,963 --> 00:35:40,065
Don't do that.

513
00:35:40,065 --> 00:35:42,401
Stop watching dramas too.

514
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:43,802
Read the newspaper.

515
00:35:43,802 --> 00:35:46,138
You don't even read books?

516
00:35:46,138 --> 00:35:47,306
If I don't watch drama,

517
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:48,707
I'll be isolated.

518
00:35:48,707 --> 00:35:49,408
What?

519
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:51,743
I don't have a friend.

520
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:54,780
Good thing those ajummas 
would hang out with me.

521
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,115
Are you an ajumma?

522
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:58,750
One half.

523
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:01,787
Eat.

524
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:12,998
Mom.

525
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:13,932
Let's go.

526
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:15,334
No, I'm working.

527
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:17,903
What work?
Let's go.

528
00:36:17,903 --> 00:36:21,173
Mom, you can't do this.

529
00:36:21,173 --> 00:36:22,341
Come with me.

530
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:27,012
It's still useless even if you do this.

531
00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:28,881
It's useful.
Go to school right away.

532
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:31,216
With our family's situation,
can I still go to uni?

533
00:36:31,216 --> 00:36:34,253
Even if I have to sell myself,
I will provide for you.

534
00:36:34,253 --> 00:36:35,420
Don't worry.
Hurry, go in.

535
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,055
I can get a scholarship at marine university.

536
00:36:37,055 --> 00:36:39,858
I can still attend university,
even if I don't have money.

537
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:41,727
Mom, I want to become a ship captain.

538
00:36:41,727 --> 00:36:43,362
I don't want to be a judge.

539
00:36:43,362 --> 00:36:44,763
You still don't understand me?

540
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:45,931
Just give in this time.

541
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:48,267
You still don't understand me?

542
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:50,602
Can't you give in to me this time?

543
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:52,471
Listen to Mom's wish.

544
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:56,909
Do you want to see Mom live miserably
in that house forever?

545
00:36:56,909 --> 00:36:58,777
Everything will be fine as long as you become a judge.

546
00:36:58,777 --> 00:37:01,580
You alone can save the whole family.

547
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,616
Mom, being a judge is not some lottery ticket.

548
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:07,186
Even if I become a judge,
money won't rain on us at once.

549
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:11,390
Shut up! 
Go home.

550
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:11,623
Oh my. Hey!

551
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:22,835
Father, sorry.

552
00:37:22,835 --> 00:37:24,703
I didn't tell you earlier.

553
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:27,973
Do you know why your mom's like that?

554
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:33,812
Yes. If I if I knew that our family 
would become like this,

555
00:37:33,812 --> 00:37:36,381
even if being a ship captain was my dream,

556
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:40,352
I would have listened to Mom's wish.

557
00:37:40,352 --> 00:37:43,856
But this is my future.
I've already decided.

558
00:37:43,856 --> 00:37:46,658
What are you going to do?

559
00:37:46,658 --> 00:37:50,395
I don't know.

560
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:57,636
I want to become a ship captain but
Mom keeps stopping me.

561
00:37:57,636 --> 00:38:01,607
I don't know if I should think 
go back to review school again.

562
00:38:01,607 --> 00:38:05,577
I'm worried.

563
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:09,781
Father, what should I do?

564
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:13,285
Life is long.
Look far ahead.

565
00:38:13,285 --> 00:38:20,292
Choose the path you won't regret
10 or 20 years down the road.

566
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:25,430
Whatever you choose,
it's fine with me.

567
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,766
You can pursue your dream or

568
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:33,138
listen to Mom and become a judge.

569
00:38:33,138 --> 00:38:35,474
Try and write these on a piece of paper.

570
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:40,846
Weigh the pros and cons of each path.

571
00:38:40,846 --> 00:38:45,751
You will find the answer if you list it down like that.

572
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:49,955
You can only decide this yourself,
no one else can.

573
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:52,057
It's your life.

574
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:20,786
- Welcome. Sit over there.
- 2 bowls of tofu stew please.
- Yes. Boss, 2 bowls of tofu stew please.

575
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:21,954
Yes.

576
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:34,099
Hello.

577
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:36,902
It's me. Where are you now?

578
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:38,537
The court sent me the papers.

579
00:39:38,537 --> 00:39:40,405
I think we need to meet one more time.

580
00:39:40,405 --> 00:39:43,442
Ajumma, the tofu is ready.

581
00:39:43,442 --> 00:39:46,011
What are you doing?
It's work hours.

582
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:47,880
Take care of it yourself.

583
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,769
These are the divorce papers.

584
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:12,638
Yes.

585
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:36,228
Have you submitted the papers 
I gave to you already?

586
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:37,396
No, not yet.

587
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:39,264
When's the deadline?

588
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:42,067
Up to today.

589
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:43,702
If we don't process that today,

590
00:40:43,702 --> 00:40:44,870
you know that it won't be valid anymore, right?

591
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,206
You won't be divorced.

592
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:00,752
No, Mom.

593
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:02,154
Eonni might do that.

594
00:41:02,154 --> 00:41:04,022
But Brother-in-law won't do that.

595
00:41:04,022 --> 00:41:06,124
What about your sister?

596
00:41:06,124 --> 00:41:09,394
Go son-in-law is acting strange.

597
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:11,730
Otherwise, why does he want a divorce?

598
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,599
Find out what kind of woman she is.

599
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,766
What's the use of finding out?

600
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:16,635
They're over.

601
00:41:16,635 --> 00:41:20,139
We can get compensation if they got
divorced because he had an affair.

602
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:23,642
To be honest, Eonni's not that honest either.

603
00:41:23,642 --> 00:41:24,576
What do you mean she's not?

604
00:41:24,576 --> 00:41:27,146
She just made a little mistake before marriage.

605
00:41:27,146 --> 00:41:29,014
Was that a mistake?

606
00:41:29,014 --> 00:41:31,116
If done at a marrying age,

607
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:33,452
perhaps it's okay with both sets of parents' consents.

608
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:35,554
Without any plans and thoughts,

609
00:41:35,554 --> 00:41:39,057
a university student co-habitating without her parent's knowledge.
How can that be considered a mistake?

610
00:41:39,057 --> 00:41:40,692
That was a huge blunder.

611
00:41:40,692 --> 00:41:42,561
It's because he doesn't know.

612
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:46,064
Who will be happy if they hear that?
Whether male or female.

613
00:41:46,064 --> 00:41:47,699
If Sin Dong's dad did that,

614
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:49,802
I would never forgive him.

615
00:41:58,911 --> 00:41:59,845
Please receive this.

616
00:41:59,845 --> 00:42:01,480
Okay.

617
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:12,224
The divorce papers is already received.

618
00:42:12,224 --> 00:42:14,560
Then, am I considered divorced?

619
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,895
Yes.
Today is the last day.

620
00:42:16,895 --> 00:42:18,997
You almost missed it.

621
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:22,734
I don't know whether it's a good thing 
or a bad thing though.

622
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:30,209
Oppa.

623
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:40,018
Congratulate me.

624
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:43,755
I am finally divorced.

625
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:45,390
You submitted the documents?

626
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,660
Yes.
It was quite simple.

627
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,762
The decision before that was hard.

628
00:42:50,762 --> 00:42:52,631
After you hand that in,

629
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:54,266
you're divorced right away.

630
00:42:54,266 --> 00:42:57,769
How do you feel?
Strange?

631
00:42:57,769 --> 00:43:01,974
Of course.

632
00:43:01,974 --> 00:43:07,346
On one hand, I feel relieved,

633
00:43:07,346 --> 00:43:09,448
and a little expectant.

634
00:43:09,448 --> 00:43:12,951
I'm looking forward to a hot romantic love with you.

635
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:13,886
I don't believe you.

636
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:15,754
It's true.

637
00:43:15,754 --> 00:43:18,323
Nothing can stand in our way now.

638
00:43:18,323 --> 00:43:21,360
I think you're a bad man.

639
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,528
Although I am only saying this now,

640
00:43:22,528 --> 00:43:24,163
do you know how sad I was before?

641
00:43:24,163 --> 00:43:24,863
About what?

642
00:43:24,863 --> 00:43:26,031
Once something happened,
you asked me to come.

643
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:28,367
Another thing happened,
and you broke up with me.

644
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:29,768
Me?

645
00:43:29,768 --> 00:43:33,272
See?
You're the classic bad man.

646
00:43:33,272 --> 00:43:35,374
You conveniently forgot.

647
00:43:35,374 --> 00:43:36,775
When Father was in the hospital,

648
00:43:36,775 --> 00:43:38,410
you wanted to save,
so you used me.

649
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,512
"Sun Jeong, can you help me for a few days?"

650
00:43:40,512 --> 00:43:41,914
You asked me politely.

651
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:43,549
But after he left the hospital,

652
00:43:43,549 --> 00:43:44,950
you kept avoiding me.

653
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,118
"I can't meet you again."

654
00:43:46,118 --> 00:43:47,986
"I don't need you. Go."

655
00:43:47,986 --> 00:43:49,388
I was also going crazy.

656
00:43:49,388 --> 00:43:50,088
You asked me to come, I came.

657
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:51,723
You asked me to go, I left.

658
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:58,964
After hearing that,
I'm really such a bad man.

659
00:43:58,964 --> 00:44:01,066
Then why did you keep following me?

660
00:44:01,066 --> 00:44:06,672
I wasn't following you.
You appeared on your own.

661
00:44:06,672 --> 00:44:09,708
You're that kind of person.

662
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:11,810
I like you like that.

663
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,146
You are loyal.

664
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:17,182
You always treasure your family.

665
00:44:17,182 --> 00:44:19,051
Although you made me cry,

666
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:21,386
you're that kind of guy.

667
00:44:21,386 --> 00:44:23,489
In our 7 years of dating,

668
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:25,824
you never looked at another woman.

669
00:44:25,824 --> 00:44:29,328
You were loyal all through out.

670
00:44:29,328 --> 00:44:31,897
That's what I like about you.

671
00:44:31,897 --> 00:44:37,035
You're a faithful man.

672
00:44:37,035 --> 00:44:40,072
Congratulations.

673
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:43,342
Yes.
If you weren't there,

674
00:44:43,342 --> 00:44:45,677
I would be drinking soju at home alone.

675
00:44:45,677 --> 00:44:48,480
Seeing you makes me feel more at ease.

676
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,349
Since it's already like this,
let's have a party.

677
00:44:50,349 --> 00:44:53,619
Divorced man and divorced woman.

678
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:55,254
Be honest with me.

679
00:44:55,254 --> 00:44:58,524
Were you waiting for it?

680
00:44:58,524 --> 00:45:00,859
How could you say that?

681
00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:02,261
You really know me.

682
00:45:02,261 --> 00:45:05,063
Check how long my neck 
has become from waiting.

683
00:45:05,063 --> 00:45:06,465
See?

684
00:46:20,506 --> 00:46:21,673
Was it really like that?

685
00:46:21,673 --> 00:46:24,243
I told you already.
Excuse me.

686
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:34,520
It's me.

687
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,322
Go son-in-law, what are you doing?

688
00:46:37,322 --> 00:46:39,424
I have an appointment outside.

689
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:41,994
Have you eaten dinner?

690
00:46:41,994 --> 00:46:43,629
Yes.

691
00:46:43,629 --> 00:46:46,198
Are you busy lately?
You don't visit.

692
00:46:46,198 --> 00:46:48,767
Ae Ji and Jung Ji ae looking for their dad.

693
00:46:49,234 --> 00:46:50,402
Oppa!

694
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:57,876
I'll go tomorrow.

695
00:46:59,511 --> 00:47:00,913
Okay.

696
00:47:00,913 --> 00:47:03,248
You must come tomorrow.

697
00:47:03,248 --> 00:47:05,117
Don't you pity your children?

698
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:10,489
Their mother is not around.
You should come by often.

699
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:12,124
Then, let's hang up.

700
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:21,233
Don't call Go son-in-law often.

701
00:47:21,934 --> 00:47:25,671
I'm just calling for the children's sake.

702
00:47:25,671 --> 00:47:27,773
Don't call him using the children as excuse.

703
00:47:27,773 --> 00:47:28,941
He will feel uncomfortable.

704
00:47:28,941 --> 00:47:30,576
Why would he feel uncomfortable?

705
00:47:30,576 --> 00:47:32,911
He stopped coming here.

706
00:47:32,911 --> 00:47:34,780
I was just curious,
so I gave him a call.

707
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,816
He's living alone, 
I wonder if he's eating on time.

708
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:39,685
He'll take care of it.

709
00:47:39,685 --> 00:47:41,320
I know you why you're like that.

710
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,955
Don't do that.

711
00:47:42,955 --> 00:47:45,057
They already handed their divorced papers.

712
00:47:45,057 --> 00:47:47,392
It's not final yet.

713
00:47:52,064 --> 00:47:54,166
What is this?

714
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:55,801
Divorce Confirmation papers.

715
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:58,837
I saw it when I went to get the mail.

716
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:01,640
Go son-in-law must have gotten his already.

717
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,443
They will be strangers already
if he submitted it.

718
00:48:04,443 --> 00:48:07,713
Don't keep calling him,
it will make him uncomfortable.

719
00:48:07,713 --> 00:48:10,749
The children are our grandchildren.
Of course, we should raise them.

720
00:48:29,902 --> 00:48:31,770
Let's go.

721
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,639
Where are we going?

722
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:37,376
I'm thinking about it.
Maybe walk around.

723
00:48:37,376 --> 00:48:39,244
I heard that you were in a bad mood today.

724
00:48:39,244 --> 00:48:41,346
So I came to see you immediately.

725
00:48:41,346 --> 00:48:43,682
Not only today.

726
00:48:43,682 --> 00:48:45,317
Children are enemies.

727
00:48:45,317 --> 00:48:47,419
Both my son and daughter.

728
00:48:47,419 --> 00:48:49,288
It's really cold.

729
00:48:51,623 --> 00:48:53,258
Where do you want to go?

730
00:48:53,258 --> 00:48:55,594
Where there's plenty of people.
Crowded places.

731
00:48:55,594 --> 00:48:56,762
What?

732
00:48:56,762 --> 00:49:00,499
It's cold. We should go to a place
where there's plenty of people.

733
00:49:00,499 --> 00:49:03,769
I will keep you warm.
Let's go where there's no one around.

734
00:49:03,769 --> 00:49:06,338
It's boring if there's no one around.

735
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:23,155
How about it? 
Not cold anymore?

736
00:49:23,155 --> 00:49:26,425
Yes. I really love people hugging me.

737
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:28,527
Whether it's over the shoulders
or tight embrace.

738
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:31,797
There's no one around.
It's fun.

739
00:49:31,797 --> 00:49:32,965
Am I right?

740
00:49:33,198 --> 00:49:35,534
I forgot all about my problems.

741
00:49:35,534 --> 00:49:37,169
Tell me if you're hungry.

742
00:49:37,169 --> 00:49:39,271
I'm not hungry. 
Let's walk some more.

743
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:40,439
Yes.

744
00:49:51,884 --> 00:49:53,986
I feel at ease now.

745
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:06,832
The divorce papers came.

746
00:50:06,832 --> 00:50:11,270
Before Go son-in-law submits it,
meet him and ask for forgiveness.

747
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,839
You have children, you must reconcile.

748
00:50:33,225 --> 00:50:34,860
Sister-in-law, I'll go ahead.

749
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,028
Bye, Brother-in-law.

750
00:50:36,028 --> 00:50:38,130
Goodbye, Father-in-law.

751
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:39,765
Aunt, I'm leaving.

752
00:50:47,473 --> 00:50:50,275
I think I'll be going to China one of these days.

753
00:50:50,275 --> 00:50:54,480
Yes.
Ask them what contracts we need
 to prepare for signature.

754
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,647
I was thinking of doing that too.

755
00:50:59,384 --> 00:51:04,523
Aunt. Now?
Okay.

756
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:08,961
Is that true?

757
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:10,362
Yes.

758
00:51:10,362 --> 00:51:12,931
You wife asked me to keep it a secret from you.

759
00:51:12,931 --> 00:51:14,800
But I just can't take it anymore.

760
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:18,070
How could such a thing like that happen?

761
00:51:19,471 --> 00:51:21,106
They even moved house?

762
00:51:21,106 --> 00:51:24,843
Yes. They moved to a house with only 2 rooms.

763
00:51:24,843 --> 00:51:26,712
How could she not tell me?

764
00:51:28,347 --> 00:51:30,916
Aunt, couples can't be like this.

765
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:33,952
Even so, she still has pride.

766
00:51:33,952 --> 00:51:36,989
You just got married,
and her family went bankrupt.

767
00:51:36,989 --> 00:51:40,025
It's embarrassing and hurts the pride.

768
00:51:40,025 --> 00:51:44,229
Anyone will feel a sudden loss of self-confidence.
That happens.

769
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:48,667
How can that happen?
We are husband and wife.

770
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:50,769
She must be having a really hard time.

771
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:54,973
Don't tell Brother-in-law.
Just comfort her.

772
00:52:03,148 --> 00:52:04,550
Hello, Mother-in-law.

773
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,185
Do you want some tea?

774
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:09,221
Before that, let's exchange what we need to exchange.

775
00:52:09,688 --> 00:52:10,856
Yes.

776
00:52:16,462 --> 00:52:18,564
Give that to me first.

777
00:52:18,564 --> 00:52:20,432
You really won't tell them?

778
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:22,301
No.

779
00:52:22,301 --> 00:52:25,571
This is our secret.

780
00:52:25,571 --> 00:52:27,439
Of course.

781
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,541
Then, give it to me first.

782
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:33,045
You should give them to me first.
I've already taken the envelope out.

783
00:52:33,045 --> 00:52:34,913
You should take them out too.

784
00:52:43,088 --> 00:52:44,490
Open them.

785
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:45,891
Why should I?

786
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:49,394
Open it first.
I need to check first.

787
00:52:49,394 --> 00:52:52,197
Then, let me see what's inside the envelope too.

788
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:05,744
You can't do this.

789
00:53:09,248 --> 00:53:11,583
You're something else.

790
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:12,985
I went to university.

791
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:15,320
Then, I can't give this money to you.

792
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,890
We are really alike.

793
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:22,327
If we open a teahouse,
it will do really well.

794
00:53:29,802 --> 00:53:32,604
Good enough?
Give that to me.

795
00:53:32,604 --> 00:53:34,239
Let's exchange simultaneously.

796
00:53:40,078 --> 00:53:43,582
1. 2. 3, then let go.

797
00:53:43,582 --> 00:53:47,319
1... 2...

798
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:53,158
You're really something else.

799
00:53:53,158 --> 00:53:56,428
How did you know that I'd snatch
it away at the count of 2?

800
00:53:56,428 --> 00:53:59,698
I went to university and 
I used to be a teacher.

801
00:54:05,771 --> 00:54:08,807
What's this?
What did you do?

802
00:54:08,807 --> 00:54:10,676
You deceived me.

803
00:54:10,676 --> 00:54:13,712
I just took back what you stole.

804
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:16,515
I have no reason for giving you money.

805
00:54:20,018 --> 00:54:22,354
I am your mother-in-law.

806
00:54:22,354 --> 00:54:24,923
How could you do this to me?

807
00:54:24,923 --> 00:54:27,960
How did you treat me?

808
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,529
I did everything I could for you.

809
00:54:30,529 --> 00:54:33,332
I gave you 10 million Won behind Sang Nam's back.

810
00:54:33,332 --> 00:54:36,135
Although Sang Nam was hurt when he was little,

811
00:54:36,135 --> 00:54:39,171
do you know how happy he is to see you now?

812
00:54:39,171 --> 00:54:41,740
As long as Sang Nam's wound can be healed,

813
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,908
I can bear the castigations.

814
00:54:42,908 --> 00:54:45,944
But, you even stole Father's gold key,

815
00:54:45,944 --> 00:54:48,280
and drove a wedge between
Sang Nam and me.

816
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,316
I can't endure it any longer.

817
00:54:51,316 --> 00:54:53,652
What are you enduring?

818
00:54:53,652 --> 00:54:55,988
I'm already indulging you and you dare...

819
00:54:57,156 --> 00:55:01,360
Sang Nam. Sang Nam. Sang Nam. 
Listen to me.

820
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,995
She is framing me.

821
00:55:02,995 --> 00:55:05,097
Sang Nam, listen to me.

822
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:05,798
Sang Nam.

823
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:07,199
Get out.

824
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:07,900
Sang Nam.

825
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,702
I told you to leave!

826
00:55:10,702 --> 00:55:14,673
I'm really embarrassed that I even
tried to treat you like a mom.

827
00:55:14,673 --> 00:55:17,242
I really regret meeting you again.

828
00:55:17,242 --> 00:55:20,746
I feel really wretched because
you gave birth to me!

829
00:55:20,746 --> 00:55:24,249
I want to draw out all the blood in my body.

830
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:26,819
I even called a person like you mother.

831
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:29,388
I regret calling you mom.

832
00:55:29,388 --> 00:55:30,556
Sang Nam.

833
00:55:30,556 --> 00:55:32,658
Please leave.

834
00:55:32,658 --> 00:55:34,760
Don't say anything.

835
00:55:36,628 --> 00:55:38,030
Get out.

836
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:43,168
Sang Nam.

837
00:55:43,168 --> 00:55:46,905
Sang Nam.

838
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:03,956
I'm really sorry that things ended up like this.

839
00:56:03,956 --> 00:56:06,758
It would have been better
if only you and me know about this.

840
00:56:07,459 --> 00:56:10,262
Later, after a long time has passed,

841
00:56:10,262 --> 00:56:13,765
when Sang Nam's ready to accept you as mother again,

842
00:56:13,765 --> 00:56:16,335
I will call you.

843
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:18,904
Then, goodbye.

844
00:56:49,968 --> 00:56:52,538
Why did you come back?

845
00:56:52,538 --> 00:56:55,107
I could have settled it.

846
00:56:56,742 --> 00:56:58,143
Sorry.

847
00:57:00,479 --> 00:57:02,347
I'm really sorry.

848
00:57:04,683 --> 00:57:06,785
I'm really speechless.

849
00:57:07,486 --> 00:57:09,121
Sang Nam.

850
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:12,157
You must be really heartbroken, right?

851
00:57:12,858 --> 00:57:15,194
It would have been better
if you didn't know.

852
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:21,967
No, I should know what I need to know.

853
00:57:25,704 --> 00:57:28,740
But why didn't you tell me
about what happened to your family?

854
00:57:31,777 --> 00:57:33,645
Why didn't you tell me?

855
00:57:33,645 --> 00:57:35,047
We are husband and wife.

856
00:57:37,149 --> 00:57:39,952
You heard from Aunt?

857
00:57:39,952 --> 00:57:41,353
Yes.

858
00:57:41,353 --> 00:57:43,689
How could you keep that a secret?

859
00:57:52,097 --> 00:57:54,666
It must be very hard having to bear it alone.
Fool.

860
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:58,871
I'm really lacking compared to you.

861
00:58:00,038 --> 00:58:01,907
I still have a long way to go
before I mature.

862
00:58:04,243 --> 00:58:06,111
I'm not your husband.

863
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:28,300
Go Min Jeong and Wang Su Bak

864
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,869
are already divorced.
It's here.

865
00:59:12,444 --> 00:59:13,612
Oppa.

866
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,288
Hello.

867
01:00:29,288 --> 01:00:30,689
Yes.

868
01:00:30,689 --> 01:00:33,492
What are you doing here?

869
01:00:33,492 --> 01:00:35,594
I know someone here.

870
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:38,630
I came to see someone here too.

871
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,966
Is our Gwang Bak doing well?

872
01:00:40,966 --> 01:00:41,667
Yes.

873
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:43,302
I'll rely on you.

874
01:00:43,302 --> 01:00:45,871
As the middle person,
please help her.

875
01:00:45,871 --> 01:00:47,506
Yes.

876
01:00:47,506 --> 01:00:49,608
Then, go.

877
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:51,243
Bye.

878
01:01:11,096 --> 01:01:12,264
I'm back.

01:01:15,767 --> 01:01:16,702
Is it snowing?

880
01:01:16,702 --> 01:01:19,505
Yes, it's snowing.

881
01:01:19,505 --> 01:01:20,906
Really?

883
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:26,538
You know who the head of Dae Se Heavy Industries is, right?

884
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:28,173
Who are you to use informal language at me?

885
01:02:28,173 --> 01:02:30,509
You actually dare.

886
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:36,114
I will make up for all the hurt you had before.

887
01:02:36,114 --> 01:02:37,749
It feels like I'm falling in love with you again.

888
01:02:37,749 --> 01:02:41,487
They said couples can still start again
after a divorce.

889
01:02:41,487 --> 01:02:43,121
Mother-in-law, we've already...

890
01:02:43,121 --> 01:02:44,990
You're making him feel uncomfortable.
Why do you keep doing that?

891
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:47,092
You have children.

892
01:02:47,092 --> 01:02:48,494
Mom, please.

893
01:02:48,494 --> 01:02:49,895
Just go.

894
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:51,063
Our destiny ends here.

895
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:52,464
It won't end here.

896
01:02:52,464 --> 01:02:54,333
Although Go son-in-law didn't say anything.

897
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:56,435
He is definitely with another woman.

898
01:02:56,435 --> 01:02:58,537
What face do I have to hold on to him?

899
01:02:58,537 --> 01:03:02,508
Wake up.
Don't let another woman take him away.
