2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,980
You told me to keep my mouth shut, so I did.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,050
It's in the past.
You made a mistake.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,790
But Subak, don't do this.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,610
You don't know what you're doing, do you?

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,520
It's the most horrible, cowardly,

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,250
and evil sin in the world.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,140
I've experienced it, and it's hell.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,020
My spouse being with another person.

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,890
That's hell.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,940
It destroys one's soul completely.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,910
Subak, I'm begging you.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,510
End it now.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,910
What if Minjung finds out?

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,010
It'll destroy everyone.

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,820
You, Minjung and your kids.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,620
Minjung.

18
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,820
How long have you been standing there?

19
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,320
Huh? I just got here.

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,290
He wouldn't sleep so I just kept walking, and here I am.

21
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,220
What are you doing out here?
It's cold.

22
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,110
I was yelling at her for coming home so late.

23
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,490
Even if she has a job,

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,880
she shouldn't come home so late.

25
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,940
I'm more experienced in working.

26
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,480
I never come home this late, and she has

27
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,380
a little baby which mom is taking care of,

28
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,790
and you too, so she shouldn't be like this.

29
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,850
Aren't you glad I scolded her?

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,820
I am.

31
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,650
How rude.

32
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,250
She thinks she's my older sister.

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,410
She thinks I'm an idiot.

34
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,910
She thinks she's so much better.

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,910
Minjung, try to give her a break.

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,350
It's her first job, so it must be hard.

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,590
She can't say no to business engagements.

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,820
I'll see you later.

39
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,250
See you.

40
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,380
Minjung, goodbye.

41
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,850
See you again.

42
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,050
You can't control your kids.

43
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,090
She brought a man she wants to marry,

44
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,190
and I don't like him.

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,520
He's nice, but it's the things about him.

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,910
But my daughter wouldn't give up,

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,080
so I met with his father,

48
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,120
but oh, boy.

49
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,620
What's wrong?

50
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,090
His father is nothing but trouble.

51
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,120
My wife saw him to talk about furniture,

52
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,920
and she canceled the wedding.

53
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,910
My daughter's crying her eyes out,

54
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,940
but my wife keeps saying no.

55
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,850
I'd say yes if things weren't so bad,

56
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,510
but it feels wrong.

57
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:35,850
He's so weird that he held a daughter in law audition.

58
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,720
I couldn't believe it.

59
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,250
What did you just say?

60
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,020
Daughter in law audition?

61
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,590
Yes. Why?

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,020
Why did you call me so late?

63
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,220
Is something wrong?

64
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,610
Come and meet me.

65
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,540
Excuse me?

66
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,290
Just come and meet me right now.

67
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,880
Hey, Daese!

68
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,150
Oh, hi.

69
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,540
Hello.

70
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,040
How come you two are together?

71
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,240
It just happened.

72
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,290
Hello.

73
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,790
I don't understand...

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,150
Sit, sit, sit. Sit.

75
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,120
Daese, this is meant to be.

76
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,310
You trust me, don't you?

77
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,680
Bong, you trust me too, don't you?

78
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,950
No words needed.

79
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,310
You two are in laws now.

80
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,640
Just trust me

81
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,690
and let your son and daughter get married.

82
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,140
What is it?
You can't sleep?

83
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,890
What if Bangtong dies?

84
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,680
He won't. Not from this.

85
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,540
He'll be fine when his fever breaks.

86
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,850
Go to bed.

87
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,620
Why aren't you in bed?

88
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,720
Grandma, Bangtong's sick.

89
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,450
He is? Why?

90
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,950
I don't know. He has a fever.

91
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,590
Yeongdal! Bangtong is sick!

92
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,540
Bangtong is sick?

93
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,290
Oh, my, he's burning up.

94
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,590
Shouldn't we take him to the ER?

95
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,910
It was worse before.

96
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,890
He's a lot better now.

97
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,850
You didn't get any sleep, did you?

98
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,150
We'll look after him. Go to bed.

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,150
I know how upset you must be.

100
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,690
Yes, Hobak.
Get some sleep in our room.

101
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,710
Mom and I will sleep here.

102
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,650
It's okay. You can go to bed.

103
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,320
Dad.

104
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,010
Bangtong, it's grandma.

105
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,790
Wake up! 
Bangtong, open your eyes.

106
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,680
Why are you waking him up?

107
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,910
Dad... Dad...

108
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,310
See? He's not sleeping.

109
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,440
What did he just say?

110
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,120
He's calling for his dad.

111
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,040
Oh, my.

112
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,740
He's sick and he's calling for his dad.

113
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,080
He got sick because he misses his dad.

114
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,220
- Poor boy.
- Dad.

115
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,240
I know.

116
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,480
Hobak, don't break your son's heart.

117
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,480
Forget it. Please leave.

118
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,040
You're telling us to leave now?

119
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,740
Where could we go in the middle of winter?

120
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,740
Whenever you tell us to leave,

121
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,910
my heart jumps.

122
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,110
It's like I'm becoming neurotic.

123
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,640
You can't do this to me.

124
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,720
I mean leave this room. He can't sleep.

125
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,040
Mom, she wants us out of this room.

126
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,720
Let's, go, let's go.

127
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,040
Call me if you get too tired.

128
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,910
- One more time!
- One more time!

129
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,090
You don't know what you're doing, do you?

130
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,980
It's the most horrible, cowardly,

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,750
and evil sin in the world.

132
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,190
I've experienced it, and it's hell.

133
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,540
My spouse being with another person.

134
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,290
That's hell.

135
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,490
Minjung, come over here.

136
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,680
I don't feel like eating.

137
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,540
Have a bite.
I made soft tofu stew.

138
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,040
I'm not hungry.

139
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,120
That's okay.

140
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,620
You can't work on an empty stomach.

141
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,890
You have to eat if you want to work.

142
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,950
My stomach hurts, so I'll skip it.

143
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,020
Why would your stomach hurt?

144
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,620
I had indigestion last night.

145
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,120
You did?

146
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,850
You shouldn't eat so quickly.

147
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,440
You eat like someone's coming after you.

148
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,410
Don't eat so quickly, even when you're busy.

149
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,940
I wish you'd have a bite, at least.

150
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,310
Leave him be. He's not hungry.

151
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,610
You cooked for nothing.

152
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,910
I should go.

153
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,020
Get something later, okay?

154
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,680
What's wrong?

155
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,680
Minjung skipped breakfast.

156
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,150
His stomach hurts and he's not hungry.

157
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,020
I hope he's not sick.

158
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,720
I know.

159
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,540
Why did you get so drunk last night?

160
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,150
Oh, I'm dying.

161
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,440
Get me some honey tea.

162
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,410
Have some hangover soup.

163
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,520
You were pretty drunk last night.

164
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,150
Oh, that hit the spot.
I feel better now.

165
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,940
Who did you go drinking with?

166
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,040
None of your business.

167
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,150
Your soup is amazing. Top class.

168
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,440
Tell the rude girl she better cook like this.

169
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,020
Or I'll kick her out.

170
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,520
Excuse me?

171
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,710
Father.

172
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,840
You're saying yes?

173
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,110
Nobody will cook for me if you were gone.

174
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,540
Teach her how to make it just like this.

175
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,250
I will, Daese.

176
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,690
Father, thank you!

177
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,110
Oh, let me go!
I have to eat this.

178
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,820
Stop it!

179
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,020
Father, what did you say?

180
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,490
Honey, this is wrong.

181
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,790
I'm not saying yes because I'm happy.

182
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,390
You say you can't live without him,

183
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,120
and I don't want you to die a spinster.

184
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,680
You better not regret this!

185
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,080
And don't blame us for not stopping you!

186
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,410
I won't, I won't!

187
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,680
The number you have called is busy...

188
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,940
The number you have called is busy...

189
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,520
The number you have called is busy...

190
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,190
Sangnam.

191
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,480
Congrats, congrats!
You're getting married!

192
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,410
Our fathers had a drink last night.

193
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,750
I heard.

194
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,390
We're really getting married?

195
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,410
After I break up with the women who loves me.

196
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,810
Huh?

197
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,520
Let's celebrate later.

198
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,540
Okay.

199
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,580
Yay!

200
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,840
How could you decide that on your own?

201
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,910
Didn't you say his father's weird?

202
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,250
He's actually a decent man.

203
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,290
He's picky, but he's a good person.

204
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,620
Even the meanest mother in law has a good reputation in her neighborhood.

205
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,590
Did you mean me?

206
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,040
Everyone likes you in our neighborhood.

207
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,790
Why you little...

208
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,650
I only want one thing.

209
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,180
A woman can mess up a man's life.

210
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,890
Lots of marriages break up over the wife's side of the family.

211
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,220
Don't let them intimidate you.

212
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,940
Don't be at their beck and call.

213
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,650
You're my son, not their servant, got it?

214
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,590
Father, I'll be fine. Don't worry.

215
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,390
I'm worried about his father.

216
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,990
Did you make him swear that he won't give her any trouble?

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,540
But Gwangbak loves him more.

218
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,440
She even entered that audition.

219
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,040
Father...

220
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,440
You're so weird.

221
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,180
I would never do anything like that.

222
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,520
Do you know what makes you the happiest?

223
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,890
Being warm and well fed makes you happy.

224
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,180
And having a brand name handbag.

225
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,240
You don't even feel hungry when you do.

226
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,340
That darn brand name handbag.

227
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,440
I'll sell this house and buy you one.

228
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,250
I'll buy you one, mom.

229
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,450
And me?

230
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,740
Mom, you have me.

231
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,540
Don't ask your granddaughter for one.

232
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,250
You have a son here.

233
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,250
Let me talk.

234
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,220
Why are we talking about that?

235
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,210
Go ahead.

236
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,540
Where was I?

237
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,580
Do you know what makes you the happiest?

238
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,110
You just finished saying that.

239
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,220
Okay.

240
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,520
Doing what you love while living with the person you love.

241
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,990
That's what makes you the happiest.

242
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,190
Yes.

243
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,610
You're right, father.

244
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,590
Oh, you must have been so unhappy.

245
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,650
You couldn't become a singer or live with the woman you love.

246
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,150
I'm glad you know.

247
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,120
What?

248
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,750
But I got half of it.

249
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,990
I'm living with the woman I love.

250
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,890
Stop lying.

251
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,710
You had a crush on the miller's daughter!

252
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,020
How did you know that?

253
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,540
Mother told me.

254
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,910
I never told you that!

255
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,650
You forgot already?

256
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,890
You said the miller's daughter was tall,

257
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,590
thin, and beautiful every day to me.

258
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,480
A tall woman wouldn't look right with Bong.

259
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,650
I'm perfect for him.

260
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,240
She was the one who had a crush on me.

261
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,520
Whatever.

262
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,150
I'm not going to cook for you anymore!

263
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,020
How about you?

264
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,290
You didn't have a crush on anyone?

265
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,840
Of course I did!

266
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,410
So many young men fell for me that

267
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,790
my father had to stay up all night

268
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,910
making number tickets to keep them in order.

269
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,490
Stop it, liar!

270
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,880
Mom, I will be happy.

271
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,890
Father, thank you.

272
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,180
Look at how big her smile is.

273
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,150
- Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.
- Congratulations.

274
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,590
- Good luck.
- Ugh!

275
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,080
Anna, I have to take the morning off.

276
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,110
Okay, Hobak.

277
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,220
If something comes up, I'll call you.

278
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,080
Can I come, too?

279
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,010
I don't want to stay home.

280
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,940
You have to, even if you don't want to.

281
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,410
What if she takes our stuff out?

282
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,990
We'd be kicked out, just like that.

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,720
She's not even going to work today.

284
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,810
I can't believe this.

285
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,310
One of us must stay home from now on,
 so Sedal can come home.

286
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,650
If we get kicked out, we'd be ruined.

287
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,310
This is crazy.

288
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,240
How does it feel?

289
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,690
It's not the nice smelling lotion

290
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,390
that moves one's heart. It's the person.

291
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,910
Don't you think so?

292
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,880
Of course I do.

293
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,310
Hello.

294
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,290
Oh!

295
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,020
Hello.

296
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,650
You're my first customer.

297
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,390
Oh, I am?

298
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,650
The lotion I bought here was great.

299
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,150
I knew it!

300
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,690
The weather's turning my hands really rough.

301
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,350
Do you have anything for that?

302
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,210
Would you like to try our hand lotion?

303
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,450
Okay.

304
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,580
Right here, please.

305
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,650
If you love your body, your skin improves.

306
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,610
Wash your hands and work the lotion in.

307
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,180
Work it in.

308
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,220
Rub it in like this.

309
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,940
Done.

310
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,910
May I have some on this one, too?

311
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,890
Hello?

312
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,080
Sangnam, did you tell her?

313
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,140
To come and see me?

314
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,040
Uh, not yet.

315
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,690
She doesn't want to see me?

316
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,990
It's not that.

317
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,650
I didn't get the chance to tell her.

318
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,180
You didn't?

319
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,290
I'm supposed to be her mother in law,

320
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,690
so you can't introduce me at the wedding.

321
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,450
I have to see her.

322
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,190
I'm very curious about her.

323
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,990
Okay.

324
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,840
Father.

325
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,420
I heard you couldn't go to work.

326
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,950
Is it serious?

327
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,420
The fever broke.

328
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,650
It must be a cold.
He threw up.

329
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,510
Did you take him to see a doctor?

330
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,190
Yes.

331
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,090
I know you'd never miss work.

332
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,040
You went to work even when your kid got surgery.

333
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,990
It breaks my heart to think of that, father.

334
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,520
I'm not going to live like that anymore.

335
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,880
My boys were the most important,

336
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,840
but I lived to make money.

337
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,990
From now on, I'm going to be there for them,

338
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,040
build memories with them, eat good food and travel with them.

339
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,220
I feel horrible about not doing that.

340
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,950
You can start now.

341
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,950
Don't beat yourself up over that.

342
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,020
Let me see.

343
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,520
Your mother in law came over upset the other day.

344
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,220
She went to your house?

345
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,040
She's just upset.

346
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,750
Hobak, I'm a man, too,

347
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,220
but it takes men longer to become adults.

348
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,220
Maybe it's because we don't give birth,

349
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,920
but it takes us much longer than women.

350
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,450
I know what you're going to say.

351
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,650
But I...

352
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:24,880
For your boys, can't you just reconsider it?

353
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,210
I told you I don't want to maintain a loveless marriage because of my kids.

354
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,890
I know how you feel right now,

355
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,290
but Hobak, men need time to grow up.

356
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,790
Some men actually do change.

357
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,340
He might change if you gave him time.

358
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,380
I'm saying this for you.

359
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,080
I don't want you to have any regrets.

360
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:55,310
He wouldn't have come back if that woman hadn't dumped him.

361
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,940
Father, I'm not some trash can.

362
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,520
I can't do that to myself.

363
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,920
- Uh, mother.
- Oh, you scared me.

364
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,340
I knocked...

365
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,210
How have you been?

366
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,840
Not good, thanks to you.
Why are you here?

367
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,080
I wanted to see you and tell you something.

368
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,140
I don't want to hear anything from you.

369
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,810
How dare you come here after all you've done?

370
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,640
Mother.

371
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,290
I'm not your mother!

372
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,840
Get out!
How dare you come here?

373
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,080
You're just like your mother!
Get out!

374
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,520
Uh, I just need a minute. I have...

375
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,450
I don't want to hear anything from you!

376
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,990
You have a lot of nerve to show up here!

377
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,620
Uh, mother...

378
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,940
Stop calling me that. Get out!

379
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,790
Mother, I'm sorry.

380
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,020
Please hear me out!

381
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,750
Mother, open the door, please.

382
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,840
Mother! I'm sorry! Mother!

383
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,440
Mother!

384
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,920
What are you doing?

385
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,990
She won't even open the door.

386
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,990
Would you, if you were her?

387
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,720
Loser, what should I do?

388
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,620
Why are you asking me that?

389
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,910
Can I have some more soup?

390
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,020
She won't see me,

391
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,790
so I can't even beg for her forgiveness.

392
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,180
Neither my brother nor his wife wants to see you.

393
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,420
If you were them, would you want to see you?

394
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,990
No.

395
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,890
Hobak always sticks to her decision.

396
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,340
You know that.

397
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,250
But she takes a long time to decide.

398
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,540
Why didn't you go back when she asked?

399
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,290
I was out of my mind back then.

400
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,380
Right. You had crazy eyes back then.

401
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,610
I know.

402
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:24,140
My eyes, brain, and heart were all crazy.

403
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,940
Why didn't you stop me?

404
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,520
Beating you up didn't work, so how could I?

405
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,450
This is nuts.

406
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,650
Goof-off,

407
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,910
I kind of understand you.

408
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,420
I feel sorry for you.

409
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,120
I can't throw stones at you.

410
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,110
But I can't be on your side.

411
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,210
You broke Hobak's heart.

412
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,310
You should give up.

413
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,310
I can't.

414
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,110
Can you be my messenger?

415
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,020
I won't forget this.

416
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,250
I couldn't do it if I wanted to.

417
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,810
Hobak won't listen to me.

418
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,840
She won't even listen to her father.

419
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,910
Unless you can bring her lots of money,

420
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:12,750
you should just let her go.

421
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,690
How much is it?

422
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,190
Three dollars.

423
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,720
You should stay and finish this.

424
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,720
This is nuts.

425
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,650
Bangtong.

426
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,020
Sintong.

427
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,520
How are you feeling?

428
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,310
I'm better now.

429
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,920
Here. Cards.

430
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,350
You said you wanted them.

431
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,920
I miss dad.

432
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,190
Don't you miss dad?

433
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,520
Mom.

434
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,080
Yes, hold on.

435
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,880
I'll make you something to eat after this.

436
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,940
Can you tell dad to come?

437
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,940
Bangtong misses him.

438
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,220
He won't even take my cards.

439
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,310
He's asking for dad.

440
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,140
What are you doing here?

441
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,080
To buy gifts to celebrate our wedding.

442
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,610
Oh, how nice!

443
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,520
Come to think of it...

444
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,610
I'm materialistic, right?

445
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,710
I'm a material girl.

446
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,420
It's not for you.

447
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,520
I'm buying Christmas gifts for my nephews.

448
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,340
You have nephews?
Isn't Miho your cousin?

449
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,810
Your nephews.

450
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,810
I want them to be on my side.

451
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,140
Really?

452
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,240
Oh, you're so amazing!

453
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,920
I can't believe this!

454
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:12,340
But I don't want you spending money without my permission in the future.

455
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,310
Afer we're married, I won't.

456
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,490
I'll ask you whenever I spend a penny. Happy?

457
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,810
I should spend lots of it before our wedding.

458
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,580
Should I buy gifts for my ex-girlfriends?

459
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,980
Ugh!

460
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,810
You're impossible.

461
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,140
These are from your future uncle.

462
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,840
Christmas gifts.

463
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,210
Wow! How exciting!

464
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,150
- You're the best.
- He's the best!

465
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,990
I thought your mom didn't go to work today.

466
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,650
She just did.

467
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,010
Bangtong's not sick anymore.

468
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,250
Your future uncle wants you to feel better.

469
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,950
So don't get sick again.

470
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,820
If I can see dad, I won't get sick, aunt.

471
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,450
Gwangbak, I know what you're saying,

472
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,090
but don't talk to me about Sedal. Please.

473
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,720
Everyone's been talking to me about him.

474
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,040
I know. I'm sorry.

475
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,490
I'm fine.

476
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,040
You're not. And it's Christmas.

477
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,880
I'll talk to you later.

478
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,340
Father, hi.
Hi, Minjung.

479
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,140
Show us your lightest and warmest coat.

480
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,080
Show us the best, regardless of price.

481
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,880
But you don't have to.

482
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,310
Let me buy you one, Minjung.

483
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,990
Then get me something cheap.

484
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,310
An expensive one, okay?

485
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,110
Okay.

486
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,020
I'll get the best, most expensive one we have.

487
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,950
Father, stay here.

488
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,890
Minjung, what's your favorite color?

489
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,180
Hobak,

490
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,390
can I see you after work?

491
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,540
I don't understand what you're saying.

492
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,220
Be honest with me.

493
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,620
I caught some of it the other night,

494
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,380
but I want to know for sure.

495
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,740
I think I should.

496
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,950
But I didn't say much.

497
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,850
Hobak.

498
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,110
Minjung,

499
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,210
I don't know what you think you heard,

500
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,390
but I already told you that night.

501
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,180
I yelled at Subak for coming home late.

502
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,690
I told her to go home early and help mom out.

503
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,150
I told her you'd be worried, too.

504
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,810
I'm serious, Minjung.

505
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,750
That's what I said.

506
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,310
Minjung,

507
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,020
what's wrong?

508
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,990
I don't know.

509
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,650
Minjung.

510
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,140
Something's not right.

511
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,210
I just have this feeling.

512
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,880
But Hobak,

513
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,950
I don't know why,

514
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,420
but I want the truth,

515
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:42,090
and at the same time, I'm afraid of it.

516
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,750
I'm scared.

517
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:52,610
Maybe I want to avoid it entirely.

518
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,840
Whatever the truth is,

519
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:02,790
I want to cover my eyes and ears.

520
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:06,320
Minjung,

521
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,910
I know how that feels.

522
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,950
I know it too well.

523
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,680
Dying to know the truth but wanting to avoid it.

524
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,220
Wanting and not wanting it at the same time.

525
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,120
Feeling lost and scared.

526
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,880
I know that.

527
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,210
I've been there.

528
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,420
What do I do after I find out the truth?

529
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,190
I was scared.

530
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,980
But Minjung,

531
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,810
Subak isn't.

532
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,450
She's not cheating on you.

533
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,620
She can't afford to do that right now.

534
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,480
She really isn't.

535
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,650
You misunderstood.

536
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,020
I didn't finish because of Minjung, but...

537
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,290
Yes, you did!

538
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,190
Subak.

539
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,990
What? What more do you have to say?

540
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,250
You know what.

541
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,250
- End it.
- I can't.

542
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,250
Subak.

543
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,890
He's my path to survival.

544
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,340
I work at his company.

545
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,940
You're nuts.

546
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,190
How could you work at his company?

547
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,290
Does that mean you see him every day?

548
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,140
Subak, snap out of it! 
This is wrong.

549
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,410
What if Minjung finds out?

550
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,390
He might have already.

551
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,180
He's dense, so he won't.

552
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,640
My father's going home tomorrow.

553
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,790
I'm spending the night at the hospital.

554
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,190
Who is it?

555
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,820
It's your brother in law!

556
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,290
He's spending the night at the hospital.

557
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,540
You don't want to divorce him.

558
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,110
I will, if I have to.

559
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,410
Don't talk like that.

560
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,820
You're not alone.
You have two kids.

561
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,640
You have to resign.

562
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,440
Who do you think you are to tell me that?

563
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,420
You said you see him every day.

564
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,120
All men are the same.

565
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,940
Nobody is that special.

566
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,190
When you have a job, some men seem special.

567
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,790
How amazing it would be to be his wife?

568
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,020
But when you meet their wives, they all say this.

569
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:28,020
Try living with him for a week or a month.

570
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,310
You're upset because you couldn't marry him,

571
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,610
but if you did, you might already be divorced.

572
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,310
He's not the right man for you.

573
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:43,220
Subak, I hope you and Minjung don't go through what I did.

574
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,790
Go.

575
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,490
And mind your own business from now on.

576
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,290
I'm fine. Let me down.

577
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,610
I said I'm fine.

578
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,810
Thank you for everything.

579
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,220
Don't mention it.

580
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,750
Take care of yourself.

581
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,420
I hope you stay healthy.

582
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,190
I'll see you later. Thank you.

583
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,390
You should go.

584
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,310
Here, take it.

585
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,940
Is it my paycheck?

586
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,410
It's a bonus.

587
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,950
I'll be back soon.

588
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,190
What is it?

589
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,250
Mom, I wired you the money.

590
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,840
You did?

591
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,520
I wired $1,000, just like you asked.

592
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,710
Don't you just love me?

593
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,210
Thanks to you, I'm making money now.

594
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,980
I'm getting my monthly paycheck.

595
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,290
When you turn around!

596
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,150
My eyes might meet yours!

597
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,990
Why didn't you finish hanging up the laundry?

598
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,450
I didn't?

599
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,790
I can't believe this.

600
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,290
I think you should see a doctor.

601
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,440
I know.

602
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,880
I keep forgetting where I put things.

603
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:43,440
What if something bad happens?

604
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,290
How's your business?

605
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,520
- Hello.
- Hi.

606
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,820
What's good today?

607
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,490
Oh.

608
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,480
I don't see anything I want.

609
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,080
I'll come back another time.

610
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,720
Have a good day!

611
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,090
The bank!

612
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,790
Oh, my.

613
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,440
This is fur.

614
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,910
Let me see.

615
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,340
Hello.

616
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,340
I'm Wang Gwangbak.

617
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,920
Hi.

618
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,820
You're perfect for my Sangnam.

619
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,720
You're very pretty.

620
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,810
You look like I did when I was young.

621
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,790
I heard if the mother and daughter in law look alike, they get along well.

622
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,680
Really?

623
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,090
Yes.

624
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,950
Let's sit down. Sit.

625
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,110
You must have been surprised.

626
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,480
I actually wanted to meet you.

627
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,090
It was meant to be then.

628
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,890
Should we go out for dinner?

629
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,040
I'd love to cook for you, but...

630
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,420
You're very kind.

631
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,420
You look so good together.

632
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,120
I only want one thing.

633
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,920
I want you two to be happy.

634
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,190
If Sangnam is happy, I'm happy.

635
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,590
Should we get something?

636
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,590
I'll go get it.

637
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,690
I'll get it.

638
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,690
What would you like?

639
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,020
I just want instant coffee.

640
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,880
They have that here, right?

641
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,310
Me too.

642
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,220
I'll get the closest thing.

643
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,340
What's your number?

644
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,110
I'll store it in your phone for you.

645
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,810
What should I save my name as?

646
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,120
Your name.

647
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,790
Daughter in law.

648
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,790
Can I call you?

649
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,920
Yes.

650
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,410
What are you making?

651
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:00,990
Spicy raw crab.
Subak's favorite.

652
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,250
You only care about Subak?

653
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,020
Subak paid me today.

654
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,050
People are such simple creatures.

655
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:13,550
Being paid makes all this a piece of cake.

656
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,690
I should've asked Bong to pay me.

657
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,250
It's bad to go money crazy.

658
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,420
I'm not the type of person who could.

659
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,590
Jungji's taking a long nap for a change.

660
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,680
Can you go check on him?

661
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,210
Where did you put Jungji?

662
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,140
He's not in your room or Subak's room.

663
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,110
He's not?

664
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,750
Gwangbak...

665
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,750
Mom, what is it?
I'm home.

666
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,340
What?

667
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,440
Okay, mom.

668
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,840
What is it?

669
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,020
Oh, no!

670
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,920
Minjung,

671
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,220
what do I do?

672
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,540
I lost Jungji.

673
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,890
Okay, mother.

674
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,920
I'm on my way home.

675
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:39,380
Mother, don't be so scared.
Calm down.

676
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,940
I'm sure we can find him.

677
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,250
I'll hurry up.

678
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,680
Mom! Mom!

679
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,980
What do I do?
What do I do?

680
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:03,880
Mom, pull yourself together and think about it.

681
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,810
I'm sure we can find him.

682
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,910
- Jungji!
- Jungji!

683
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,820
Jungji!

684
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,690
- Mom, here.
- Jungji.

685
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,150
Gwangbak!

686
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,450
Oh, Hobak.

687
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,020
What happened?

688
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,050
Mom took Jungji out on his stroller,

689
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,890
but she can't remember where she left him.

690
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,250
But we looked everywhere.

691
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,340
What do we do?

692
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,840
Mom, try to remember.

693
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,380
I can't remember where I left him.

694
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:33,920
What do I do?
What do I do about my Jungji?

695
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:37,450
Calm down and think.
Where did you go?

696
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,410
I bought some blue crabs at the market,

697
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,990
and I talked to the fish vendor.

698
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,440
Where did I go next?

699
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:49,180
Oh! I went to the bank.

700
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,340
The bank?

701
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,610
Let's go there, mom.

702
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,920
Where's Subak?

703
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,880
We couldn't reach her.

704
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,690
Man. How about Minjung?

705
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,220
He's on his way.

706
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,310
Oh, no.

707
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,420
Did you see a stroller here by any chance?

708
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,750
It's a pink stroller.

709
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,090
A stroller?

710
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,820
I didn't see any.

711
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,340
- Mom!
- Mom.

712
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,920
I can't do this. I can't.

713
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,420
Mother.

714
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,340
- Minjung. 
- Mother.

715
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,150
Oh, Minjung, what do I do?

716
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,020
What do I do?
I'm so sorry.

717
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,020
I can't remember.

718
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,650
I can't remember where I left him.

719
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,790
I should just die. I should die.

720
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,650
Don't do this, mom.

721
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,450
Stop this.

722
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,210
Mother, stop this.

723
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,590
Mother!

724
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,290
- Mom!
- Stop this.

725
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,610
Honey.

726
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,840
What do I do?

727
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,550
I'm home.

728
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,090
Oh, man!
Something awful happened.

729
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,720
We lost Jungji.

730
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,150
What?

731
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,110
What happened?
How did this happen?

732
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,540
How could you lose my baby?

733
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,620
Be quiet.

734
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,690
We reported it at the police station.

735
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,420
Mom, are you crazy?

736
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

737
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,590
What do I do?

738
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,820
It's cold...
Where did he go...

739
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,250
What if something happened to him?

740
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,690
Oh, Jungji...
My baby...

741
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,820
Why did you take him out?

742
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,790
When you're so forgetful?

743
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,290
What if something bad happened to him?

744
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,710
That's enough. 
Mother's a mess.

745
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,020
How can I stop it?

746
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,610
I paid you!

747
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,190
How can you let this happen after I paid you?

748
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,790
Subak, stop it.
Mom's not well.

749
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,420
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

750
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,880
Look at what happened.

751
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,190
What if we never find him?

752
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,950
Mom, what will you do?

753
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:11,110
How could you lose my baby?

754
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,190
I'm not letting you get away with this!

755
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,290
She's your mom.

756
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,480
Can't you see she's out of her mind?

757
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,580
Can't you see she was worried sick all day?

758
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,050
Just look at her right now.

759
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,150
She's shaking like a leaf right now!

760
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,150
How dare you say such a thing?

761
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,520
After being gone all day!

762
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,690
Take your kids and get out of my house!

763
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,610
You're going to kill my wife.

764
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,710
She gets aches and pains at night.

765
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,180
She can't even sleep because of your kids.

766
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,790
And this is how you treat her?

767
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,820
I'm not putting up with this anymore!

768
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:57,490
Get out of my house.

769
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,490
I don't need any of you.

770
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:07,550
The most important person to me is your mom.

771
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,840
Subak!

772
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,080
Take your family and get out!

773
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,890
Fine! I will!

774
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:17,380
We'll leave!

775
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,250
What?

776
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,520
Come here.

777
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,290
Let go!

778
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,210
Why do you always do this to me?

779
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:31,610
You've always hated me and yelled at me.

780
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,710
You yelled at mom for favoring me,

781
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,520
but you were always on Hobak's side.

782
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,320
You weren't happy with anything I did.

783
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,750
You never said anything nice to me.

784
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,320
Stop. This is no time for that.

785
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:54,750
Hello?

786
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,190
What?

787
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,980
Someone just called me. My baby.

788
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,210
Over there.

789
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,710
Jungji!

790
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,750
Jungji.

791
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,080
My baby!

792
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,650
Let me hold you, my baby!

793
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,110
You saved me, you saved me.

794
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,290
Oh, my baby!

795
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,920
Where have you been?

796
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,990
Oh, thank you, god!

797
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,680
Oh, my baby...

798
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,920
My baby...

799
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,690
Maybe this house is cursed.

800
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,920
Not a day goes by quietly.

801
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,880
I'm just glad we found him.

802
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,150
What if we lost him for good?

803
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,950
Or, it's horrible just to even think about it.

804
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,440
Hobak,

805
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,440
about Goof-off...

806
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:09,640
Stop.

807
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,220
I feel sorry for the guy.

808
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,540
He asked me to talk to you.

809
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,520
Uncle.

810
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,710
I know how you feel.

811
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,180
You can't know unless you experience it.

812
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,880
So don't say you know how I feel.

813
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,620
Just look the other way.

814
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,920
Stop telling me how he's doing.

815
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:35,110
If you can understand just a fraction of how I feel, don't say anything.

816
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:38,480
You two are friends, so you can see him.

817
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,340
But,

818
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:42,250
don't talk about him to me.

819
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,110
You should resign.

820
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,990
What?

821
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,580
You need to quit your job.

822
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,320
I can't.

823
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:58,620
Why not?

824
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,840
You don't know why?

825
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:05,310
I don't know why you have to keep working.

826
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:09,150
Especially after what happened today.

827
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,250
I don't get it.

828
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,150
I'm doing it to make money, not to party.

829
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,290
If you could make enough money,

830
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,610
I wouldn't bother working.

831
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,610
So stay home.

832
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,440
What's wrong with you?

833
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:23,250
Hobak goes to work when she has two kids.

834
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,620
She went to work when her boys were hospitalized.

835
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,380
And now she's a manager.

836
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,290
But that's Hobak.

837
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,340
Why?

838
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,810
You don't think I can do what Hobak does?

839
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:38,220
Why are you asking me to quit my job?

840
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,290
Did Hobak put you up to this?

841
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,610
Just do what I say.

842
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:46,150
I want to protect our family.

843
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,420
For our kids,

844
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,490
just do what I say.

845
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:53,840
Don't get mad at mother for losing Jungji.

846
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,080
You stay home and raise the kids.

847
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,110
If you want to work, 
do it after Jungji's grown up.

848
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,190
Are you crazy?

849
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,340
Fine. Let's say I'm crazy.

850
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:05,040
So do what I say before I go totally crazy!

851
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,990
Quit your job right now!

852
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,580
Oh, my...

853
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,190
Why are you screaming?

854
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,210
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo...

855
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:39,380
Try this.

856
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:41,420
You like red bean cake.

857
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,790
I don't want to eat.

858
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,750
But you'll die.

859
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,920
You won't eat any porridge.

860
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,220
It's hot. It's really good.

861
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,310
Try it. Hurry.

862
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:04,440
You're the only one who cares about me.

863
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:12,290
Subak won't even come down to check on me when I'm this sick.

864
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,050
They say a husband is better to you

865
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,550
than 100 children put together.

866
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,920
Even if he's old and sick.

867
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:21,020
And now I understand why.

868
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:24,980
Without you, I'm nothing.

869
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:27,750
I'm so mad.

870
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,340
I was so good to her.

871
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,920
Don't think about that.

872
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,950
Kids are useless.

873
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,210
So let's take care of each other.

874
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,790
Eat this and get better.

875
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:48,250
It's good.
You have some, too.

876
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,650
Okay.

877
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,790
I pity those who are old and single.

878
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,940
So be nice to mother.

879
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:05,610
You always talk about your mother.

880
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:10,080
What is it?

881
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,220
Where are you?

882
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,520
I'm getting some tangerines.

883
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:13,920
Hurry up and go home!

884
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,090
What if she puts our stuff outside?

885
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,350
She went to her parents house.

886
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,190
Mom, I'm hanging up.

887
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,920
Hello, I'm Wang Don.

888
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:32,850
- Let's go in.
- Yes, let's go inside.

889
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,750
You're more handsome than I thought.

890
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,020
And you look kind.

891
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:56,480
Thank you.

892
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,940
You're in the same pizza class with my friend?

893
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,310
Yes.

894
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:03,550
I came because she kept pushing me to,

895
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,020
but I'm not used to dating.

896
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,250
I don't really know how to...

897
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,210
Then would you follow my lead?

898
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,410
We're not in our twenties,

899
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,650
so let's go get a drink and talk some more.

900
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,790
Sure.

901
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,050
Huh?

902
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,710
What are you doing?

903
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,920
Why are you here?

904
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,420
How could you do this?

905
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,750
How could you do this to me?

906
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,250
What?

907
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,340
What am I doing to you?

908
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:42,650
Who is she?

909
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,250
- She's nobody.
- I am.

910
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,420
his wife.

911
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,110
Hey!

912
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,940
This is wrong!

913
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:52,040
She's not my wife.

914
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,290
She's my friend's little sister.

915
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,320
I am his friend's little sister.

916
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:56,920
And I married him.

917
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,990
When did that happen?
This is nuts!

918
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,790
Honey,

919
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,050
this is wrong.

920
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:07,790
How can you cheat on me like this?

921
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,980
Let's go home. Our kids are waiting.

922
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:14,540
What kids?

923
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,350
Our twins are crying so hard.

924
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:20,080
Apologize to this woman.

925
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,150
Don't you feel badly for her?

926
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,250
I'm very sorry.

927
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,480
Let me apologize for my husband.

928
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:30,210
Honey,

929
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:33,080
it's okay to break my heart.

930
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,990
But what are you doing to her?

931
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,440
Why are you doing this?

932
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:44,750
She's not my wife.

933
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,020
Honey!

934
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,590
What a creep!

935
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:53,750
Goodbye.

936
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,720
What are you doing?

937
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,410
Are you mad?

938
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,310
No, I'm not mad.

939
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:08,610
Don't ever show your face in front of me,

940
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,290
and don't ever see my brother again.

941
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:16,650
That night was the most awful day of my life.

942
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,750
I can't believe what happened.

943
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:30,790
You,

944
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,650
you weren't so good that night.

945
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,880
Loser,

946
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:03,920
you weren't so good that night.

947
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,340
What was that?

948
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,750
It's cold.
It's probably just the wind.

949
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,690
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo!

950
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,210
Where were you?
Where?

951
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,520
Why?

952
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:36,080
She changed the code.

953
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,290
She did?

954
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:49,410
Hobak, open the door!

955
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:54,450
Hobak, it's freezing.
Please open the door!

956
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:57,080
Hobak, Hobak!

957
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,490
Promise to move out this week!

958
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:04,310
I promise.
We'll move out this week.

959
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:14,110
You're so mean.
How could you lock us out?

960
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,580
You promised.

961
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,190
Move out by the end of this week.

962
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,580
Why you little!

963
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,920
If you don't, I'm throwing your stuff out.

964
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,420
Fine.

965
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:29,990
If you want us out, we'll have to.

966
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,380
I told you not to leave the apartment.

967
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,520
I didn't know she'd do this.

968
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,380
Maybe mother lost her appetite.

969
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,920
You should just go to work.

970
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:42,840
Can you make something...

971
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:45,580
Enough. I'll take care of her.

972
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,650
Mother!

973
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,020
I'm old, too.

974
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,320
Doing this is hard on me.

975
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:02,820
Forget it. I'm not eating.

976
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:05,320
You said the older you are, the more you must eat.

977
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:07,450
I don't want to eat.

978
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,480
I should just die.
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

979
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,520
What bothered you this time?

980
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:14,550
I won't know unless you tell me.

981
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:19,220
Tell Bong to buy me a burial plot.

982
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,580
Who buys burial plots these days?

983
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,720
Kids don't take care of their parents graves.

984
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,610
Can bong do it?
Can Don do it?

985
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,210
Kinds are useless.

986
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,710
I know.

987
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,610
You should take care of yourself.

988
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,690
Relying on your kids will end up killing you.

989
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,220
I was sick last night,

990
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,110
but nobody brought me even a glass of water.

991
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,210
But your husband brought you red bean cake!

992
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:49,980
That cake gave me indigestion.

993
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:54,380
I got punished for not sharing it with you.

994
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:27,620
Where to?

995
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,220
Anywhere. Just go straight.

996
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,550
Hello. Do you need a prescription filled?

997
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,290
Hold on.

998
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,110
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

999
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,880
Well, that...

1000
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,020
What would you like?

1001
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,480
That...

1002
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,750
That?

1003
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,520
Oh!

1004
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:03,550
1, condoms,

1005
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,750
2, birth control pills, 3, pregnancy test.

1006
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,880
3! 3! I want number 3.

1007
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,520
Here it is.

1008
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,420
How did you know?

1009
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:16,290
When women your age come here looking nervous,

1010
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,110
it's because they're looking for one of them.

1011
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:21,110
Stop it.

1012
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,810
Water canon!

1013
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:26,920
Shoot!

1014
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:27,950
It broke.

1015
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:35,320
Please, please.

1016
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,920
Are you still accepting applications?

1017
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,380
Have you made up your mind?

1018
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,180
You can't take this lightly.

1019
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,690
I'm ready.

1020
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,340
When are we leaving?

1021
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,290
Thank you.

1022
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,380
See you again.

1023
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,990
Hello?

1024
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,940
Mom.

1025
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,080
Yes, Sedal.

1026
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,950
How's the sauna?

1027
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,380
Mom, I'm leaving.

1028
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:46,810
What? Where to?

1029
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:48,820
Where are you going?

1030
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,590
I'm going to become a fisherman.

1031
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,720
I'll come back when I'm rich.

1032
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,980
Mom, don't get sick. Take care.

1033
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:59,380
And don't worry about me.

1034
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:03,440
Sedal, Sedal, no!
Don't go! Don't go!

1035
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:07,040
Hello? Sedal! Sedal!

1036
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,750
Oh, Sedal, Sedal...

1037
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,380
I have to go make rounds.

1038
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,750
See you later, manager.

1039
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,610
How could you do this?

1040
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,750
How could you do this to Sedal?

1041
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:38,410
This is my workplace.

1042
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:42,050
You kicked my son out and you're happy?

1043
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,290
You can't do this.

1044
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,920
I never kicked him out.

1045
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:46,990
He walked out on me.

1046
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:49,250
But you didn't take him back!

1047
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,250
Would you have if you were me?

1048
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,820
You're too young to understand.

1049
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:56,550
Kids need both parents.

1050
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,790
You know what that does to you?

1051
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,320
A cheating, gambling husband

1052
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:03,890
is better than a dead husband.

1053
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,750
I don't want to hear that.
Go home.

1054
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,380
Sedal's going to become an ice fisherman.

1055
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:12,480
Why do you think he's doing that?

1056
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,520
He's never even been on a ship.

1057
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:17,440
He's sick and tired of life,

1058
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:19,340
and he turned to that.

1059
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:22,190
What if something bad happens to him?

1060
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:27,020
Good for him.

1061
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:32,480
He can't stay unemployed and expect to get $3 a day in allowance.

1062
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,190
He doesn't even have a wife anymore.

1063
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,950
Let him catch shrimp or whales.

1064
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:39,380
He has to make money now.

1065
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,440
I'm busy.

1066
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:42,640
God will punish you!

1067
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,020
Fine.

1068
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,480
Oh, man...

1069
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,320
It's been a long time.

1071
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,110
We can't meet like this anymore.

1072
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,190
We can't?

1073
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,990
Be good to mother!

1074
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:17,140
My mother's more important!
Understand?

1075
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,650
I'm pregnant.

1076
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,020
What did you just say?

1077
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,550
We're not husband and wife.

1078
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,720
He's never been on a ship before.

1079
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,980
How am I going to live now?

1080
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:29,250
You don't deserve forgiveness.

1081
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,320
Let her go!

1082
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,590
Father!

1083
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,720
Get out of my house!

1084
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,380
I'm not seeing a man!

1085
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:35,790
Are you crazy?

1086
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,610
Whatever you were doing,

1087
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,540
stop it right now.
