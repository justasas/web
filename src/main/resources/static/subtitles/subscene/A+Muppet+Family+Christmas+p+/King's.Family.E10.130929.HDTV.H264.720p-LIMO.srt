00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,120
Who is it? 

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,440
It's me. 

4
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,240
Oh, father. 

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,470
- Did the moving go well?
- Yes. 

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,210
I finished late at the Office of Education,
so I hurried over. 

7
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,180
Im late, huh? 

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,180
You didn't have to. 

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,810
Come in, father. 

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,070
Is everyone gone?
They're in such a rush! 

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,990
It's a nice apartment. Roomy. 

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,460
Where's Sedal? 

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,270
He's on a business trip. 

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,650
I haven't unpacked yet.
I'll give you a tour. 

15
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,330
This is the master bedroom. 

16
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,160
It's nice and roomy. 

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,810
There's a bathroom. 

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,980
Nice. Why didn't you get a bed? 

19
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,860
Later. I can buy other things used, 

20
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,800
but the bed, I want to buy a new one. 

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Okay. 

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,960
- I'll show you the boys' rooms.
- Okay. 

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,430
Nice job on moving. 

24
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,770
And nice job on buying this apartment. 

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,290
Buy something with this.
It's not much. 

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,960
Since it's from you, I'll take it. 

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,900
I need a clock so I'll get one with this. 

28
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,320
I'm not sure if that's enough. 

29
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,880
If it's not, bill me. 

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,060
I'll get a real expensive one and bill you. 

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,680
Have a seat. 

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,110
No, I should go home. 

33
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,110
It's nice and roomy. 

34
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,290
And the wallpapers look new. 

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,850
Was it Sedal? 

36
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,560
Yes. 

37
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,060
You can enjoy a decent life now. 

38
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,280
What's wrong?
Were you crying? 

39
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,670
I'm so happy that I cried. 

40
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,880
What did your mom say?
Wasn't she happy? 

41
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,020
Father, I'll throw a real housewarming party. 

42
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,750
Please come back then. 

43
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,100
You had one already so it's okay. 

44
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,370
I'm going, okay?
Go to bed. 

45
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,700
What's that? 

46
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,520
It's nothing, father? 

47
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,580
What is it? 

48
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,520
Why did you throw all the food away? 

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,700
[Name: Wang Subak] 

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,830
Hello? 

51
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,990
It's me. 

52
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,250
It's me, too. 

53
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,290
Why are you calling at this hour? 

54
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,550
You didn't call to hear my voice, 

55
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,260
and mother is at the senior citizen's center. 

56
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,680
What else do you want to know? 

57
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,280
Let's have lunch together. 

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,490
Lunch? 

59
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,730
You've been worried about Subak so much,
so come out and take a break. 

60
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,730
I can't afford to do that. 

61
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,420
I have to make lunch for mother. 

62
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,700
She can skip lunch once. 

63
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,040
I can't believe my ears. 

64
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,240
If she did, the Korean War would mean nothing. 

65
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,110
She's having lunch at the center. 

66
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,480
She is? 

67
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,520
Okay. Where should I see you? 

68
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,310
- Hello.
- Hi. 

69
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,300
- Your reservation is under?
- Wang Bong. 

70
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,940
Yes, this way. 

71
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,980
Mom. 

72
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,970
I called her to join us since she moved. 

73
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,130
Come in. 

74
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,140
Did your moving go well? 

75
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,170
Yes. 

76
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,650
I couldn't go because I was aching all over. 

77
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,210
I'm glad it went well. 

78
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,590
Where should I sit? 

79
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,530
Next to your husband, of course. 

80
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,440
Hobak, you sit there. 

81
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,360
It's not that good.
But expensive. 

82
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,700
But you ate it all. 

83
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,630
Why am I the only one drinking? 

84
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,300
I have to go back to school. 

85
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,270
Hobak, have some. 

86
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,640
Since we're done eating and since we're all together... 

87
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,540
I already know. 

88
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,380
When you only called us over,
it means you want us to get it out. 

89
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,380
Not get it out. 

90
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,950
Talk things out. 

91
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,950
You should be able to work things out. 

92
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,460
There's nothing to work out. 

93
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,630
I'll take a stroll so talk to each other. 

94
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,900
Hobak, tell her everything you want to say. 

95
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,390
Did you ask your father for this? 

96
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,660
No. 

97
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,510
I didn't know. 

98
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,760
He just asked me to lunch. 

99
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,650
It doesn't matter if you knew. 

100
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,770
Since we're here, say what you will. 

101
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,100
Go ahead. 

102
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,870
On the day I moved, 

103
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,590
I was sad because you didn't come. 

104
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,750
There's nothing to feel sad about. 

105
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,750
Talking about feeling sad, 

106
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,380
I could talk about it for 3 straight days. 

107
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,610
I know. 

108
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,910
Like you said, I never bought you anything, 

109
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,650
and I never gave you any allowance. 

110
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,110
And I disappointed you when I got married. 

111
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,330
I'm glad you know. 

112
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,160
I know I made some mistakes, 

113
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,100
but still, mom, 

114
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,370
you only loved Subak, 

115
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,590
and that really breaks my heart. 

116
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,060
You always compared me to her, told me I'm not even half as good to you as her. 

117
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,480
But you really are not good to me. 

118
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,120
Is that why you beat me? 

119
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,720
Why did you beat me? 

120
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
When did I ever beat you? 

121
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,590
You beat me whenever you got mad. 

122
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,650
You beat me until the day I got married. 

123
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,160
You grabbed me by my hair,  

124
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,370
dragged me around, 

125
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,940
pushed me against the wall, spun me. 

126
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,850
You beat me with whatever was in your hand, 

127
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,460
be it a frying pan or broom. 

128
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,270
If I'd deserved it, 
I wouldn't have been so upset. 

129
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,440
Now that I have my own kids, I understand. 

130
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,350
3 years ago, Sintong fought with a kid at his kindergarten, so I spanked him. 

131
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,350
It broke my heart. 

132
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,820
I cried so hard. 

133
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,750
I could never hit him again. 

134
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,670
That's how moms are. 

135
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,660
Didn't it hurt you when you beat me up like that? 

136
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,260
What's wrong with you? 

137
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,610
I don't remember any of that! 

138
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,250
You don't? 

139
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,380
How can you not remember? 

140
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,820
Shut up. 

141
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,740
I can't believe you'd make up such things. 

142
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,220
Get up. Let's go. 

143
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,860
Mom. 

144
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,930
What's wrong with you? 

145
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,830
Tell me one thing before leaving. 

146
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,360
Tell me you're sorry before you go. 

147
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,280
What? 

148
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,590
Tell me you're sorry, that's all I want. 

149
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,990
That you're sorry for beating me. 

150
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,180
Say you're sorry for mistreating me. 

151
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,780
I slaved away raising you and this is what I get. 

152
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,480
You treated me like I was a nuisance. 

153
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:29,920
When Subak played with dolls, I was in the kitchen doing the dishes. 

154
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,430
She always had new clothes while I only got hand me downs. 

155
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,850
You always loved Subak more than me, 

156
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,500
and even now, you still do that. 

157
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,440
Did you know that I thought you were my stepmom? 

158
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,720
You think I don't have anything to say? 

159
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,890
I was abused because of you by your grandma. 

160
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,880
Because I had two girls in a row. 

161
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,970
Do you know how difficult she made my life? 

162
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,580
How can you say that? 

163
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,540
How can a mom say that to her daughter? 

164
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,830
Why can't I? 

165
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,280
Fine. 

166
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,940
Let's talk about it then. 

167
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,880
You say I don't love you like I love Subak, 

168
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
but you should think about it. 

169
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,270
She's married but she always took care of  the family, so of course I love her more. 

170
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,020
And think about what happened to her. 

171
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,650
She's bankrupt and you bought an apartment! 

172
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,370
It's like having a party next to a funeral, 

173
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,360
and having a barbecue next to a burning house. 

174
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,620
You're heartless. 

175
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,760
I'm disgusted with what you did. 

176
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,090
I did go to the bank after we met. 

177
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,410
I cleaned out my account to help Subak. 

178
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,810
But when I heard someone call my boys beggars, I lost it. 

179
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,750
I couldn't give the money to her. 

180
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,350
So I decided to buy an apartment. 

181
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,350
Was that so wrong? 

182
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,170
What's going on? 

183
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,340
Everything's fine. 

184
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,710
Do you know what my dream was? 

185
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,570
You never had a dream. 

186
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,340
I wanted to become an announcer. 

187
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,870
Everyone knew, but you didn't, did you? 

188
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,540
You try taking care of your mother in law and raise several kids at the same time. 

189
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,570
You wouldn't be able to remember anything. 

190
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,840
I had to quit college because of Subak. 

191
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,610
If only I had gotten my degree... 

192
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,200
There's no guarantee you would've made it. 

193
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,470
But you're doing fine right now. 

194
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,930
Why are you bringing ancient history back? 

195
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,830
You're getting old, too, 

196
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,600
so what's the use of talking about how I abused you? 

197
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,860
I'm not trying to make use of it. 

198
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,120
I want us to be on good terms, 

199
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,110
like how other moms and daughters are. 

200
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,450
No, 

201
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,980
like Subak and you, 

202
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,980
I want to go to the sauna with you, 

203
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,700
and go to a nice restaurant with you. 

204
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,320
You say you get angry when you see me. 

205
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,000
I wonder if you ever loved me! 

206
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,590
You're totally crazy. 

207
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,970
I raised you because I loved you. 

208
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,690
You're married and have two kids, 

209
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,670
so how can you ask such a thing? 

210
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,220
And you call yourself human? 

211
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,270
Let's pretend I did those things. 

212
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,240
But why would you bring that up now? 

213
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,980
At a restaurant of all places? 

214
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,760
This is the thanks I get for raising you? 

215
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,950
Let's go. 

216
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,310
Don't just sit there and take it. 

217
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,310
I agree. 

218
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,430
Not you. Hobak. 

219
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,200
Wait for me outside. 

220
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,080
I can't believe she attacked me like that. 

221
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,000
Why in the world did you invite her? 

222
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,920
Why didn't you go to Hobak's new place? 

223
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,820
I said I was sick. 

224
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,180
Would you have done that to Subak? 

225
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,380
That's why she acted like that. 

226
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,950
You were so harsh on her when she was a kid, 

227
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,220
so try to be warm to her from now on. 

228
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,220
Don't break her heart anymore. 

229
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,780
Love flows from top to bottom. 

230
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,690
Reach out to her first.
She's your child. 

231
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,770
I was outside listening, and I couldn't stand it. 

232
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,590
You go and teach your students instead of trying to teach me. 

233
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,750
I feel sorry for those married to teachers. 

234
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,790
I know a woman whose son's wife is a teacher, 

235
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,660
and she acts like she's a teacher at home, 

236
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,670
treating her mother in law like a student. 

237
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,270
That's because she deserves it. 

238
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,270
Did you two plan on this? 

239
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,850
I can't believe what just happened to me. 

240
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,750
Hobak is your own daughter. 

241
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,150
Put yourself in her shoes. 

242
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,150
Pretend you're Hobak. 

243
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,000
I'd feel the same even if I did. 

244
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,740
If I were Hobak, I'd be thinking, 

245
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,290
oh, my mom's upset because of me. 

246
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,780
I wouldn't flip out like that. 

247
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:40,880
Don't you feel proud about how far she came from that basement efficiency? 

248
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,190
Even strangers would congratulate her! 

249
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,090
Is Subak your only child? 

250
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,780
She ordered Chinese and waited for you. 

251
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,080
Imagine how she felt when she had to put all that food in the trash. 

252
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,020
She never spends money on herself. 

253
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,070
She'd skip meals just to save money. 

254
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,300
How would she have felt? 

255
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,880
You understand your daughter very well, 
so why can't you understand me? 

256
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,210
Try to think about how I feel! 

257
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,930
You don't understand your own daughter, 

258
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,020
and you expect me to understand you? 

259
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,270
We're not the ones related by blood here. 

260
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,450
Think about what you did, 

261
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,450
if you don't want to lose her forever. 

262
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,840
Come with me. 

263
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,380
The address is right, but that's not ours. 

264
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,280
I'm sorry. 

265
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,810
Parcel service. 

266
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,830
Oh, yes. 

267
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,570
Nobody was home, so I left it with No. 502. 

268
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,880
How can you leave it with No. 502? 

269
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,100
We hate each other. 

270
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,030
Excuse me? 

271
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,030
We don't even talk! 

272
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,030
You have to get it back! 

273
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,720
It's right next door. 

274
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,070
Hello? Sir? 

275
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,710
Parcel service. 

276
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,580
I've been looking for your house for an hour. 

277
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,130
It's the right address. 

278
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,130
Excuse me? 

279
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,990
You moved yesterday? 

280
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,260
Please bring them here. 

281
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,260
It's one town over. 

282
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,660
It'll only take 10 minutes. 

283
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,840
Well, that's not my area. 

284
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Who cares? It's the next town. 

285
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,470
You have to bring them now. 

286
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,380
Hello. 

287
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,500
Oh? 

288
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,050
Mr. Wang! 

289
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,940
Hello. 

290
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,700
Can I use this place for a short while? 

291
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,830
Of course. 

292
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,160
I sent everyone away just for you. 

293
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Nobody will be here. 

294
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,850
Say hi. She's my daughter. 

295
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,050
Hello. I'm Ho Namhyeong. I was his student. 

296
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,290
Hi. 

297
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,230
He's the coach here, 

298
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,150
and he's a few years younger than you. 

299
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,800
I hope you have fun. 

300
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,020
Let's go. 

301
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,920
Put these on. 

302
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,990
Go ahead. 

303
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,350
Why... 

304
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,600
You should learn to blow off some steam. 

305
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,260
Don't hold it all inside. 

306
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,450
You'll get sick if you do. 

307
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,620
With your husband and with your mom. 

308
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,660
If you need to argue with them, do so. 

309
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,360
If you want to yell at them, do so. 

310
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,360
You can't do it at them, 

311
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,400
but swearing at the punching bag  

312
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,510
and beating it senseless will make you feel better. 

313
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,280
People talk about "healing" all the time,
so I'm calling it "the swear healing." 

314
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,310
Punch it. 

315
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,530
Father... 

316
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,620
It can be anyone, 

317
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,540
anyone you hate or who broke your heart. 

318
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,760
I'm giving you permission, so it's okay. 

319
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,570
Do whatever you want. 

320
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,260
Why did you? 

321
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,090
Why did you treat me like that? 

322
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,820
I want to be love by you, mom. 

323
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,470
I want to be appreciated. 

324
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,130
So why do you hate me? 

325
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,730
Why couldn't you say you're sorry? 

326
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,620
Why couldn't you say you love me? 

327
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,140
Mom... 

328
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:48,150
Mom... Mom... 

329
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,540
Let's meet at the cafe. 

330
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,440
I'm only going to wait 10 minutes. 

331
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,800
Brush your teeth first. 

332
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,730
You have bad breath, according to Daebak. 

333
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,240
I don't believe my eyes. 

334
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,920
I gave you 10 minutes. 

335
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,320
Putting that on took 30 minutes? 

336
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,630
I got an urgent call. 

337
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,780
You must be a busy man. 

338
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,130
You're very feisty today. 

339
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:55,550
I thought I should see you before I went on my business trip. 

340
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,190
You're going on a business trip? 

341
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,790
Tell me if you need anything. 

342
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,710
A present? 

343
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,240
Can it be an expensive thing? 

344
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,360
Of course. 

345
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,840
Sunblock. It's cheaper at duty free shops, right? 

346
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,050
What brand? 

347
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,500
It doesn't matter. 

348
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,900
I don't care about brands, only men. 

349
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,690
Shh, what would you like? 

350
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,200
Anything... 

351
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,840
Making a man want to kiss. 

352
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,540
Want to kiss? 

353
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,270
How? 

354
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,330
When you order something at a cafe, 

355
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,890
stock your lips out and say hot chocolate. 

356
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,600
Anything? 

357
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,960
No, 

358
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,760
hot chocolate. 

359
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,270
We're out of hot chocolate. 

360
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,910
Oh, you are? 

361
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,080
Then I want a cappuccino. 

362
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,270
You shouldn't... 

363
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,370
- Two of those.
- Okay. 

364
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,150
On your lips, 

365
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,780
get milk foam. Like this. 

366
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,460
It's from China. Excuse me. 

367
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,010
I'm sorry. It's work... 

368
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,880
It's okay. 

369
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,520
This is Choi Sangnam. 

370
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,850
Oh, okay. 

371
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:16,740
Men get excited when they see collarbones. 

372
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,820
Okay, Gwangbak. 

373
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,820
Don't be too discouraged. 

374
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,100
I'll teach you again. 

375
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,030
The spinster student? 

376
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,110
Yes. 

377
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,920
How far did she go? 

378
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,220
Physical contact. 

379
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,940
You're teaching about physical contact? 

380
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,210
She doesn't know anything. 

381
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,880
Is something wrong with her? 

382
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
You're only in 4th grade. 

383
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,530
She thinks she's smart, but she's really bad at this. 

384
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,480
She failed again today. 

385
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,290
Hot chocolate. Is this so hard? 

386
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,260
What? What did you teach her? 

387
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,260
Hot chocolate. 

388
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,480
And getting foam on the lips? 

389
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,080
How did you know? 

390
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,960
Did you read this, too? 

391
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,100
The name of your spinster student is... 

392
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,850
Gwangbak. Wang Gwangbak. 

393
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,970
She's Daebak's sister. 

394
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,490
Well, Miho, 

395
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,840
you didn't tell her about us, did you? 

396
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,950
No. 

397
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,950
Don't tell Daebak, either. 

398
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,450
I don't like telling others about our family. 

399
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,480
I know. I don't either. 

400
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,140
Let's order something cheap. 

401
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,910
Your husband must be having a hard time. 

402
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:03,040
Hand over the money and the book. 

403
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,990
It's better to be safe than sorry. 

404
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,220
I'm home. 

405
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,700
This is why we're getting roaches. 

406
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,470
I told you, this isn't temporary. 

407
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,700
This is bad for you, so you should cook... 

408
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,150
Leave me alone, please! 

409
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,850
I'm sick and tired of it. 

410
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,850
Stop saying that! 

411
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,160
What's wrong with getting take outs? 

412
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,920
I already know it's bad for you! 

413
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,640
It can't get any worse than this! 

414
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,270
What's the point of staying healthy when you have to live like this? 

415
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,640
What's that? 

416
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,860
It's for you. 

417
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,210
Me? 

418
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,410
It's here! Yes! 

419
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,360
What's this? 

420
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,740
Can't you tell?
It's a baby stroller. 

421
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,970
I can tell, but where did you get it? 

422
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,080
I bought it of course. 

423
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
Where did you get the money? 

424
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,560
But they said it would take months! 

425
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,470
It's so pretty. Oh, my! 

426
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,490
How much was it? 

427
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,210
Subak. 

428
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,730
What? 

429
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,220
How much was this? 

430
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,970
It wasn't much. It was cheap. 

431
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,050
How cheap? 

432
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,070
$3,000. 

433
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,570
$3,000? 

434
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,100
They have ones that are far more expensive. 

435
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,890
This is on the cheap side. 

436
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,520
But we can't afford... 

437
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,800
When did you buy this? 

438
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,600
- A long time ago.
- When? 

439
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,670
I ordered it right after I had Jungji. 

440
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,920
Don't lie. 

441
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,910
The address is here. 

442
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,820
Where did you get the money? 

443
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,960
I got a loan. 

444
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,400
- From where?
- A private loan company. 

445
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,700
You went into debt to buy a baby stroller? 

446
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,870
A baby stroller that is $3,000? 

447
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,410
Who cares?
It's for our baby. 

448
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,750
It'll be her first car. 

449
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,210
We have Aeji's old stroller. 

450
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,660
Are you crazy? That was ages ago! 

451
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,390
Can't you understand? 

452
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,500
It's just like why men want import cars. 

453
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,620
You don't want this for her? 

454
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,260
It's not that... 

455
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,660
I'm out of words. 

456
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,130
I can't spend a measly $3,000? 

457
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,530
I was in the Miss Korea pageant! 

458
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,670
What does that have to do with a stroller? 

459
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,050
And what's this? 

460
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,360
I'm sending Aeji to an English academy. 

461
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,650
Everyone at her kindergarten goes. 

462
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,530
It doesn't have to be this expensive. 

463
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,970
You don't want her to get an education? 

464
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,420
Just look at us. 

465
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,820
How can we afford thousands of dollars? 

466
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,160
We have to invest in their education,
so they don't end up like us. 

467
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,770
Move Aeji to a cheaper kindergarten. 

468
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,420
What? 

469
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,010
I've been meaning to tell you that. 

470
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,780
We can't afford that kindergarten. 

471
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,180
What are you trying to do to our girls? 

472
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,480
I don't go shopping anymore. 

473
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,670
I don't even buy clothes. 

474
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,550
And I can't do that for our girls? 

475
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,730
And you're calling yourself their dad? 

476
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,260
Not being able to afford those things means I'm a bad dad? 

477
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,040
Of course it means that. 

478
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,620
You should be able to keep up with others! 

479
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,640
Subak, 

480
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,400
do you know how much I make a day? 

481
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,750
Even if I run around all day, 

482
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,430
until my heart's about to explode, 

483
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,750
I make less than $2,000 a month. 

484
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:41,790
I deliver a sack of rice or corn and make 80 cents. 80 cents. 

485
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,720
I don't have time for lunch,
so I eat a rice roll in the truck, 

486
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,710
and I can't even go to the bathroom. 

487
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,340
I have stomach, back and joint problems, 

488
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,430
and they keep me up at night.
Did you know? 

489
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:08,210
And did you know how hard it is to deal with difficult customers? 

490
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,910
So? What? What? 

491
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,410
Of course I want to provide for the girls. 

492
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,080
But I can't afford it. 

493
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,080
I just can't afford it... 

494
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,820
Subak, let's try harder. 

495
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,830
When I make more money, I'll make it up. 

496
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,050
I'll make up for everything. 

497
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,930
Let's return this. 

498
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,830
Are you crazy? 

499
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,480
Yes, I'm at the verge of going crazy. 

500
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,140
What are you doing? 

501
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,420
Don't mess with me. 

502
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,970
This is the only thing I want. 

503
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,060
Even if we live in a place like this, 

504
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:56,370
I want my baby to have the best stroller! 

505
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,190
Who's that? 

506
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,550
Hey! 

507
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,420
Welcome. 

508
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,920
Excuse me! 

509
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,080
Oh, this is so pretty. 

510
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,570
What brand is this? 

511
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,020
It's an imported brand. 

512
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,340
Oh, it's good. 

513
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,090
You sure can cook, Sunjeong. 

514
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,730
I can't eat out because of your cooking. 

515
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,100
Eat up. I made plenty. 

516
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,810
You should be getting a daughter in law. 

517
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,200
You're not going to let Sangnam get married? 

518
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,970
It's not me. He doesn't want to yet. 

519
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,970
People in our business should settle down. 

520
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,740
I don't think he's found the right girl yet. 

521
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,480
What happened to that girl from before? 

522
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,570
They broke up a long time ago. 

523
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,360
Can you find someone nice for him? 

524
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,240
I don't know any girls, just men. 

525
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,040
Oh, there is one! 

526
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,160
- There is?
- There is? 

527
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,890
- Who?
- What kind of girl is she? 

528
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:14,320
Why didn't I think of her earlier? 

529
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,200
I think they'll be a great match. 

530
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,070
I'm very curious. 

531
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,200
Yes, father. 

532
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,540
Have a nice trip to China. 

533
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,030
I'll have a present for you ready. 

534
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,500
I don't say no. 

535
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,560
But you don't know what it is. 

536
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,930
It's obvious. 

537
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,830
What I love the most, a woman? 

538
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,390
You sure are my own blood. 

539
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,510
Have a nice trip. 

540
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,760
He said yes. 

541
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,400
They should meet first. 

542
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,920
I'm sure she's great, since you're recommending her. 

543
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,410
I hope things work out. 

544
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,530
What are you doing here? 

545
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,530
Did you come to see me off? 

546
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,530
Correct. 

547
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,820
I've been waiting here for an hour. 

548
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,000
Incredible. I'm touched. 

549
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,760
I was aiming for that. 

550
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,240
But I have to go right now, actually. 

551
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,210
I've seen you, so it's okay. 

552
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:26,530
Come back without a scratch. 

553
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,810
Go. 

554
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,020
Bye. 

555
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,960
Would you like to do homework at my house? 

556
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,790
Your girlfriend gave me a warning. 

557
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,370
She's not my girlfriend.
Not even close. 

558
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,260
I've been tutoring her. 

559
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,260
You've been tutoring her? 

560
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,530
Incredible. 

561
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,260
Why are you here? 

562
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,650
I came to take you home. 

563
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,240
Did you forget about the yellow card? 

564
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:09,370
I'm warning you again.
Don't flirt with him. 

565
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,160
He's mine. 

566
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,170
But you're just a little girl! 

567
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,620
I may be little, but I'm taking care of him. 

568
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:20,310
I'm checking up on his studies, babysitting his nieces, 

569
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,510
and teaching his sister dating tricks. 

570
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,490
Can you do all that? 

571
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:27,600
If you can, I'll let you have him. 

572
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,080
How can I do all that? 

573
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,090
Daebak, did you hear that? 

574
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,150
Let's go. 

575
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,100
Uh, okay... 

576
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,670
- Please sign here.
- Okay. 

577
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,150
You seem to use the parcel service often. 

578
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,250
Yes, I like online shopping. 

579
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,790
I see. Thank you for using the service. 

580
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,790
Would you like something cool to drink? 

581
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,230
It's okay. Thank you. 

582
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,080
What's wrong with that woman? 

583
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,270
She was the first one in. 

584
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,280
What time is it? 

585
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,880
It's 2 o'clock. 

586
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,910
Well... 

587
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,180
That stroller looks suspicious. 

588
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,300
She's had the cover on the whole time. 

589
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,480
Excuse us. 

590
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,800
What is it? 

591
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,030
This baby stroller... 

592
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,540
It was imported. 

593
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,000
It's not that. Please come with us. 

594
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,840
Why? 

595
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,940
It'll only take a minute. 

596
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,550
There's something we must check. 

597
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,300
Check what? 

598
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,180
What are you doing? Let me go! 

599
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,040
Oh, my! Oh! Let me go! Let me go! 

600
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,960
What are you doing? Let me go! 

601
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,350
I said let me go! Let go! Let go! 

602
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,870
What are you doing? 

603
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,360
How dare you drag me in here like this? 

604
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,190
I'm sorry but can we look at the stroller? 

605
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,450
Why? Why would you do that? 

606
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:55,950
You came in at the opening hour,
and you haven't bought anything for... 

607
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,090
So what is it you want? 

608
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,600
Please let me check this. 

609
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,120
Check what? 

610
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,120
How dare you! Don't! 

611
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,520
I said don't!
You'll wake up the baby! 

612
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,860
What are you doing? 

613
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,500
You think I stole something? 

614
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,240
I'm sorry. We made a mistake... 

615
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,930
I don't believe you! 

616
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:22,910
I was a VVIP here! 

617
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,760
Get the president here! Bring him! 

618
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
I'm sorry. 

619
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,850
Let go! How dare you belittle me like this? 

620
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:33,030
I was in the Miss Korea pageant! 

621
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,040
How dare you! 

622
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,180
Minjung? 

623
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,640
I'm fine, of course. 

624
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,410
You're not ill, are you? 

625
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,950
Isn't delivering packages hard? 

626
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,030
I'm okay, father. 

627
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,200
I'm used to it now. 

628
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,700
Father, is there an A-frame you can spare? 

629
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,860
It'll come in handy with a heavy package. 

630
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,660
A-frame? 

631
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,230
A-frame would make it easy to carry. 

632
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,050
I'll look for one or make you one. 

633
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,760
Drop by sometime. 

634
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,210
Okay, father. 

635
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,000
Don't skip your meals. 

636
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,620
And don't worry about me. 

637
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,630
Father, I'm getting a call. 

638
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,160
Goodbye, father. 

639
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,490
Parcel delivery. 

640
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,490
Excuse me? 

641
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,370
Okay. 

642
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,700
I'm sorry. 

643
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:59,150
She came in at opening hour, and she walked around for 4 hours buying nothing... 

644
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,860
We'll drive her home. 

645
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,310
Let's go. 

646
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,000
I can't. 

647
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,180
I'm going to sue you. 

648
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,060
I'm going to post this online and ruin you. 

649
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,810
I'm sorry. 

650
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,810
Why are you sorry? 

651
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,540
Do your job right! 

652
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,200
Look at the list. I'm Wang Subak! 

653
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,080
I was this department store's VVIP! 

654
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,960
Let's go, Subak. 

655
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,210
Uh, Minjung, don't you know me? 

656
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,390
I'm the second son of the village head. 

657
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,660
Huh? Yes... 

658
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,440
You work here? 

659
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,950
Yes, it's been so long. 

660
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,910
What's going on? 

661
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,230
What's up with your outfit? 

662
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,320
Let's talk another time. 

663
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,940
What are you doing?
It hurts. 

664
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,530
He's from your hometown? 

665
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,530
And he treated me this way? 

666
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,140
You're all dead! 

667
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,850
Oh, man! 

668
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,850
Ouch! It hurts! 

669
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,880
Do you know him? 

670
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
He's from my hometown. 

671
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,880
I wonder what happened. 

672
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,850
He was running a big company. 

673
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:22,290
His father threw a party in honor for him. 

674
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,760
Man... 

675
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,630
Wow, nice car. 

676
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,710
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 

677
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:05,790
Oh, my! Oh, that woman must be crazy. 

678
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:09,580
She looks almost crazy to me. 

679
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,780
I hate people who disregard traffic lights. 

680
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,400
If there was an accident, I'd get blamed. 

681
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,900
And I'd have to pay for it. 

682
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,650
That may be so. 

683
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,550
People just don't get it. They don't. 

684
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,780
She must sell rice cakes. 

685
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,480
She doesn't. 

686
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,350
You know her?
She's your acquaintance? 

687
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,150
No way. 

688
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,740
I don't associate with married women. 

689
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,870
Especially women like that. 

690
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,620
I know, after tonight, yo! 

691
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,610
You will leave me, 

692
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,440
and the sadness of our final kiss... 

693
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,120
Are you really leaving? 

694
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,290
Oh, hot! This looks good. 

695
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,700
Is it here? 

696
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,800
Yes. 

697
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,510
How big? 

698
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:08,860
126 square meters with 2 bathrooms. 

699
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:12,730
It must be suffocating to have four people live there. 

700
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:14,640
Would you like to be my lover? 

701
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,390
Compared to the apartment before... 

702
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,200
Excuse me? 

703
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,340
What did you just say? 

704
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,010
Be my lover. 

705
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,340
But I'm married. 

706
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,000
So? 

707
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,890
That means I have a wife. 

708
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,440
In other words, I had a wedding. 

709
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,350
So? 

710
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:41,170
Since I'm married, I can't have a lover. 

711
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:44,240
That's what I'm told although I don't agree. 

712
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,160
If you want to, you can. 

713
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,390
You're more old fashioned than I thought. 

714
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,790
That's what the average Korean would think. 

715
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,850
Did I ask you to marry me? 

716
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:55,610
Excuse me? 

717
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,550
I'm not, so why are you scared? 

718
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,610
Give it some thought.
You have 3 days. 

719
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,350
Here. 

720
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,100
What is this? 

721
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,480
A credit card. 

722
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,540
What am I supposed to do with this? 

723
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,840
You tend to ask questions you know the answers to. 

724
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,470
Use it as you want. 

725
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,280
The limit is a hundred thousand dollars. 

726
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,980
A hun-hundred thousand? 

727
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,140
Get out. 

728
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,930
I'm going nuts. 

729
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,160
Delicious. 

730
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,180
You'll be rich. 

731
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,800
Right? It came out perfect. 

732
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,650
Why did Ms. Scrooge pass rice cakes out to the neighbors? 

733
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,630
I've never felt so happy about giving something to someone before. 

734
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,210
I envy those who own houses in Seoul. 

735
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,510
Where's Sedal? 

736
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:23,490
He's coming today. 

737
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,760
The director must like him. 

738
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,220
I told him to stick with the director. 

739
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,490
I told him to do whatever he says. 

740
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:35,270
Take this home. 

741
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,600
You take it home. 

742
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,920
I'm not going to visit. 

743
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,690
I think both mom and I need some time. 

744
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,220
My father thinks we should. 

745
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,920
I understand what you mean. 

746
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,470
Do whatever you want.
You have my support. 

747
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,970
That's what my father said. 

748
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:56,090
Like older brother, like younger brother. 

749
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,600
Hobak, 

750
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,560
I work now, so stop giving me money. 

751
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:06,060
Uncle, I love you.
I love you so much. 

752
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,380
Stop that. 

753
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,950
Let's drop by Hobak's new apartment. 

754
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:14,800
You go alone. I'm not going. 

755
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,020
Are you still upset about Sedal? 

756
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,000
Don't even bring up Sedal or Hobak. 

757
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,360
The rice cakes came out perfectly. 

758
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,830
If the rices cakes come out delicious,
you'll become rich. 

759
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,200
As if I'll be sorry. 

760
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,260
I'm going to watch how well she does. 

761
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,100
Try some. 

762
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,120
No thank you.
You eat it all. 

763
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,210
It's me. 

764
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:40,610
Hello. 

765
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:44,420
What's up?
Shouldn't you be working? 

766
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,230
I'm taking a break. 

767
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:49,300
Jungji's asleep and Aeji's at kindergarten. 

768
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,090
I came to see you, not the girls. 

769
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:54,710
I'd like you to go and check on my wife. 

770
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,950
Why? Is Subak okay? 

771
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,680
She's been acting strange. 

772
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,340
What do you mean? 

773
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,090
She bought a $3,000 baby stroller. 

774
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,770
What? 

775
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:09,280
Where did she get the money? 

776
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,380
She got a loan from a private loan company. 

777
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,070
Is she crazy? 

778
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,500
You want her to go crazy, mother? 

779
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,640
Can't you understand why she did that? 

780
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,540
She pushes that stroller around all day. 

781
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,110
What's wrong with that? 

782
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,960
When I was her age, I'd walk around, 

783
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,600
carrying my baby on my back all day long to show off the baby's blanket. 

784
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,640
Stop lying. 

785
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,950
Everything you say is a lie. 

786
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,170
Hey, try this rice cake. 

787
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,840
This is from Hobak. 

788
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,200
But the stroller is empty. 

789
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,260
Is she an old grandmother? 

790
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,720
Why is she pushing around an empty stroller? 

791
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:53,640
Oh, I should talk to Bong about her. 

792
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,980
Try it. 

793
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,440
Okay. 

794
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,950
You picked this moment to tell me that? 

795
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:05,020
You came all the way here to rat on her? 

796
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,720
I came because I'm worried. 

797
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,190
Isn't it good? 

798
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,110
Yes, it's good. 

799
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,940
How can you eat at a time like this? 

800
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,310
I can't really eat. 

801
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,900
Yes, parcel service. 

802
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:34,730
Excuse me? 

803
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,720
I'm Aeji's father... 

804
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,550
What did you say? 

805
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,840
Let go! Let me go!  

806
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,430
What did you say?
You awful woman! 

807
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,880
Let go! Let go! 

808
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,990
Parcel service? Parcel service? 

809
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,480
How dare you keep coming here? 

810
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,790
Dad! 

811
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,870
Yes, Aeji. 

812
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,820
Don't cry. Don't cry.  

813
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,400
Are you crazy? 

814
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:20,080
Subak! 

815
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,690
Mom! Mom! Mom! 

816
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,850
Careful, be careful. 

817
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:46,370
Oh, no! What do we do? 

818
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,960
I can't believe my eyes. 

819
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,720
The Korean War was nothing compared to this. 

820
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,640
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo... 

821
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,600
You're crazy too. 

822
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,050
How could you do this to me? 

823
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:09,330
Why do I have to live like this? 

824
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:15,680
I used to be a classy woman!
I never fought! 

825
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:21,500
Why do I have to be belittled by her? 

826
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,470
I don't deserve that. 

827
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:27,460
I was in the Miss Korea pageant! 

828
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,490
You got eliminated in the preliminaries. 

829
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,860
I'm sorry. It's all my fault. 

830
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:36,170
Didn't you learn anything from that? 

831
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:41,900
That woman teased her about your job! 

832
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,660
Who could actually take that sitting down? 

833
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,870
I'm still shaking right now. 

834
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:51,280
She never had a fight growing up. 

835
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,580
Mom, that's enough. 

836
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,520
Why didn't you manage your company better? 

837
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:02,300
You were so rich before,
so how could you lose everything? 

838
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,530
What if something bad happened to her? 

839
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,430
Why don't you just set her free? 

840
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,900
Mom. 

841
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,890
You should divorce her while she's young. 

842
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,780
She has her whole life ahead of her! 

843
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,220
Don't think I'm being too hard on you. 

844
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,220
I'm saying it because I'm frustrated. 

845
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,220
Get out. I don't want to see you. 

846
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,060
Minjung. 

847
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,060
Minjung... 

848
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,260
Oh, boy... 

849
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,480
The Korean War was nothing compared to this. 

850
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,730
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo... 

851
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,050
Minjung! Minjung! 

852
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,620
How could she do that at her kindergarten? 

853
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,050
Is she out of her mind? 

854
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,080
I told you!
She's out of her mind. 

855
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,940
What if something bad happened... 

856
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,750
Leave her be.
It's her life. 

857
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,660
Honey... 

858
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:38,290
So many people have it harder than her. 

859
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,730
Why can't she handle that? 

860
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:42,440
Please let me help them. 

861
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,750
Let's have them move in with us. 

862
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,180
Stop that. 

863
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,360
Leave them be, whatever happens. 

864
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,420
But that's not a good idea here. 

865
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,880
I came here because I'm desperate. 

866
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,600
Even Gwangbak thinks so. 

867
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,850
I'm too worried about Subak to leave her be. 

868
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:02,940
Honey, think of this as a favor for me. 

869
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,530
It's me. Open the door. 

870
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,380
Why are you here? 

871
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,020
I'm staying here for now. 

872
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,490
This is a motel. 

873
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:10,010
How can a mom stay at a motel where people with things to hide come in and out? 

874
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,670
It was you who made me come here. 

875
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:15,410
Give me the money to go to a hotel, then. 

876
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,280
Let's go home. 

877
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,210
No. 

878
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:26,740
I'm too scared of father to go to mom's house, and I have that basement efficiency. 

879
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:31,160
I'm sick and tired of that landlady,
and I hate the roaches and the mice! 

880
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,820
Get up. 

881
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:35,890
Subak. 

882
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,200
Are you busy? 

883
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,460
Even if it's late, come to my school. 

884
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,850
Okay. 

885
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,000
I loved seeing your smiling face. 

886
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:06,030
When you first came to my house,
I gave my permission because of that smile. 

887
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,580
Even for a man, your smile was really nice. 

888
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:13,280
But I haven't seen that in a while. 

889
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,800
Minjung, 

890
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,970
you're hurt, aren't you? 

891
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:27,640
I don't know how to resolve this. 

892
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,580
I feel bad for you and Subak. 

893
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:37,150
I'm heartbroken because I can't help you. 

894
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,680
I shouldn't say this to you,

895
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:49,500
but I'm so frustrated. 

896
00:57:53,210 --> 00:58:01,580
I can't end my life because I'm afraid of hurting my father, 

897
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:06,320
hurting my little girls, 

898
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,280
and turning Subak into a woman  

899
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,760
with a horrible fate. 

900
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,170
I know. 

901
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,610
I understand how you feel. 

902
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,390
Minjung, 

903
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:33,210
what would you like to do most right now? 

904
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,350
Excuse me? 

905
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,660
Tell me what you want to do. 

906
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,980
You should let off some steam. 

907
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:48,220
We can grab a drink, 

908
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:53,210
or if you want to go on a trip, you can. 

909
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:59,660
Or take the girls to your father's place. 

910
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:04,650
You need to be able to breathe, 

911
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:10,300
so you can take care of your family. 

912
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,050
Tell me what you want to do. 

913
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,820
I'll make it happen. 

914
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,410
Can I really do it? 

915
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,010
Of course. 

916
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,830
If you want to go on a trip, I'll pay. 

917
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,360
No, thank you. 

918
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,070
Then, 

919
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,400
would you like to grab a drink? 

920
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,300
No, father. 

921
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,270
Well, 

922
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:51,120
I'll do what I've been wanting to do. 

923
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:31,800
Subtitles by KBS World 

924
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,750
Is the director good to you? 

925
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:33,910
Yes. 

926
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:35,600
That's nice. 

927
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,520
Just do whatever you're told. 

928
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,210
Getting that job was really hard. 

929
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,880
What took you so long? 

930
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,020
Answer my calls before the third ring. 

931
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,590
Yeongdal is getting married. 

932
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:45,420
Did he propose to you? 

933
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,820
I think he will when he comes back. 

934
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,500
How do you know that if he's going to propose or not? 

935
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,570
You're moving in with your in laws? 

936
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:55,390
I'm not interested in moving in with them. 

937
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:58,020
Thanks to my Sedal, we're finally laughing. 

938
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:02,220
She just called me "my Sedal"!
