00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:30,053
Mr. Chairman... Please let me go.

3
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,851
What are you doing?

4
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:43,107
Get him to kneel down.

5
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:00,100
Honey!

6
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:07,918
Get up.
You didn't do anything wrong.

7
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,444
Gosh, why did you come here?

8
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,897
I'm not here to see you.

9
00:01:18,072 --> 00:01:19,781
I came to see the chairman.

10
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:30,509
I'm glad you are here too, Gi Bum.

11
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,215
What brought you here?

12
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:35,888
I am here to show you something.

13
00:01:48,272 --> 00:01:50,027
You know who that is, right?

14
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:57,433
They would risk their
lives for Director Baek.

15
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:10,019
Ah... I didn't do that intentionally.
It was an accident!

16
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,754
I was going to just scare him.

17
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:13,895
But he tripped over and died.

18
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:16,189
It's true, Tae Soo! It's true!

19
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:17,646
Dad, please believe me.

20
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:20,478
Do you know what kind of guy Mr. Son was?

21
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:23,027
He was a loser, swindler, and gambler!

22
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:26,721
He lost all of your three
billion won at the casino!

23
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,026
It says the borrower is my husband, huh?

24
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,877
If you and I were drowning in the water

25
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:38,651
Which of us do you think
Tae Soo would save first?

26
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:41,683
If this place is on fire
who would he save first?

27
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:45,085
He risked his life for you for 20 years.

28
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:47,162
But framing him for a
murder was not enough.

29
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:50,358
You had to make him sign an
IOU for three billion won?

30
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,002
Let's go, Honey.

31
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:19,972
Dad...

32
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:23,270
What an idiot.

33
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:25,116
Dummy!

34
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,199
<i>[Episode 4]</i>

35
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:38,937
Oh, gosh!

36
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:40,580
Ah...

37
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,938
Eun Ok!

38
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:52,070
You don't have to thank me.

39
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:56,270
The one who saved you is the lady in
charge of the neighborhood council.

40
00:03:56,764 --> 00:03:57,811
Huh?

41
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,462
Kyung Mee.

42
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:14,018
<i>Eun Ok, did you hear about Tae Soo's
IOU for three billion won?</i>

43
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,961
Gosh...

44
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:22,139
Eun Ok, what brought you
here at this hour?

45
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,766
I'm sorry... but can I check
the black box footage from last week?

46
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:29,755
<i>My husband said it got deleted
because it had a small memory card.</i>

47
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:32,541
Tae Soo asked about it last night too.

48
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,944
Is something going on?

49
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:38,045
<i>Am I fooling a ghost here?</i>

50
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:41,661
<i>I saw it with my own eyes.
You can't deny it!</i>

51
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:45,343
You threw away trash here
at 11:40 PM last night.

52
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:46,759
Huh?

53
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,562
You did it at 11:13 PM the night before.

54
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:49,980
Should I say the seconds too?

55
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,622
It's not like you're poor.
Buy your own trash bags!

56
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:54,454
Chairwoman of the Neighborhood Council!

57
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:55,615
Seriously... Huh?

58
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:57,538
- Ma'am!
- You scared me!

59
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:00,050
Ma'am! How do you know that?

60
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,651
How you do you know they
threw away trash here?

61
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,370
How? Please answer me!

62
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,855
Over there.

63
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:24,221
What's wrong?
Where are you going?

64
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:27,115
I have to say what I couldn't
say to the chairman!

65
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:28,516
Are you crazy?

66
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:32,401
Why do you think I went to
him, not to the police?

67
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:34,911
That way, you could live and
it wouldn't get too big.

68
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:37,077
What is it that you want to do there?

69
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,093
Gosh.

70
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:47,060
Didn't you see how pale his face turned?

71
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,536
And Baek Gi Bum had the sorriest excuse!

72
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:51,370
They are that kind of people!

73
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,129
What will do you now?

74
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:56,300
We've seen everything about them.
You can't go back!

75
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:14,339
I, Yoon Tae Soo...!

76
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,964
I quit as of today!

77
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:20,391
Even if I make one million won a month

78
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:22,824
You will be able to sleep
well at night, Eun Ok!

79
00:06:23,494 --> 00:06:26,439
Geez, I'm so glad to hear that!

80
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,446
You finally grew up!

81
00:06:28,446 --> 00:06:30,853
Now that I decided to do that

82
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,821
it feels great!

83
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:35,064
Sure! Why not!

84
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:39,427
I'll make it work no matter how
little money you bring home.

85
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:42,622
We won't send the kids to
the afterschool programs.

86
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:46,024
Sung Min and Soo Min will dance
around because they're happy!

87
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:47,598
Ding Dong Dang!

88
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:49,834
Our house is the chairman's.

89
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:52,189
We can just live on the street!

90
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:53,903
Let's buy a tent!

91
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:56,435
There are many good ones!
Where should we put it up?

92
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:58,896
We need to use water and a restroom.

93
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,576
Maybe right next to a public restroom?

94
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:02,744
We can handle the smell...

95
00:07:02,744 --> 00:07:06,172
And we can just eat
the free samples at the market!

96
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:10,000
Or we can get free meals
at Mom's senior center!

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,524
I love that!

98
00:07:11,524 --> 00:07:15,031
We could even save some
money if we did that!

99
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:18,232
I'm still going to spend
5,000 won on Lotto tickets.

100
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:19,675
Of course.

101
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:21,694
Without that...

102
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,129
What hope would we have to hold on to?

103
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:28,843
Geez, why do you say that?

104
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:31,887
I'm losing my appetite for
alcohol over the word, hope.

105
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:36,485
Gosh.

106
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,072
Geez.

107
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:42,158
Geez.

108
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:44,134
- I'm going to die.
- I'm going to die.

109
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:46,456
What's going on here?

110
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:47,649
Oh?

111
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,519
Madam Lee Choon Boon!

112
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,379
What the heck is going on?

113
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,019
Hey, how much did you drink?

114
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,475
It just happened.

115
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,170
Oh, Mother!

116
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,163
Please don't be harsh.

117
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:04,346
Today, I did something amazing!

118
00:08:04,346 --> 00:08:08,274
Today I saved your son, Yoon Tae Soo!

119
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,562
You should praise me for that, Mother.

120
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:18,019
If you praise me, I will forget
everything and forgive you!

121
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:21,327
What the heck is she talking about?

122
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:23,459
Get off me! You are stinky!

123
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,483
Give me a high five!

124
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:27,362
High five!

125
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:28,846
Geez, calm down!

126
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:30,072
Wow!

127
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:33,159
Gosh, go in the room.
The kids are watching.

128
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,801
Why? Go on, Mom!

129
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,288
Give me an interview!

130
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:40,452
Please make me look
beautiful like an actress.

131
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,756
My ugly, pretty daughter!

132
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:46,106
Drink some water, Mom.

133
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,171
Good.

134
00:08:47,187 --> 00:08:49,750
My son was here too!

135
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,927
Did you cry? Why are your eyes so red?

136
00:08:53,191 --> 00:08:55,143
Who cried?

137
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:57,469
Sung Min!

138
00:08:57,469 --> 00:09:00,014
You're the best, my son!

139
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,538
You know what my wishes are.

140
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,120
No matter what, you must
go to a college in Seoul.

141
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,801
At least one of the top three schools!

142
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:10,013
If you go to Seoul University

143
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:12,774
I will dance in the middle
of a road in Seoul!

144
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:17,202
Seoul University! My son got
admitted to Seoul University!

145
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:20,321
My son goes to Seoul University!

146
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:22,491
My son goes to Seoul University!

147
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:23,702
Mom!

148
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:25,869
Mom...

149
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:27,863
Mom loves Seoul University!

150
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:30,254
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll take her.

151
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:31,767
Let's go, honey.

152
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:32,860
- Let's go.
- Love ya!

153
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,719
Mother! I love you!

154
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:38,698
- I love you, Soo Min!
- Let's go to sleep.

155
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:40,883
What a beautiful night!

156
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:42,238
Love you!

157
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:43,918
Oh, my blood pressure.

158
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,230
Oh, yes! I got you, Mom.

159
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,961
I love you!

160
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:50,894
Oh...

161
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,291
Geez.

162
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:54,980
Geez. Let me see.

163
00:09:57,402 --> 00:10:01,221
Why is it that life sucks?

164
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:54,678
Do you remember this place?

165
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:57,224
How can I forget?

166
00:10:57,224 --> 00:11:00,192
Without you, this would
have been my burial site.

167
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:02,335
Was it about 15 years ago?

168
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:06,355
You and I hid here and barely survived.

169
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:11,349
I made up my mind then.

170
00:11:12,164 --> 00:11:14,644
From now on, Tae Soo is my son.

171
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,586
Tae Soo.

172
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:24,524
About Gi Bum...

173
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:28,519
I'll just think that he doesn't exist.
So do whatever you want with him.

174
00:11:29,177 --> 00:11:31,869
I'll send him to the Philippines
if you say so.

175
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:34,941
Even if you turn him to the
police, I can't say much.

176
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:41,057
How will you live without Gi Bum?

177
00:11:41,057 --> 00:11:43,889
Is he my only child?

178
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:47,585
I have you too, Tae Soo.

179
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,716
It's all my fault.

180
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:59,090
A horse running in the wild doesn't have
the time to take care of his stable.

181
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:02,551
That's how I spoiled Gi Bum.

182
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:05,057
Now that he's so immature

183
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:08,317
he's becoming a disgrace to me.

184
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:17,730
Mr. Chairman.

185
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:27,048
Will you do as I say?

186
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:28,451
What do you want?

187
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:30,390
Promise me first.

188
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:38,154
Gi Bum...

189
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:40,876
He's my dearest friend.

190
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:43,326
I'm the one who owes him.

191
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:46,518
Anyway, he took care of
someone who deserved to die.

192
00:12:46,518 --> 00:12:48,854
And I'm proven innocent.

193
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:51,644
So I am the one who
owes him a drink.

194
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:54,884
Do you mean it?

195
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:59,280
Do you think you can
let go of everything?

196
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,461
Yes.

197
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:03,623
You always said if the result
is good, everything is good.

198
00:13:03,623 --> 00:13:05,533
This is that kind of situation.

199
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,725
Then... what about the movie?

200
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:09,798
Of course I should make it.

201
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:12,811
I was even on TV as a movie maker.

202
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,442
Also, I should make sure you look good.

203
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:22,807
Tae Soo.

204
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:24,928
Geez, look at you.

205
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:27,475
You got so thin because
of all that stress.

206
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,499
Don't worry about the movie.

207
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:32,340
I will take care of it.

208
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:02,591
Why are you outside? It's cold!

209
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,075
Honey, are you really okay?

210
00:14:06,075 --> 00:14:08,013
Of course I am.

211
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,722
Thank you for coming back safely.

212
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:16,480
Oh, man!

213
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:20,717
People might think we are
shooting a movie here.

214
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:25,476
You're frozen. Let's go in.
You might catch a cold.

215
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,105
Are you sober now?

216
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:30,336
I was all over the place
last night, right?

217
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:33,243
I don't know. I saw nothing.

218
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:35,284
Soo Min took a video of it.

219
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:38,418
- It's cold!
- Why is it so cold?

220
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:44,177
You just recovered from a cold.

221
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:45,291
Are you up?

222
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:48,746
You haven't slept much
since you came home late.

223
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:50,351
Is something going on?

224
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,586
Director Baek didn't come home
last night.

225
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,217
I can't really talk about it.

226
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,938
Just pretend you don't know.

227
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,554
I'm disappointed if you do this.

228
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:04,624
I can't blame anyone.

229
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,892
He's like money bouncing
around, not doing anything good.

230
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:13,817
It's my fault. I'm always on his case.

231
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:18,393
It feels like I lost two sons
at the same time.

232
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:23,067
How about making him a family?

233
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:27,249
He's lost because he has
no family to take care of.

234
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:31,155
That's why he keeps causing
trouble for you.

235
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:38,071
You know his ex-wife and
daughter came back to Daejeon?

236
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:40,653
Don't even mention them.

237
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:42,985
I have no business with them.

238
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:47,537
Oh...

239
00:15:47,764 --> 00:15:51,335
I used less whipped cream
and put lots of fruits.

240
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:55,135
Was it obvious I was on a diet?

241
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:59,510
Why don't you sit if you aren't too busy?

242
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,650
Should I?

243
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:06,201
I know I might be rude to say this...

244
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:09,264
But I know about you and Director Baek.

245
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:12,658
It's all in the past.

246
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:14,879
Perhaps...

247
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:18,881
The chairman doesn't like me
coming back here...

248
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:20,303
Are you here to tell me that?

249
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:22,788
Oh, no. Please don't misunderstand.

250
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:24,990
Then... why?

251
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,245
Well.... let's say I'm just
curious about you, Do Kyung.

252
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:33,315
It's like, you are attracted
to certain people.

253
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:37,009
You're someone I can relate to.

254
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:41,750
Wow, you and I are definitely
thinking the same thing!

255
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,236
You felt so familiar from the beginning.

256
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,416
Where did you live in Seoul?

257
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:51,169
Seoul...? Mostly... in Gangnam...

258
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:52,857
But...

259
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:57,181
You wouldn't have seen me
because I lived abroad mostly.

260
00:16:58,136 --> 00:16:59,586
Well...

261
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,285
Could it be the Indian consul's
party last summer?

262
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:05,845
Didn't you come to the party?

263
00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:07,499
Not at all.

264
00:17:07,682 --> 00:17:10,643
Well, maybe because you are so beautiful

265
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:12,729
I might have thought you
were an actress I knew.

266
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:15,230
Oh, please...!

267
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,237
I would like to treat you like
my own sister from now on.

268
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:21,736
If that's okay with you.

269
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:24,019
Thank you.

270
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,617
Please have some, Sister.

271
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:30,935
Thank you.

272
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:46,551
<i>[Missing Person]</i>

273
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:51,198
What the heck! What is this, Boss?

274
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:54,055
Gosh.

275
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:56,452
What are you doing? Take it off!

276
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,827
Take it off?

277
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,311
I said take them off!

278
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:06,463
Hey.

279
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,842
<i>Did you see them, honey?</i>

280
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,320
<i>Where the heck are you?</i>

281
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,968
Ma'am...

282
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,760
You can't report a missing person
until it's been five years.

283
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:19,190
For now, you can report a runaway.

284
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,037
I said it's an accident, not a runaway.

285
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:24,724
You can't insist that
when there's no evidence.

286
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:27,443
There's an order of business
in everything.

287
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:30,759
My goodness, you are so dense.

288
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,973
That's why you are still
in that position.

289
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:37,112
Were you born in August?

290
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:38,165
Year of Dog?

291
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:42,717
How do you know...?

292
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:44,221
What's the date of your birth?

293
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,528
It's eighth.

294
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:53,998
Oh... geez.

295
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,701
It's one of the hottest days of the year.

296
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:59,006
Gosh.

297
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:02,116
You went through a lot, right?

298
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:04,661
The spirit says a good thing
will happen in the new year.

299
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:06,167
Yeah?

300
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:12,175
She says watch your steps.

301
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:14,536
She says dig with your front legs.

302
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:19,868
Please help me find him.

303
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,564
My son is missing.

304
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:24,833
Please help me find my son.

305
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,271
Please help!

306
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:28,144
He talks like a Seoulite.

307
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,920
Gosh, we're going to die from running!

308
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:43,503
Honey, are we having a punishment?

309
00:19:43,503 --> 00:19:45,531
What are you doing? Take them off!

310
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:48,317
They are all over the town!

311
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,019
Someone's there!

312
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,719
It could have been bad.

313
00:19:57,847 --> 00:19:59,511
- Are they gone?
- Really?

314
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:00,582
Yeah.

315
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:05,483
Be careful! We almost got caught!

316
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:08,713
I was so focused I didn't see them!

317
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,557
It drives me nuts! When are we
going to take them all off?

318
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:13,945
Are we going to be okay?

319
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:15,631
What do you mean?
Did we do something?

320
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,892
Just focus! Okay?

321
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:20,561
Over there! It's totally covered!

322
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:23,303
Be natural. Be natural.

323
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:25,698
Be natural...

324
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:33,815
Oh...

325
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,104
What are the bags for?

326
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,884
Oh... it's nothing.

327
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:41,625
Say hello. She's my friend.

328
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,933
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

329
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:45,634
You must be her son.

330
00:20:45,737 --> 00:20:47,471
And you are her daughter in-law.

331
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,857
Yes.

332
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,084
I'll bring something to eat.

333
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,116
Okay.

334
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:54,739
Sit over here.

335
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:55,902
Sure.

336
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:01,142
Oh, Tae Soo!

337
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:04,045
This is an amazing coincidence!

338
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:08,390
How could I run into the
Shaman of Mia-ri there like that!

339
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:10,468
Shaman of what?

340
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:14,772
She says she's a famous shaman in Seoul.

341
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:18,105
She has hundreds of regulars!

342
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:20,382
You know what's even more interesting?

343
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,117
What is it?

344
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:24,654
She's the mother of the man.

345
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:26,480
Who is that man?

346
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,003
The man you're making a movie with!

347
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:31,538
I told him he had a lucky face.

348
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:34,530
What?

349
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,201
Why are you so surprised?

350
00:21:37,332 --> 00:21:39,901
We were just worried about him.

351
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:43,380
Because his business partner
has been out of touch.

352
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:48,574
I see a knife in your physiognomy.

353
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:49,682
Pardon?

354
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,233
What does that mean?

355
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:55,353
Actually he's well-known
for his fist in Daejeon.

356
00:21:55,353 --> 00:21:56,578
- Mom...
- Yeah?

357
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:57,875
Okay.

358
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,965
Why did you have one child?

359
00:22:00,673 --> 00:22:02,521
You didn't want a son?

360
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,126
It's not true.

361
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,847
We have a son. My oldest is a son.

362
00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:16,112
Well... he doesn't look like you at all!

363
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:19,957
That's why he's a good student at school.

364
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:21,991
He ranks first in his class.

365
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:26,413
Gosh, this isn't the time for
me to tell others' fortunes.

366
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:28,497
My son is missing!

367
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:29,622
Okay.

368
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:33,421
Anyway she'll stay with us
until she finds her son.

369
00:22:33,421 --> 00:22:35,156
Just know that, okay?

370
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,299
Sure...

371
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,808
Get him! Get him!

372
00:22:45,992 --> 00:22:47,807
Get him!

373
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,997
Hey, beat him!

374
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:55,536
Stop!

375
00:22:57,137 --> 00:22:58,180
You!

376
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:09,673
Step aside.

377
00:23:26,182 --> 00:23:27,334
Huh?

378
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:31,079
Mr. Son, are you okay?

379
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:34,461
- I'm fine.
- Huh?

380
00:23:34,461 --> 00:23:36,917
A dead body doesn't hurt.

381
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:39,380
Oh... oh...

382
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,382
Ah!

383
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,227
See you soon.

384
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:57,781
What's wrong?

385
00:23:58,817 --> 00:24:01,615
No... it was a dream.

386
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:05,423
I had a nightmare.

387
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,705
Could it be that... she knows something?

388
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:11,286
You saw her scary eyes, right?

389
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:12,372
Yeah.

390
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,210
Well, it can't be.

391
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,267
If she knew something
she would've reported it.

392
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:21,632
Sleep now.

393
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:23,929
I have something to do.

394
00:24:24,054 --> 00:24:25,144
Okay.

395
00:24:37,707 --> 00:24:39,136
You scared me!

396
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:41,307
What are you doing here?

397
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:42,714
I'm praying!

398
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,267
My goodness!

399
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:47,558
What are you doing?
You totally scared me!

400
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:48,558
Geez.

401
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:51,707
Did you have a nightmare?

402
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:53,751
Pardon?

403
00:24:55,282 --> 00:24:56,566
No...

404
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,272
I came out to go to the bathroom.

405
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:03,440
Please answer me!

406
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,134
My poor son, Se Yoon!

407
00:25:08,134 --> 00:25:10,147
Please answer me!

408
00:25:15,288 --> 00:25:18,252
My poor son, Se Yoon!

409
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:20,949
Please answer me!

410
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:39,193
Just like that, that feeling!

411
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:40,380
Pavane!

412
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:42,431
Cry if you want to cry.

413
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:45,382
Don't save your tears if it's for an art!

414
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:48,330
Should I make you shed tears and blood?

415
00:25:48,384 --> 00:25:49,443
Pardon?

416
00:25:49,627 --> 00:25:50,702
Huh?

417
00:25:50,702 --> 00:25:54,423
I have no comments on that.

418
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:58,788
Is this all you can do, huh?

419
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:01,906
That's the most expensive item here.

420
00:26:01,906 --> 00:26:03,509
You can break anything except for that!

421
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:06,063
It's the most expensive here!

422
00:26:06,063 --> 00:26:07,714
Oh!

423
00:26:07,714 --> 00:26:10,136
Luckily, Mr. Yoon is here!

424
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,503
Oh, what brought you here?

425
00:26:12,503 --> 00:26:16,701
She wanted to see where her son worked.

426
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,324
So we came.

427
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,646
Excuse me.

428
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:23,270
Huh?

429
00:26:26,395 --> 00:26:27,554
Huh?

430
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,648
Are you the director?

431
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:35,103
You work for Se Yoon?

432
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,530
How do you know...

433
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,165
What happened to my son?

434
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:43,277
Why are you still here when my son isn't?

435
00:26:43,277 --> 00:26:45,765
It wasn't me...

436
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:58,661
Oh...

437
00:26:59,938 --> 00:27:01,757
What... what is it?

438
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:10,174
Hmm?

439
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:25,824
Perhaps this is...

440
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:28,588
That belongs to Mr. Son.

441
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:33,009
Oh... Se Yoon is asking
me to find him quickly.

442
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:35,931
He's shouting, "Mom, find me!"

443
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:37,174
Se Yoon!

444
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,673
Is this Choong Shin Construction
that invested in the movie?

445
00:27:47,673 --> 00:27:49,097
Yes, it is.

446
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,223
Oh, he's coming here!

447
00:27:51,442 --> 00:27:52,961
Gi Bum!

448
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:54,126
Oh!

449
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:56,673
What brought you here?

450
00:27:56,673 --> 00:28:00,335
This is the man, who I told you
was really close to your son!

451
00:28:00,796 --> 00:28:02,182
Who is she?

452
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,713
She's Mr. Son's mother.

453
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:07,876
What?

454
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:09,869
Something happened between
you and my son, right?

455
00:28:11,486 --> 00:28:14,584
What do you mean? It's just
that things went wrong...

456
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,859
He did it first... I didn't
do that intentionally...

457
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,451
Just tell her the truth.

458
00:28:28,451 --> 00:28:31,229
You spilled hot soup over his pants.

459
00:28:31,463 --> 00:28:33,398
His thigh was burned a little.

460
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:37,532
Yes, it was my fault... hot soup...
his thigh...

461
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:39,250
Is that all?

462
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:43,411
Well... that's...

463
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:47,005
Gi Bum, you always did that.
You still do that?

464
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:48,761
You should be more careful.

465
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,932
Oh, yes.

466
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,848
I am going to pray in
Gyeryong Mountain tonight.

467
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:02,538
I am sure... I will get an answer.

468
00:29:11,842 --> 00:29:14,537
Did you buy whipped cream
and condensed milk?

469
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:16,880
Okay, I got it.

470
00:29:19,962 --> 00:29:21,388
Come on in!

471
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:37,599
I'll close the store for a moment.

472
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,582
Why did you come back?

473
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,732
My contract didn't say I couldn't
come back to my hometown.

474
00:29:47,732 --> 00:29:50,099
You are still arrogant.

475
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:52,324
You didn't change a bit.

476
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:55,681
Don't even think about
ruining my son's life.

477
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:57,478
Just go back while I'm still nice.

478
00:29:57,478 --> 00:30:01,608
Do you still think
I ruined Gi Bum's life?

479
00:30:01,608 --> 00:30:05,710
You should be thankful that I let
you keep the money and your child!

480
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,040
What the heck are you trying
to do, using your child?

481
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,275
Is it money?

482
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,275
Think what you like.

483
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:16,198
Aren't you embarrassed to your child?

484
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:19,954
No, I have nothing to be
ashamed of or afraid of.

485
00:30:19,954 --> 00:30:22,126
You're doing this for your child, right?

486
00:30:22,396 --> 00:30:23,848
It's likewise.

487
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:26,717
I won't let you kick me out like before!

488
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:28,576
How dare!

489
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:32,057
You kicked out all the
customers, and now it's us?

490
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:34,856
Hyun Jee!

491
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:36,943
What have we done so wrong?

492
00:30:36,943 --> 00:30:39,249
I asked her to move down here.

493
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:41,138
Don't do this to my mom!

494
00:30:42,102 --> 00:30:44,648
Hyun Jee! Hyun Jee!

495
00:30:46,728 --> 00:30:47,932
Hyun Jee!

496
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:49,727
Hyun Jee!

497
00:30:50,384 --> 00:30:52,606
Hyun Jee! Hyun Jee!

498
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,314
Hyun Jee!

499
00:31:48,202 --> 00:31:51,131
Well, do you have an upbeat song?

500
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,997
I'm totally gloomy today.

501
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:57,157
Gosh.

502
00:31:57,777 --> 00:32:00,196
You're ignoring me again? Hey.

503
00:32:00,196 --> 00:32:02,386
Don't pretend to be so chic.

504
00:32:04,605 --> 00:32:07,919
I remember how dumb you
were when you were little.

505
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,711
Hey!

506
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:17,775
Stop bothering me!
I'm not interested in you!

507
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,273
We are lovers from now on.

508
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:30,330
It means I'm your owner
and you are my servant.

509
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,171
If you understand, say yes.

510
00:32:32,171 --> 00:32:33,861
Yes, Hyun Jee.

511
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:39,174
Do you remember it now?

512
00:32:43,946 --> 00:32:45,862
It's not enough pretending
to be a singer?

513
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:47,777
Now you're making a movie?

514
00:32:47,876 --> 00:32:50,112
Is she your girlfriend?

515
00:32:50,112 --> 00:32:52,125
Wow, she's...

516
00:32:52,955 --> 00:32:54,213
Cute!

517
00:32:56,587 --> 00:32:57,656
Let's go.

518
00:32:57,656 --> 00:33:00,856
Bastard! You ignore us again?

519
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:02,382
Hey!

520
00:33:02,454 --> 00:33:04,468
You better just go your way.

521
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:06,153
I'm not in a good mood today.

522
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:07,795
Bitch!

523
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,501
You!

524
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,344
Hey!

525
00:33:14,965 --> 00:33:16,396
I can't see!

526
00:33:17,294 --> 00:33:18,515
Cops!

527
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:22,151
Oh, Sung Min! Sung Min!

528
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,308
What?

529
00:33:24,122 --> 00:33:26,294
What happened to your face?

530
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:29,505
What on earth happened?

531
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:30,623
I'm fine, Mom.

532
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:32,441
You are not fine at all!

533
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:35,275
You should've been at cram school!
Why are you here?

534
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:37,921
Hyun Jee!

535
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,442
Hyun Jee?

536
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,462
What's wrong? Are you okay?

537
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:42,926
Aren't you hurt?

538
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:46,865
Man!

539
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:49,479
It seems that those kids bothered them.

540
00:33:49,598 --> 00:33:51,178
We already got the story.

541
00:33:51,326 --> 00:33:53,919
Please sign here and you can go home.

542
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:55,278
You can take them.

543
00:33:55,926 --> 00:33:58,042
Guys, next time...

544
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:01,058
Have a date in a bright
spot, not in the dark alley.

545
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,779
Got it?

546
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,166
Wait a minute, Officer.

547
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:07,730
Oh... no.

548
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:11,059
What do you mean by date?
How could you say that?

549
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,452
My child isn't that kind of boy.

550
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,681
Even though slutty girls
keep bothering him

551
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:19,061
he never pays attention to them.
He only studies...

552
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:20,851
Watch your mouth.

553
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,032
Are you saying Hyun Jee tried to
seduce him when he didn't do anything?

554
00:34:25,175 --> 00:34:27,306
And what do you mean by slutty girls?

555
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,958
Oh, my. Did it sound like that?

556
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:35,425
Your ears must be broken. I meant
my child wouldn't do that.

557
00:34:35,425 --> 00:34:37,072
You're being oversensitive.

558
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:39,146
Let's say they did have a date.

559
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:42,175
When you raise a kid
all sorts of things can happen.

560
00:34:42,175 --> 00:34:43,878
It's not like we are strangers.

561
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:45,574
Why do you make a big deal out of it?

562
00:34:45,574 --> 00:34:46,588
Make a big deal?

563
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:48,965
Wow, you are so calm!

564
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:52,909
How can you say that when they
were brought to the police station?

565
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,791
How did you raise her in Seoul?

566
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:57,097
I raised her at ease,
not hovering over her.

567
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:58,911
I didn't raise him to be a brat!

568
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:00,204
Please stop.

569
00:35:00,204 --> 00:35:01,652
You should stop too.

570
00:35:01,652 --> 00:35:04,298
Sung Min, tell me the truth.

571
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,739
Why were you at the park and
not at cram school?

572
00:35:07,115 --> 00:35:08,998
Did you really have a date with her?

573
00:35:09,092 --> 00:35:11,632
Answer me. Why were you there with her?

574
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:12,996
It's my fault.

575
00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:20,927
He tried to help me when those
kids were bothering me.

576
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:23,516
Sung Min did nothing wrong.

577
00:35:25,264 --> 00:35:26,556
Did you hear that?

578
00:35:26,697 --> 00:35:29,893
My son saved your daughter.

579
00:35:30,485 --> 00:35:32,514
And it was definitely not a date.

580
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:51,911
Aren't you cold?

581
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:53,648
Thank you, Mom.

582
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:02,394
Tell me the truth.

583
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:05,030
Is it really true that
Sung Min saved you?

584
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,969
And you ran into him coincidentally?

585
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:08,885
Is that important?

586
00:36:09,726 --> 00:36:14,300
By the way, his mom doesn't
seem to like you that much.

587
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:17,204
Was she like that before?

588
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:21,411
I guess she's guarded
because I'm too pretty.

589
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:22,505
Gosh.

590
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,902
Why isn't there anyone
here who welcomes us?

591
00:36:28,735 --> 00:36:30,822
Like Grandpa...

592
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:33,849
Everyone hates me.

593
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:36,798
Don't say that.

594
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:39,181
You're making me feel bad.

595
00:36:40,344 --> 00:36:41,351
Is that so?

596
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:46,757
By the way, I was totally
rude to Grandpa, right?

597
00:36:46,757 --> 00:36:49,851
Don't worry. That felt good!

598
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:54,663
But don't do that again. Okay?

599
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,286
Since we feel gloomy,
should I sing a song, Mom?

600
00:37:00,764 --> 00:37:01,902
Good!

601
00:37:01,902 --> 00:37:03,063
Okay!

602
00:37:06,177 --> 00:37:07,224
Okay.

603
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,652
What's wrong with you?

604
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:55,786
You never did this kind of thing.

605
00:37:56,228 --> 00:37:58,365
Did you have to be like that?

606
00:37:59,322 --> 00:38:00,648
It was embarrassing.

607
00:38:00,648 --> 00:38:01,800
Embarrassing?

608
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:04,324
How can you say that in this situation?

609
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,831
Why did you skip your cram school?
What did you do?

610
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:11,492
You don't go to Seoul University
for free.

611
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:14,876
You've worked hard. But why
are you doing this now?

612
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:18,672
If you go to a good college, there
will be lots of nice girls.

613
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:20,655
Much nicer girls!

614
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:24,494
I'm tired. I'll go rest.

615
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,588
Hey, Yoon Sung Min!

616
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,666
Oh! Did you cause trouble?

617
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:32,625
Wow, you're a human! So cool!

618
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:34,327
Nice!

619
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:36,434
Soo Min causes enough trouble for me!

620
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:38,340
Do you have to add more trouble?

621
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:40,418
I just finished my homework!

622
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,137
Why do you treat me like that?
So annoying!

623
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:46,318
What? Hey, you!

624
00:38:46,614 --> 00:38:48,925
I can't live like this!

625
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:53,360
Why did that fox come back?
She's making me upset!

626
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:56,099
Why the daughter of
Lee Do Kyung and Baek Gi Bum?

627
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:58,389
My head is already about to explode!

628
00:38:58,389 --> 00:39:00,989
Please calm down. Do you want water?

629
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:02,237
By the way...

630
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:06,590
The shaman won't get answers
at Gyeryong Mountain, right?

631
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:10,237
I'm nervous, and your
mom is driving me nuts!

632
00:39:10,237 --> 00:39:11,784
You're right.

633
00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:14,063
Mom is being ridiculous!

634
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:15,621
Gosh.

635
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:23,510
<i>It was my fault.</i>

636
00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:27,965
He was just trying to help me when
those kids were bothering me.

637
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,329
Sung Min did nothing wrong.

638
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:41,853
My name is Baek Hyun Jee.

639
00:39:42,097 --> 00:39:43,577
I was a slacker in Seoul.

640
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:45,103
That's all.

641
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:46,998
So refreshing!

642
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:52,217
That's all. Go sit by Si Yeon.

643
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:55,159
Okay, let's have a good day!

644
00:39:58,286 --> 00:40:01,351
Hyun Jee, I'm Young Jae.
Chang Young Jae.

645
00:40:01,675 --> 00:40:03,074
From Love Preschool.

646
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:05,548
Oh, Young Jae!

647
00:40:05,673 --> 00:40:08,601
Young Jae, can we trade seats?

648
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:09,719
Huh?

649
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:11,380
Thanks, Young Jae.

650
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,817
It's so nice to see you again.
It's been 10 years!

651
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:26,226
Hey, what are you doing?

652
00:40:26,452 --> 00:40:28,240
I've been looking for you.

653
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:33,809
It seems that your mom
doesn't like me at all.

654
00:40:35,387 --> 00:40:36,489
Sorry.

655
00:40:38,086 --> 00:40:39,956
And thanks for keeping my secret.

656
00:40:42,494 --> 00:40:44,394
Do you study music composition?

657
00:40:44,394 --> 00:40:45,880
What about harmony?

658
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,150
It's also helpful to know keyboards.

659
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:49,500
Right!

660
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:52,632
We took piano lessons
together back in preschool.

661
00:40:53,481 --> 00:40:55,224
What's up with you?

662
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,561
Were you a singer in
training back in Seoul?

663
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:02,224
It's a secret.

664
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:07,942
I've gone to see fortune tellers before.

665
00:41:07,942 --> 00:41:10,827
But I've never seen such a
powerful one like that before.

666
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,213
The shaman of Mia-ri took
a quick look at my face.

667
00:41:15,442 --> 00:41:18,414
She found out I was born on
August 8, in the year of dog.

668
00:41:18,597 --> 00:41:22,166
Man, she said something good
would happen in the new year.

669
00:41:22,385 --> 00:41:24,974
Maybe I'll get a promotion
after I resolve this case!

670
00:41:24,974 --> 00:41:27,099
What is it that you wanted to tell me?

671
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:31,088
Oh, man... are you serious?
Both of us are pros.

672
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:35,014
Of course I know you've been
busy looking for that man.

673
00:41:36,403 --> 00:41:39,403
Share some information with me.

674
00:41:39,403 --> 00:41:41,375
What information?

675
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,393
Don't you see I'm empty-handed now?

676
00:41:43,393 --> 00:41:46,163
Don't be a wuss.

677
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:48,295
The shaman said...

678
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:53,170
I should dig with my front legs.

679
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:55,932
Could it be...

680
00:41:57,164 --> 00:41:58,737
He's buried somewhere?

681
00:41:58,737 --> 00:42:00,509
That's nonsense!

682
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:05,150
If you have no more to say, I'll just go.

683
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:08,384
<i>It's the weather forecast for Daejeon.</i>

684
00:42:08,384 --> 00:42:11,168
<i>There will be heavy rain at night.</i>

685
00:42:11,168 --> 00:42:15,865
<i>It's going to rain, 100 liters per hour
accompanied by lightning and thunder.</i>

686
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:19,925
<i>There are chances of landslides
in the Bong Gal mountain area.</i>

687
00:42:19,925 --> 00:42:21,896
<i>Please be prepared for that.</i>

688
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:23,927
Bong Gal Mountain?

689
00:42:23,927 --> 00:42:25,989
<i>It's going to be colder tomorrow.</i>

690
00:42:26,068 --> 00:42:28,887
<i>From high 12 to high 19
degrees in Celsius...</i>

691
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,891
Come on in... Oh, my!

692
00:42:33,956 --> 00:42:35,416
You scared me.

693
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:38,557
Where are you going in a hurry?
It's raining outside.

694
00:42:38,815 --> 00:42:42,182
It's just... over there...

695
00:42:42,182 --> 00:42:45,293
Tae Soo, you won't believe this.

696
00:42:45,512 --> 00:42:47,666
She got her answer!

697
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:51,351
What? What... answer?

698
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:55,298
She heard... she'll meet
her son within a few days.

699
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,936
Huh?

700
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:25,916
That bastard... bastard!

701
00:43:28,425 --> 00:43:29,574
Ah!

702
00:43:35,204 --> 00:43:37,518
Tae... Tae Soo!

703
00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:44,097
You were worried that he might get
washed away in a landslide, right?

704
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:47,568
I was trying to bury him deep,
to be sure!

705
00:43:51,597 --> 00:43:53,175
Heart to heart!

706
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:56,456
We are friends after all, right, Tae Soo?

707
00:43:56,456 --> 00:43:58,717
Shut up. Just dig!

708
00:44:02,034 --> 00:44:03,043
Oh...

709
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,521
Mr. Son's mother has a scary stare.

710
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:08,956
Should we do something about
her before it gets bad?

711
00:44:08,956 --> 00:44:11,322
Heavens will punish you!

712
00:44:11,322 --> 00:44:13,639
You are all about saving your life!

713
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:15,942
You are hopeless!

714
00:44:19,811 --> 00:44:24,134
Tae Soo, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

715
00:44:24,134 --> 00:44:26,813
Why, are you afraid you might
get struck by a lightning?

716
00:44:26,813 --> 00:44:28,391
Are you afraid I might kill you?

717
00:44:28,391 --> 00:44:31,945
I deserve to die. But please forgive me!

718
00:44:31,945 --> 00:44:35,938
How can you say the word
'forgive' that easily?

719
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:43,059
Oh, Tae Soo! Tae Soo!

720
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:48,237
Tae Soo! Don't do that!
Don't do that!

721
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:57,596
Oh... oh...

722
00:44:57,596 --> 00:45:00,760
I won't waste a shovel on a guy like you!

723
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,623
Hide!

724
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:12,268
Hide!

725
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:17,635
Huh? Oh, my.

726
00:45:19,427 --> 00:45:21,666
Oh... what are you doing here?

727
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,456
You didn't hear about the landslides?

728
00:45:24,664 --> 00:45:28,358
Well, we just checked our
father's burial site.

729
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,501
Yeah, in case of landslides...

730
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:32,369
There isn't a burial site around here.

731
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:33,697
Have you seen one?

732
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:38,148
It's over there, but we got
lost and ended up here.

733
00:45:38,742 --> 00:45:40,210
Where are you going?

734
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,172
Someone reported a collapsed bearing.

735
00:45:43,172 --> 00:45:46,320
Then there's no time for this.
Where is it? Show me.

736
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:48,617
No, just go down. It's dangerous here.

737
00:45:48,617 --> 00:45:51,240
It's good to have more hands.

738
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,454
Okay, let's go.

739
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:55,706
Show me. Where is it?

740
00:45:55,706 --> 00:45:58,369
Is it that way? Let's go.

741
00:45:58,394 --> 00:45:59,538
Hurry up.

742
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:16,043
Oh, come on in, Director Baek.

743
00:46:16,284 --> 00:46:17,914
Geez.

744
00:46:18,472 --> 00:46:21,697
People might think
two spies are meeting.

745
00:46:22,202 --> 00:46:24,476
My goodness!

746
00:46:26,746 --> 00:46:29,233
What happened to your face?

747
00:46:29,561 --> 00:46:32,266
Gosh, did you get into a fight again?

748
00:46:33,045 --> 00:46:35,344
Just say what you want to say.

749
00:46:39,572 --> 00:46:43,751
Do you know the chairman
went to see Lee Do Kyung?

750
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:48,114
He did? What did he say?

751
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:52,713
I don't know exactly, but
obviously nothing pleasant.

752
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:56,445
I heard he yelled and
pointed his finger at her.

753
00:46:57,157 --> 00:47:01,536
I guess he really hates Lee Do Kyung.

754
00:47:05,501 --> 00:47:06,916
What is it that you want?

755
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:11,543
Gosh, don't make it all
about give and take.

756
00:47:12,126 --> 00:47:16,003
I know how dear your ex-wife
and your daughter are to you.

757
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:20,166
I felt bad and just wanted to help.

758
00:47:22,597 --> 00:47:25,159
Why don't we have lunch together

759
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,106
and talk about what's on our minds?

760
00:47:33,202 --> 00:47:34,715
Accept a new member?

761
00:47:34,715 --> 00:47:37,945
I just want to raise our
bar a little higher.

762
00:47:37,945 --> 00:47:40,769
She went to Le Cordon Bleu.

763
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:44,092
She's also a certified barista.

764
00:47:44,092 --> 00:47:47,829
If she joins us, One Heart
will shine brighter!

765
00:47:48,556 --> 00:47:51,085
What do you think, Kyung Mee?

766
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,103
Pardon?

767
00:47:53,505 --> 00:47:55,809
Oh, of course!

768
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:58,471
I think we can get
a lot of help from her!

769
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:00,101
Do you agree?

770
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:03,331
Yes, we like that, Madam!

771
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:08,634
Oh, it's good timing!

772
00:48:13,244 --> 00:48:16,612
It seems like everyone is welcoming you!

773
00:48:16,612 --> 00:48:17,693
Really?

774
00:48:22,313 --> 00:48:23,760
I'm relieved.

775
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,057
I worried that someone might oppose.

776
00:48:29,902 --> 00:48:32,574
It's a brilliant idea, Madam.

777
00:48:32,682 --> 00:48:34,782
We are all for change and innovation.

778
00:48:34,782 --> 00:48:37,826
One Heart needs a change too!

779
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,744
That's right.

780
00:48:39,744 --> 00:48:41,199
However!

781
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,726
There's a rule about
accepting new members.

782
00:48:43,815 --> 00:48:46,130
The majority of the members must agree.

783
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:49,021
Yeah, that's right.

784
00:48:53,253 --> 00:48:56,641
I was hasty. I made a mistake.

785
00:48:58,532 --> 00:49:01,768
Then let's vote by raising hands.

786
00:49:07,722 --> 00:49:11,902
Anyone who opposes to
Lee Do Kyung's joining the team?

787
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:33,735
Does this mean everyone agrees then?

788
00:49:35,288 --> 00:49:40,157
Since we are all here, should we hold a
ceremony to accept her as a new member?

789
00:49:40,684 --> 00:49:42,650
That's great!

790
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,856
Thank you.

791
00:49:56,338 --> 00:50:00,246
This is... a bit awkward...

792
00:50:01,659 --> 00:50:05,884
I don't want to do this either.
So be quiet.

793
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:10,650
Do Kyung.

794
00:50:10,972 --> 00:50:14,407
Do you know how special this
feet washing ceremony is?

795
00:50:14,407 --> 00:50:17,563
It's about respecting and
loving our new members.

796
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:21,179
Madam Oh started this tradition.

797
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,318
I see.

798
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:31,119
Oh... Mother!

799
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:33,913
Mother!

800
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,233
How on earth are you here?

801
00:50:36,702 --> 00:50:39,130
I just followed her.

802
00:50:39,898 --> 00:50:42,639
She said she was spoken to.

803
00:50:42,882 --> 00:50:45,507
I think she's going to do something.

804
00:50:45,614 --> 00:50:48,601
What? Do what?

805
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:52,844
My feet just lead me here.

806
00:50:56,913 --> 00:50:58,143
First...

807
00:51:00,431 --> 00:51:03,398
May I ask you to do me a favor?

808
00:51:04,538 --> 00:51:05,583
Well...

809
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:08,610
What... what kind of...?

810
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:11,498
Audrey Hepburn said this.

811
00:51:11,498 --> 00:51:14,052
'Everyone must be saved from pain.'

812
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:17,985
'You must not abandon anyone!'

813
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:19,340
Please!

814
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,585
Please understand the desperation
a mom feels

815
00:51:21,585 --> 00:51:23,469
when she's looking for her lost son!

816
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,963
We need your help and participation!

817
00:51:31,536 --> 00:51:37,322
<i>Has anyone...</i>

818
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:43,748
<i>seen this person?</i>

819
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:47,865
<i>His name is Son Se Yoon...</i>

820
00:51:47,865 --> 00:51:50,429
It's nice to volunteer.

821
00:51:50,429 --> 00:51:54,010
But we could look a bit
all over the place.

822
00:51:55,036 --> 00:51:58,639
We are doing this with a pure intention.

823
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:02,449
There will be a lot of these things.
I hope you're not regretting.

824
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,989
Hello. Please read this.

825
00:52:10,072 --> 00:52:13,364
What am I supposed to do?
Even Madam Oh is involved.

826
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:18,581
Come quickly. I'm worried
what might happen.

827
00:52:28,847 --> 00:52:30,298
Where are you?

828
00:52:30,298 --> 00:52:33,487
She's doing exorcism so
she can find Mr. Son.

829
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:34,829
Really?

830
00:52:34,829 --> 00:52:37,978
I heard she's a famous shaman
from Mia-ri.

831
00:52:43,365 --> 00:52:45,818
What's all this?

832
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,048
How would I know?

833
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:49,710
Gosh.

834
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:53,646
This is such nonsense!

835
00:52:53,646 --> 00:52:55,527
Is this a show or what?

836
00:52:55,576 --> 00:52:59,313
Let's play a round!

837
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:14,898
Oh, my!

838
00:53:21,922 --> 00:53:23,070
Why is she doing that?

839
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,869
I don't know.
I guess a spirit is upon her.

840
00:53:32,423 --> 00:53:33,536
Honey.

841
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:35,353
What's going on?

842
00:53:49,931 --> 00:53:52,327
My son has come!

843
00:53:53,465 --> 00:53:57,202
My son! My poor child!

844
00:53:57,659 --> 00:54:00,673
Come to your mom's arms!

845
00:54:01,181 --> 00:54:04,639
My poor child!

846
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,483
Come to your mom's arms!
Come to my arms!

847
00:54:14,304 --> 00:54:16,443
Oh, Gi Bum!

848
00:54:16,443 --> 00:54:18,313
Gi Bum! What's wrong?

849
00:54:18,485 --> 00:54:19,688
Gi Bum!

850
00:54:20,797 --> 00:54:24,215
What's wrong?
What's wrong with you?

851
00:54:24,336 --> 00:54:26,226
Gi Bum! What's wrong?

852
00:54:53,233 --> 00:54:55,027
Are you Se Yoon?

853
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:57,485
Yes, Mom.

854
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,532
My poor child!

855
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:02,443
Welcome back!

856
00:55:02,443 --> 00:55:05,682
Welcome back, my child!

857
00:55:05,682 --> 00:55:07,409
Mom!

858
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:09,679
My child!

859
00:55:18,018 --> 00:55:19,605
What's wrong with him?

860
00:55:20,878 --> 00:55:22,222
Director Bong.

861
00:55:22,222 --> 00:55:23,389
Yes.

862
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,099
It must be hard on you.

863
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:28,378
Because of me...

864
00:55:28,416 --> 00:55:31,820
Not at all, Mr. Son.

865
00:55:33,536 --> 00:55:34,722
Producer Lee.

866
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:36,028
Yeah?

867
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:52,608
Mr. Yoon.

868
00:55:53,221 --> 00:55:55,373
Yeah?

869
00:56:01,873 --> 00:56:05,045
How could you... out of all...

870
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:07,822
It's not a mistake...

871
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:11,362
Wake up, Gi Bum! You aren't Mr. Son!

872
00:56:11,362 --> 00:56:14,112
Wake up! Wake up!

873
00:56:27,869 --> 00:56:29,891
My poor child.

874
00:56:31,032 --> 00:56:32,920
Who did this to you?

875
00:56:33,588 --> 00:56:34,983
Mom...

876
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,072
It's one of them here.

877
00:56:38,985 --> 00:56:40,215
Who?

878
00:56:41,989 --> 00:56:45,085
That person is...

879
00:56:48,222 --> 00:56:49,989
That person is...

880
00:56:52,918 --> 00:56:54,817
That person is...

881
00:56:55,684 --> 00:56:56,909
What...

882
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:23,351
I, Yoon Tae Soo, will take care
of Kim Eun Ok until my death.

883
00:57:23,427 --> 00:57:25,434
I don't need this.

884
00:57:25,536 --> 00:57:27,452
Don't you hate me?

885
00:57:29,005 --> 00:57:31,059
I'm like a worm.

886
00:57:31,536 --> 00:57:35,164
Go, just go.

887
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:38,231
Go. Just go!

888
00:57:50,686 --> 00:57:53,840
Tae Soo! I'm so sorry!

889
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,472
Tae Soo! I'm sorry!

890
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:00,719
Tae Soo, come down!

891
00:58:01,369 --> 00:58:03,085
I am sorry!

892
00:58:03,197 --> 00:58:05,612
Please get down!

893
00:58:05,688 --> 00:58:07,838
I did wrong.

894
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:12,139
Tae Soo! Tae Soo!

895
00:58:12,463 --> 00:58:15,621
Tae Soo, get down!

896
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:18,889
Tae Soo!

897
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:30,498
You are in here.

898
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:33,268
You are in here.

899
00:58:34,146 --> 00:58:35,628
My child!

900
00:58:36,414 --> 00:58:38,657
Where are you now?

901
00:58:38,804 --> 00:58:41,809
Half way up Bong Gal Mountain.

902
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,677
Where exactly?

903
00:58:43,677 --> 00:58:47,327
In the back of the pine tree forest.

904
00:58:47,443 --> 00:58:49,246
Bong Gal Mountain?

905
00:58:49,335 --> 00:58:50,704
Stay focused.

906
00:58:50,704 --> 00:58:52,003
Bong Gal Mountain!

907
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,289
Don't worry.

908
00:58:53,289 --> 00:58:55,476

Cross! Do you have a cross or garlic?

They are useless.
Just knock him out!

Over here! There's something here!

920
01:00:34,467 --> 01:00:35,835

Take it out!
