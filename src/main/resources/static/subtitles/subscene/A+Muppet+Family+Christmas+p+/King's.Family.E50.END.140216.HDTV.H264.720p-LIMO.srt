00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,470
You didn't know Miho's your daughter?

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,470
Dad, let's eat.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,670
Did you tell Miho to call me dad?

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,060
No.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,600
Miho said she wanted to.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,040
I'm grateful, but I hope she doesn't for now.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,070
It's Aeji.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,840
Miho is...

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,540
It's nothing.

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,870
Let me see.

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,940
I have something to tell you.

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,560
Go ahead.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,440
Don't be surprised.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,690
I tried to tell you, but I couldn't.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,260
What's he doing?

17
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,840
It's Mr. Ko.

18
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,590
Please open the door.

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,900
Huh?

20
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,470
How...

21
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,440
Why didn't you tell me?

22
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,200
Why didn't you tell me about Miho?

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,300
I didn't want to give such a precious gift to someone who didn't want her.

24
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:22,700
I wanted to wait for the right moment.

25
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,230
But I never got it.

26
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,530
Come home.

27
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,340
Are you getting on or not?

28
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm getting on.

29
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,400
Sunjeong.

30
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,100
I'm leaving.

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,230
I'll call you when Miho gets married.

32
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,300
You can walk her down the aisle.

33
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,870
That's all we need.

34
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,730
Sunjeong.

35
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,500
Sunjeong!

36
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,590
Sunjeong! Sunjeong!

37
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,300
Sunjeong!

38
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,130
Sunjeong!

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,660
Don't, please!

40
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,130
Please don't hurt me.

41
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,160
Please don't call the police, please.

42
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,340
Give it.

43
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,190
What?

44
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,330
The money from selling my in-laws house.

45
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,100
I don't have it...

46
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,940
Sedal,

47
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,960
talking to him won't get the job done.

48
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,090
There's nobody here.

49
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,940
We can take care of him without anyone finding out.

50
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,240
How should we handle him, Sedal?

51
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,900
Calm down, calm down.

52
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,960
Let's hold off on that for now.

53
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,960
Remember the guy we buried 3 days ago?

54
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,030
Wait, did we use this excavator?

55
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,440
Where did we bury him? Around here?

56
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,370
Huh? You bastard!

57
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,130
Please don't kill me.

58
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,360
There's too many for me to remember.

59
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,670
Uh, please! Please hold on.

60
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,600
I'll give you the money back,

61
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,870
so please don't call the police.

62
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,560
Please.

63
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,390
Yes! We did it! We did it!

64
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,500
Yes! Yes! Yes!

65
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,130
What happened? 
Why are the kids here?

66
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,530
Don't even bring it up. Aeji got hurt.

67
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,400
How?

68
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,440
She's been through so much that

69
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,600
she tried to come home all by herself.

70
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,600
Raise them like they are her own?

71
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,170
Yeah, right.

72
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,670
I couldn't do that.

73
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,040
Women who raise other's kids are saints.

74
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,970
Even your own kids drive you crazy.

75
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,290
Just cut to the chase.

76
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,400
Must I spell it out?
She was abused.

77
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,130
I just can't believe that woman.

78
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,830
Aeji said she was really mean to her.

79
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,060
You can't believe everything kids say.

80
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,370
What did Subak say?

81
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,670
She said she's keeping them.
She was furious.

82
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,170
Where did she go?

83
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,560
She went to get training.

84
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,760
Father! Mother!

85
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,470
Oh, my!

86
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,390
What? Is that true?

87
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,960
Bong, we're saved, we're saved.

88
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,060
I can't believe my ears.
Is that true?

89
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,800
Oh, God, Buddha, thank you.

90
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,800
- How did you get it back?
- Well,

91
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,770
Sangnam was on the same plane with him.

92
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,870
It was like a Bond movie.

93
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,970
Minjung was with us, too, but he had to go.

94
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,960
The 3 of us captured him and beat him up,

95
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,690
and we told him to spit out the money.

96
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,130
And I was acting all angry and crazy.

97
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,390
It was actually quite fun.

98
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,590
I'm sure the Korean was nothing compared to it!

99
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,690
Right, grandmother.

100
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,440
It was like an action film.

101
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,870
Oh, this is nuts.

102
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,260
Sedal, you're amazing.

103
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,090
Hey, what did you do with him?

104
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,270
We took him to the police.

105
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,690
He begged us not to take him there,

106
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,330
but we took him right over.

107
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,390
Good job.

108
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,290
Good, good.

109
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,770
Today was the auction day,

110
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,890
so we went to court and got the house back.

111
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,060
For some reason, it didn't sell.

112
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,890
Because it's our house.

113
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,760
They put that notice on the door

114
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,760
so every neighbor could see it,

115
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,760
but it was meant for us.

116
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,940
I wanted someone to buy it...

117
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,440
Good job, Sedal, Good job, Sangnam.

118
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,040
Our son in laws saved us.

119
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,440
I'm worthless.

120
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,870
That you are!

121
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,690
Sedal!

122
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,890
Don left.

123
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,890
Hey come back inside!

124
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,730
Come in, come in! Make us some pizza.

125
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,460
Wang Subak! Wang Subak!

126
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,790
Good news! Great news!

127
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,170
Really?

128
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,370
Is that true, uncle?

129
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,540
Yes!

130
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,590
Your parents are ecstatic.

131
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,860
I can't believe this really happened!

132
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,900
Don't cry.

133
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,900
You must be so happy.

134
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,270
You can finally relax.

135
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,190
Look how excited you are.

136
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,040
It must have been really great.

137
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,830
You caught me.

138
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,130
Unbelievable.

139
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,470
You didn't even say hi to me at the airport!

140
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,960
- Who was she?
- What?

141
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,960
That girl you followed.
Who was she?

142
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,890
- Girl?
- I saw you following her.

143
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,190
You did?

144
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,640
Wasn't she pretty?

145
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,040
Tell me who she was.

146
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,740
After I change.

147
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,190
Tell me!

148
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,170
I went to the airport because I felt badly

149
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,670
for sending you after a fight.

150
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,040
[I'm sorry about the fight]
See?

151
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,590
[I'm sorry about the fight]
I'm going to do this for you.

152
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,060
[I'll be good to you]
I was going to flip these pages.

153
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,360
[I'll be a good wife]
I was so excited about this.

154
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,590
Do it now.

155
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,760
Are you kidding me?

156
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,000
You wrote them, so let me see them.

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,490
Forget it.

158
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,790
I won't do it again. I'm sure of it.

159
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,040
Wow, this is like in the movies!

160
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,670
When did you make this?

161
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't look at it!

162
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,060
Yes, mom, what is it?

163
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,270
Sangnam? He's here.

164
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,690
What?

165
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,770
What do you mean?

166
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,800
You got the house back?

167
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,670
Really? Really, mom?

168
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,330
Oh, my.

169
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,860
Okay, mom.

170
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,670
My darling husband.

171
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,870
Oh...

172
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,800
Thank you for welcoming me like this.

173
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,060
But what do I do?
I need to go see her.

174
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,940
Oh, no, no. 
Don't go, don't go.

175
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,000
Everywhere.

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,530
Kiss me everywhere, to a point where it makes you wonder if you should be doing it.

177
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,360
How can you be such a darling?

178
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,260
Honey, I have something to tell you, too.

179
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,140
Sweetie!

180
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,170
Yes, father!

181
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,760
Sweetie?

182
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,240
Did he just call you that?

183
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,360
Yes, I'm sweetie.

184
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,940
Father and I made up.

185
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,440
We had a drinking competition.

186
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,900
Really? Who won?

187
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,170
I did, of course.

188
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,140
But I think I shouldn't have done that.

189
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,870
I should've let him win.

190
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,090
I didn't know what he had in mind.

191
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,730
Why am I so slow at catching things like that?

192
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,990
You just realized that now?

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,160
Ugh!

194
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,330
Sweetie!

195
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,860
Yes, I'm coming, father.

196
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,560
I like him much more than you.

197
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,860
He gave me a cafe.

198
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,890
I'm materialistic, you know?

199
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,170
Father, I'm coming!

200
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,170
Oh, how exciting!

201
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,590
- The weather's so nice!
- It's so light!

202
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,300
I'm so happy that it doesn't feel heavy!

203
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,960
Oh, my!

204
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,800
House, it's been a while!
How have you been?

205
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,500
Oh, it's so nice to be back.

206
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,790
Let's go in.

207
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,240
Bong, you go in first.

208
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,160
Okay.

209
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,460
We should get our stuff from the storage.

210
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,960
Yes, yes.

211
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,300
It's been a while.
How have you been?

212
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,640
Oh, home sweet home!

213
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,940
I'm so happy.

214
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,540
Oh...

215
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,060
Hey! Hey!

216
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,590
What is it?

217
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,330
Where's the doorplate?

218
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,040
- It's gone.
- What?

219
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,560
You said you won't need it.

220
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,590
I tossed it into the fire.

221
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,960
How dare you!

222
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,230
Get out!

223
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,160
The doorplate is more important to me!

224
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,300
Oh, I can't believe this.

225
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,060
Here, here it is.

226
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,690
I packed this first.

227
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,940
You would've thrown me out if I hadn't.

228
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,190
Of course.

229
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,440
This is a very important doorplate.

230
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,590
Good-off and Hobak look good.

231
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,040
You don't fight anymore?

232
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,240
They haven't fought in a while.

233
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,660
How are you feeling?

234
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,640
Good.

235
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,300
You should have another baby.

236
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,330
When you get pregnant, I'll take care of you.

237
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,490
I'll cook you anything you want.

238
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,160
I'll take care of you after you give birth.

239
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,300
You promise?

240
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,690
Hobak, let's go.

241
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,590
Where?

242
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,730
She wants us to make a baby.
Let's go and...

243
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,860
Stop this!

244
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,170
Why you little...

245
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,140
How about you?

246
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,560
Hold on. It's coming.

247
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,130
Say that after you get pregnant.

248
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,640
I know. It only took us...

249
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,240
That's nothing to brag about.

250
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,360
Right.

251
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,490
You should focus on each other from now on.

252
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,230
We will. We won't have time to be otherwise.

253
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,140
I did take him back to get my revenge.

254
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,560
I didn't understand women who take their

255
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,540
husbands back after they've cheated on them.

256
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,040
But now I do.

257
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,960
Although I did it to make him work for me.

258
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,130
Be honest. You did it because you love him.

259
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,060
I didn't love him back then.

260
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,300
I wanted to pay him back for what he did,

261
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,690
but marriage is a funny thing.

262
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,490
If that happened with a friend,

263
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,940
we would've become mortal enemies,

264
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,830
but it was different. I felt sorry for him.

265
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,360
That's what marriage is about.

266
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,530
Love turns into that after 10 years.

267
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,270
You feel sorry you can't do more for your spouse.

268
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,940
The two of you become one.

269
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,490
That's how a marriage lasts.

270
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,130
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

271
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:15,140
I pity those who are old and single.

272
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,370
That reminds me of Sedal's mother.

273
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,660
Your mom must feel very lonely.

274
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,800
Find out if she wants to meet someone.

275
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,370
You don't need to worry about my mom.

276
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,460
She has me and Yeongdal, so she's happy.

277
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,730
- Sedal.
- That's enough.

278
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,530
I don't feel comfortable with it.

279
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,170
- You don't know anything.
- But I do.

280
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,560
- What?
- I heard.

281
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,540
So? Mother is human and a woman.

282
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,740
And she never abandoned you.

283
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,460
You went to sleep at night, 

284
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,460
holding onto her skirt, afraid she might run away.

285
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,360
But my mom isn't a bad woman.

286
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,360
I know.

287
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,890
She was younger than me at the time,

288
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,560
so I understand her and feel bad for her.

289
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,300
It must have been really hard for her.

290
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,060
I don't know if I could've done the same.

291
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,400
You should get over it.

292
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,600
You have me.

293
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,530
Oh...

294
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,530
Sedal,

295
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,330
we should get her free.

296
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,190
Are you sleeping?

297
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,030
No, I'm not sleepy at all.

298
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,290
Ugh...

299
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,440
You must be the happiest one here.

300
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,170
I'd never imagined it.

301
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,990
I wanted to buy you a house.

302
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,900
As if that will ever happen.

303
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,730
You should take care of yourself first.

304
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,560
Has Minjung called?

305
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,900
No.

306
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,670
He didn't even call when the kids are here?

307
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,460
He must have completely lost his mind.

308
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,790
Men are like that.

309
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,090
I'm going to wait and see.

310
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,670
Don, I'm so happy.

311
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:39,290
I had no idea how happy I'd feel about having a room all to ourselves.

312
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,890
I don't want a house.

313
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,100
All I need is a room.

314
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,300
Yeongdal, I love you because of this.

315
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,490
You used to like rich men before.

316
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,640
I was crazy back then.

317
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,840
Meeting you changed my views.

318
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,570
You must really love me.

319
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,800
My beautiful princess.

320
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,760
Oh...

321
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,040
Get me some tea.

322
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,960
The person you called is unavailable...

323
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,260
It's our opening day, so let's do a good job.

324
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,330
Let's do this!

325
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,040
- What are you doing?
- When did you come?

326
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,260
Just now.

327
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,990
I'm going to start writing.

328
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,760
You'll ave a writer daughter in law soon.

329
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,990
[Go for it!]
I heard this is the best drink on the menu.

330
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,030
[Go for it!]
You pour chocolate over it?

331
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,960
Thank you.

332
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,560
I'll drink this and write like mad.

333
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,600
And badmouth your father in law?

334
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,400
No, I have nothing bad to say about you!

335
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,670
Not having any flaws is your flaw.

336
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,000
You...

337
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,560
Hello?

338
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,100
Yes. I'll see you there.

339
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,170
Medical report, tax report, family record.

340
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,570
Were you upset because I asked for these?

341
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,840
No.

342
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:22,830
I know you're worried about your mother meeting some worthless bum.

343
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,300
Thank you for understanding.

344
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,590
I'll review these and call you.

345
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,900
But haven't we met somewhere?

346
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,070
I thought that, too.

347
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,600
Did you attend Yeongnam High School?

348
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,900
No.

349
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,400
College? I majored in law.

350
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,670
I didn't go to college.

351
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,300
How about army service?

352
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,530
I was stationed in Gangwon-do Province.

353
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,730
I was stationed way down south.

354
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,530
Oh!

355
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,090
- The fishing vessel!
- The used excavator!

356
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,870
No...

357
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,530
Let's think about it.

358
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,170
- Okay.
- Bye.

359
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,230
Oh!

360
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,940
The wedding!

361
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,370
Right! You were the host!

362
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,460
You're Gwangbak's father in law!

363
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,770
How can this be?

364
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,400
You won't need these, right?

365
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,670
I should check the medical exam.

366
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,140
Just look at me.

367
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,370
From head to toe,

368
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,040
from bones to blood,

369
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,060
from muscles to fat,

370
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,100
I'm totally clean.

371
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,400
Why couldn't you recognize me?

372
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,100
Man.

373
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,630
What is it?

374
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,840
Give me some new skin care stuff.

375
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,570
Is it a gift? For whom?

376
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,000
My step dad.

377
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,440
What did you just say?

378
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,230
Your step dad?

379
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,940
I met him and he seemed decent.

380
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,370
But promise me you'll be happy.

381
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,190
If you're not, I won't let it slide.

382
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,690
Oh, Sedal!

383
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,840
Mom, please...

384
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,970
Oh, mom.

385
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,900
I love you.

386
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,840
Really?

387
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,190
Sedal, you're so amazing.

388
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,340
Good job. Kiss, kiss!

389
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,140
I'll see you later.

390
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,190
You look like you're newlyweds.

391
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,960
We're stuck together, so I might as well...

392
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,460
Whatever, Hobak.

393
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,400
You're really amazing.

394
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,440
I thought you were going to kill each other.

395
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,440
Tell me how you did it.

396
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,690
I'll tell you when you get married. I'll be back.

397
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,900
- Come in.
- Okay.

398
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,560
Huh? Father.

399
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,000
Welcome.

400
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,200
Say hi. My mom.

401
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,140
Hello.

402
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,770
Why are we...

403
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,190
Let's have lunch. Sit.

404
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,290
Okay.

405
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,870
Sedal, your mother is beautiful.

406
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,870
You're a smart man. You pass.

407
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,400
Is today a special day?

408
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,440
Sedal told me to wear a suit, so I did.

409
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:50,530
We're going to be brothers.

410
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,670
Hello.

411
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,030
Oh, welcome. Sit down.

412
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,290
They called you, too?

413
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,360
Of course.

414
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,230
Hello.

415
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,560
I'm her one and only daughter in law.

416
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,270
I heard I should thank you for making this happen.

417
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,900
Thank you.

418
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,260
There's no need to be that formal.

419
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,230
I'll work on that.

420
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,960
Hobak, what happens to our family tree?

421
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,870
It's too complicated to talk about.

422
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,230
Let's have the wedding in the spring.

423
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,400
And let's keep it simple.

424
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,730
Wedding?
Who's getting married?

425
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,440
You don't know?

426
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,070
I just came because Sedal called me.

427
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,170
What's going on here?

428
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,390
Man...

429
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,690
Where have you been?
Just look at them.

430
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,600
I still don't get it.

431
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,500
Oh, no.

432
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,860
Sangnam, what's going on here is...

433
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,230
You idiot.

434
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,190
You can't tell what's going on here?

435
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:02,060
Hobak's mother in law and your father are getting married.

436
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,640
Really?

437
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,340
You thought I'd say that?

438
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,670
I was just pretending.

439
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,540
Why are you looking at me like that?

440
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,940
I'm serious. I knew it all along.

441
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,570
What's so funny?

442
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,840
- Huh?
- Hello.

443
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,070
Jangbi,

444
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,570
this is the woman I'm going to marry.

445
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,540
Congratulations.

446
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,440
Take good care of our immature Daese.

447
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,690
I'm immature, too.

448
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,600
It's my treat. Start ordering.

449
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,800
Can I order a large order of the noodles?

450
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,660
Or can we get the lunch course?

451
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,300
Mother, that's my leg.

452
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,790
Oh, no.

453
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,540
What were you doing under the table?

454
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,030
Mom!

455
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,230
Daese.

456
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,730
Sunjeong, it's me.

457
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,070
Congratulate me.
I'm getting married.

458
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,800
You are?

459
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,690
Come to Seoul and say hello to her.

460
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,170
I'm sorry, Daese.

461
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,440
I'll just come to your wedding.

462
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,640
I don't want to go to Seoul just yet.

463
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,230
Okay. Is Miho doing okay?

464
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,730
Yes.

465
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,730
Daese, don't worry about me.

466
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,960
We are doing fine here.

467
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,460
It's like I've returned to the beginning again.

468
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,400
Nothing has changed.

469
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,590
Take care and good luck with your wedding preparations.

470
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,190
Goodbye.

471
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,840
The person you called is unavailable,

472
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,440
so your call will be directed to voice mail.

473
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,230
Sunjeong, where are you?

474
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,800
Just tell me where you are.

475
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,190
If you don't want to talk, text me.

476
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,640
I'll come right over, okay?

477
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,870
Please answer the phone.

478
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,000
Sunjeong, I'm sorry.

479
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,030
I'll get down on my knees and beg.

480
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,940
Sunjeong, where are you?

481
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,170
Please tell me.

482
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,140
Just tell me where you are.

483
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,770
I miss Miho.

484
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,300
How can you be so dense?

485
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,290
Would she live with you if Miho wasn't yours?

486
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,590
I just can't believe how dense you are!

487
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,440
Miho looks just like you!

488
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:59,760
Sunjeong, please answer my call.

489
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,990
I want to hear your voice.

490
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,060
Tell me where you are.

491
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,830
I've been awful to Miho.

492
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:17,760
I want to hold her in my arms.

493
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,670
I want Miho to call me dad, Sunjeong.

494
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:31,870
I know I don't deserve an ounce of pity.

495
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,960
You raised my girl all alone.

496
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,290
Can I hold her in my arms?

497
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,170
Sunjeong, where are you?

498
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,860
Where are you?

499
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,600
Please.

500
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,570
Sunjeong!

501
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,090
Success for Wang Don's pizza!

502
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,070
Success! Success! Success!

503
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,540
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

504
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,960
Tough days are over for you, Don.

505
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,400
- Mom! 
- Yes, yes.

506
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,640
Don, I hope you become successful.

507
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,600
And make lots of money.

508
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,270
Yes, Bong.

509
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,490
I'll be the breadwinner from now on.

510
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,790
So you just enjoy yourself.

511
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,590
Let's all enjoy ourselves from now on.

512
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:32,040
No, I'm still young.

513
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,170
I'm going to open an after school program.

514
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,070
The kids have nowhere to study.

515
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,070
Many of them can't afford academy programs.

516
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,840
I was a teacher, so I should do that.

517
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,400
Gwangbak said she'll help.

518
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,440
Hello.

519
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,600
You're here!

520
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,940
Loser! You finally have your own business!

521
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,460
Loser? Stop calling me that.

522
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,990
- Beat him up.
- Oh!

523
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,860
Do it. It's okay.

524
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,990
Don, congratulations!

525
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,460
Mother...

526
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,290
Congratulations, Mrs. Park.

527
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,070
Your son's still good for nothing,

528
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,770
but your son in law is the owner here!

529
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,260
What are you implying?

530
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,170
I'm not implying anything.

531
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,170
You gave your children to us.

532
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,460
What will you do from now on?

533
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,440
The thought of that keeps me up at night.

534
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,340
It shouldn't keep you up at night.

535
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,440
You did a good thing.

536
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,530
You raised your children well.

537
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,900
I thought they weren't all that special,

538
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:43,800
but Sedal and Yeongdal are all very nice.

539
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,560
You really think so?

540
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,170
Of course.

541
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,030
I actually envy you.

542
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,960
You ran a hair salon and now a makeup shop.

543
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,870
You've done everything you wanted to do,

544
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,670
and now you're getting married again.

545
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,460
But I envied you.

546
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,940
People respected you for your husband,

547
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,760
had five children,

548
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,960
and your husband is alive and well.

549
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,600
That's nothing to be envious of.

550
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,690
Try living with my husband for a week.

551
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,170
Then you'll know.

552
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,070
The grass is always greener on the other side.

553
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,170
Right.

554
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,530
I hope you have a happy life.

555
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,940
I'll come to your wedding.

556
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,440
What are you two doing?

557
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,960
It's a secret.

558
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,230
Did you pack everything?

559
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,340
Just about. I'm coming back.

560
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,630
I'll come to the orientation party.

561
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:53,130
I feel relieved now we got our house back.

562
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,670
You have to become a captain.

563
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,240
Life isn't all that special.

564
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,600
So do what you want to do.

565
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,490
- Mom. 
- Mom.

566
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,400
Mom.

567
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,840
Why are you all here?

568
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:16,030
We came because Haebak's leaving tomorrow.

569
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,630
Oh, it's not like she's getting married.

570
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,330
She's doing what she wants, so I'm okay.

571
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,490
Then why do you look like you'll cry?

572
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,440
I'm not!

573
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,670
Mom.

574
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,570
Tada!

575
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,740
What's that?

576
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,170
Dollar undies.

577
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,360
Tada!

578
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,990
Really?

579
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,190
She went to the factory to get them.

580
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,500
You can put two or three pairs on now.

581
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,400
Look at how she loves them.

582
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,670
I'll get you more if they get worn out.

583
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,300
I'm in charge of mom's undies from now on.

584
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,600
Lucky you, mom!

585
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,330
Aunt said she'll supply you with makeup,

586
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,370
uncles said he'll feed you pizza,

587
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,830
Subak said she'll buy you handbags,

588
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,400
and Hobak will buy you undies.

589
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,360
What will you get me?

590
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,030
Your favorite! Money!

591
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,100
Look at her laughing.
She loves money.

592
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,960
No! I'm sick of money.

593
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,400
Oh, that's great news!

594
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,760
Mom, I heard money plays games, too.

595
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:15,360
It only comes to you when you're not into it.

596
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,830
That's why I'm not going to be into it.

597
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,570
Subak, isn't your job hard?

598
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,670
I heard you have to learn things.

599
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,090
I hate learning, but this is fun.

600
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,730
Even the training is fun, too.

601
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,900
How is your writing coming?

602
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,590
I feel like I'm a writer already.

603
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,530
We'll see about that.

604
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,490
But am I not the most successful?

605
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,630
Subak missed the Miss Korea pageant,

606
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,490
- and Hobak...
- Didn't become an announcer.

607
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,760
- What?
- Stop that!

608
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,460
I can become Miss Korea if I want to.

609
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,630
I was in the Miss Korea pageant.

610
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,570
I'm my company's announcer.

611
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,170
- Mom, what was your dream?
- Me?

612
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,970
It wasn't anything special.

613
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,070
In the old days, everyone wanted to

614
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,970
meet a nice man and build a family.

615
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,870
Then you realized your dream.

616
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,290
Madam Lee Anggeum,

617
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,600
how do you feel about realizing your dream?

618
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,130
You sound like a real announcer.

619
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,730
IN my next life...

620
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:27,490
I hope to study and become a great person

621
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,030
and do whatever I want to do.

622
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:40,400
I want to meet men and go abroad and study.

623
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:45,470
Not just as a wife or a mother.

624
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,500
But live as myself, Lee Anggeum.

625
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,030
Then you should study, like Subak.

626
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,090
In my next life!
It's too late for me now.

627
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,400
Mom, do you regret having us?

628
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,990
What do you think?

629
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,490
Mom! Ouch!

630
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,900
The number you have dialed is not in service.

631
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,590
Please check the number again.

632
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,960
Please.

633
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,100
Tell me where she is.

634
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,630
She won't pick up the phone or answer my texts.

635
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,630
And I think she changed her number.

636
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,860
I'm going crazy.

637
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,960
Sunjeong doesn't want to see you.

638
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,100
I'm begging you.

639
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,970
When she left saying she's going to be happy from now on,

640
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,840
she was glowing, but as time went by,

641
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,300
she lost weight and was full of worries.

642
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,370
I'm sorry.

643
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,990
I think it's over between you.

644
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,800
You should move on.

645
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,870
I have nothing else to say.

646
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,090
I...

647
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,760
Daese.

648
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,460
He says he's going crazy.

649
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,770
Sunjeong, I think you should see him.

650
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,730
No.

651
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,760
I left him for a reason,

652
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,990
and I don't want to get back with him.

653
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,070
What we had between us has been long gone.

654
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:53,490
It was silly of me to try to reconnect.

655
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,070
I should've just kept him in my heart.

656
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,200
He lost a lot of weight.

657
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:04,540
He found out about Miho after you left.

658
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,340
I'm sure he's dying inside.

659
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,170
That can't be helped.

660
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,590
He'll just have to deal with it.

661
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,130
But think about Miho.

662
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,290
I'm doing this for Miho.

663
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,670
I don't want to hurt her anymore.

664
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,800
I couldn't deal with it anymore.

665
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,170
He didn't know she was his.

666
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,870
Daese,

667
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,460
I appreciate you coming here.

668
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,640
But I won't change my mind.
I won't go back.

669
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,900
You might feel sorry for him now,

670
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,840
but he'll go back to his other kids.

671
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,900
My presence will only make things hard for him.

672
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,570
Let's not talk about him.

673
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,340
What about you?
Are you okay?

674
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,970
If he's okay, I'm okay.

675
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,100
It was like that in the past.

676
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,760
When he smiles, I smile.

677
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:02,460
When he's in pain, I'm in pain.

678
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,100
And it's the same now.

679
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,830
I was happy while it lasted.

680
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,970
Does Miho know?

681
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,170
No, I haven't told her.

682
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,800
I'll tell her when she gets married.

683
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,530
Her dad should walk her down the aisle.

684
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,630
She grew up without a father.

685
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,940
She should at least get that.

686
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,840
That's enough for us.

687
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:36,940
You can be pretty scary, you know?

688
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,340
I have to be, if I'm to raise my child alone.

689
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,440
Daese,

690
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:47,530
don't tell him where I am. Never.

691
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,970
You're here.

692
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,700
- Want a drink?
- No thanks.

693
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,300
You are just too much!

694
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,400
I knew you were crazy about her,

695
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,760
but this is too much.

696
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:00,030
Why didn't you come to me to apologize after kicking Aeji out?

697
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,400
How come you didn't say anything to me?

698
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,940
How can you just turn your back on us?

699
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,630
This is what you wanted, wasn't it?

700
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,440
Now that you've kicked my kids out,

701
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,130
are you enjoying yourselves?

702
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,260
Yes, I am.

703
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:28,530
I'm so happy I can fly.

704
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,300
I'm keeping the children.

705
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:40,440
But you should come and see them.

706
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:45,070
You're their dad, so be there for them.

707
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:51,190
Okay, I will.

708
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,840
And...

709
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,640
You're mistaken.

710
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,030
She never mistreated the kids.

711
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,760
She's not like that.

712
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,760
She was great to them.

713
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:11,170
You're defending her in front of me?

714
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,130
You're impossible.

715
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,460
She's gone.

716
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,100
She left that day.

717
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:30,600
You're not living together?

718
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,170
Miho...

719
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,790
She's mine.

720
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:49,360
She's my daughter.

721
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:58,670
I found out after they left.

722
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:05,670
She never told me that Miho's my daughter.

723
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,590
She never did.

724
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,140
I didn't even know that.

725
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:22,260
When Miho called me dad, I told her to stop.

726
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:29,030
Aeji kept crying, saying that I'm her dad,

727
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,900
telling her not to call me dad,

728
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,170
so I told her not to.

729
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,730
I only thought about Aeji.

730
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:47,900
I didn't care about how Miho felt.

731
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,530
I'm worthless.

732
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,260
I don't even know where they are.

733
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:34,130
If they are alive or dead...

734
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,840
Miho!

735
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,860
Miho!

736
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,940
Mr. Ko!

737
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,040
Miho!

738
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,760
How have you been?

739
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,170
Fine.

740
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,940
What are you doing here?

741
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,740
I came to see you.

742
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,770
I wanted to see you, Miho.

743
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:24,030
Can we shake hands?

744
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,190
Miho,

745
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:44,090
may I give you a hug?

746
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,260
Miho!

747
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,530
That looks so good on you.

748
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,730
I think that purse was waiting for you.

749
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:32,860
Goodbye.

750
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,240
Aeji.

751
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,040
Mom's getting paid today.

752
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,840
Aren't you happy?

753
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,840
Of course, I'm getting you a gift.

754
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:49,840
Wait with your dad.

755
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,740
Hi. Isn't it cold?

756
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,040
It's gotten warmer.

757
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,340
It's spring.

758
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:19,760
Jungji, give mommy a kiss.

759
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,500
Mom!

760
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,630
How was your day?

761
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,140
What did you buy?

762
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,690
They're not for you.

763
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,070
Sunjeong, it's me.

764
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:33,960
Welcome.

765
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,900
Oh, that smells good.

766
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,470
I made spicy octopus.

767
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,270
Oh, that's my favorite.

768
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,360
You must be hungry.
Dinner's almost ready.

769
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:44,330
The kids just ate.

770
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,870
Minjung, open these with the kids.

771
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:50,360
Where's Miho? Miho!

772
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,260
Hello.

773
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,760
You're studying again?

774
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,130
You're nothing like me.

775
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,260
I hated studying when I was a student.

776
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:00,900
This is yours.

777
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,630
It's a dress.
I hope you like it.

778
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,590
Thank you.

779
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,130
Everything you buy is so pretty.

780
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:10,640
Wow!

781
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,360
How do I look, dad?

782
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,330
Pretty. The prettiest.

783
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,070
Aeji, isn't she pretty? Right?

784
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,340
Yes.

785
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:22,070
Here, the short armed, short legged, dense,

786
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,140
and uselessly taciturn 

787
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,630
Ko Minjung brought you coffee.

788
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,170
Should I give you a kiss as a tip?

789
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,030
No thank you.

790
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,760
Being taciturn isn't good.

791
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:37,960
It can drive someone crazy.

792
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,870
You should tell her how you feel.

793
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,060
I won't take you back if Sunjeong dumps you.

794
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,470
If he acts mean, call me right away.

795
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,740
Okay.

796
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:52,130
He's been texting some woman at work.

797
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,530
Really?

798
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,940
No way!

799
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,260
Who is she?

800
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:59,360
I should go slap her silly.

801
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,360
Give me your phone.

802
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,560
When did I ever?
Why would you say that?

803
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,970
I should hide before I get into more trouble.

804
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,400
You're not going to do the dishes?

805
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:09,990
Call me later.

806
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,340
Is it true?

807
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,570
I was joking.

808
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,370
How could he?
With his short arms and legs?

809
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,690
Sunjeong,

810
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,700
don't tell anyone this.

811
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:30,270
I submitted some proposals at work,

812
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:32,840
and they said I'm wasting my talent.

813
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,700
They asked me if I'm interested in studying,

814
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:38,640
and suggested going to Italy to study.

815
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,030
Really?

816
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,690
Wow, that's amazing.

817
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:49,040
I'm going to study handbag design in Italy.

818
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,440
Please don't tell the kids.

819
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,900
You'll be successful. I'm sure of it.

820
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,700
You're not going home?

821
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,640
I am. I was about to.

822
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:13,530
Why don't you check on the kids?

823
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,170
No, I should just go.

824
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,800
Take her home.

825
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:18,990
It's okay.

826
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,460
Hurry.

827
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,670
Don't bother. I'm fine.

828
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,960
Walking with you feels weird.

829
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,870
We never did this even when we were married.

830
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:37,630
I know.

831
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,560
Why did I live like that?
I'm a fool.

832
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:47,940
Why didn't I know before what a good man you are?

833
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:52,340
But I'm glad you're happy.

834
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:58,830
Whenever I visit, you feel like a stranger.

835
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:03,990
I've never seen you laugh like that.

836
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:07,070
You look so happy.

837
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:13,400
Everyone has someone they're meant to be with.

838
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,130
And that breaks my heart.

839
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,130
May I hold your hand?

840
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,670
I'm really sorry.

841
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,340
And thank you.

842
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:48,030
Don't say that.

843
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,440
I'm the one grateful. And I'm sorry.

844
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,130
- Go in.
- It's okay.

845
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,460
This is enough. Bye.

846
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:59,470
Take care!

847
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,260
Oh, it's cold.

848
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:10,440
You're back already?

849
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:13,170
Why didn't you walk her home?

850
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,030
She wanted to go alone.

851
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,760
Oh, man. You're impossible.

852
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:27,140
Subak! Subak!

853
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:33,730
What time is your flight?
Let me come.

854
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,240
It's okay. I want to go alone.

855
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,340
I feel bad letting you go like this.

856
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,300
Thank you for what you've done.

857
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:52,300
If you hadn't come to see me,

858
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,970
I wouldn't be so happy right now.

859
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,590
Please take care of my kids.

860
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:22,490
I'm the only one who can convince you.

861
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:29,360
Can you take care of Aeji and Jungji?

862
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,340
Please.

863
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:35,070
Minjung looks like he's about to die.

864
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,900
Help me save him.

865
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,670
I was never able to take care of them.

866
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,570
I was never a good mother.

867
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:49,170
I gave them up when I divorced him,

868
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,590
but I used them to hold onto Minjung.

869
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:58,460
I'm not doing this because I'm nice.

870
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,600
I think this is the only way.

871
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,840
Please come back.

872
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:18,400
I'm not raising your kids because I'm nice.

873
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:22,070
I rand away because I couldn't handle it.

874
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:27,300
I chose to do this to make myself feel better.

875
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:37,490
Don't worry about anything here. 

876
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,730
I'll take the kids to the airport when you come back.

877
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:46,200
And I'll send their photos every day.

878
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:50,560
Thank you,

879
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,700
Sunjeong.

880
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:14,300
Okay, clap your hands and focus!

881
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,970
[30 years later]
Today is Gwangbak's 60th birthday.

882
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,670
And except for Daebak who's in the US,

883
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,700
everyone came to celebrate it.

884
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,600
First of all, happy birthday, Gwangbak.

885
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,190
Oh!

886
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,600
Thank you.

887
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,030
60th birthdays are such a bother!

888
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,230
That's why we only got a cake.

889
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:45,690
Who knew we'd really live to be 100?

890
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:48,770
How old are you, mother?

891
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,530
After I hit 100,

892
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,340
I stopped counting.

893
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:56,440
Funeral homes all went bankrupt, I heard.

894
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:00,840
I can't believe my ears.

895
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,490
Believe it because I've heard that, too.

896
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,400
Me too.

897
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:07,070
Okay,

898
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,260
now that the original members are all here,

899
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:14,840
tell us what you've been doing.

900
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:21,190
My parents have passed away, so I've been thinking of this family as my own.

901
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:25,770
The kids are all grown up and married.

902
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:32,490
My company became the 3rd biggest in the world.

903
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,340
You know how many awards I've won,

904
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:38,240
and the last handbag I designed was a huge hit,

905
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:41,600
and I'm exporting them all.

906
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,260
Even the US President carries my handbag.

907
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:51,370
The domestic branches were a huge success,

908
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:56,230
and now my pizza shop is in China, too.

909
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:01,600
As you know already, I'm a best selling writer.

910
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,800
My most recent book sold 10 million copies in 1 week.

911
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:09,570
I'm sick and tired of counting money.

912
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,670
So I got a money counting machine.

913
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,530
I make a lot of money, too.

914
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,490
I quit my captain job

915
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,400
and passed the coast pilot test.

916
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,400
Retirement age now is 80, right?

917
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,340
Yes.

918
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,370
I have a dozen or so years left,

919
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:32,790
and they want me to be their vice president.

920
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,360
I'm trying to have a baby.

921
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,130
Medicine's so advance these days,

922
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,170
that it's actually possible.

923
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,140
Stop lying, all of you!

924
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:48,230
You're all liars!

925
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,530
This is nuts.

926
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:56,760
How amazing would that be if that were true?

927
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,460
I know.

928
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:04,260
Writer, captain.

929
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:06,860
Who cares if you couldn't be those?

930
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,760
If you're healthy, that's all that matters.

931
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:10,860
Of course.

932
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:14,230
You shouldn't be too greedy.

933
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,800
How does it feel to be old?

934
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:18,240
You're right, grandmother.

935
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:23,670
When you're old, money doesn't matter.

936
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,440
I wonder why I worked so hard.

937
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:29,630
I should've enjoyed myself more.

938
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,030
I know.

939
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:34,840
Why you little!

940
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:37,600
The outcome isn't important in life.

941
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,170
Every step you take is important.

942
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:46,800
Having an ordinary life is not easy.

943
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,570
Right, right, Minjung.

944
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:52,530
Even if you work hard, it ends the same way.

945
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:55,490
You come empty handed and leave that way, too.

946
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,340
Being over 100 years old made me see that.

947
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:01,760
But I still can't see the answer, mother.

948
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:03,800
It's because you're still young.

949
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:06,400
You'll know when you're my age.

950
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,940
Isn't it time to take a picture?

951
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:19,290
Oh, my bones are making noise.

952
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:24,490
Take the picture!

953
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,860
Who's taking the picture?

954
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:31,440
Who? This is nutty, nutty, nuts.

955
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,340
This is nuts for me, too.

956
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:36,440
Once I sit down, I don't want to get up.

957
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:39,530
That's the problem with getting old.

958
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:44,340
You don't want to get up. Ugh.

959
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:46,170
Didn't we take a picture last year?

960
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,740
Right. They look all the same.

961
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,340
They don't!

962
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:53,840
I'm wearing hair mousse today!

963
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,960
Daebak used to send gifts every year.

964
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,040
- But mother?
- Yes.

965
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:06,130
I never got to realize all my dreams,

966
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:11,960
but I was happy while trying.

967
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,270
- Me too.
- Me too.

968
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:17,690
- Me too.
- Me too!

969
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:23,990
Let's pretend we took a picture.

970
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,260
- Let's shout, "Wang's family!"
- Okay.

971
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:27,940
Wang's family!

972
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:30,260
Wang's family!

973
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:31,670
Parcel service!

974
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:46,680
The Korean War was nothing compared to this!
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.
