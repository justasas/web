2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,470
Why did you throw away the pot?

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,820
You said you wanted to keep it forever.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,340
Because it was pathetic.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,900
It was pathetic, like me.

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,420
I didn't want to see it.

7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,450
Why did you come?

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,520
How did you know I was there?

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,000
You can't hide from me.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,820
That was where I proposed to you,

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
and we went there on our honeymoon.

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,170
Hobak,

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,200
were you happy living with me?

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,120
I'm not sure I was.

15
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,750
I don't think I was ever really happy.

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,550
You know what kind of misery your family put me through, don't you?

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,700
Being your parents son in law was downright horrible.

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,170
Especially your mother.

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,550
Every word your mother said to me stabbed me in the heart like thorns,

20
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,000
and they left scars.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,550
She said I was a bum who was leeching off of you for a living.

22
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,200
I'm a man.

23
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,200
I have feelings, too.

24
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,720
I'm someone's precious son.

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,970
But your mother treats me like dirt.

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,820
She always compared me to Minjung,

27
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,750
discriminating me with food.

28
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,450
Whenever that happened,

29
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,770
I felt so small and degraded.

30
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,570
She destroyed my self esteem.

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,550
Last New Year's Day,

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:10,900
Minjung's dumpling soup was overflowing with dumplings,

33
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,450
but mine only had broth.

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,970
I stirred it with my spoon,

35
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,750
and I found only two busted dumplings.

36
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,250
But she asked Minjung

37
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,570
if he wanted deep fried dumplings.

38
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,700
If she had more dumplings,

39
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,120
why couldn't she have given me some more?

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,200
Whenever I reached for something with my chopsticks, she slapped my hand.

41
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,300
Was I there to beg for food?

42
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,470
When I go to my moms, I just sit there because my mom does everything for me.

43
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,070
But

44
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,170
whenever I go to your parents', I'm a nuisance.

45
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,970
What did I ever do to deserve that?

46
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,470
Am I a criminal?
Did I steal something?

47
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,300
Is being unemployed a crime?

48
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,200
But do you know what hurt me the most?

49
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,050
It's not your mother,

50
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,200
and it's not Minjung or your big sister.

51
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,100
It's you.

52
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,600
You, Hobak.

53
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,120
No matter how much your mother hates me,

54
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,670
no matter how much your family mistreats me,

55
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,300
if you were on my side,

56
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,770
I wouldn't have felt so sad.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,850
Have you ever,

58
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,400
even once,

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,550
stood up for me in front of them?

60
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,670
Whenever your family treated me like dirt,

61
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,120
you just sat there, doing nothing.

62
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,270
Why do you think I visit your family?

63
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,300
For you.

64
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,550
If you weren't my wife,

65
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,200
I'd never have to deal with them.

66
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,320
Please,

67
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,500
let me breathe.

68
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,590
That's all I want.

69
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,860
What do you mean by that?

70
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,100
Set me free for a month.

71
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,220
Let's be separated for just one month.

72
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,650
This is a chance for me, 

73
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,920
and I don't want to miss it.

74
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,150
I won't get another chance like this.

75
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,950
I want to take this elevator.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,350
Where are you planning on going on that?

77
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,170
I don't know where the elevator will take me to.

78
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,050
And you won't regret it?

79
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,640
If I don't do this, I will regret it.

80
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,070
I'm begging you.

81
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,300
You saw him, too.

82
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,120
He change completely.

83
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,650
Hanging out with that awful girl changed him for the worse.

84
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,620
Daese,

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,660
maybe this isn't my place to say anything,

86
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,500
but I think you're over estimating your son.

87
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,320
What?

88
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Sangnam is a great kid.

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,100
He's really nice. He's like no other man.

90
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,250
But see him through the society's eyes.

91
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,620
He dropped out of high school.

92
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,120
Most people these days are college graduates.

93
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,870
Women don't like blue collar workers like him.

94
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,680
Jangbi.

95
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,690
I know he runs his own company.

96
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,520
But his parents are divorced.

97
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,520
What does that have to do with him?

98
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,300
Even if your kids are in love,

99
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,500
the parents look at everything.

100
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,450
They look at the family, financial situation, education and looks.

101
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,540
It's not like it used to be when love was everything that mattered.

102
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,850
So?

103
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,170
Are you saying Sangnam is flawed?

104
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,600
I'm not saying that.

105
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,870
But you are!

106
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,150
Are you drunk?

107
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,450
Just hear me out.

108
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,420
Who's against this marriage?

109
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,500
Me.

110
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
That's the problem.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,520
Despite Sangnam's situation, her family's not against it, so why are you?

112
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,570
It's them who should be against it.

113
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,670
Why are you so picky?

114
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,620
Jangbi, I only want one thing.

115
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,470
She has to be a decent person.

116
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,250
Her character is all I look at.

117
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,550
Living with such a rude girl will turn Sangnam's life into hell.

118
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,900
Who knows if it will be heaven or hell?

119
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,520
I do!

120
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,170
I've lived with someone just like her.

121
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,400
Apparently, people don't change.

122
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,570
If you fall in love with the wrong woman,

123
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,870
your life turns into hell in an instant.

124
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,770
I will never put my son through that kind of misery.

125
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,770
Never.

126
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,350
Man...

127
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,650
Gwangbak! Gwangbak!

128
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,220
Uncle! Uncle, you're here!

129
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,370
People might think I'm you're boyfriend.

130
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,510
How did you call me in this state? Let go.

131
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,670
Let's go.

132
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:20,900
Let's go, let's go, let's go to hell! Ouch!

133
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,370
Gwangbak! Gwangbak! Gwangbak!

134
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,370
My burning heart!

135
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,400
Oh, you're heavy.

136
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,600
My heart's on fire!

137
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,400
Will it ever burn again?

138
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,100
I don't want to say goodbye.

139
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,320
No!

140
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,020
Like being hit by a bullet!

141
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,450
Stay still. You're heavy enough as it is!

142
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,470
I don't want to say goodbye.

143
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,550
One, two, three, four!

144
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,650
Yongpil! Yongpil!

145
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:05,020
Like being hit by a bullet...

146
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,120
How can you sing so many songs at once?

147
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,600
Just stick to one song, would you?

148
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,570
My heart hurts so much!

149
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,450
There you go again.

150
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,200
Uncle, do you know how I feel?

151
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,850
No, I don't!

152
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,220
What's so special about a college degree?

153
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,670
It's not!

154
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,970
Even with a college degree, you're jobless.

155
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,420
Go easy on my, please.

156
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,700
They're jobless,

157
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,900
I'm jobless and he's jobless.

158
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,500
Who cares if you're a high school dropout?

159
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,670
He's a thousand times better!

160
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,670
You went a little too far there.

161
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,900
Is being divorced a sin?

162
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,700
It was his parents, not him!

163
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,720
What if someone saw?

164
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,920
I can't believe my eyes.

165
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,350
Why didn't you just dump her somewhere?

166
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,750
Take her to her room before he sees her.

167
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,020
You won't get away with this!

168
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,250
How embarrassing.

169
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,700
Hey, hey, hey!

170
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,750
Hey!

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,350
Father!

172
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,370
You have something to say?

173
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,370
Father!

174
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,550
Can't you let me have my way, just this once?

175
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,920
I really love him.

176
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,650
I won't meet anyone like him again.

177
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,920
I've never felt this way before, father.

178
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,050
Please let me marry him.

179
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,420
How dare you!

180
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,600
If you're drunk, just go to bed.

181
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,170
We'll talk when you're sober.

182
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,520
Father!

183
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,800
What's wrong with you?

184
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,620
Let's go to bed. Let's talk tomorrow.

185
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,870
Father, I'm disappointed in you!

186
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,370
You're a hypocrite!

187
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,360
Hey! How could you!

188
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:21,820
Come with me.

189
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,500
Father, she's drunk. Don't listen to her.

190
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,650
Mom, take father inside.

191
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,000
What did you teach your students?

192
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,320
You said college isn't important!

193
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,520
You told them to do what they want, instead of dwelling on getting a college degree!

194
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,870
I still remember it.

195
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:46,070
Remember what you told me on my first day of work as a teacher?

196
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,570
He told me never to hurt my students,

197
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,850
never to discriminate them for their grades.

198
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:56,620
You told me not to have prejudices against kids from divorced families.

199
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,850
You said that's what a true teacher does.

200
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,620
Where did that man go?

201
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,800
Father, answer me!

202
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,500
I can't believe that girl!

203
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,950
She's totally out of her mind!

204
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,550
You won't get away with this!

205
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,200
Oh, she's totally crazy.

206
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,670
She's taking her anger out on her father!

207
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,770
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

208
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,850
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo! Dear god!

209
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,070
He broke up with me.

210
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,650
He won't marry me if my parents are against it.

211
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
What do I do, Subak?

212
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,270
Oh, dear...

213
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,300
What do I do...

214
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,570
Don't fall in love again.

215
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,770
It breaks my heart to see you like this.

216
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,120
Why aren't you in bed?

217
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,670
You're upset because of Gwangbak?

218
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,170
Just forget it. She was drunk.

219
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,570
Mother,

220
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,700
I am a hypocrite.

221
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,400
Gwangbak's right.

222
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,350
I'm a different man when I'm teaching

223
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,070
my students and my own children.

224
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,270
I'm a real hypocrite.

225
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,920
You're a parent.

226
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,270
A parent is different from a teacher.

227
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,450
Teachers say it's okay to fail,

228
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,620
but parents want their kids to get A's.

229
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,770
Let's say there's a fire.

230
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,460
Teachers say you must go in and rescue people.

231
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:16,400
But parents say never to even go near where there's a fire.

232
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,100
Parents can't always be right.

233
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,350
That's what teachers are for.

234
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,820
Mother,

235
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,180
there's no correct answer in life.

236
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,950
It gets more difficult as I get older.

237
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,650
But that's what makes life interesting.

238
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,790
Bong,

239
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,700
she's not old enough to see what you see.

240
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,750
Don't stress over such impossible question and go to bed.

241
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,300
Don't do this all night. 

242
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,500
Go.

243
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,120
You're right.

244
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,320
Everything you said was right.

245
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,750
I think I understand how you feel.

246
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,920
Nobody else could put up with it.

247
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,820
I'd be demanding for a divorce, too.

248
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,060
Even women don't put up with that now.

249
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,720
Sedal,

250
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,420
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,770
I didn't stand up for you.

252
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,400
Whenever your mother was mean to me,

253
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,520
I blamed you for just letting her do it,

254
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,600
but I never put myself in your shoes.

255
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,500
If you say it that way,

256
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,970
I don't know how to reply to that.

257
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,820
I'm sorry you had to go through such misery with my family because of me.

258
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,750
Go.

259
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,320
Do you mean it?

260
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,250
I don't know where that elevator will end up, but go.

261
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,210
So you won't regret it.

262
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,820
But let's keep this between us.

263
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,350
Business trip? For how long?

264
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,550
About a month.

265
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,300
A month long business trip?

266
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,750
It might take longer, but for now, it is.

267
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,120
Where are you going?

268
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,020
Somewhere far away.

269
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,950
Where? Busan?

270
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,850
Oh, Busan sounds nice. I want to go there.

271
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,770
Nice? You think I'm going on a vacation?

272
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,700
I have to train new employees there.

273
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,520
You're gong to train someone?

274
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,650
What's wrong with your tone?

275
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,700
It's just that I can't believe it.

276
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,020
He went to law school, so believe it.

277
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,620
He knows all about the law.

278
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,120
What does the law have to do with hotels?

279
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,620
When are you leaving?

280
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,120
Now.

281
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,240
Now?

282
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,870
Your husband is going on a business trip,

283
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,650
and you're just going to let him go?

284
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,250
But he said he has to go today.

285
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,800
I told him to go tomorrow.

286
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,620
Make dinner for us.

287
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,420
We should throw a party for him.

288
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420
He's going away for his job.

289
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,520
This is why I don't approve of you.

290
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,870
What have you done for him as his wife?

291
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,220
All you care about is money.

292
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,200
That's enough.

293
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Go grocery shopping right now.

294
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,970
And make something my son likes.

295
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,200
Okay.

296
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,450
Where's Gwangbak? She's not eating?

297
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,670
She's sick.

298
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,850
She's too embarrassed to come down.

299
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,250
Don't give her any food.

300
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,300
How dare she talk to her father like that?

301
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,800
Mr. Choi!

302
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,900
See?

303
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,820
He knows he was wrong.

304
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,350
He should!

305
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,020
He can't beat his father.

306
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,370
Sangnam is a much bigger man than you.

307
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,700
He better not try anything like that again.

308
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,900
I told you I have emotional scars.

309
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,450
You grew up in a normal family,

310
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,600
so you could never understand.

311
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:29,550
A middle school graduate like me wanting to marry a former teacher who will be a writer?

312
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,020
That's nonsense.

313
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,000
Let's pretend this never happened.

314
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,700
Get up.

315
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,300
You have no right to pout!

316
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,850
You got drunk over a man and came home on your uncle's back.

317
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,900
What if any of our neighbors saw you?

318
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,120
Do you want to ruin your father's reputation?

319
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,620
You said you'll become a successful writer.

320
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,700
So forget getting married and write.

321
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,700
You never had a boyfriend before, so why would you start now and cause such trouble?

322
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,550
Mom, leave her alone.
She's heartbroken.

323
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,200
Why would she be heartbroken?

324
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,750
They've only been dating for a few months!

325
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,120
Even if you've been dating for 2 or 3 years,

326
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,000
you still can't know a man, so what's wrong?

327
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,750
Mom, I'll talk to her.

328
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,750
Ugh, you're impossible.

329
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,050
Why don't you go out or something!

330
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,200
I'm sick of seeing you like this.

331
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,600
You've become a total idiot!

332
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,820
You used to be a teacher, for heaven's sake,

333
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,570
and this is how you've ended up?

334
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,020
I can't believe my eyes.

335
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,500
Ugh.

336
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,300
Why don't you go out and get some air?

337
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,470
Staying home will just make mom madder.

338

[Accepting applications for part time jobs]

339
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,050
Mop the floor first.

340
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,200
And when you're done, clean the bathroom.

341
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,720
You heard what the manager said, right?

342
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,750
So do what I tell you to do.

343
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,620
I will.

344
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,970
Did you have any other part time jobs?

345
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,250
This is my first one.

346
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,450
This is my first one?

347
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,820
How can that be for an old woman?

348
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,370
I'm not old.

349
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,070
You are! You said you're 29.

350
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,870
I'm 20.

351
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,270
I've been here 3 months longer than you, so don't make any mistakes and do as I say.

352
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:06,950
Keep the windows, floor, and bathroom clean, and memorize the whole menu,

the codes for membership and discount cards, and don't forget to stamp the coupons.

354
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,500
Stay alert when you take orders, and don't make mistakes of the sizes, okay?

355
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,050
No, this is Sangnam's.

356
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,470
Can I use it? It's pretty.

357
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,660
He doesn't want anyone else to use it.

358
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,650
It's okay, Miho, you can use it.

359
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,450
Really? Thanks.

360
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,020
No, Miho! Bring that back.

361
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,320
It's okay, aunt.

362
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,970
Let Miho have it.

00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,480
your ring...

365
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,700
We broke up.

366
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,600
Sangnam.

367
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,620
That's awful.

368
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,450
Are you okay?

369
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,900
I miss her.

370
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,470
Everything else aside,

371
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,820
I just miss her.

372
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,720
Not being able to see the person you miss is hard.

373
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,370
Sangnam,

374
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,730
you should keep seeing her.

375
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,450
You're not Romeo and Juliet.

376
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,450
You're both adults,

377
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,300
so why would you care?

378
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,700
Your father's acting like that right now,

379
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,920
but in time, he will change his mind.

380
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,800
If you miss her, go see her.

381
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,120
Or you'll get sick.

382
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,400
Imagine how hard it must be for her.

383
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,920
It's not because of father.

384
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,620
Aunt,

385
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,600
actually, her parents

386
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,170
don't want me.

387
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,850
Her parents?

388
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,220
Yey! How exciting!

389
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,620
You guys!

390
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,720
You're excited when your dad is going away?

391
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,450
I'm excited because of the food!

392
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,910
Me too, me too!

393
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,600
You must've been starving them!

394
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,780
Stop being a Scrooge and feed your kids.

395
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,370
I'm going to, from now on.

396
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,300
Grandma, don't yell at mom.

397
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,770
We had yummy food at the beach.

398
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,120
I'm sure it was something really cheap.

399
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,600
No, we had pork belly, shrimps and clams.

400
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,120
Like I said, cheap.

401
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,800
Okay, let's get on with this.

402
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,450
Who is it?

403
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,220
Huh?

404
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,750
The director.

405
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,650
Mom, I have to go.

406
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,300
I'm supposed to go tonight.

407
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,520
You can go early tomorrow morning.

408
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,200
Director,

409
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,720
my mom and my sister came over for dinner.

410
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,100
I'll talk to her. Give me the phone.

411
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,350
- Hey, no!
- Give it to me.

412
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,070
You, what are you going to say?

413
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,820
Oh, mom, mom!

414
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,470
Hello, I'm Sedal's mom.

415
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,300
I've heard so much about you.

416
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,670
I'd like to come over and say hello.

417
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,320
We're actually having a goodbye dinner with the family,

418
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,100
so would you mind if he came tomorrow?

419
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,470
Except when he went to the army,

420
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,370
I've never been separated from my son,

421
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,470
so I don't want to just send him off.

422
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,170
Okay, then.

423
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,200
Have him leave first thing in the morning.

424
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Don't worry, director.

425
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,450
I'll take him to the Seoul Station.

426
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,950
The Seoul Station?

427
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,470
Yes, I heard he's going to Busan.

428
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,670
He can take the train, right?

429
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,500
Goodbye, director.

430
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,200
See? I knew I could change her mind.

431
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,950
She said to go ahead.

432
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,700
You're the best, mom.

433
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,870
I've always been a persuasive person.

434
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,750
Right. Whenever there was a problem at school,
you went there and solved it.

435
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,200
Can you imagine?

436
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,070
I went and met his teacher whenever he didn't do his homework,

437
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:25,300
was late to school, got hurt playing with his friends, and wet his pants.

438
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,470
Mom, the boys are listening.

439
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,470
I'm sure they already know.

440
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,350
I also went to school with you, you know?

441
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,350
And that's how I became so successful.

442
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,700
Successful?

443
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,850
I'm not satisfied with this.

444
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,120
You're supposed to become the president.

445
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,750
Grandma, dad's going to be the president?

446
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,170
You believe her?

447
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,620
Don't become the president.

448
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,270
It's a whole lot of headache.

449
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,170
Right.

450
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,220
Even a kid knows it's a lot of headache.

451
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,600
Even he knows.

452
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,550
You're a smart boy.

453
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,720
Just wait and see.

454
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,420
There's no need to become the president,

455
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,270
but you'll come awfully close.

456
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,110
And that will make you happy, too.

457
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,370
Will you make manager when you return?

458
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,320
I'd probably be made director.

459
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,920
Really?

460
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,470
The director must really like you.

461
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,350
Be loyal to her.

462
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,520
And you drop him off at the Seoul Station.

463
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,720
I will.

464
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,700
Let's blow out the candles.

465
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:34,870
Happy business trip to you!

466
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,220
Happy business trip dear dad!

467
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,220
Happy business trip to you!

468
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,250
This is nutty, nutty, nuts!

469
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,800
You're killing your dad!

470
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,670
Your sons are killing you!

471
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:26,300
There are four people in our family,
you, dad, Sintong and me.

472
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,070
It'll be sad if anyone was missing.

473
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,370
Here's five hundred thousand.

474
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,200
Put it in the safe, not in the bank.

475
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
The safe is already full.

476
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Then shove it in my car trunk.

477
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,700
I'm paying him tomorrow morning.

478
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,770
Good job, Director Wang.

479
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,920
Thank you, sir.

480
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,720
But without those two,

481
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,120
it won't be five hundred thousand.

482
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,060
Really?

483
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,950
You may leave.

484
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,120
Yes, sir.

485
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,150
- Don't lose any.
- I won't.

486
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,120
I'll pay you next time.

487
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,010
You handle millions of dollars with this hand?

488
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,370
How amazing!

489
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,800
I've never seen five hundred thousand in cash.

490
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,420
I thought your husband was successful.

491
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,420
He never brought money home.

492
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,820
He doesn't know me at all.
He's so dense.

493
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,900
Mmm... I can smell money.

494
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,670
I love the smell of money.

495
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,100
It's blissful.

496
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,400
Let's go.

497
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Already?

498
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,230
It's almost midnight.

499
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,600
I want to grab a drink.

500
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,100
But you have kids.

501
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,370
My mom's taking care of them.

502
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,070
I don't usually take care of them.

503
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,520
My housekeeper took care of them before.

504
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,670
I can't take care of my kids.

505
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,570
Shame on you.

506
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,570
We can't go out for a drink?

507
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,470
You have nobody waiting for you at home.

508
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,300
You said you're living alone now.

509
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,670
Do you have a girlfriend?

510
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,600
How can I?
I'm too busy for one.

511
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,070
I have golf early in the morning.

512
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,130
Okay.

513
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,420
Go.

514
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,750
I'm going only because of golf.

515
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,270
Should I come to work late tomorrow too?

516
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,350
Yes.

517
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,160
We have special investors, so look pretty.

518
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
I'm always pretty.

519
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,160
- Good night.
- Night.

520
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,550
Oh, you scared me!

521
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,420
You're home late.

522
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,900
I told you not to wait up.
Why did you?

523
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,800
You think I'm cheating on you?

524
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,650
What?

525
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:29,200
You think I'm hiding something?

526
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,750
I don't think that.

527
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,020
I was worried because it's past midnight.

528
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,120
Stop it.

529
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,070
Did I tell you to worry about me?

530
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,450
They take me home when it gets too late.

531
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,700
So don't stand by the bus stop or the door.

532
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,020
It bothers me.

533
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,750
Did something bad happen at work?

534
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,950
Why would you ask that?

535
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,050
If I'm not home, just go to bed.

536
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,150
Just go to bed instead of waiting for me.

537
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,920
You doing this bothers me.

538
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,600
You never did this before, so why start now?

539
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,620
Mom, the bathroom's so clean. It's great.

540
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,670
She even bought a bidet for the boys.

541
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,920
It has to be better than our beat up apartment.

542
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,470
It must be nice to live in such a big place.

543
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,270
Even the floor feels nice.

544
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,870
It smells different, too.

545
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,620
I can breathe better because it's big.

546
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,170
I breathe like this

547
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,720
in our apartment,

548
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,650
but here, see?

549
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,200
I can breathe more relaxed.

550
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,670
Mom, you're outrageous.

551
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,550
Mom, wouldn't it be nice if we lived here?

552
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,870
Hobak would cook for us, too.

553
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,650
Are you asleep?

554
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,270
I am.

555
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,520
Sedal.

556
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
I said I'm tired.

557
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,520
Hey!

558
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,670
You...

559
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,310
What are you doing?

560
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,350
Mom and Yeongdal are outside.

561
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,900
What are you doing?

562
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,920
Please, let me hold you for a moment.

563
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,620
I can't breathe.

564
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,220
This is nutty, nutty, nuts.

565
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,550
What are you doing?

566
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,170
Why are you doing this?

567
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,170
Am I going there to die?

568
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,470
You're not keeping your promise.

569
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,500
You said you'd send me away with a smile.

570
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,000
So why are you acting like this?

571
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,570
You don't have any pride?

572
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,870
I told you I can't stand you,

573
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,350
so why are you getting all choked up here?

574
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,570
Just dump me. I'm a bastard.

575
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,570
You really have no clue, do you?

576
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:13,200
You're only pushing me away further by acting this way.

577
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,520
This is nuts.

578
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,400
Hey, you!

579
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,100
How dare you steal from me!

580
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,420
I worked really hard to grow them!

581
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,720
You bastards!

582
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,070
Bastards!

583
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,150
You can't take them!

584
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,100
How dare you!

585
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,670
Bastards!

586
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,170
No, you can't! You can't take them!

587
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,670
I don't believe this!

588
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,620
Yes, I'm on my way.

589
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,300
I'll be there in 5 minutes.

590
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,250
Yes, parcel service.

591
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,620
Minjung!

592
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,020
Minsuk, can I call you later? I'm busy.

593
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,420
Father had an accident.

594
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,900
What?

595
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,120
He's in surgery right now.

596
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,350
He hurt his back.

597
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,000
There was a robbery at the orchard.

598
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,600
The doctors don't know how serious it is.

599
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,020
Minjung, Minjung!

600
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,950
Poor father. Poor father...

601
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,480
- Father.
- Father.

602
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,470
Minjung, Minsuk.

603
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:14,050
Father, are you okay?

604
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,570
What did they say?

605
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,650
The surgery went well,

606
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,650
and the nerve cells weren't damaged.

607
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:25,750
But you have to stay here for a few months.

608
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,100
You were lucky.

609
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,170
I'm sorry, kids.

610
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,320
Why did you call your brother?

611
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,120
I don't want to burden him.

612
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,620
What do you mean?

613
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,400
I should've been the first to know.

614
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,950
People get mad if their parcels come late.

615
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,220
I'm okay, so go back to work.

616
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,650
Don't worry about it.

617
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,530
I got someone else to cover for me.

618
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:59,220
Anyway, what happened?

619
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,830
There are many robberies in the countryside,

620
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,120
and they steal agricultural products.

621
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,170
I was patrolling the orchard,

622
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,540
and there were people at the shed.

623
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:19,270
I was going to sell them and help you out.

624
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,200
The insurance will cover the treatment,

625
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,250
but the problem is taking care of him.

626
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,200
He'll be bed bound for months,

627
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,650
so he'll need someone to take care of him.

628
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,500
I'd do it, but my in laws and the kids...

629
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,720
Minjung, can you talk to your wife?

630
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,600
I know she's not the type to do this,

631
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,970
but we have no other choice.

632
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,970
She's working now.

633
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,600
She is?

634
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,320
What do we do, then?

635
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,250
We'll have to hire someone.

636
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,170
You know how much that costs?

637
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,450
It'll take more than $2,000 a month.

638
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,270
I can't even pitch in $100 a month.

639
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,220
I'm so upset.

640
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,050
I have no time or money.

641
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,220
What do we do...

642
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,600
Done! Done!

643
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,050
All done!

644
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,270
Let's go.

645
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,020
Is this the moving company?

646
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,630
I asked for a truck ages ago!

647
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,300
Now? Okay, hurry over.

648
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,820
He's coming. Are you all packed?

649
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,170
Just about.

650
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,500
Mom, you're so smart.

651
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,720
I was famous for being clever.

652
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,070
Go to Myeongdong now.

653
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,170
Everyone has heard of me, Park Salla.

654
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:59,320
Everyone talked about how clever I was.

655
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,870
I think Sedal takes after you.

656
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,670
Oh, how are you?

657
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,300
You look pretty.

658
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,520
Director, what should we do with this?

659
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,950
Put them in the fridge. They are mine.

660
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,200
They smell. Throw them in the trash.

661
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,020
I'll throw them out.

662
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,850
Oppa, come out.
We're having a barbecue.

663
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,270
I'm coming.

664
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,970
Manager Wang Hobak, congratulations.

665
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,270
Thank you.

666
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:10,520
I'll put all my effort into making this the best branch in the country.

667
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,270
To the infinite growth of our company!

668
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,450
Let's go for it!

669
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,150
Hey, that's not how it's done.

670
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,200
You have to give it love.

671
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,100
Luh, luh, love.

672
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,700
There.

673
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,620
Say ah.

674
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,760
Ah.

675
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,100
Good girl.

676
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,150
Here.

677
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,250
We'll be on a deserted island for a week.

678
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,300
I wouldn't care if it were a prison.

679
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,400
I'm the prisoner and you're the guard.

680
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,620
This isn't a dream, is it?

681
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,200
I can't believe this is happening to me.

682
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,700
This is nutty, nutty, nuts!

683
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,720
Thank you, come again.

684
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,220
What is it? I'm busy.

685
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,200
Mom!

686
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,670
Sintong, why are you crying?

687
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,250
My room's gone!

688
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,620
What? Your room's gone?

689
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,750
What the...

690
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,300
Mother!

691
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,200
Yes, we're here.

692
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,470
Let's live together like a big family.

693
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,350
How could you do this to me?

694
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:11,100
Don't start. My son went to law school.

695
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,870
This is wrong.

696
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,470
How could you just move in like this?

697
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,770
This is my apartment.

698
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:20,220
Your apartment? Did you just say that?

699
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,620
It's my son's apartment, too.

700
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,950
Mom, she looks angry.

701
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,450
Who cares?

702
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,800
I'll crush her if she tries to kick us out.

703
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,550
You do that, mom.

704
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,850
Is that true?

705
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,350
He said it was a business trip to Busan,

706
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,120
but I think he went with that woman.

707
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,200
What is she going to do?

708
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
She has to divorce him, of course.

709
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,900
I don't know why Hobak's holding on to him.

710
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,470
Your father's going to pass out.

711
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,950
What are you talking about?

712
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,650
Why would I pass out?

713
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,150
What brings you here?

714
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,420
Hello, Mrs. Park.

715
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,620
I came to see Hobak.

716
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,620
She's not home right now.

717
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,620
She didn't come home yet?

718
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,170
I don't know.

719
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,270
Hello, grandpa.

720
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,570
Yes, yes. Hi.

721
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:33,650
Grandpa, grandma stole our room.

722
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,200
What?

723
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200
We moved in.

724
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,550
We moved in today.

725
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,420
My son's on a month long business trip,

726
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,220
so I thought I should move in,

727
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,950
help her out and keep her company.

728
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,950
It took a lot of work.

729
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,950
It's a dangerous time,

730
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:54,080
so I could look after the boys.

731
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,870
Oh, I see.

732
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,200
Where is your mom?

733
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,650
I don't know. She got angry at grandma and...

734
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,700
Okay. I should go.

735
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,700
Goodbye, Mrs. Park.

736
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,420
To be honest, I'm angry at Hobak.

737
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,420
She only moved here with her family.

738
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,270
And look what happened today.

739
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,970
We moved without her help,

740
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,120
and she yelled at us and left.

741
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,750
She didn't learn any manners.

742
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,600
But she comes from a teacher's family.

743
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,170
I wonder whom she takes after.

744
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,450
I don't think it's you.

745
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,950
I'm sorry.

746
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,220
I didn't move here to be a burden on her.

747
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,400
I would be a big help.

748
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,990
I'll look after the boys and do the dishes.

749
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,800
I'd wash the rags, too.

750
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,370
But she keeps talking back at me.

751
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,800
The person you're trying to reach is unavailable.

752
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,010
Your call will be redirected to voice mail.

753
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,800
Why won't you divorce him?

754
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,350
Don't you have any feelings?

755
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,020
You have a good job.

756
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,030
And don't use your kids as an excuse.

757
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:28,270
What happened to us is your family's fault.

758
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,420
When I think about how your mother treated me,

759
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,920
I get really sick. Did you know that?

760
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:04,310
Hobak.

761
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,070
Father.

762
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:15,950
Why did you let him go?

763
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:21,090
What else could I do?
He wanted to go.

764
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,200
I couldn't stop him.

765
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:29,350
I had to, so he would return.

766
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,520
You think I'm a fool, don't you?

767
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:38,520
Why didn't you tell me?

768
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,920
You have parents and siblings!

769
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,270
I'm here for you, so why didn't you come to me instead of bottling it up like that?

770
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,950
You held everything inside as a child.

771
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:52,770
Your marriage should've turned out better.

772
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,620
I'm going to teach him a lesson.

773
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,350
He said he suffered, too.

774
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,870
How dare he say that?

775
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,870
He never made a penny!
He never worked!

776
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,970
That was what was hard on him.

777
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:09,050
Being unemployed must have been hard.

778
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,140
On top of that,

779
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,920
being mistreated by my family

780
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,920
was hard on him, too.

781
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,170
I know you were against our marriage,

782
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,470
so I wanted to make it work...

783
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,500
Father, I'm sorry.

784
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,770
Don't think about how others feel.

785
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,170
Hobak, if it's too hard for you...

786
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,870
I'm not getting a divorce, father.

787
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:44,150
You're the vice principal...

788
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,570
I don't care.

789
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,800
Your happiness is more important to me.

790
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,070
And I'll be retiring soon.

791
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,320
Are you living for your parents?

792
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,020
You should live for yourself.

793
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,070
Lots of women put up with cheating husbands.

794
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,950
I don't have the nerves to get a divorce.

795
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,320
I don't know if I can raise the boys by myself.

796
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,820
I'm really scared.

797
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,600
That's how I feel.

798
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,570
I'm not ready to let him go yet.

799
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,400
I'm being stupid. I know.

800
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,450
I can't help it, father.

801
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,200
I don't want to regret later on.

802
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,050
I'm going to tough it out a little longer.

803
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,620
I can't imagine my family without him.

804
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:47,240
My family is him, me, Sintong, and Bangtong.

805
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,550
I don't want to lose anyone.

806
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,150
I'm going to wait for him as long as I can.

807
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,970
I'm not sure how long it will be,

808
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,220
but I can be patient for now.

809
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,220
Okay.

810
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,220
I'm on your side,

811
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,200
no matter what.

812
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,500
Understand?

813
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,150
Give me a bottle of soju.

814
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,000
I will charge it to this card.

815
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,450
Please sign there.

816
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:02,970
Thank you. Enjoy your coffee.

817
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,200
Wake up.

818
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:45,200
Hey.

819
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,150
What is it?

820
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,360
Wake up.

821
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,220
What time is it?

822
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:59,770
Where are you coming from?

823
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,620
How could you sleep?

824
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,950
How could you, after what happened to Hobak?

825
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,470
Were you drinking?

826
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:10,010
Yes, I was.

827
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,850
I had to because I was so frustrated.

828
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:22,620
Why couldn't you spend any money on Hobak's wedding?

829
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,770
What?

830
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,400
Why are you bringing that old subject up?

831
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,620
Did someone say something to you?

832
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,420
Did you run into the hair salon woman?

833
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:36,410
If she hadn't gotten married with nothing,

834
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,120
her in laws would've respected her,

835
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,850
and her husband would've been nicer to her.

836
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,410
Is it my fault Hobak's marriage fell apart?

837
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:44,820
I don't believe you.

838
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,770
If you're drunk, just go to bed.

839
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,150
Why are you acting all drunk on me?

840
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,150
You think I'm saying this because I'm drunk?

841
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:55,000
It's already happened. I can't do anything!

842
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,900
She's just unlucky. That's all.

843
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,450
I didn't force her to marry him!

844
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,450
Why are you blaming me?

845
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,450
Everyone blames me for everything.

846
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,670
Having a bad husband is my fault.

847
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,620
Having a cheating husband is my fault, too.

848
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,150
Shut up!

849
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:15,120
You never feel sorry for anything you did!

850
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:18,050
How could you be so heartless?

851
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,350
Did a war break out or something?

852
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,600
Put yourself in her shoes.

853
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,950
Even with dogs, if their owners love them,

854
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,900
other people love them, too.

855
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,650
You treat Hobak like dirt,

856
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,800
so who could possibly love her?

857
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,300
The whole town knows you only love Subak.

858
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,050
But you only love Hobak! Don't you?

859
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:45,450
Don't be like that.

860
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:52,170
When you mistreat your child, it comes back as bad karma.

861
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,650
You were mean to Hobak's husband, too.

862
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,870
You compared your son in laws.

863
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,490
How could you be so mean?

864
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,220
You were mean to Sedal,

865
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,900
and you ruined their marriage.

866
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,550
What?

867
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,550
Did I raise the kids alone?

868
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:11,800
You raised them with me!

869
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,700
Why do you blame me for everything?

870
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,510
There's a big part of Hobak's issue that you've caused.

871
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:19,700
You compared Minjung and Sedal,

872
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,320
and you only cared about money.

873
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,150
And you call yourself a mother in law?

874
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,950
Son in laws are not like our own children,

875
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,170
no matter how close we are to them.

876
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,170
How could you mistreat them?

877
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:35,170
Don't you feel embarrassed to act like that?

878
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,720
You're so materialistic.

879
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,350
What did you say?

880
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:45,420
Materialistic?

881
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,600
I'm materialistic?

882
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,370
You're calling me that after all I've done for you?

883
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,370
Yes! Materialistic.

884
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:01,270
You're horrible.

885
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:07,520
I know you had a hard life after marrying me,

886
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,870
but you don't deserve to be a mother.

887
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:18,920
I feel ashamed.

888
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,900
My heart is breaking.

889
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,450
I'm supposed to be a teacher,

890
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,220
but I can't keep my family in line.

891
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,420
I'm a teacher,

892
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,420
but my wife runs wild.

893
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,250
I'm ashamed!

894
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,650
All because of you! Did you know?

895
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,170
I'm a horrible woman?

896
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,010
I'm materialistic?

897
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,070
Who made me this way?

898
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,720
I chase after money?

899
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,500
I only care about money?

900
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,050
I had to be that way because I had to

901
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,450
support your mother, father,

902
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,650
your four brothers and sisters,

903
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:25,320
and your five children on a teacher's salary!

904
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,000
How do you think we were able to afford this house?

905
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,120
I saved every penny I could,

906
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,000
cutting back on everything I could!

907
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,300
That's how I bought this house!

908
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:43,150
People don't respect you if you're poor!

909
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:48,650
We have this house because I chased after money!

910
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:55,150
You're the one who turned me into this!

911
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:03,270
Oh, boy.

912
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:05,520
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

913
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,720
This family is falling apart. Egh, hyo, hyo...

914
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,650
Mother, your breakfast is read. Yeongdal.

915
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,400
Sit down, mother.

916
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,220
I will sit down, but...

917
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:54,000
Where are the boys?

918
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,650
They went to school and kindergarten.

919
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:01,100
Mother, I'm sorry about yesterday.

920
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:05,150
It's just that you didn't let me know,

921
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:09,600
and I was sad about Sintong's room.

922
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,700
I talked to the boys.

923
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,450
You did?

924
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,750
I'm scared because you changed overnight.

925
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,850
Don't be.

926
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,850
With Sedal gone,

927
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:23,120
I was worried about being lonely,

928
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,760
so I'm glad you moved in.

929
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,760
Mother, welcome.

930
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,870
I'm sure we can get along great.

931
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,470
Hello?

932
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,770
Who is this?

933
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,420
Yes, yes.

934
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,870
Yes. I will come right now.

935
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,220
This is nuts.

936
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,500
Ugh.

937
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,670
Why did I answer that?

938
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,250
Why did you want to see me?

939
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,520
Mommy!

940
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:41,570
Oh, man.

941
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,270
What brings you here?

942
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:50,800
Let's pretend we're not in laws.

943
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,350
I'm going to beat you up!

944
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:55,700
Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed?

945
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,200
You did a swell job raising your son.

946
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,050
On top of putting my daughter to misery,

947
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,970
now you turn my husband against me?

948
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:05,300
Have you gone completely mad?

949
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,950
Why would I turn your husband against you?

950
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:10,220
You should keep your son in line!

951
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,450
Why are you badmouthing my son?

952
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:13,670
You're his mom,

953
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:16,650
but you have no idea what he's up to!

954
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:19,420
What do you mean by that?

955
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,520
I'm going to kill you.

956
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,850
Why are you doing this?

957
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,920
Father, why are you doing this?

958
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,720
Use words!

959
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,800
You taught me never to use violence!

960
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:32,270
Help!

961
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,450
- Come with me!
- Hey! Hey!

962
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,620
Come with me.

963
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,420
You never treated my son well.

964
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,250
I should be the one screaming at you!

965
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,390
You hated Sedal because you hated Hobak.

966
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,750
Whenever we met, you bragged about Minjung,

967
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,720
saying my Minjung, my Minjung!

968
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,220
I couldn't ever forget his name!

969
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,570
Do you know how much you hurt my son?

970
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:26,220
That has nothing to do with cheating on Hobak!

971
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,000
If your in laws mistreat you,

972
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
it's okay to cheat on your wife?

973
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,450
So, are you saying what he did is okay?

974
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:35,650
I can't believe how brazen you are!

975
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,620
What are you doing?

976
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:39,920
Oh, hey!

977
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,350
Why are you attacking my mom?

978
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:47,650
You stay out of this!

979
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:50,070
Watch your manners when adults are talking.

980
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:52,770
Screaming at someone's workplace is being well mannered?

981
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,800
Causing a disturbance at someone's business is a crime!

982
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,170
Leave before I call the police!

983
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,200
Leave now!

984
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,420
Oh, my! Hey! Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my! Mom, mom.

985
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,950
Mom, mom.

986
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,770
Oh, ugh, ugh... Ugh... Hey!

987
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:10,100
Hey! You!

988
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,170
Open the door! Open!

989
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,870
Open!

990
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:17,400
Hey!

991
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,770
I won't say this twice.

992
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:33,570
Go back to your family today.

993
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,870
Today?

994
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,520
I can't today.

995
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,700
What?

996
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:45,550
I have to sort things out,

997
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,120
and to be honest,

998
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:53,050
Hobak and I came to a decision together legally,

999
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,300
so for a third party to butt in like this is a bit...

1000
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,600
- You little...
- How dare you!

1001
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,120
Father,

1002
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,120
I can't get a divorce yet.

1003
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,650
I'm going to tough it out.

1004
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,670
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1005

1006
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,750
Can you check on my father?

1007
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:45,900
Please do something for him.

1008
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,350
You don't even have a hundred thousand?

1009
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:50,050
You'll turn that into two hundred thousand?

1010
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:51,820
I thought your father's a vice principal.

1011
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,120
Teachers have the best credit.

1012
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,970
How could you do this? Get out.

1013
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,400
Bastard!

1014
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,170
They didn't break up because we said no.

1015
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:01,550
He was two timing!

1016
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:03,370
He wouldn't do that to me.

1017
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:05,200
He couldn't do that.

1018
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,150
Mother, I can't come home tonight.

1019
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:13,720
You're my husband and you won't give me any credit!

1020
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:17,170
Do you even know how I feel?
