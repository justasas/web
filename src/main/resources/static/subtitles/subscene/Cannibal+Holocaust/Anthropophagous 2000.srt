00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,820
Steve Bauers, Interpol

2
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,657
Hi there. Marsh... we already met

3
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,831
So, guys- what have you found?

4
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,832
Doctor, you must take a look
inside the Cave.

5
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,169
OK, we better take a look then.

6
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:46,437
What a fucking smell!

7
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,086
This is the Killer's Cave.
Go and tell the Men...

8
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:11,562
OK, but there is no trace of George!

9
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:16,572
OK, you better have a look around then.

10
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,142
" I was a big shot Businessman; "

11
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,181
my Family was the most influential
on the lsland.

12
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,655
A a matter of fact, you could
say we owned it.

13
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,866
Let's see...well...

14
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,938
You want to have a look how the
Baby is doing?

15
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:39,543
Everything is just fine, tonight we will
reach our Destination.

16
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:44,389
But on this Trip we got caught in the
middle of a bad Thunderstorm.

17
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:52,023
Damned!

18
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,809
The Mast!

19
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,386
Vicky!

20
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,461
Come on, help her.

21
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:53,216
Time has no meaning anymore.
Here it begins and ends...

22
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,557
...the story of the Karamanlis family.

23
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,511
Mary, you are so wonderful.

24
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:35,132
Stuart, are you coming with me?
I will look for some wood.

25
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,899
Oh no. You go ahead. I will rest a little bit.

26
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,037
Stuart, I am back.

27
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,957
Hey, hey, hey!

28
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,130
How are you?

29
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,960
Look at that hat!

30
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,814
Vince, how are you?

31
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,148
Cool.

32
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,650
What's happening? Where are
Mary and Stuart?

33
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:16,245
They just went to the beach,
but they will meet us at the house,

34
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,386
you'll see, I didn't promise you too much.

35
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,317
So, what's up now?

36
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:26,998
It's very pretty here.
Let's take a look around.

37
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,937
We'll be gone for three hours at least.
I'll better let them know.

38
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,535
" Don't bother; they will have a "
good time without us.

39
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,240
Stan? Yeah, we're fine...

40
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,153
Well, there is nothing you can do about it.

41
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,060
OK, here she is.

42
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:01,191
Hello Darling?

43
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:08,734
Hello, yes it's me. I've got another
operation an emergency.

44
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:17,106
" And no one else is available; "

45
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,789
I will join you as soon as I'm finished here.

46
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:34,028
OK, bye, yeah bye.

47
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,197
Silly bastard.

48
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,126
Turn right here.

49
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,067
Are you feeling ok?

50
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:34,137
If we don't stop right now I will
puke all over the car.

51
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,546
You better stop here.

52
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,552
Just a second.

53
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,770
Food, Food

54
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:21,583
We are looking for directions to
Borgo San Lorenzo.

55
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:25,822
Borgo San Lorenzo? Don't go there.

56
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,708
Food Food.

57
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,516
What did you eat today?

58
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,081
You know what, Hank? They nicked
"the Campsite; "

59
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,312
take a look at the map.

60
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,765
According to the map we should be here,

61
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,066
or here, but we could also be here.

62
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:48,744
You know what. I haven't got a clue.

63
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,110
Let's camp right here.

64
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,864
Maybe we ran out of gas or whatever.

65
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:21,605
I don't know, it's not my fault.
Fucking weather.

66
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,821
" Listen; let's just go into the village."
It's raining cats and dogs.

67
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,253
OK

68
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,821
OK

69
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,329
Shit, my Leg.

70
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,697
Carol, is it bad? Or can you walk?

71
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,913
You all just go ahead, I will take
care of Carol.

72
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,349
Vince, take good care of these two.

73
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,319
Anybody there?

74
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:52,629
Seems deserted...

75
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:19,055
"Come on; let's take a look inside."

76
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:30,093
Miss...excuse me...Miss

77
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,651
Hey Vince, can you get me some lce?

78
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,291
I could bring you a Handful of Sand,
there is nothing else here.

79
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,808
You know what, Carol? I take a look
at the engine.

80
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:57,106
Vince where the Hell are you?

81
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,648
Hello, where are you two?

82
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,620
Come over here!

83
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,684
You won't believe this, but...

84
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:29,801
" Let's get out of here; yeah let's "
get out of here.

85
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,590
I think I'm done here.

86
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,349
I just saw a little take out there.

87
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,893
Maybe we'll meet some chicks...

88
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,961
...out there and get lucky.

89
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,839
You go ahead, I want to read a little bit,
and we have got a...

90
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,067
...Iot to do tomorrow.

91
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,334
I'm getting a little worried about you, man.

92
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:47,249
Back home you are
Mr. Loverboy and out here.

93
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,215
You just go and do whatever you want.

94
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,670
Damned, where is the car?

95
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,813
Maybe they found some gas somewhere.

96
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,087
I can't walk any longer.

97
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,920
You know what? I'll just go and look
around for Mary and Stuart.

98
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,522
Let's go that way.

99
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,757
Come on let's go.

100
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,632
Help, help.

101
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,101
Hey you shit. Where are you?

102
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:24,728
Alan, where are you?...Alan?

103
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:13,744
You know what? I am fucking scared.

104
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,678
Mary and Stuart are still not here.

105
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,361
Come on, let's go to bed.

106
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,518
Did you also...?

107
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,913
Are you nuts to scare me like that?

108
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:31,728
Auriet, my god, Auriet. It is me - Rita!

109
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,418
What's happening, who is she?

110
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:52,486
It's Auriet, Mary's sister.

111
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,517
Take her upstairs, come on.

112
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,598
She is scared to death.

113
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,032
I think she recognized me.

114
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,604
I think this has to be treated.

115
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,913
I'll go into the village.

116
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:26,681
Be careful.

117
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:42,272
Auriet, can you hear me? Where is Mary?

118
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,073
I don't know.

119
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,910
Do you know who he is?

120
00:40:56,053 --> 00:41:15,702
It's him, Mary, Stuart, where are you?
Nobody will come! He is here.

121
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,345
How does he smell?

122
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,072
He smells like blood.

123
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:44,361
Everything is going to be just fine,
got to sleep now.

124
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:02,732
I hope there is something that will be
of any help to you.

125
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:02,858
It's useless, Carol is bound to be...

126
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:09,131
Let's please move on, we will
find them somehow.

127
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:14,594
Hey Mark, don't quit on me now.

128
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,332
I need you.

129
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:25,144
He's no god, he's human.
We can hurt him.

130
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:31,046
We have to stick together or he will
get us one after another.

131
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,817
Come on let's go.

132
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:56,345
I know that house. It belonged to the
Karamanlis family. They are all dead.

133
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,775
Is there nobody left?

134
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:03,318
Only his sister, but she went mad.

135
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,154
I can't stand it any longer.

136
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:31,361
" " "Go away" ". Is this his sister? "

137
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,430
Yes, yes.

138
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,702
It makes me sick, let's get out of here.

139
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:15,997
Carol, Mary, Stuart, anybody there?

140
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:59,511
Put her down there. Look at these photos.

141
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:34,482
" " " My wife, my daughter and the "
unborn child are dead.

142
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:47,658
Since then I need meat, lot's of
meat from animals but that doesn't stop

143
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:53,701
my craving for blood, red like blood,
red - the colour of love.

144
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:59,441
It's hard to describe the pain that's
tearing me apart.

145
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:09,518
It's like I am a burning flame
"...an eternal hellfire..." " "

146
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,555
Stan! I am so glad you are here.

147
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,791
What the hell is going on?

148
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:28,427
Vince and Carol are gone but
I know where they are.

149
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,248
Hello, can anybody hear me?

150
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:08,641
Don't worry about me. Vince, Carol!

151
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:12,813
Try to control your breathing and relax.

152
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,290
Hello, can anybody hear me?

153
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:08,427
Mark, no!

154
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,426
Hello, can anybody hear me?

155
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:50,504
Carol, are you here? Carol, are you here?

156
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,463
Stan, is it you?

157
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,900
Carol, there you are. Let's get out of here.

158
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,157
What do you want? Leave us alone,
you monster. Is it the child?

159
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:58,678
I know exactly who you are. But this sacrifice
won't bring back your Wife and Child.

160
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:12,458
Child, I once also had a child.

161
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:42,655
A Storm once took us far away from
the coast and the hot sun cooked our Flesh

162
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,762
You better don't do that or the salt
will destroy your skin.

163
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:58,972
I know, but it is still better than being boiled
by the sun.

164
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:02,869
You will burn your skin.

165
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,375
I know.

166
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:24,632
When would we be saved? A ship could
save us, just a ship.

167
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:39,471
The days went by and I thought I was losing
my mind. I wanted to live, we all should live.

168
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,700
My god, you know what
we have to do now.

169
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:05,764
You don't touch her.

170
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,174
It's the only thing left to do.

171
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,611
Leave her alone or I will kill you.

172
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:16,378
But she is dead. And it's dead meat,
meat we need to survive.

173
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,208
Don't touch him!

174
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,246
Come on.

175
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:00,497
What do we do now?

176
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:14,373
Where is the car? Think!

177
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:16,376
I don't know.

178
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,112
Where is the car?

179
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,915
I don't know!!!!!

180
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,524
Come on.

181
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:57,883
Where are you?

182
01:04:58,694 --> 01:04:59,888
Shit!. Help!

183
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:15,569
Hurry up!

184
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,200
Help me, George!!!

185
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:25,686
Do you think you can bring us back to life
with your cruelty?

186
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,673
We love you, Nicos. Come to us.

187
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:38,231
Release me, release me.

188
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:16,655
Strange, very strange. There is something
fishy about this.

189
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,861
The ending, when could he have
written this.

190
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:26,838
I have to get out of here.
