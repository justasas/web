1
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:42,986
Hello, guys.

2
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,661
-Hello, captain.
-Yo, cappy.

3
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,901
Jacques, I hope everything's
in order?. You do a good job?.

4
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,562
Sure thing, captain.
When do we leave?.

5
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,105
In the morning. Our passengers
arrived on the noon plane.

6
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,100
What's wrong, Jacques?.

7
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,134
Well, sir, you know that bringing
civilians aboard brings bad luck.

8
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,083
Plus I just
don't like all this mystery.

9
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,345
I know how you feel.

10
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:09,545
Give the men a couple
of days leave, and remember....

11
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:14,420
no strangers are allowed on board.
And especially no reporters!.

12
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,958
Don't worry, sir.

13
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,460
I'm gonna go see those people.

14
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,691
I don't know how the five
of them are gonna fit into one tent.

15
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,470
-Three of them are women.
-Woman!

16
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,907
We must be crazy! You know what
they say about women.

17
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,541
They really bring bad luck!

18
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:34,270
It's worse than that,
Jacques. They're scientists.

19
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,744
Can you imagine what
kinda monsters they are?.

20
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,986
-Goodbye, Captain.
-I'll see ya tomorrow.

21
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,392
Excuse me. I'm looking for the
members of the scientific expedition.

22
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,001
They're up there by the pool.

23
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,368
Good morning.

24
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,302
Captain Hardee?.

25
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,406
Yes.

26
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,439
I'm Annie Darmona.

27
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,410
My pleasure. And you must be.
Let me guess, the biologist?.

28
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,603
My field is nuclear physics.

29
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,976
I'm Professor Lemuan's assistant.
Disappointed?.

30
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,015
No, on the contrary.

31
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,814
Neither physics nor
biology are my strong points.

32
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,150
Do you want a drink?.

33
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,518
No, thanks, I'm on duty.

34
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,760
I thought that
only applied to policemen.

35
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:57,987
And sailors, too.

36
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,497
Bravo!

37
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,997
Come here, I want you
to meet a real clean-cut sailor.

38
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,564
A pleasure, captain.

39
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,905
The pleasure is all mine.

40
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,075
I never thought
Science was so interesting.

41
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,012
Are you the biologist?.

42
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,446
She's the zoologist,
Dr. Dorcin de San Jack.

43
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,013
Oh excuse me
Countess de San Jack!

44
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:24,087
Thank you, my dear. Even the
Navy has its good points, captain.

45
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,281
Are you the one who's
going to take us to the island?.

46
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,256
Yes, the Minister has placed
me entirely at your disposal.

47
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:34,000
Magnificent! Perhaps you can
take me on a tour of the islands?.

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,161
Naturally, if you'd like.

49
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:43,964
Pardon me for a moment.

50
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,247
You again, Benoit?. You want
me to call the military police?.

51
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,778
You can't do
anything to me, Captain.

52
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,420
Fortunately, we still
have freedom of the press here.

53
00:05:56,622 --> 00:06:00,353
Oh come on,
I just need a good story.

54
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,620
Sorry, Benoit,
but there's nothing here to see.

55
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,732
Besides, I don't even
know what's going on myself.

56
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,131
Lies!! I'm sure
something big is going on here,

57
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,973
and the public's
got a right to know.

58
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,533
Well, you won't
get anything from me.

59
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,177
Goodbye, Benoit.

60
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,008
Captain, this isn't
over yet! Captain, wait!!

61
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,583
Forgive me.
He's the press correspondent here.

62
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:32,182
It's very hard to get rid of him.
Now what were we talking about?.

63
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,915
I must confess I really don't know
why you're going to that island.

64
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,618
I must confess I really don't know
why you're going to that island.

65
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:02,213
My orders are to bring you there, and
give you whatever help you'll need.

66
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:07,985
I'm just the
taxi driver, nothing more.

67
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:12,988
Maybe we can explain
it to you, would you like that?.

68
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,396
I will admit I'm very curious.

69
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,969
But not without
Professor Lemuan's permission!

70
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:24,368
Please, Countess,
don't be so mysterious.

71
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,636
This whole thing
is becoming ridiculous.

72
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:34,309
Up to now, we've had no
scientific facts, only a theory.

73
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:39,183
We have those photos, Annie.
They're not just a theory.

74
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,095
Those photos were
taken from a naval plane.

75
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,063
Are you sure you
don't know anything about this?.

76
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:49,291
No, that's basically it. The Minister
gave me explicit instructions

77
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,869
not to talk to anyone.
But for awhile now,

78
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,597
we've been hearing of strange
things happening on that island.

79
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,936
For a while now?. But
they only notified us a month ago!

80
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,739
The Minister thought
if we reacted to the rumors,

81
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,143
we'd risk making fools of ourselves.

82
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,716
It might just be a
tall tale told by the fishermen.

83
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,355
You know the people around here,
with their rituals and black magic,

84
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,184
tend to lose sight of reality.

85
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,525
Look! What could
have done this to him?.

86
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:22,134
No sea animal can do something like
this. Oh God, may he rest in peace.

87
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,371
We told him not to
go near that cursed island.

88
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,067
He went there to kill the
monster, to avenge his son's death.

89
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:33,642
Come, let us bury him at sea.
The sea can keep many dark secrets.

90
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,923
Do you want to take
a shower?. I'm finished.

91
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:44,582
Thank you.

92
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,190
Hmmm, I've never seen that
underwear before. It's very sexy.

93
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,419
Simone, you know I hate
it when you make stupid remarks.

94
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,292
Wait, I've got
something here. It hurts.

95
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,830
I don't see anything.

96
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,002
And you don't feel anything here?.

97
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,763
Simone, I'm in a hurry.
The Minister is waiting.

98
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,803
Simone! Calm down!

99
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,169
Come on...

100
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,368
No more!

101
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,507
I came...

102
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,024
According to this evidence, the
problem appears to be very serious.

103
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,359
According to this evidence, the
problem appears to be very serious.

104
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,988
Crabs, turtles and
rodents, all of enormous size!

105
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,756
This would seem
to verify the rumors about

106
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:05,370
biological mutations
to the animals there.

107
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,768
That's what we have to investigate.

108
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:13,746
Minister, Professor Keller
is too much of a perfectionist,

109
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,544
Iike all biologists.
We physicists are not so rigid.

110
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,319
You physicists are also responsible
for those horrible mutations.

111
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,914
Minister, your report
says you sent a plane up

112
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,158
to take photographs
after a long series of...

113
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,924
shall we call them, incidents?. Excuse
me, but why did you wait so long?.

114
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:34,194
Frankly, Professor Lemuan, I don't
believe what those fishermen say.

115
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,569
They use dynamite to catch fish,
sometimes a fatal accident occurs.

116
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,035
They blame the deaths on a demon,
to avoid responsibility themselves.

117
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,336
But one of them, a man named Keno,
has told of a monstrous creature

118
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,809
on that cursed island
a monster that murdered his son.

119
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,348
That is all fantasy Professor.

120
00:10:53,586 --> 00:11:00,617
But we have photos and the
examanation on the dead child.

121
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,454
The island's
been deserted since 1 958,

122
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:08,600
when we evacuated
the tiny native population

123
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,498
after the island was chosen as a
test site for nuclear experiments.

124
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,139
Since then, we haven't
allowed anyone to live there.

125
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,868
Is it possible that a few of the
original inhabitants were left behind?.

126
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,569
Perhaps someone living
in a remote area of the island?.

127
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,740
Strange that you would
believe such an absurd theory!

128
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,977
No one could have lived
through those atomic explosions.

129
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,918
Minister, I was one of the physicists
who worked on that experiment,

130
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:39,155
and ever since
that day, I've asked myself

131
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,526
if we had the right to do what
we did in the name of Progress.

132
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,261
We unleashed a terrible force, the
extent of which we do not even know.

133
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,440
I'm not seeking exoneration, I'm just
trying to rid myself of a nightmare

134
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:53,943
the possibility that these mutations
may have affected a human being!

135
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,740
Pardon me, Professor,
perhaps I seem a bit brusque,

136
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,213
but they keep bothering
me from Paris. The truth is,

137
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,251
I don't enjoy finding myself
involved with a bunch of scientists

138
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,116
and all these security measures.

139
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,486
I understand.
We'll try to keep out of your way.

140
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,823
On the contrary, I want to help.
I'm assigning you to Captain Hardee,

141
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,499
and if necessary, I'll send a second
boat out to the island to help you.

142
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,530
Thank you, gentlemen.

143
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,638
Come in.

144
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,153
Hello.
Why don't you lock your door?.

145
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,179
What for?. I've no fear that
someone might come in and fuck me.

146
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,549
In fact, I wish they would.

147
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,956
I see your lover has disappointed
you again. But he always tries.

148
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,561
That's enough.

149
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,827
Where's Annie gone?.

150
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,169
She's busy. Would you believe
she went out with that captain?.

151
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,404
She beat you to him, eh?.

152
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:06,615
If you want another,
just keep acting like a bitch.

153
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,278
What a whore you are!

154
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,256
Such language?. I'm shocked.

155
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,254
Come on,

156
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,431
don't play stupid.

157
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,261
Let's not fight, eh?. Let's fuck!

158
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:12,695
For you, captain. Eat hearty!

159
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,192
You're wondering why
this place is so peaceful.

160
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:22,067
I've been wondering about
that myself. I think it's because

161
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,402
there are so few tourists
here, and so little noise.

162
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,741
It'd be the perfect place
for a couple looking for privacy.

163
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,085
The people around here
don't go to a restaurant like this,

164
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,587
that offers the home-made
cooking they can get at home.

165
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:44,889
This is home-cooking?. It makes
me want to move here permanently.

166
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,928
It's fabulous!

167
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:53,071
The lobster's not half bad. Tastes
like it came straight from Japan.

168
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:58,904
What if the tourist people hear you?.
You surprise me, Captain Hardee ---

169
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,137
in a good way. I didn't
expect you to be so friendly.

170
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,781
You're just
getting to know me better.

171
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:09,443
Have you noticed I'm as
nervous as an Olympic athlete?.

172
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:13,921
Sure. And I've been wondering why.

173
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:21,834
Y'know, the big lie about sailors is
that they have a girl in every port.

174
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:28,865
I never thought you'd
be such an interesting woman.

175
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:33,045
That's ridiculous. Do you think
I'm different when I'm in Paris?.

176
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,706
Do you think just
because I'm a scientist,

177
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,303
that I've forgotten
how to be a woman, too?.

178
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:42,381
I don't mean it that way.
But as impossible as it may seem,

179
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,182
at this moment I feel we
could be in a restaurant in Paris.

180
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,483
Of course, some
things would be dif ferent.

181
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:51,322
Instead of this lobster,
we'd be having hamburgers.

182
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,961
Hamburgers?. What kind of place
would you take me to in Paris?.

183
00:18:56,168 --> 00:19:00,764
Hey! You think I could afford to
eat lobster in Paris on my salary?.

184
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:05,273
Calm down. Let's
not talk about hamburgers.

185
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,173
That's what I eat every
day at the hospital commissary.

186
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,908
But let's talk about us. Do you have
anything planned for after dinner?.

187
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:20,650
Sure. We're going to go see a great
show. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

188
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,986
Do we have time?.
I don't like to eat in a hurry.

189
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:29,725
Don't worry.
We'll have all the time we need.

190
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,527
OK

191
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,211
What a beautiful city!
Isn't it interesting?.

192
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,538
Yes, very.

193
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,807
But not nearly as interesting
as a place I've discovered.

194
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,279
Is sex all you think about?.

195
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:51,784
Ah, we're here.
I think this is the place.

196
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,458
Have fun then.
This kind of thing's not for me.

197
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,595
Come with me.
It'll be an exciting experience.

198
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,061
It better be, for what
I spent to find out about this place.

199
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:08,674
Sorry, but I don't have the courage.
Or maybe I'm just too pure.

200
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:13,634
Well, do as you like. But
I'm not missing out on this chance.

201
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,449
Last week I got
lucky with one of the tourists.

202
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:31,085
Come in, miss. You have to pay
in advance here. House rules.

203
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,161
Wait'll you see
how you will be satisfied.

204
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,060
I have two fine specimens here.

205
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,029
Here.

206
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,770
Well, here we are.

207
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,931
It's about time.
Oh, those potholes!

208
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,399
That road is pretty bad,
but you'll really enjoy the show.

209
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:00,373
Give me the champagne?.

210
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,642
Come on, I've reserved
two seats in the front row.

211
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,845
I'm glad you got
a day off before the trip.

212
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,950
I didn't want to leave
without seeing these islands.

213
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:22,022
It's very slippery. There
are a lot of sharp rocks here.

214
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,958
I've never seen so many.

215
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,070
Be careful.

216
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,110
Oh, my shoe!

217
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,074
Here.

218
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,680
Forget it, leave it like that.

219
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,848
Let's stop here.
No one will bother us.

220
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:47,290
You were right. It is a spectacular
sight. What a beautiful sea!

221
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,157
I'm going for a swim.
Will you join me?.

222
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,986
No, I'd prefer
to sit here and watch.

223
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,600
But I'm not part of the show.

224
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:03,137
I think you are. Let's just
say you complete the picture.

225
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,894
The water's incredible.
Why don't you go in?.

226
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:18,142
You are so amazing.
I want you so bad.

227
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:32,917
Pierre and Jacques aren't very
disciplined, but they're fine sailors.

228
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,283
And above all,
they're very trustworthy.

229
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,757
Captain, did Professor
Keller introduce you to his wife?.

230
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,993
Not really, but
I know everything about her.

231
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,928
She is Dr. Simone Keller, biologist.

232
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:48,299
Bravo, captain!
I've heard so much about you.

233
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:52,235
For example, that you
made a big impact on my colleague.

234
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,078
When will we arrive
on the island, captain?.

235
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,636
Just before dawn.

236
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:03,745
Is it that far?.

237
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,247
No, but we will change our course a
few times to avoid being followed.

238
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,850
You never know.

239
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,182
Do you think there will be
any danger from radioactivity?.

240
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,883
I don't think so,
not after all this time.

241
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,585
We'll take a reading,
though, as soon as we get there.

242
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,761
How long
will we be staying there?.

243
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,234
A couple of days.

244
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,225
I really don't know
what we can do there,

245
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,165
other than take a
few readings and samples.

246
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,140
I'm sorry...

247
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,906
But is that how you scientists spend
the taxpayer's money?.

248
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,007
You sound like
a politician on a campaign.

249
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,014
Let's consider the evidence here,

250
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:41,848
the photos and the
testimony of those fishermen.

251
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:46,784
The aerial photos suggest the
possibility of biological mutations.

252
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:52,285
If we accept the
fishermen's stories as truth,

253
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,954
that possibility is doubled.

254
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,567
Or maybe it's
all just a wild story,

255
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,464
in which case

256
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,004
we're all having a little vacation

257
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,733
at the taxpayer's expense.

258
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:11,540
But this island could
hold an unknown danger

259
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:15,881
that we are
not prepared to confront.

260
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:19,223
I say we turn around and go back.

261
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:24,422
You may be right, Professor.
But did we need to hear a speech?.

262
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:27,059
You should have discussed
your fears with the Minister.

263
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,794
I did! God knows
I did! But no one would listen.

264
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,367
And now, here
we are in this little boat,

265
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,234
preparing to
grab the Devil by the horns.

266
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,906
Keller, you're so boring.

267
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,602
Would you rather go to the
island on a cruise liner?.

268
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:46,117
We're only going to take samples.
We're not going of f to war.

269
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:51,180
It may not be a war,
but it's something abnormal.

270
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,257
I'm sure the Minister
wouldn't react this way

271
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,493
to a bunch of fishermen's tales.

272
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,795
All this security...

273
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,064
passing us off as tourists...

274
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,499
changes in the route.

275
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:07,438
I'm convinced there's
something strange going on here.

276
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,835
Oh come on, Keller,
why are you so grim?.

277
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:14,669
Simone, what's worrying your
husband?. Doesn't he ever relax?.

278
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,878
We'd better get some sun
now, before we get to the island.

279
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,714
Have fun! We're on vacation!
A beautiful trip on a tropical sea!

280
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,079
Pity it will all end tomorrow.

281
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,084
Lemuan is right.
You really are boring.

282
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,186
Tomorrow we
start working seriously.

283
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,121
From that point on,
we won't have time to go swimming.

284
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:33,451
That's for sure.

285
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,393
Listen to me,
I know what I'm talking about.

286
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:40,056
-Don't argue any more.
-Enjoy the trip, like I'm doing.

287
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,658
Oh, shut up. That's the way
I am. Please just leave me alone.

288
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:48,536
You don't know how
to take a joke. Aw, just forget it.

289
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,409
Are you enjoying yourself?.

290
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,569
Yes, very much.

291
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,557
When we go back,

292
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:10,789
I'm going to spend a couple of
days relaxing and seeing the sights.

293
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,964
Simone,
will you be staying awhile?.

294
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:17,798
I'd like to, but we have
to return to Paris immediately.

295
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,071
Look! There's your island.

296
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,281
You mad at me?.

297
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,414
Do you think I am?.

298
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:30,187
I haven't talked to you all day.

299
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:31,821
You're talking to me now.

300
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:36,665
I hate having that stupid
Countess thinking I'm an easy lay!

301
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:42,203
I'm not an easy lay.
I'm just a guy who likes you a lot.

302
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,030
If I didn't ----

303
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,386
There's hardly
any radiation at all.

304
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,382
A lot less than we'd predicted.

305
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,995
We can all relax.

306
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,257
Great!

307
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,501
The island is so peaceful.

308
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,379
Stop for a minute?.
I want to take a photo.

309
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:47,969
Nothing at all.
The island looks dead.

310
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,975
You look nervous?.

311
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:52,999
What's wrong?.

312
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,144
Nothing, really.

313
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,011
I just have a feeling
that we're being watched.

314
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:03,576
Is your conscience bothering
you?. It's your own sense of guilt.

315
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,257
How about you, Annie?.
Have you noticed anything?.

316
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:09,026
Nothing at all.
Not even a single insect.

317
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,017
No signs of birds or rodents.....

318
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:12,523
Yes. Let's go on.

319
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,088
They haven't returned yet?.

320
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:48,824
No.

321
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,166
Why are you staying by yourself?.

322
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,531
Your pussy still hurt?.

323
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,235
More than you know.

324
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,068
Those black bastards
really busted my hole.

325
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:01,376
But what a magnificent fuck!

326
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,647
You'll have to be strong now.

327
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:07,417
How will you survive on this island
for a whole week, without any sex?.

328
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,975
There are always new experiences.

329
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,188
What are you doing?.

330
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:18,485
I have a surefire
way to keep us both happy.

331
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,620
The boat's on
the other side of that mountain.

332
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,884
We've explored about
two thirds of the island now.

333
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:22,184
Well, I think
we should return to camp.

334
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,393
Me too.

335
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:26,328
Maybe we'll come back this afternoon
to get a few samples to analyze.

336
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,163
It'll be cooler then.

337
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:36,034
Hey, why don't we eat some crabs
tonight?. There are plenty around.

338
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,541
I hope I'm wrong about this.
What do you think, professor?.

339
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:45,842
No, you're not
wrong. It's incredible!

340
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,347
What a surprise
the Countess will have!

341
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,717
Captain, would you pick
up a few of those for us?.

342
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,969
I'm finished.
Now it's your turn.

343
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,605
I still can't explain
this scientifically.

344
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:13,042
All I can do right now is classify
and preserve the specimens,

345
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:15,976
because we don't have the
necessary instruments here.

346
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:18,748
My husband and I will have
to get back to the lnstitute lab

347
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,875
before we can formulate a theory.

348
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:27,086
Pardon me. I may not understand
this zoology and biology stuf f,

349
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,726
but I've seen thousands
of crabs around here.

350
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:32,095
And they all look
perfectly ordinary to me.

351
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:35,398
This "ordinary" crab is
a cretinos enano, a midget species

352
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:40,665
that usually grows to a maximum
length of 2 and a half centimeters.

353
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:47,043
But this one's more than twenty!

354
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:49,112
22, to be exact.

355
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,943
The radiation, I assume?.

356
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:55,885
You assume correctly, captain.
If you want to know more,

357
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,754
I suggest you go talk to Lemuan.

358
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,789
It's men like him,
playing games with the atom,

359
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,848
who are sending this
whole world straight to Hell.

360
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,279
-Let's stop here and fuck.
-Hmmm, I like that.

361
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:26,295
Our tests detect radiation in the
water, but at extremely low levels.

362
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,664
Are you saying that someday
life may return to this island?.

363
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:29,653
Yes.

364
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:34,492
We've looked everywhere and we
haven't found a trace of animal life.

365
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,061
Only these strange
looking crabs....

366
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,811
It's possible that
after the atomic explosions,

367
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:45,681
some species died of f altogether,
while others may have mutated.

368
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:47,046
And that bothers you?.

369
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:51,954
It's our only hope, really.

370
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:58,561
Some of the animals on this
island may have become nocturnal.

371
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:01,364
And maybe we can
find some specimens.

372
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:04,000
Pardon me,
I don't mean to be rude.

373
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,669
But how much longer will
we have to stay on this island?.

374
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:09,639
However long
it takes. If you don't mind,

375
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:13,336
my wife and I would like
to leave the camp for a while,

376
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:17,106
to go off and
study some things on our own.

377
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,782
Will you assume
personal responsibility

378
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:23,411
for your safety if
you don't stay with the group?.

379
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:25,752
Of course.

380
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:03,519
Find anything?.

381
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,987
Only a few small fresh
water plants.

382
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,113
I think the life forms

383
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:10,521
here have started to mutate.

384
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,562
Do you see the strange
coloration of this plant?.

385
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:18,295
Yes, it looks carnivorous. The
Countess will be able to confirm that.

386
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:26,308
I'm so tired. Let's go to bed.
We'll finish up tomorrow.

387
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:28,299
We're going to be
awfully cramped in there.

388
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,148
So?. Does that bother you?.

389
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:34,742
Simone,
what are you up to now?.

390
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:41,557
You know this place
gives me a strange sensation.

391
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:45,584
Are you afraid?.
It makes me feel something else.

392
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:49,632
Give me a little kiss, professor?.

393
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:52,192
Simone Please!

394
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:56,037
What's wrong?. Are you afraid
that someone might see us?.

395
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:59,636
Then tell me where
you would like to fuck?.

396
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:40,466
Oh, God, professor. That
was marvelous! It's about time!

397
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,037
Yes, it certainly
was marvelous......

398
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:48,784
You see, we may
not like this island,

399
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:51,878
but we've turned this
trip into a honeymoon!

400
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:56,489
That was the first real
fuck you've ever given me!!

401
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:04,800
Our first fuck, eh?. God, I'm all
sweaty. And I'm so thirsty.

402
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,536
We need some ice cold
champagne to celebrate!!

403
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,164
I'm going to take a
dip in the water. Wait a minute?.

404
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:14,600
Hurry back. I'll be waiting.

405
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:16,406
I won't be long.

406
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:22,404
Hey, professor.
Is that you?. Where are you?.

407
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,793
Jacques, come over here.

408
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:18,000
Why're you laughin'
like a fuckin' idiot?.

409
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,538
Those two guys got two women
like that, and look what they're doing.

410
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:26,008
Playing poker instead'a fuckin'.
My grandpappy was right.

411
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,677
What can I say?.
They're very studious people.

412
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,146
Yeah, the Captain's
been studyin' too.

413
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:35,017
When he come back with that lady
doctor, you should see his face.

414
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,885
Well, it's none of our business.

415
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:39,822
Let's go pick some
fruit before it gets dark.

416
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,289
Yes, sir.

417
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:11,649
I'll see ya back at camp.

418
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:12,913
O. K.

419
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:19,351
You go that way,
and I'll go this way.

420
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:20,525
OK boss.

421
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,237
What the hell was that?.

422
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:39,041
Quick! Let's go see.

423
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,099
Let's split up.

424
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:45,460
Captain, I'll go this way.

425
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,290
Alright.

426
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,402
I can't go on.

427
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:55,233
Here, lean on me.

428
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:23,151
To whomever finds this notebook;
My name is Antoine Demaduro.

429
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:27,756
I had no time to leave the
island before the first explosion.

430
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:29,587
I'm going to live in this cave...

431
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:38,289
...with my wife and child.

432
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:48,340
May God have mercy on us,
Monday, the 1 9th of Sept.,1 958.

433
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:36,424
I just came
from the dock. The boat is gone!

434
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:38,960
The ropes were broken.
The currents swept it out to sea.

435
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,120
We're trapped here.

436
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:45,734
What do you
think happened last night?.

437
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,936
I don't know, but I'm
sure it was something terrible.

438
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:50,427
My men don't lose
their heads so easily.

439
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:52,374
And what about the others?.

440
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:56,278
No sign of them. They all seem to
have disappeared, including Annie.

441
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:58,906
My God, that's strange....

442
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:55,435
Look! There's Keller.

443
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:09,818
He's dead.
We have to look for Simone.

444
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:14,187
Their camp must
be up there. Let's go.

445
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:25,129
Who could've done this killing?.

446
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:30,205
I don't know,
but I'm sure it was no animal.

447
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:32,799
How can you be so sure?.

448
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:36,678
I don't know of
any animal, except for a man,

449
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,980
that would fuck
a woman before killing her.

450
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:41,744
No, it's not possible!
I can't believe...

451
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:47,912
a human being was
responsible for these murders.

452
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:52,620
Captain, we're in great danger.
What do we do now?.

453
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:56,965
First,
we have to bury these bodies.

454
01:23:56,965 --> 01:24:02,062
Then we'll go back to the
camp. Annie may still be alive.

455
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:08,209
In a couple of days, there'll be
another boat coming by to look for us.

456
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,370
We have to make a plan.

457
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:16,284
Yes, we have to stay alive
until the other boat arrives.

458
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:21,085
Meanwhile,
help me dig these graves.

459
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:38,466
I found my men. I just finished
burying them, or should I say,

460
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:41,128
what was left of them.

461
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:45,640
I can't understand it.
Who is attacking us?.

462
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:49,235
Oh, I found a small
boat hidden under some bushes.

463
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:51,646
Well, that's good news at least.

464
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:53,546
No, it isn't.

465
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:57,813
Why not?. Now
we can get off the island!

466
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:02,157
It's too small
to carry the three of us.

467
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,792
One big wave,
and we'd be shark food.

468
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:08,963
Wait, Captain. Maybe that
boat came here from a larger ship,

469
01:26:08,963 --> 01:26:12,262
to get water and provisions.

470
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:18,640
No, that's impossible. Fishing is not
alowed within 50 miles of this place.

471
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,075
Then how did that boat get here?.

472
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:25,569
It's just one more mystery
we can add to the others.

473
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:03,076
Maybe we should eat some of these?.

474
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,824
That's not a
good idea. I'm no botanist,

475
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,384
but the fruit
here has an unusual look.

476
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:15,263
The radiation?.

477
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:17,498
Yes.
Do you agree, doctor?.

478
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:19,667
It's better not to risk it,

479
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:23,364
although eating meat in this
heat isn't a good idea, either.

480
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:24,166
Yeah.

481
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:27,874
We don't have
the utensils, anyway.

482
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:31,602
I think we should keep moving.

483
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:36,314
When it gets cooler,
I'm heading south.

484
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:40,121
Still hoping to find Annie?.

485
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:42,521
We have to
wait for the ship anyway.

486
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:46,560
Shouldn't we set up a defense?.

487
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:52,300
I just can't figure out
who that mystery man is,

488
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,802
if he exists.

489
01:27:54,802 --> 01:28:01,799
The captain is right. I agree with
him. We have to try to stay alive.

490
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:05,735
Yeah, we're not gonna just
sit here and wait to be killed.

491
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:10,151
Lemuan, there's some
whiskey left. W ant a drink?.

492
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:11,812
No, thank you.
You know I don't drink.

493
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:22,497
My God, what a barbaric situation!
Look what's become of us.

494
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:26,263
We're like wild
animals trying to survive.

495
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:31,506
You're losing
your dignity too, eh?.

496
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:34,175
I suppose that's
easy for you to do.

497
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:36,541
Depends on the
circumstances, Lemuan.

498
01:28:43,184 --> 01:28:44,886
Find any good ones?.

499
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:46,751
Up to now,
I've just destroyed my hands.

500
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:49,948
Want some?.

501
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:52,986
I'm sweating already.

502
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:54,858
Your loss.....

503
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,360
Be careful,
you could get drunk.

504
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:02,537
Afraid I'll
lose my respect for you?.

505
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:08,276
Afraid I'll
lose my respect for you?.

506
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:09,766
Wait, I'll take care of it.

507
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:17,551
Hey,
where'd you learn to do that?.

508
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:21,846
Where do you think?.

509
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:24,689
Sorry I asked.

510
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:28,986
Come on. Fuck me?.

511
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:31,161
No, thank you.

512
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:35,097
Why, you afraid?.

513
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:38,900
Drink and you'll feel better.

514
01:29:39,807 --> 01:29:45,513
Wouldn't you like to fuck a countess?.
It might be your last chance.

515
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:49,950
Tomorrow we might all be dead...
dead! Understand?.

516
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:20,021
Benoit!! Now I understand.
That was your boat I found.

517
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:21,989
Who did this to you?.

518
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:26,827
A cross between monster and a
man. He was dressed in rags.

519
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:29,230
C'mon, I'll take you to our camp.

520
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,356
No, Captain.

521
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:37,161
That bastard broke
every bone in my body.

522
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:44,304
Let me die in peace.
You'd better go rescue the woman.

523
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:47,114
Woman?.
What woman are you talking about?.

524
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:51,483
The dark-skinned girl.
She was a member of the expedition.

525
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:53,576
Where is she?.?.

526
01:34:53,654 --> 01:35:01,356
Up there, in a cave. Listen to me,
Captain. Don't go up there alone!!

527
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:48,175
Where is it?.

528
01:40:48,175 --> 01:40:49,233
I don't know.

529
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:51,602
We'd better hurry.

530
01:40:58,252 --> 01:40:59,241
Let's go.

531
01:41:32,986 --> 01:41:34,112
Get behind me!

532
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:33,437
No, Demaduro, no!!

533
01:42:42,856 --> 01:42:43,515
Let's go!

534
01:47:34,314 --> 01:47:37,451
We're out of gas, water and food.

535
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:40,215
I'm afraid the current
is taking us to God knows where

536
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:43,120
far from the shipping lanes.

537
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:48,056
It's so unfair. We escape from that
monster, only to end up like this.

538
01:47:49,429 --> 01:47:51,465
You know what
you do in a case like this?.

539
01:47:51,465 --> 01:47:53,695
Just make believe
that everything is OK.

540
01:47:54,367 --> 01:47:55,527
Oh, really?.

541
01:47:55,769 --> 01:47:59,940
Sure, my love. How would you
like a nice continental breakfast?.

542
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:03,103
Scrambled eggs with
2 big slices of bacon.

543
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:08,076
You're so silly. God, what l
wouldn't give for a meal like that!

544
01:48:09,082 --> 01:48:12,074
Then God bless
the captain of that ship.

545
01:48:14,221 --> 01:48:16,689
Hey! We're over here!!

546
01:48:17,424 --> 01:48:20,291
-We're here!
-Help us!!

547
01:48:21,261 --> 01:48:23,889
Over here! Help us!
