00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:49,560
Steve Bauers, Interpol

2
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,396
Hi there. Marsh... we already met

3
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:52,570
So, guys- what have you found?

4
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,569
Doctor, you must take a look
inside the Cave.

5
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,905
OK, we better take a look then.

6
00:02:04,576 --> 00:02:07,168
What a fucking smell!

7
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:23,809
This is the Killer's Cave.
Go and tell the Men...

8
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:32,282
OK, but there is no trace of George!

9
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,289
OK, you better have a look around then.

10
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,807
" I was a big shot Businessman; "

11
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,843
my Family was the most influential
on the lsland.

12
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:34,315
A a matter of fact, you could
say we owned it.

13
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:45,520
Let's see...well...

14
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:47,591
You want to have a look how the
Baby is doing?

15
00:04:50,695 --> 00:05:00,190
Everything is just fine, tonight we will
reach our Destination.

16
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,034
But on this Trip we got caught in the
middle of a bad Thunderstorm.

17
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:12,665
Damned!

18
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:31,441
The Mast!

19
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:37,015
Vicky!

20
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:45,087
Come on, help her.

21
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:13,827
Time has no meaning anymore.
Here it begins and ends...

22
00:06:13,937 --> 00:06:17,167
...the story of the Karamanlis family.

23
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:35,966
Mary, you are so wonderful.

24
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:55,578
Stuart, are you coming with me?
I will look for some wood.

25
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,343
Oh no. You go ahead. I will rest a little bit.

26
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,449
Stuart, I am back.

27
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:06,310
Hey, hey, hey!

28
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:12,480
How are you?

29
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,307
Look at that hat!

30
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:29,156
Vince, how are you?

31
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:30,489
Cool.

32
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:32,990
What's happening? Where are
Mary and Stuart?

33
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:36,583
They just went to the beach,
but they will meet us at the house,

34
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,722
you'll see, I didn't promise you too much.

35
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:41,652
So, what's up now?

36
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:47,330
It's very pretty here.
Let's take a look around.

37
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:56,265
We'll be gone for three hours at least.
I'll better let them know.

38
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,861
" Don't bother; they will have a "
good time without us.

39
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,564
Stan? Yeah, we're fine...

40
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:16,472
Well, there is nothing you can do about it.

41
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:19,377
OK, here she is.

42
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:21,507
Hello Darling?

43
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:29,047
Hello, yes it's me. I've got another
operation an emergency.

44
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:37,415
" And no one else is available; "

45
00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:46,093
I will join you as soon as I'm finished here.

46
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,328
OK, bye, yeah bye.

47
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:57,495
Silly bastard.

48
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,360
Turn right here.

49
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:50,282
Are you feeling ok?

50
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:54,349
If we don't stop right now I will
puke all over the car.

51
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,756
You better stop here.

52
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:00,761
Just a second.

53
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:28,966
Food, Food

54
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:41,773
We are looking for directions to
Borgo San Lorenzo.

55
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:46,009
Borgo San Lorenzo? Don't go there.

56
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,885
Food Food.

57
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:12,690
What did you eat today?

58
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:38,243
You know what, Hank? They nicked
"the Campsite; "

59
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:40,474
take a look at the map.

60
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:53,919
According to the map we should be here,

61
00:21:54,954 --> 00:21:59,218
or here, but we could also be here.

62
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:08,891
You know what. I haven't got a clue.

63
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:12,256
Let's camp right here.

64
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:34,999
Maybe we ran out of gas or whatever.

65
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:41,736
I don't know, it's not my fault.
Fucking weather.

66
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:51,947
" Listen; let's just go into the village."
It's raining cats and dogs.

67
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:55,378
OK

68
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:56,945
OK

69
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:04,450
Shit, my Leg.

70
00:23:05,757 --> 00:23:08,815
Carol, is it bad? Or can you walk?

71
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,026
You all just go ahead, I will take
care of Carol.

72
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:24,459
Vince, take good care of these two.

73
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:01,411
Anybody there?

74
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:12,716
Seems deserted...

75
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:39,129
"Come on; let's take a look inside."

76
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:50,132
Miss...excuse me...Miss

77
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,647
Hey Vince, can you get me some lce?

78
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:24,285
I could bring you a Handful of Sand,
there is nothing else here.

79
00:27:39,597 --> 00:27:42,793
You know what, Carol? I take a look
at the engine.

80
00:28:13,481 --> 00:28:17,075
Vince where the Hell are you?

81
00:28:51,802 --> 00:28:54,599
Hello, where are you two?

82
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:57,569
Come over here!

83
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,629
You won't believe this, but...

84
00:29:44,562 --> 00:29:49,724
" Let's get out of here; yeah let's "
get out of here.

85
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:13,502
I think I'm done here.

86
00:30:36,655 --> 00:30:39,248
I just saw a little take out there.

87
00:30:40,824 --> 00:30:42,791
Maybe we'll meet some chicks...

88
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:45,857
...out there and get lucky.

89
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:55,730
You go ahead, I want to read a little bit,
and we have got a...

90
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:56,957
...Iot to do tomorrow.

91
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,224
I'm getting a little worried about you, man.

92
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:07,134
Back home you are
Mr. Loverboy and out here.

93
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:13,098
You just go and do whatever you want.

94
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:36,541
Damned, where is the car?

95
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:42,681
Maybe they found some gas somewhere.

96
00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:45,954
I can't walk any longer.

97
00:31:48,693 --> 00:31:50,785
You know what? I'll just go and look
around for Mary and Stuart.

98
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:54,385
Let's go that way.

99
00:31:55,595 --> 00:31:56,619
Come on let's go.

100
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:37,445
Help, help.

101
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:17,894
Hey you shit. Where are you?

102
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:44,508
Alan, where are you?...Alan?

103
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:33,472
You know what? I am fucking scared.

104
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:40,402
Mary and Stuart are still not here.

105
00:36:53,315 --> 00:36:55,078
Come on, let's go to bed.

106
00:40:35,796 --> 00:40:37,127
Did you also...?

107
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,521
Are you nuts to scare me like that?

108
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:51,330
Auriet, my god, Auriet. It is me - Rita!

109
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:08,011
What's happening, who is she?

110
00:41:08,246 --> 00:41:12,078
It's Auriet, Mary's sister.

111
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:15,107
Take her upstairs, come on.

112
00:41:24,454 --> 00:41:26,183
She is scared to death.

113
00:41:28,523 --> 00:41:30,615
I think she recognized me.

114
00:41:35,194 --> 00:41:37,183
I think this has to be treated.

115
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,490
I'll go into the village.

116
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,256
Be careful.

117
00:41:55,903 --> 00:42:01,840
Auriet, can you hear me? Where is Mary?

118
00:42:02,173 --> 00:42:03,640
I don't know.

119
00:42:09,311 --> 00:42:12,472
Do you know who he is?

120
00:42:15,614 --> 00:42:35,253
It's him, Mary, Stuart, where are you?
Nobody will come! He is here.

121
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:41,893
How does he smell?

122
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:43,619
He smells like blood.

123
00:42:48,831 --> 00:43:03,898
Everything is going to be just fine,
got to sleep now.

124
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:22,173
I hope there is something that will be
of any help to you.

125
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:22,270
It's useless, Carol is bound to be...

126
00:47:24,173 --> 00:47:28,539
Let's please move on, we will
find them somehow.

127
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:34,000
Hey Mark, don't quit on me now.

128
00:47:35,678 --> 00:47:37,736
I need you.

129
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:44,545
He's no god, he's human.
We can hurt him.

130
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:50,444
We have to stick together or he will
get us one after another.

131
00:47:51,586 --> 00:47:54,213
Come on let's go.

132
00:48:07,862 --> 00:48:15,731
I know that house. It belonged to the
Karamanlis family. They are all dead.

133
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:19,159
Is there nobody left?

134
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:22,700
Only his sister, but she went mad.

135
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,469
I can't stand it any longer.

136
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:50,672
" " "Go away" ". Is this his sister? "

137
00:50:51,513 --> 00:50:52,740
Yes, yes.

138
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,010
It makes me sick, let's get out of here.

139
00:52:30,663 --> 00:52:35,257
Carol, Mary, Stuart, anybody there?

140
00:53:15,486 --> 00:53:18,749
Put her down there. Look at these photos.

141
00:53:48,336 --> 00:53:53,703
" " " My wife, my daughter and the "
unborn child are dead.

142
00:53:59,175 --> 00:54:06,874
Since then I need meat, lot's of
meat from animals but that doesn't stop

143
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:12,913
my craving for blood, red like blood,
red - the colour of love.

144
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:18,650
It's hard to describe the pain that's
tearing me apart.

145
00:54:23,287 --> 00:54:28,722
It's like I am a burning flame
"...an eternal hellfire..." " "

146
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:41,753
Stan! I am so glad you are here.

147
00:54:41,931 --> 00:54:43,988
What the hell is going on?

148
00:54:44,132 --> 00:54:47,623
Vince and Carol are gone but
I know where they are.

149
00:55:05,376 --> 00:55:07,433
Hello, can anybody hear me?

150
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:27,816
Don't worry about me. Vince, Carol!

151
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:31,987
Try to control your breathing and relax.

152
00:56:15,611 --> 00:56:17,441
Hello, can anybody hear me?

153
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,574
Mark, no!

154
00:56:48,628 --> 00:56:50,561
Hello, can anybody hear me?

155
00:56:57,166 --> 00:57:09,630
Carol, are you here? Carol, are you here?

156
00:57:26,149 --> 00:57:27,580
Stan, is it you?

157
00:57:28,149 --> 00:57:32,015
Carol, there you are. Let's get out of here.

158
00:58:01,133 --> 00:58:02,258
What do you want? Leave us alone,
you monster. Is it the child?

159
00:58:10,004 --> 00:58:17,771
I know exactly who you are. But this sacrifice
won't bring back your Wife and Child.

160
00:58:24,744 --> 00:58:31,545
Child, I once also had a child.

161
00:58:47,023 --> 00:59:01,726
A Storm once took us far away from
the coast and the hot sun cooked our Flesh

162
00:59:08,066 --> 00:59:10,829
You better don't do that or the salt
will destroy your skin.

163
00:59:12,702 --> 00:59:18,036
I know, but it is still better than being boiled
by the sun.

164
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,931
You will burn your skin.

165
00:59:22,707 --> 00:59:24,436
I know.

166
00:59:33,381 --> 00:59:43,683
When would we be saved? A ship could
save us, just a ship.

167
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:58,515
The days went by and I thought I was losing
my mind. I wanted to live, we all should live.

168
01:00:21,572 --> 01:00:23,732
My god, you know what
we have to do now.

169
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:24,796
You don't touch her.

170
01:00:24,907 --> 01:00:28,204
It's the only thing left to do.

171
01:00:28,308 --> 01:00:30,640
Leave her alone or I will kill you.

172
01:00:30,743 --> 01:00:35,404
But she is dead. And it's dead meat,
meat we need to survive.

173
01:01:39,712 --> 01:01:42,202
Don't touch him!

174
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,175
Come on.

175
01:05:17,657 --> 01:05:19,385
What do we do now?

176
01:05:25,761 --> 01:05:33,254
Where is the car? Think!

177
01:05:33,666 --> 01:05:35,257
I don't know.

178
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,991
Where is the car?

179
01:05:40,268 --> 01:05:42,792
I don't know!!!!!

180
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:44,400
Come on.

181
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,744
Where are you?

182
01:06:17,554 --> 01:06:18,748
Shit!. Help!

183
01:06:33,295 --> 01:06:34,421
Hurry up!

184
01:07:05,012 --> 01:07:07,036
Help me, George!!!

185
01:10:39,823 --> 01:10:44,416
Do you think you can bring us back to life
with your cruelty?

186
01:11:32,082 --> 01:11:34,379
We love you, Nicos. Come to us.

187
01:11:49,091 --> 01:11:56,926
Release me, release me.

188
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:35,302
Strange, very strange. There is something
fishy about this.

189
01:13:36,447 --> 01:13:40,506
The ending, when could he have
written this.

190
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:45,480
I have to get out of here.
