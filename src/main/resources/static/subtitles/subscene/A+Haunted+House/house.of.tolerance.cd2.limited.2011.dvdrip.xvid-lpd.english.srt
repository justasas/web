1
00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:04,716
He doesn't spend the most,
but he's the richest one.

2
00:00:04,744 --> 00:00:07,452
- Has he been coming long?

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,983
- Yes, since the days
when I worked at L'Apollonide

4
00:00:10,016 --> 00:00:13,259
like you do.

5
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,748
- My back hurts.

6
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:41,952
I'm sick of his doll thing.

7
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:43,756
- Don't complain.
There's worse.

8
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:47,094
- I'm not saying that,
just that I'm sick of it.

9
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,156
- You do as you want.

10
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:52,328
You get rid of creeps
with a few pussy hairs.

11
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:55,862
My whole bush wouldn't do that!

12
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,081
- It feels like an eternity
since we had a day out.

13
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:15,754
[gagging]

14
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:17,385
It's me.

15
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:18,952
Give me your cigarette.

16
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:22,296
All right.

17
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:23,698
What is it?

18
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:26,829
I was thinking a Lanvin hat
would suit you.

19
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,770
Go on then, Polo.

20
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:31,638
Treat me to a hat.

21
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:37,206
The fresh air loosens you up.

22
00:01:37,236 --> 00:01:39,216
Want a drop of champagne?

23
00:01:39,238 --> 00:01:41,582
Please.

24
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,111
Want some too?

25
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:47,556
Yeah, okay.

26
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,753
[coughing]

27
00:01:49,782 --> 00:01:51,784
Gently!

28
00:01:51,817 --> 00:01:53,387
Sorry.

29
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:55,797
Pardon me.

30
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:56,891
It slipped out.

31
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:58,560
Calm down, Polo.

32
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,798
Oh, you know...

33
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:05,002
I'm sorry, it's old age.

34
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:06,305
This is nice.

35
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:07,436
Oh, yes!

36
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:09,173
I feel so good!

37
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:13,542
- I don't think
I'll be here long.

38
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:15,307
- I said that too.

39
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:16,813
Now look at me.

40
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:18,941
- We'll see.

41
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,384
I don't have any debts yet.

42
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:25,252
- We'll see.

43
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:39,025
- "I understand
your sense of injustice,"

44
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:41,868
"and I've always given you
my support."

45
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:45,034
"But, as a prefect,
I can't work miracles."

46
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:50,036
"I cannot oppose
a landlord's decision."

47
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,278
- Good evening.

48
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:54,750
- Who's here this evening?

49
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:57,617
- The same ones.

50
00:03:57,643 --> 00:04:00,988
Still want to see the Jewess?
- Pardon me?

51
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:05,018
- The Woman Who Laughs.
Want to go up to see her?

52
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,620
You can,
but it'll cost you more.

53
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:08,928
- No.
I was a bit tipsy last time.

54
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:10,160
Who else is there?

55
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:11,361
- Who else...

56
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,803
Sweetness, Clea, Climbing Rose,
Fine Thigh...

57
00:04:32,278 --> 00:04:36,317
- Afterwords, women couldn't
compete in the games.

58
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:38,555
- Why not?

59
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:40,996
- Good question.

60
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,197
They were thrown from a rock
if ever they went there.

61
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:50,401
But now they can go.

62
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:53,308
- They couldn't go
because the athletes were nude.

63
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:56,211
Now they're dressed.

64
00:04:56,235 --> 00:04:59,273
So women can take part.

65
00:05:17,823 --> 00:05:20,497
- Will you go up with me
and another girl?

66
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:22,506
- Who?

67
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:24,371
- Anyone.
You choose.

68
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:27,207
- I don't know.

69
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:30,407
I'd rather go alone
if you don't mind.

70
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,384
- Shall I put you in my will?

71
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:51,668
Do you want to be in my will?

72
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,896
- No.

73
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:56,065
I want you to stay alive.

74
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,804
- If anyone here is alive,

75
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:02,335
I am.

76
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:09,242
- Good evening.

77
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:10,583
- Ah, Louis!

78
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:16,757
- A drink
or shall I call Samira?

79
00:06:16,782 --> 00:06:19,626
- Both.

80
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:27,695
- "I understand
your sense of injustice,"

81
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:31,572
"and I've always given you
my support."

82
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:35,477
"But, as a prefect,
I can't work miracles."

83
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:47,214
- Thank you.

84
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:49,624
- Some women
have very large breasts.

85
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:51,025
[bell tolling]

86
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,429
They could have an accident,
knock themselves out...

87
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:55,932
- Yes, that's true.

88
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:58,730
- They could bandage them.

89
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:03,064
- It's not so much fun.

90
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:21,925
- Fine Thigh.

91
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,364
- Fine Thigh...

92
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,800
- Clothed or naked?

93
00:07:31,824 --> 00:07:34,065
- I prefer you naked.

94
00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:36,903
- It costs more.
- I know.

95
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:32,926
- Talk to me in Japanese.

96
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,324
Go on, make it up.

97
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:43,873
Make it up.

98
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:46,900
[speaking Japanese]

99
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:53,413
- More.

100
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:56,443
[speaking Japanese]

101
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:19,166
- What does that mean?

102
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:24,409
- It means my tongue
comes towards you.

103
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:28,350
Slowly.
It slithers across the floor.

104
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:30,353
It slips under the bed.

105
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,946
It rises up the side of it.

106
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:34,980
It reaches your feet.

107
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:36,856
It licks them.

108
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:39,294
It glides up along your leg.

109
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:41,389
Along your thigh.

110
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,593
It reaches your sex.

111
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:45,693
It winds around it.

112
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:48,068
It swallows it completely.

113
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:50,937
Sword swallower.

114
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:57,203
- Your Japanese is very good.

115
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,387
Do you want some?

116
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:08,220
[speaking Japanese]

117
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:09,726
- You don't have to smoke it.

118
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:13,218
You can take a bit and eat it.

119
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:15,789
- It's okay, I know.

120
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:50,296
- I want to see you often.

121
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:53,098
- Won't Clothilde
be angry with me?

122
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,934
- I can see more than one girl.

123
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,807
Now stop asking questions
and talk to me in Japanese.

124
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:14,789
You're very young.

125
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:15,917
- Not that young.

126
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:20,053
- Really?

127
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:24,625
- Not many girls my age
have been fucked in champagne.

128
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:26,567
- Did you like it?

129
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:29,436
- I loved it.

130
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:41,745
- Men never look into the sex
of women enough.

131
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:54,253
Wonderful.

132
00:11:55,587 --> 00:11:58,693
After one night with you,
I could kill myself.

133
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,549
- Say "Ah."

134
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:21,683
Good.

135
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:22,953
What's that spot?

136
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:24,255
- Nothing.

137
00:12:24,282 --> 00:12:25,955
- Have you had it long?

138
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:27,930
- It's nothing.

139
00:12:27,953 --> 00:12:29,023
- All right.

140
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:30,089
One month? Two?

141
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:31,533
- No, a few days.

142
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:34,560
- All right.

143
00:12:34,593 --> 00:12:36,072
Any itching?

144
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:38,096
- No.

145
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:48,241
- No new rashes on your body?
- No.

146
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:51,652
- Let me take a look.

147
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:58,792
Let me see.

148
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:04,531
Lie down now
and let me examine you.

149
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:21,681
Let me see.

150
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:29,050
Nothing around the anus.

151
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:32,085
I'll use the speculum now.

152
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:46,540
- If ever I get out of here,
I'll never make love again.

153
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:50,405
- No...
- Yes.

154
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:51,539
I have to examine you.

155
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,641
You have to lie down.

156
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:55,845
- No!
- I have to examine you.

157
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:57,547
I have to.

158
00:13:57,576 --> 00:13:58,919
Come on.

159
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:00,423
Now spread your thighs.

160
00:14:00,445 --> 00:14:02,550
No two ways about it.

161
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:06,256
I can't see your sex otherwise.
Come on now.

162
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:11,664
Look at me.

163
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,431
You have to lie down.

164
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,962
Lie down and spread your thighs.
You have to do it.

165
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:23,009
The cervix is fine.

166
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:25,241
Heavy but normal discharge.

167
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,807
How about your period?

168
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,445
- It comes and goes.

169
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:32,455
- When did you last have it?
Two months ago?

170
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:33,547
Three?

171
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:35,558
- Not long ago.
I forget.

172
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,459
- Six months?

173
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:41,362
You don't have your period
any more?

174
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:43,662
- I'm not pregnant.

175
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:46,635
- Six months...

176
00:14:46,658 --> 00:14:49,036
- I just don't have my period
any more.

177
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,336
- How about your period?

178
00:14:51,363 --> 00:14:53,468
- Same thing.

179
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:55,569
It comes and goes.

180
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,170
- And you?

181
00:14:57,202 --> 00:14:58,272
- Normal.

182
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,010
- And you there?

183
00:15:00,038 --> 00:15:01,745
- Mine's fine.

184
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:03,446
- Let me examine you.

185
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:16,630
Lie down.

186
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:25,531
- Okay?
