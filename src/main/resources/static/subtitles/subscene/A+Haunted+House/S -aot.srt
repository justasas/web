1
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:23,438
Why did you leave me?

2
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:12,399
My love, I am here to fetch you.

3
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:29,957
You've come back?

4
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,967
According to an age-old belief...

5
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,778
and based on experiences
of people whose friends...

6
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,805
or relatives have passed away...

7
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:50,806
a dying person often sees the ghosts...

8
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:58,733
of their loved ones
who are already deceased.

9
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:09,577
We all have spirits who will fetch
each of us on our last hours.

10
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,831
They are our...

11
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:18,210
HARBINGERS Of DEATH

12
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,976
Take cover.

13
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:11,454
Go around them at the back.

14
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:12,648
Take cover to the left.

15
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:26,410
Take cover.

16
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:03,954
Doc, the patient is hyperventilating.

17
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,209
Let's go.

18
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,548
You check.

19
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,501
Careful now.

20
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,965
This way.

21
00:06:57,424 --> 00:06:58,800
Move a bit over there.

22
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:04,889
Oi!

23
00:07:05,473 --> 00:07:06,891
Why did you let go?

24
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:09,602
Please be careful.

25
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:11,353
We're sorry, ma'am.

26
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:12,254
Hello.

27
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:14,147
I'm still in Baguio.

28
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:16,817
Um, family matters.

29
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:19,235
No, nothing like that.

30
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,989
I had Mama's remains transferred.

31
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:28,285
Are you really sure of your plans?

32
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:34,249
That family
is the cause of your Papa's death.

33
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,127
Didn't you tell me yourself...

34
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:41,381
that even the land
isn't enough to pay...

35
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:45,760
for my brother's life, your father?

36
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,140
And these papers won't bring
Papa back to life.

37
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,937
I want to end all this.

38
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:00,440
That is for you to decide on, Louella.

39
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:05,528
If you really want to renew ties
with Romano's family...

40
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,446
I won't stop you.

41
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:08,989
But...

42
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:15,954
make sure that what you're doing
comes from the heart...

43
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:18,498
because when the time comes...

44
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,792
that everything you know
hasn't been forgotten yet...

45
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:26,172
and you discover
that you're not ready to forgive...

46
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,883
it might become very difficult for you.

47
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:02,690
It's 500 pesos.

48
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:08,528
Okay. Don't forget to finish
Mrs. Lapuz's statue by Friday.

49
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,072
- Yes, ma'am.
- Alright.

50
00:11:10,073 --> 00:11:11,907
Edong, place this in the
storeroom at the back.

51
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:12,657
Okay, ma'am.

52
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:13,867
Do it fast.

53
00:11:20,624 --> 00:11:22,333
Who is she?

54
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,085
Oh.

55
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:30,424
Aunt Menggay.

56
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:32,801
Louella?

57
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:35,012
Please come in.

58
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:37,681
Take a seat, please.

59
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,849
I'll just call Romano.

60
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,184
Make yourselves at home.

61
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:06,499
Romano?

62
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,918
Romano?

63
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,878
Come down here.

64
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:13,130
You have a visitor.

65
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:30,688
Isabel?

66
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,776
Sister, Louella?

67
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:37,777
Yes, it's me.

68
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:48,204
Sister Louella,
why did you leave so suddenly?

69
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:52,249
Louella.

70
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:04,594
How are you?

71
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:07,722
I'm okay. How about you?

72
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:10,348
Baste.

73
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:11,308
Yes?

74
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:19,399
I came here to give this back to you.

75
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:25,905
That caused the feud
between our families.

76
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:29,325
How about my debt to your father?

77
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:32,745
He's no longer here.

78
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:37,415
I want to end whatever
misunderstanding we all have.

79
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:45,131
Thank you.

80
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:54,389
I also came here to tell you that
I have a doctor-friend...

81
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,099
an eye specialist.

82
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,436
Sabel might be interested
to have an eye check up.

83
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:05,942
Brother, can we see him?

84
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:15,409
What do you think made Louella
change her mind?

85
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:18,953
When she came home last year...

86
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:21,873
on her father's death anniversary.

87
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:26,294
Linda said Louella kept drinking.

88
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:31,840
What's more, she was blaming
all of you for his death.

89
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:37,429
And then she's trying
to patch things up with you now.

90
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:43,601
I think there's nothing wrong with that.

91
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:47,396
We've been friends
since we were young.

92
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:55,070
Well, I think it's high time
everything gets settled.

93
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:59,282
By the way, Isabel.

94
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:05,621
I'll have your clothes washed
and then let's pack your bags.

95
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:08,624
Okay. Thank you.

96
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:18,175
Do you really want to see
a specialist again?

97
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:26,724
Why?

98
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:29,518
Don't you want me to?

99
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,521
It's not like that.

100
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,274
Try not to get your hopes up.

101
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:46,300
Brother, I'd rather have something
to hope for...

102
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:51,872
than just missing you.
I won't be able to see again.

103
00:16:01,214 --> 00:16:02,674
Alright.

104
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,723
Romano...

105
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:01,060
Isabel needs someone
to go with her to Manila.

106
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,649
I'm already old...

107
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:12,196
and no one will be left to take care
of your family's business here.

108
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:20,120
I don't want to see
my sister getting hurt.

109
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:25,208
Is that the real reason?

110
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:29,462
Or you really don't to leave
the house?

111
00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:34,925
What are you really afraid of?

112
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:44,350
Nothing.

113
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:48,270
Romano, your sister needs you.

114
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:52,191
And this is her only hope.

115
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:13,668
That's what I've been telling you,
Victor.

116
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:15,336
You're too generous.

117
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:17,463
Now, we're the ones in need.

118
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:20,175
How can you get better now?

119
00:18:20,342 --> 00:18:21,884
Let's not worry about it.

120
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:23,177
Not worry about it?

121
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:25,929
Victor, you're very sick.

122
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,598
You have cancer...

123
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,559
and the medications are expensive.

124
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:34,062
If you didn't allow yourself
be swindle by Romano's father...

125
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:37,107
then we might have more money now
to buy your medicine.

126
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,580
Baste.

127
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:54,623
Yes?

128
00:18:55,374 --> 00:19:00,086
Can I hitch a ride with Aunt Lumen
to Manila later?

129
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:01,754
Yes, of course.

130
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:05,045
Will Doc Louella mind?

131
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,968
She might not like the idea.

132
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:13,306
It's okay. What are neighbors for?

133
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:16,184
I'm just thinking of our bus fare.

134
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:19,228
I can save it and add
to our funeral expenses.

135
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:20,397
Baste.

136
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:22,757
- Sister Louella.
- Please put this there.

137
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,194
Sister Louella. This is Mrs. Lumen.

138
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:30,155
They're asking
if they can hitch a ride with us.

139
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:39,456
Brother.

140
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:42,417
Sister Menggay
wants me to give you this.

141
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:44,961
Thanks.

142
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:49,339
I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

143
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,258
You're really going with me to Manila.

144
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:57,347
But can you please take a bath first?

145
00:19:57,348 --> 00:19:59,348
You smell a little.

146
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:02,810
It might be embarrassing
especially to Sister Louella.

147
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:55,441
- Always take care of yourself.
- Okay.

148
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:58,986
- And remember to pray always.
- I will.

149
00:20:58,987 --> 00:20:59,777
I will.

150
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,072
Good evening, Mrs. Menggay.

151
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:02,782
- Good evening to you, too.
- Hi Isabel.

152
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:04,408
I'll put this at the back.

153
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:07,119
- Okay.
- Thank you.

154
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:11,081
Please take care.

155
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,333
Let me help you with that.

156
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:15,218
- Thanks Louella.
- Thank you.

157
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:17,045
Where's your brother Romano?

158
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:18,964
He'll be here in a minute.

159
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,426
Here he is.

160
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:26,179
It's a good thing
we were able to persuade him to go.

161
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:00,459
Wait, why are we stopping?

162
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
What are you doing?

163
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:03,212
I said I just wanted
to hitch a ride with you.

164
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:04,128
Don't be such a prude.

165
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,295
I'll introduce you to some people
who can build up your career.

166
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,000
Introduce them to me first.

167
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,343
I've heard too many offers already.

168
00:22:10,344 --> 00:22:12,095
Please.

169
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:14,180
What are you doing? I said stop it.

170
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:15,890
C'mon, please...

171
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:17,183
Stop it!

172
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,893
You jerk!

173
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:20,686
Hey, give me my things!

174
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:21,645
You're so ugly.

175
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:23,105
- You creep!
- You will regret if you overact.

176
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:24,148
What do you think of me?

177
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:25,190
- I won't settle for someone like you.
- You boasyful!

178
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:26,091
Go away!

179
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:27,818
You think you're handsome?

180
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,610
You're so disgusting! Shit!

181
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:31,280
And your breath stinks!

182
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:33,240
Stupid.

183
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:36,159
Oh, well!

184
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:39,287
Now, where am I?

185
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,626
Oh my God.

186
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:50,714
Shit.

187
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,220
It's so cold...

188
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,100
Who's there?

189
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:05,061
Let's ask her to ride with us.

190
00:23:06,896 --> 00:23:11,441
Shit, just when I've managed
to get a ride, the rain stops.

191
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:15,487
In fairness ha.
Thank you. You're all kind.

192
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:17,864
Did you know that I'm an actress?

193
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:19,490
You really are?

194
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:20,783
Of course!

195
00:23:20,784 --> 00:23:23,953
I have a primetime show
with Dennis Trillo.

196
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:26,995
I was with him in...
in a scene in a restaurant.

197
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:29,541
My legs looked so good there.

198
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:33,336
And my line was,
''may I take your order, sir?''

199
00:23:33,337 --> 00:23:35,380
- That's it!
- Cute, right?

200
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:05,950
Baste.

201
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:18,003
Baste!

202
00:24:34,894 --> 00:24:36,395
Baste.

203
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:47,196
Mom.

204
00:24:52,243 --> 00:24:53,952
Baste, stop the van!

205
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,498
What happened?

206
00:25:57,886 --> 00:25:59,929
Where is he going?

207
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:31,542
Romano?

208
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,554
What's happening to you?

209
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,954
Let's go!

210
00:28:07,422 --> 00:28:11,091
Brother,
what really happened a while ago?

211
00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:17,055
Nothing.

212
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,600
I just had a bad dream.

213
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,643
At leat you woke up.

214
00:28:22,644 --> 00:28:24,812
If not, we might be all dead by now.

215
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:26,480
I don't want to die that way.

216
00:28:26,481 --> 00:28:28,815
I might look disfigured,
especially my skin.

217
00:28:28,816 --> 00:28:30,859
I paid a lot for my face.

218
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,903
It really looks like it.

219
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,364
What were you dreaming of, Romano?

220
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,659
What?

221
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,788
Didn't you just say
you had a bad dream?

222
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:46,290
Thanks.

223
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,168
I can't remember it.

224
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:52,087
I'll just go to the ladies' room.

225
00:28:52,672 --> 00:28:54,297
Wow, that looks delicious.

226
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:55,882
Oh, sorry.

227
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:07,143
- Romano?
- What was that?

228
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:40,131
Hi. Looking for something?

229
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:50,279
Romano...

230
00:30:55,701 --> 00:30:58,161
I'm sorry for the intrusion, Romano.

231
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:00,872
I just want to help you.

232
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:03,875
Don't you believe me?

233
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:07,461
No, Louella.

234
00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:10,464
That's not what I meant.

235
00:31:19,473 --> 00:31:21,141
Is someone there?

236
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:38,657
Oh...

237
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,290
this is a gift from Carlos.

238
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:04,847
Mother asked me to go
with Aunt Lumen to Manila.

239
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:07,433
Her husband died.

240
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:10,561
It's really hard to accept a death...

241
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,648
especially if it's by accident.

242
00:32:15,774 --> 00:32:21,488
My best friend died.
He killed himself last year.

243
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:27,159
That's so sad.

244
00:32:28,745 --> 00:32:31,663
Okay, I paid for it already. Let's go.

245
00:32:31,664 --> 00:32:33,165
Let's go.

246
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:39,045
Wait, Aunt Lumen isn't back yet.

247
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,049
Aunt Lumen?

248
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:47,470
Aunt Lumen!

249
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:53,642
We won't disregard
the angle of foul play here.

250
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,062
We'll investigate this further.

251
00:32:57,855 --> 00:32:59,939
<i>But you can't bring the body with you...</i>

252
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,941
<i>still under investigation.</i>

253
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:16,079
<i>Eric, will you be staying here?</i>

254
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,457
<i>No. I'm coming with you to Manila.</i>

255
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:22,919
<i>I need to inform my relatives there.</i>

256
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:29,883
<i>Eric, my condolence.</i>

257
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:31,468
<i>Thanks, Kristina.</i>

258
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,846
<i>C'mon, smile for me.</i>

259
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,432
<i>There's my house.</i>

260
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,786
Thanks, guys.

261
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:02,163
Thank you.

262
00:34:02,164 --> 00:34:03,581
Bye-bye.

263
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:07,585
Hey handsome, thanks a lot.
I hope we meet again.

264
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:10,712
Bye!

265
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:11,880
- Bye!
- Take care.

266
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,435
Bye!

267
00:34:29,897 --> 00:34:31,565
My daughter.

268
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:10,309
What were you dreaming of, Romano?

269
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:12,186
Nothing.

270
00:35:12,353 --> 00:35:13,479
Baste!

271
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:20,901
It's a good thing you woke up.

272
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:22,987
If not, we might be all dead by now.

273
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:25,072
I don't want to die that way.

274
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:34,164
After what happened to my brother...

275
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,293
he didn't leave the house anymore.

276
00:35:38,961 --> 00:35:43,339
Every week, his senior officer
from the military came to our house...

277
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,008
to convince him to go back to service.

278
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:49,303
But he didn't talk to him.

279
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,848
Do you think he was traumatized
by what happened to him?

280
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:55,058
Maybe.

281
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:58,561
Please take a seat.

282
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:05,026
When we were at the highway...

283
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,112
I felt that he saw something.

284
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:11,073
Whatever it was, I really don't know.

285
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:13,825
Aunt Menggay told me that...

286
00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:17,662
my brother went with her
one time to buy groceries.

287
00:36:18,497 --> 00:36:20,581
His face suddenly went blank.

288
00:36:20,582 --> 00:36:24,377
Then he asked her
if they could go home already.

289
00:37:33,274 --> 00:37:35,734
I had an accident when I was little.

290
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:38,320
I was playing with my brother.

291
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:44,490
I fell from a tree and hit my head hard.

292
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:49,705
My eyesight went bad ever since.

293
00:37:52,124 --> 00:37:54,084
We'll do a series of tests again...

294
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:57,462
to evaluate the condition
of the cranial and optic nerves...

295
00:37:58,046 --> 00:38:01,424
which were probably damaged
as a result of her head injury.

296
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,343
We can also perform laser surgery.

297
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:08,096
But that's not a guarantee
that we can restore her vision...

298
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:10,057
It's a 50/50 chance.

299
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:15,979
I hope that after this,
I can finally be able to see.

300
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:21,409
I really want to see you
and my brother.

301
00:38:22,786 --> 00:38:25,246
Maybe he's very handsome.

302
00:38:26,414 --> 00:38:30,000
And maybe you're very pretty, too.

303
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:34,754
And I won't argue with that.

304
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:36,519
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

305
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:51,574
- Double 7.
- I got flowers.

306
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:53,201
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

307
00:39:53,744 --> 00:39:54,786
Still plenty.

308
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:56,704
- Cheater!
- I lost.

309
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:57,997
They will look again, eh.

310
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,625
<i>- Open it.
- Oh gosh.</i>

311
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:05,463
Sister Louella... hold on to the rails.

312
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:10,759
Here, have some juice.

313
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,843
Thanks.

314
00:40:32,905 --> 00:40:34,114
Eric.

315
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:37,075
Isabel.

316
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,161
Thank you for coming
to my uncle's wake.

317
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:43,956
Isabel, sit down here.

318
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:47,918
Sister, brother, please take a seat.

319
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,420
Thanks.

320
00:40:53,382 --> 00:40:56,926
Any news about your
Aunt Lumen's death?

321
00:40:56,927 --> 00:40:59,845
They say we can get her remains now.

322
00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:03,432
But we're still waiting
for the release papers in La Union.

323
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:10,814
By the way, we're going back
to Baguio in 2 days.

324
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:17,070
Sister Louella is thinking
you might want to ride with us.

325
00:41:20,198 --> 00:41:22,408
That's okay. Thanks.

326
00:41:22,992 --> 00:41:25,202
I already talked to my mother.

327
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:29,206
She said she's going here
to attend her sister's wake.

328
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,956
All of us have someone to fetch us.

329
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:19,711
When death is near,
they will come to pick us up.

330
00:42:20,754 --> 00:42:23,798
They are the harbingers of Death.

331
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:29,219
They will come for us
and bring us to the other life.

332
00:42:30,054 --> 00:42:32,222
All of us have someone to fetch us.

333
00:42:32,848 --> 00:42:36,559
When death is near,
they will come to pick us up.

334
00:42:36,602 --> 00:42:39,687
They are the harbingers of Death.

335
00:42:39,938 --> 00:42:45,651
They will come for us
and bring us to the other life.

336
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:50,656
You... who will come to fetch you?

337
00:42:51,365 --> 00:42:52,240
<i>Damn!</i>

338
00:42:52,241 --> 00:42:53,366
<i>you double-crossed me!</i>

339
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:55,118
You're stupid!

340
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,953
<i>- There's a fight going on.
- Why?</i>

341
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:04,626
What's that, what?

342
00:43:04,627 --> 00:43:06,337
What's happening outside?

343
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:07,713
I don't know.

344
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:32,277
Isabel?

345
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:33,862
Isabel!

346
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,617
Sister Louella!

347
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:41,869
Sister Louella!

348
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:44,497
Isabel, open the door!

349
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,083
Eric, what's happening?

350
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,837
Isabel, open the door!

351
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,591
When death is near,
they will come to pick us up.

352
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,719
They are the harbingers of Death.

353
00:44:00,553 --> 00:44:03,806
They will come for us
and bring us to the other life.

354
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:06,892
Death is here now.

355
00:44:34,126 --> 00:44:35,043
Eric?

356
00:44:40,215 --> 00:44:41,716
Why is it wet here?

357
00:44:58,482 --> 00:45:01,025
- Isabel, open it now!
- Isabel!

358
00:45:09,575 --> 00:45:10,576
fric!

359
00:45:11,452 --> 00:45:13,662
Eric, what's happening?

360
00:45:16,248 --> 00:45:17,332
Eric!

361
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:22,878
Isabel !

362
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:34,181
Brother, what's going on?

363
00:45:34,556 --> 00:45:36,307
Why has this happened to Eric, too?

364
00:45:38,143 --> 00:45:39,936
This is bad luck.

365
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:43,105
Why are we experiencing
bad things one after the other?

366
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:46,525
Romano, I know
you're hiding something to us.

367
00:45:47,902 --> 00:45:50,070
You know something about this.

368
00:45:51,906 --> 00:45:53,824
The incident that happened
in the highway.. .

369
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,535
to Lumen... to Eric.

370
00:45:58,578 --> 00:46:00,580
What really was that?

371
00:46:00,705 --> 00:46:03,165
Why don't you just tell us?

372
00:46:06,085 --> 00:46:08,212
I myself can't understand it.

373
00:46:10,589 --> 00:46:12,507
After my accident...

374
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:16,761
I went on comatose.

375
00:46:17,763 --> 00:46:21,933
When I woke,
strange things started happening.

376
00:46:22,976 --> 00:46:25,644
When I dreamt
that we were in an accident...

377
00:46:26,687 --> 00:46:28,897
I asked Baste to stop the van.

378
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:35,194
I saw something.

379
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:36,488
What did you see?

380
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:42,577
Spirits.

381
00:46:46,497 --> 00:46:47,998
5 souls.

382
00:46:51,252 --> 00:46:53,753
They were surrounding the van.

383
00:46:54,588 --> 00:46:57,090
What do you mean by "spirits''?

384
00:46:57,799 --> 00:46:59,884
Before Lumen's death.

385
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:03,012
When we were eating at the canteen...

386
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:06,682
I saw this spirit again.

387
00:47:07,266 --> 00:47:09,726
Outside the doctor's office.

388
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:12,437
When Isabel had her eyes checked...

389
00:47:13,022 --> 00:47:14,940
I saw another one again.

390
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,277
That was the soul
I've seen during the wake.

391
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:22,071
Before Eric's death.

392
00:47:24,073 --> 00:47:27,534
Brother Romano, I know a spiritist.

393
00:47:28,202 --> 00:47:29,912
She may be able to help.

394
00:47:30,621 --> 00:47:32,581
Let's see her tomorrow.

395
00:47:42,382 --> 00:47:44,842
I saw it upstairs, near the table.

396
00:47:49,263 --> 00:47:54,017
Romano, how does it feel
like whenever you see a ghost?

397
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:05,986
It doesn't seem real.

398
00:48:09,865 --> 00:48:15,453
You think you're just seeing things.

399
00:48:19,249 --> 00:48:25,421
Then your hair starts to rise.

400
00:48:30,134 --> 00:48:37,640
And you suddenly feel light-headed.

401
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:50,903
You know what, when Papa died...

402
00:48:52,071 --> 00:48:56,699
I always wondered what I would feel
when he shows himself to me.

403
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:02,663
Will I get scared
or be happy to see him?

404
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:08,252
I waited and waited
for him but he never came.

405
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:15,175
I guess I really don't have
the eye to see those things.

406
00:49:15,259 --> 00:49:23,266
The books says that anyone
can see a spirit if he wants to.

407
00:49:23,975 --> 00:49:35,610
You just need to focus.
Concentrate on the room...

408
00:49:39,364 --> 00:49:41,491
in every corner.

409
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:49,164
Then try to open your eyes
in different ways.

410
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:51,750
Try to feel everything around you.

411
00:49:53,168 --> 00:49:58,173
Whisper whatever you want
to the wind.

412
00:50:04,053 --> 00:50:05,930
Okay, I'll read it.

413
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:08,932
I'll go inside now.

414
00:50:21,444 --> 00:50:23,904
<i>Give me one kilo of pork.</i>

415
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,114
<i>One kilo of porkchop.</i>

416
00:50:26,115 --> 00:50:28,617
<i>Hold on, please.</i>

417
00:50:29,744 --> 00:50:31,161
<i>Here.</i>

418
00:50:31,287 --> 00:50:33,288
<i>140.</i>

419
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:38,042
Excuse me, boss.

420
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,294
Do you know where I can find
Mrs. Elma?

421
00:50:40,295 --> 00:50:41,337
Mrs. Elma?

422
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:42,796
Oh, Mrs. Elma.

423
00:50:42,797 --> 00:50:44,840
She's over there.

424
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:45,841
Let's go.

425
00:50:46,301 --> 00:50:48,093
- Thank you.
- Okay.

426
00:50:52,097 --> 00:50:53,556
Excuse me...

427
00:50:53,557 --> 00:50:54,932
are you Mrs. Elma?

428
00:50:54,933 --> 00:50:56,434
Why? What do you want?

429
00:50:56,727 --> 00:50:57,768
Your Mrs. Elma.

430
00:50:57,769 --> 00:50:59,896
Brother Romano, she's Mrs. Elma.

431
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,399
I want to ask you something.

432
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,611
Hurry up. I don't have all day.

433
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,490
Ma'am Elma...

434
00:51:12,491 --> 00:51:16,411
I can see things that I don't
understand.

435
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:25,127
Do you have money?

436
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:29,839
Let's go to a place that's more quiet.

437
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,091
follow me!

438
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:35,094
Hey, faster!

439
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,055
Careful now.

440
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:57,991
What do you see?

441
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,284
Ever since I woke up...

442
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:05,414
from being comatose...

443
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:10,627
I've been seeing spirits.

444
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,462
But now...

445
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,633
they're bothering me.

446
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,887
And everytime I see a ghost...

447
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,891
someone dies.

448
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:29,269
Like one of our friends...

449
00:52:29,937 --> 00:52:31,729
before she died in the accident.

450
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,357
I'm just thinking of our bus fare.

451
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,527
I can save it and add to our
funeral expenses.

452
00:52:39,946 --> 00:52:42,657
I saw the spirit of her husband.

453
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:46,660
The other one...

454
00:52:48,663 --> 00:52:50,080
I saw his friend.

455
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:52,707
My best friend died.

456
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:56,169
He killed himself last year.

457
00:53:05,928 --> 00:53:07,846
Your 3rd eye is open.

458
00:53:08,097 --> 00:53:11,308
It may have opened during the
accident you encountered.

459
00:53:11,767 --> 00:53:13,643
The spirits you see...

460
00:53:13,644 --> 00:53:17,272
are no doubt the harbingers of Death.

461
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:21,108
We all have someone to fetch us
when our time comes.

462
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:22,735
Your brother, sister...

463
00:53:22,777 --> 00:53:23,861
wife...

464
00:53:23,862 --> 00:53:25,320
best friend...

465
00:53:25,321 --> 00:53:26,989
relative.

466
00:53:27,532 --> 00:53:30,617
But why are they after Romano?

467
00:53:30,743 --> 00:53:31,994
Maybe...

468
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:35,080
they know that Romano sees them.

469
00:53:35,122 --> 00:53:38,082
And they want to tell him something.

470
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,669
That's why I saw them in the tunnel.

471
00:53:42,462 --> 00:53:43,546
The tunnel?

472
00:53:45,173 --> 00:53:46,131
Yes.

473
00:53:46,466 --> 00:53:48,550
We almost met an accident.

474
00:53:48,718 --> 00:53:50,552
But Romano saved us.

475
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:54,264
I see other spirits, too.

476
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,225
There are more?

477
00:53:57,893 --> 00:53:59,560
If that's the case...

478
00:53:59,644 --> 00:54:02,647
you have cheated death.

479
00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:06,442
Now, Death wants you to pay.

480
00:54:06,526 --> 00:54:08,652
What should we do?

481
00:54:08,653 --> 00:54:13,031
You were given that power to
see those spirits.

482
00:54:13,657 --> 00:54:16,159
And they are here to warn you.

483
00:54:16,451 --> 00:54:19,579
But how can we escape from Death?

484
00:54:19,871 --> 00:54:21,164
What I know...

485
00:54:21,206 --> 00:54:23,874
is that when you cheat death...

486
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:26,043
you have to pay with death, too.

487
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:34,634
What are you getting?

488
00:54:55,404 --> 00:54:57,655
What's wrong, Brother Romano?

489
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:04,620
Romano...

490
00:55:04,996 --> 00:55:07,164
have you seen another one again?

491
00:55:07,206 --> 00:55:08,624
Yes.

492
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:10,792
He's the old man...

493
00:55:11,043 --> 00:55:14,588
I saw at the highway,
while we're walking.

494
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,800
He's wearing a necklace.

495
00:55:19,217 --> 00:55:20,593
A necklace?

496
00:55:21,678 --> 00:55:23,596
With an animal tooth pendant?

497
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,558
Brother Romano, he's my grandfather.

498
00:55:28,017 --> 00:55:29,935
He was the one who raised me.

499
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:33,855
Am I next?

500
00:55:35,023 --> 00:55:37,108
Am I going to die?

501
00:55:56,168 --> 00:55:58,628
Romano.

502
00:56:12,683 --> 00:56:14,017
Louella...

503
00:56:14,601 --> 00:56:16,436
go to the van.

504
00:56:42,961 --> 00:56:46,005
Run!

505
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:23,956
Baste got away.

506
00:57:23,957 --> 00:57:25,916
But is he really safe?

507
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,875
How about us?

508
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:28,836
Who's next in line?

509
00:57:29,211 --> 00:57:31,546
We need to calm down.

510
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:34,716
Brother, who else did you see at
the highway.

511
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,720
I saw 5 souls.

512
00:57:40,764 --> 00:57:44,433
The 3 have already reappeared.

513
00:57:45,309 --> 00:57:47,102
There are 7 of us.

514
00:57:48,312 --> 00:57:51,732
This means 2 will be saved?

515
00:57:52,399 --> 00:57:54,484
I saw my mother.

516
00:57:54,568 --> 00:57:55,860
What?

517
00:57:58,738 --> 00:58:01,115
It's either Isabel or I...

518
00:58:01,658 --> 00:58:02,950
who's next.

519
00:58:03,117 --> 00:58:04,994
But who's the 5th one?

520
00:58:06,037 --> 00:58:07,663
A woman.

521
00:58:10,624 --> 00:58:12,793
I don't know who she is.

522
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,378
Her hair covered her face.

523
00:58:16,338 --> 00:58:18,381
And there's another one.

524
00:58:19,341 --> 00:58:20,800
You saw another one?

525
00:58:21,217 --> 00:58:23,260
I didn't see it.

526
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,971
I just heard it?

527
00:58:26,597 --> 00:58:28,474
What did you hear?

528
00:58:28,975 --> 00:58:31,101
I heard a baby crying.

529
00:58:32,686 --> 00:58:35,105
Let's go. We need to see Kristina.

530
00:58:38,316 --> 00:58:41,110
She left her cellphone while in a hurry.

531
00:58:41,111 --> 00:58:45,364
But she'll be here soon.
She's coming from a shooting.

532
00:58:45,573 --> 00:58:48,700
Oh, here she is. Kristina.

533
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:49,409
Hey, Baste.

534
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:50,410
My fare.

535
00:58:52,204 --> 00:58:53,830
Romano!

536
00:58:54,123 --> 00:58:55,623
I missed you.

537
00:58:55,624 --> 00:58:57,124
Did you miss me, too?

538
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:59,585
We need to talk.

539
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,840
I don't remember anything.

540
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,925
Besides, I really don't have a child.

541
00:59:06,926 --> 00:59:09,928
And I don't even have a niece or
nephew who died.

542
00:59:10,012 --> 00:59:11,930
Aren't you forgetting someone?

543
00:59:11,931 --> 00:59:14,765
We haven't had any child deaths in
our family.

544
00:59:14,766 --> 00:59:17,644
I think we're a family with long lives.

545
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:20,605
Wait, are you really telling the truth?

546
00:59:21,064 --> 00:59:24,900
Kristina, serve them some coffee first.

547
00:59:32,533 --> 00:59:34,075
Ma'am...

548
00:59:34,868 --> 00:59:38,663
please don't take this personally but...

549
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,583
has she never given birth?

550
00:59:42,917 --> 00:59:45,377
I am sure of it.

551
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:47,671
She doesn't even have a boyfriend.

552
00:59:48,047 --> 00:59:50,549
She's very choosy.

553
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:03,477
Hey handsome, here's your coffee.

554
01:00:04,687 --> 01:00:06,522
I made this for you.

555
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,661
Kristina, why won't you believe in us?

556
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,667
We'll just go out for some fresh air.

557
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:30,335
Come, Isabel.

558
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:38,009
Sister Kristina, please be careful.

559
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:39,927
How sweet.

560
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:47,017
Your sister's so nice.

561
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:51,438
But I don't like the other girl.
She's always frowning at me?

562
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:56,234
I think she has a crash on you.

563
01:00:57,652 --> 01:01:00,363
What we're saying is true.

564
01:01:01,656 --> 01:01:04,158
We came here...

565
01:01:04,284 --> 01:01:06,452
to warn you.

566
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:08,162
You know what?

567
01:01:08,454 --> 01:01:10,581
I'm not afraid of dying.

568
01:01:10,915 --> 01:01:12,749
What can I do if my time is up?

569
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,876
Will I fight against Death?

570
01:01:14,877 --> 01:01:16,878
I'll just tire myself out.

571
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,714
I just don't want to die looking ugly.

572
01:01:20,507 --> 01:01:23,134
But if you want to...

573
01:01:23,551 --> 01:01:24,801
look after me...

574
01:01:24,802 --> 01:01:27,929
protect or guard me...

575
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:32,184
24 hours a day,
I won't stop you.

576
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,193
What did she say?

577
01:01:42,277 --> 01:01:44,528
She still doesn't believe me.

578
01:02:02,796 --> 01:02:04,380
Be careful.

579
01:02:09,468 --> 01:02:10,677
Baste...

580
01:02:11,845 --> 01:02:13,597
let's go back to Kristina's place.

581
01:02:13,722 --> 01:02:15,556
Why? Did you forget something?

582
01:02:15,557 --> 01:02:17,350
Just do what I tell you.

583
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:19,185
Romano, what's wrong?

584
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:24,273
I know who has come to get her.

585
01:02:31,071 --> 01:02:33,073
Your daughter had a twin.

586
01:02:35,117 --> 01:02:36,951
Tell me the truth.

587
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,123
How did you know about it?

588
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:46,001
That's no longer important.

589
01:02:52,132 --> 01:02:56,428
I had to give up the other
because we were very poor.

590
01:02:57,387 --> 01:03:01,807
I chose Kristina because she's
sweeter and more quiet.

591
01:03:05,561 --> 01:03:07,563
What I know is that...

592
01:03:07,897 --> 01:03:11,233
that the people who adopted her
treated her badly.

593
01:03:12,067 --> 01:03:15,570
She got very sick and died
because of this.

594
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,330
Where is Kristina now?

595
01:03:26,831 --> 01:03:29,458
She's in her manager's spa.

596
01:04:43,276 --> 01:04:44,276
Yes, ma'am.

597
01:04:44,277 --> 01:04:45,193
Miss...

598
01:04:45,194 --> 01:04:46,611
- Yes?
- is Kristina here?

599
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:48,654
Oh, the one who is taking a spa?
Yes, she is.

600
01:04:48,656 --> 01:04:50,698
- Where is she?
- She's inside.

601
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:52,867
Sir, you can't go in there.

602
01:04:52,868 --> 01:04:53,743
Kristina!

603
01:04:53,744 --> 01:04:55,578
- Sir!
- Kristina!

604
01:04:56,705 --> 01:04:58,289
I'll follow Romano.

605
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:00,291
Please take care of Isabel.

606
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:02,126
Don't leave her alone.

607
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,603
How much for everything?

608
01:05:22,854 --> 01:05:24,063
23.

609
01:05:24,314 --> 01:05:25,981
- Here you go.
- Oh, it's a big money.

610
01:05:25,982 --> 01:05:27,399
Don't you have a smaller amount?

611
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,901
Sorry, I don't have loose change.

612
01:05:28,943 --> 01:05:30,819
Okay, wait for me.

613
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:42,204
What's wrong?

614
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:43,456
Hey!

615
01:05:44,207 --> 01:05:46,875
If I see a scratch there,
you'll be paying for it!

616
01:05:46,959 --> 01:05:49,336
Let's go! Hurry up!

617
01:05:52,006 --> 01:05:53,380
Kristina!

618
01:05:57,177 --> 01:05:58,678
Help me.

619
01:06:23,201 --> 01:06:24,160
Baste.

620
01:06:24,452 --> 01:06:25,452
Help me.

621
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:26,536
Romano!

622
01:06:26,537 --> 01:06:28,079
Romano, please help me.

623
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,373
Kristina?

624
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:31,333
Kristina!

625
01:06:37,339 --> 01:06:39,421
Kristina! Kristina!

626
01:06:41,593 --> 01:06:42,510
Baste!

627
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:43,660
Isabel !

628
01:06:43,828 --> 01:06:45,387
- Baste!
- Isabel, please help me!

629
01:06:45,388 --> 01:06:47,222
What's happening to you?

630
01:06:52,561 --> 01:06:53,561
Kristina?

631
01:06:53,954 --> 01:06:55,105
Kristina?

632
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:05,906
Kristina?

633
01:07:36,184 --> 01:07:39,520
Do you think we will avoid any
accidents now?

634
01:07:47,278 --> 01:07:50,363
We're fighting against spirits
Romano, not humans.

635
01:07:50,364 --> 01:07:52,657
He can do anything he wants.

636
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,784
We can't hide from him.

637
01:07:54,785 --> 01:07:56,911
We are all going to die.

638
01:07:59,164 --> 01:08:00,832
I'm a doctor.

639
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:05,252
I've seen death.
But not this way, not like this.

640
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:08,255
I don't want to believe,
but how couldn't I?

641
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:13,343
We need to do everything to
keep us safe.

642
01:08:13,469 --> 01:08:16,262
You don't understand what Mrs.
Elma told us.

643
01:08:18,265 --> 01:08:20,683
Death is chasing us.

644
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:22,976
We need to sacrifice a life.

645
01:08:22,977 --> 01:08:26,480
He is after someone alive,
now we need someone in exchange.

646
01:08:31,527 --> 01:08:33,403
What do you want to do?

647
01:08:35,781 --> 01:08:37,532
Kill someone?

648
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:53,964
Brother...

649
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:56,674
isn't that...

650
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:00,595
I'm to blame for all of this.

651
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:04,265
If it wasn't for me...

652
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:08,394
we wouldn't have been here in Manila.

653
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,605
Don't think about those things.

654
01:09:14,858 --> 01:09:16,526
It's not your fault.

655
01:09:17,527 --> 01:09:19,529
Go get some rest.

656
01:09:22,323 --> 01:09:26,994
Brother, is mom fetching me or you?

657
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:45,594
Do you remember that picture?

658
01:09:47,722 --> 01:09:50,182
The drawing in Isabel's hand?

659
01:09:52,226 --> 01:09:54,019
I did that.

660
01:09:54,937 --> 01:09:57,730
Those are stick figures of a family.

661
01:09:58,231 --> 01:10:00,983
A dad and a mom...

662
01:10:01,317 --> 01:10:03,235
and a baby.

663
01:10:03,528 --> 01:10:05,362
Louella...

664
01:10:07,281 --> 01:10:10,075
you don't have to worry about
anything.

665
01:10:11,785 --> 01:10:14,579
I can't see any spirits right now.

666
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:21,794
That could fetch you.

667
01:10:25,548 --> 01:10:27,508
I told myself before...

668
01:10:29,301 --> 01:10:33,763
that when I have a child...

669
01:10:35,182 --> 01:10:37,058
a boy.

670
01:10:38,059 --> 01:10:39,811
Romano...

671
01:10:39,895 --> 01:10:42,730
that crying baby you heard.

672
01:10:44,691 --> 01:10:47,026
I am being fetched.

673
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:50,946
What do you mean?

674
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,573
I got pregnant...

675
01:10:56,451 --> 01:10:58,410
It was a bad time for me.

676
01:10:58,411 --> 01:11:00,747
when I was in med school.

677
01:11:02,499 --> 01:11:05,668
I had the baby, my child... aborted.

678
01:11:06,627 --> 01:11:09,379
I aborted the child.

679
01:11:09,755 --> 01:11:14,009
That's why I know that I'm
the next one.

680
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,263
My baby is coming to get me.

681
01:11:20,181 --> 01:11:23,017
He's coming to get me.

682
01:11:45,955 --> 01:11:48,332
Romano, we need to be careful.

683
01:13:36,306 --> 01:13:37,848
Where are you?

684
01:13:37,849 --> 01:13:39,433
Show yourself to me!

685
01:13:39,434 --> 01:13:41,477
Show yourself!

686
01:15:40,962 --> 01:15:43,339
Isabel.

687
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,802
Mom.

688
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:25,628
Isabel.

689
01:16:27,171 --> 01:16:28,714
Isabel.

690
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,355
Isabel !

691
01:17:58,004 --> 01:18:00,089
That's enough.

692
01:18:01,007 --> 01:18:02,674
That's enough! I can't take it
anymore!

693
01:18:02,675 --> 01:18:05,052
That's enough! Stop it!

694
01:18:05,053 --> 01:18:06,178
Stop it!

695
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:07,221
That's enough!

696
01:18:14,311 --> 01:18:16,062
Isabel...

697
01:18:17,022 --> 01:18:18,773
what are you doing there?

698
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:23,527
Brother, please come here.

699
01:18:28,449 --> 01:18:30,492
Go down there.

700
01:18:42,295 --> 01:18:43,671
Isabel.

701
01:18:51,011 --> 01:18:52,387
Brother.

702
01:19:50,566 --> 01:19:52,567
Louella?

703
01:19:56,488 --> 01:19:58,573
I won't die now.

704
01:19:58,615 --> 01:20:01,033
I've already sacrificed a life.

705
01:20:03,494 --> 01:20:04,994
It's all your fault!

706
01:20:05,062 --> 01:20:07,664
It's your fault why Papa is dead now.

707
01:20:08,332 --> 01:20:10,334
Isabel had to pay with her life.

708
01:20:10,335 --> 01:20:12,210
I don't want to die yet.

709
01:20:12,711 --> 01:20:14,296
I don't want to die yet.

710
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:16,881
You killed Isabel?

711
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,674
She can't kill me.

712
01:20:18,675 --> 01:20:20,510
She can't go after me.

713
01:20:29,685 --> 01:20:31,978
I need to stay alive.

714
01:20:32,563 --> 01:20:34,648
You need to die now.

715
01:20:35,941 --> 01:20:38,526
You need to die now.

716
01:21:06,344 --> 01:21:09,221
Do you come to fetch me?

717
01:22:13,155 --> 01:22:15,448
I don't wanna die yet.

718
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:21,300

01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:27,251
Get away from me!
