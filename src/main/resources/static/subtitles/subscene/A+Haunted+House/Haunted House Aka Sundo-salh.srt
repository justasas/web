1
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:22,921
Why did you leave me..?

2
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,851
My love,
l am here to fetch you.

3
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:29,316
You've come back?

4
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:32,783
Haah...

5
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,017
Haah.

6
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:41,518
Accordíng to an age-old beIief...

7
00:01:41,883 --> 00:01:41,883
and based on experiences of 
peopIe whose friends...

8
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:46,418
or reIatives have passed away...

9
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:46,683
a dyíng person often sees the ghosts...

10
00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:58,122
of theír loved ones
who are already deceased.

11
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:08,959
We all have spíríts who will fetch
each of us on our last hours.

12
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:13,184
They are our...

13
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:17,585
Harbingers of demh!!

14
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:06,251
Take over.

15
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,149
Surround them at the back.

16
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:11,882
Take over to the left.

17
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:25,715
Take over.

18
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:01,783
Doc, the patient is hyperventilating.

19
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:04,382
Let's go.

20
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:10,715
You check.

21
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:49,649
Careful now.

22
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,116
This way.

23
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:57,916
Move a bit over there.

24
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:03,982
Hey!

25
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:05,982
Why did you let go?

26
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:08,717
Please be careful.

27
00:07:09,482 --> 00:07:10,783
We're sorry, ma'am.

28
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:10,949
Hello.

29
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:13,217
l'm still in Baguio.

30
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:15,917
Family matters.

31
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:18,317
No, nothing like that.

32
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:22,117
l had Mama's remains transferred.

33
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:27,383
Are you really sure of your plans?

34
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:33,320
That family
is the cause of your Papa's death.

35
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:36,217
Didn't you tell me yourself...

36
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:40,452
that even the land
isn't enough to pay...

37
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:44,785
for my brother's life, your father?

38
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:50,252
And these papers won't bring
Papa back to life.

39
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,017
l want to end all this.

40
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:59,484
That is for you to decide on, Louella.

41
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:04,585
lf you really want to renew ties
with Romano's family...

42
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:06,850
l won't stop you.

43
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:08,050
But...

44
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:09,416
make sure that what you're doing
comes from the heart...

45
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:17,517
because when the time comes...

46
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:21,218
that everything you know
hasn't been forgotten yet...

47
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:25,186
and you discover
that you're not ready to forgive...

48
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:27,917
it might become very diflicult for you.

49
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:00,616
lt's five hundred pesos.

50
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:02,549
Okay.

51
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:07,786
Don't forget to finish
Mrs. Lapuz's statue by friday.

52
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,050
- Yes, ma'am.
- Alright.

53
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:09,482
Edong, place this in the storeroom
at the back.

54
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:11,948
Okay, ma'am.

55
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:12,749
Do it fast.

56
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:21,182
Who is she?

57
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:22,982
Oh.

58
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:29,250
Aunt Menggay.

59
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:31,650
Louella?

60
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,883
Please come in.

61
00:11:34,716 --> 00:11:36,517
Take a seat, please.

62
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:38,749
l'll just call Romano.

63
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:40,082
Make yourselves at home.

64
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,316
Romano?

65
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:07,750
Romano?

66
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:09,716
Come down here.

67
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:11,950
You have a visitor.

68
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:29,517
lsabel?

69
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:34,550
Sister, Louella?

70
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:36,616
Yes, it is l.

71
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:46,985
Sister Louella,
why did you leave so sudddenly?

72
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:51,050
Louella.

73
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,349
How are you?

74
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:06,517
l'm okay. How about you?

75
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:09,183
Baste.

76
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:10,049
Yes?

77
00:13:15,482 --> 00:13:18,117
l came here to give this back to you.

78
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:24,686
That caused the feud
between our families.

79
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:28,117
How about my debt to your father?

80
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:31,482
He's no longer here.

81
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:36,186
l want to end whatever
misunderstanding we all have.

82
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:43,883
Thank you.

83
00:13:46,282 --> 00:13:53,322
l also came here to tell you that
l have a doctor-friend...

84
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:55,084
an eye specialist.

85
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:58,185
Sabel might be interested
to have an eye check up.

86
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:04,652
Brother, can we see him?

87
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:14,118
What do you think made Louella
change her mind?

88
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:16,282
When she came home last year...

89
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:20,551
on her father's death anniversary.

90
00:14:21,315 --> 00:14:25,018
Linda said Louella kept drinking.

91
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:30,553
What's more, she was blaming
all of you for his death.

92
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:36,152
And then she's trying
to patch things up with you now.

93
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:42,317
l think there's nothing wrong with that.

94
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,084
We've been friends
since we were young.

95
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:53,721
Well, l think it's high time
everything gets settled.

96
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:58,083
By the way, Isabel.

97
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:04,288
l'll have your clothes washed
and then let's pack your bags.

98
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:07,283
Okay. Thank you.

99
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:16,853
Do you really want to see
a specialist again?

100
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:25,383
Why?

101
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:28,117
Don't you want me to?

102
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:31,182
lt's not like that.

103
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,950
Try not to get your hopes up.

104
00:15:41,883 --> 00:15:41,883
Brother,
l'd rather have something to hope...

105
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:50,485
for than thinking,
l won't be able to see again.

106
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:01,282
Alright.

107
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:55,282
Romano...

108
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,617
lsabel needs someone
to go with her to Manila.

109
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:05,217
l'm already old...

110
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:10,719
and no one will be left to take care
of your family's business here.

111
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:18,652
l don't want to see
my sister getting hurt.

112
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:23,751
ls that the real reason?

113
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,984
Or you really don't to leave
the house?

114
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,485
What are you really afraid of?

115
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:42,849
Nothing.

116
00:17:43,616 --> 00:17:46,752
Romano, your sister needs you.

117
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:50,719
And this is her only hope.

118
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:12,484
That's what I've been teIling you,
Víctor.

119
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:13,983
You're too generous.

120
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:16,183
Now, we're the ones ín need.

121
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:18,651
How can you get better now?

122
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:19,382
Let's not worry about ít.

123
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:21,850
Not worry about it?

124
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:24,718
Victor, you're very síck.

125
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,517
You have cancer...

126
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:29,085
and the medícatíons are expensíve.

127
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,952
lf you didn't allow yourself
be swindIe by ffomano's father...

128
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:35,584
then we might have more money now
to buy your medícíne.

129
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:52,249
Baste.

130
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,082
Yes?

131
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:54,315
Can l hitch a ride with Aunt Lumen
to Manila later?

132
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:58,752
Can l hitch a ride with Aunt Lumen
to Manila later?

133
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:00,216
Yes, of course.

134
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:01,549
Will Doc Louella mind?

135
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:06,450
She might not like the idea.

136
00:19:07,482 --> 00:19:11,853
lt's okay. What are neighbors for?

137
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:14,651
l'm just thinking of our bus fare.

138
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:17,951
l can save it and add
to our funeral expenses.

139
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:18,782
Baste.

140
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:19,683
Sister Louella.

141
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:20,782
Please put this there.

142
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,617
Sister Louella. This is Mrs. Lumen.

143
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:28,585
They're asking
if they can hitch a ride with us.

144
00:19:36,949 --> 00:19:37,883
Brother.

145
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:40,851
Sister Menggay
wants me to give you this.

146
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:43,349
Thanks.

147
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:47,951
l'm the one
who should be thanking you.

148
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:49,650
You're really going with me to Manila.

149
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:55,985
But can you please take a bath first?

150
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:56,282
You smell a little.

151
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:01,218
lt might be embarrassing
especially to Sister Louella.

152
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:53,984
- Always take care of yourself.
- Okay.

153
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:54,282
- And remember to pray always.
- l will.

154

l will.

155
00:20:58,616 --> 00:20:59,850
Good evening, Mrs. Menggay.

156
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,517
- Good evening to you, too.
- Hi Isabel.

157
00:21:01,616 --> 00:21:02,917

158

Okay.

- Thanks Louella.
- Thank you.

163
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:15,416
Where's your brother Romano?

He'll be here in a minute.

165
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:21,782
Here he is.

166
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,483
lt's a good thing
we were able to persuade him to go.

167
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,850
Wait, why are we stopping?

168
00:21:59,282 --> 00:21:59,949
What are you doing?

169
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:00,249
l said l just wanted
to hitch a ride with you.

170
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:01,983
Don't be such a prude.

171
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:02,916
l'll introduce you to some people
who can build up your career.

Hey, gíve me my things!

181
00:22:19,482 --> 00:22:20,282
You're so ugly.

182
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,683
- You creep!
- You wíll regret íf you overact.

183
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:22,583

184
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:22,916
- l won't settIe for someone like you.
- You boasyuJ!

185
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:23,983
Go away!

186
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:26,417
You think you're handsome?

187
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:26,582
You're so disgusting! Shit!

188
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:29,516
And your breath stinks!

189
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,483
Stupid.

190
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,384
Oh, well!

191
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:37,550
Now, where am l?

192
00:22:41,883 --> 00:22:43,851
Oh my God.

193
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:48,950
Shit.

194
00:22:53,516 --> 00:22:55,484
lt's so cold...

195
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:01,316
Who's there?

196
00:23:01,883 --> 00:23:03,317
Let's ask her to ride wíth us.

197
00:23:05,582 --> 00:23:09,886
Shit, just when l've managed
to get a ride,the rain stops.

198
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:13,718
ln fairness ha.
Thank you. You're all kind.

199
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:16,083
Did you know that l'm an actress?

200
00:23:16,816 --> 00:23:17,950
You really are?

201
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:19,216
Of course!

202
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:22,485
l have a primetime show
with Dennis Trillo.

203
00:23:22,683 --> 00:23:22,683
l was with him ín...
in a scene in a restaurant.

204
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:27,851
My legs looked so good there.

205
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,852
And my line was,
''may l take your order, sir?''

206
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:32,015
That's it!

207
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:33,583
Cute, right?

208
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,083
Baste.

209
00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:05,650
Uh-oh.

210
00:24:15,482 --> 00:24:16,182
Baste!

211
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:34,516
Baste.

212
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,316
Mom.

213
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:52,050
Baste, stop the van!

214
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:56,616
What happened?

215
00:25:56,449 --> 00:25:57,983
Where is he going?

216
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:29,583
Romano?

217
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:42,618
What's happening to you?

218
00:27:55,082 --> 00:27:55,916
Let's go!

219
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:09,052
Brother,
what really happened a while ago?

220
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:14,950
Nothing.

221
00:28:16,816 --> 00:28:18,551
l just had a bad dream.

222
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:19,215
lt's a good thing you woke up.

223
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:23,050
lf not, we might be all dead by now.

224
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:24,583
l don't want to die that way.

225
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,884
l might look disfigured,
especially my skin.

226
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,184
l paid a lot for my face.

227
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,850
lt really looks like it.

228
00:28:32,182 --> 00:28:34,317
What were you dreaming of, Romano?

229
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,616
What?

230
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:41,685
Didn't you just say
you had a bad dream?

231
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:44,183
Thanks.

232
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:47,049
l can't remember it.

233
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:49,984
l'll just go to the ladies' room.

234
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:51,082
Wow, that looks delicíous.

235
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:53,784
Oh, sory.

236
00:29:03,716 --> 00:29:05,050
- Romano?
- What was that?

237
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,017
Hi. Looking for something?

238
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:48,083
Romano.. .

239
00:30:53,983 --> 00:30:55,951
l'm sorry for the intrusion, Romano.

240
00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:58,684
l just want to help you.

241
00:31:00,282 --> 00:31:01,650
Don't you believe me?

242
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:05,250
No, Louella.

243
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:08,250
That's not what l meant.

244
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:18,917
ls someone there?

245
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:36,416
Oh...

246
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:46,083
this is a gift from Carlos.

247
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:57,017
Aaayyyy...

248
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:02,586
Mother asked me to go
with Aunt Lumen to Manila.

249
00:32:03,315 --> 00:32:05,150
Her husband died.

250
00:32:06,482 --> 00:32:08,317
lt's really hard to accept a death...

251
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:12,351
especially if it's by accident.

252
00:32:13,983 --> 00:32:19,254
My best friend died.
He killed himself last year.

253
00:32:23,315 --> 00:32:24,916
That's so sad.

254
00:32:26,983 --> 00:32:29,785
Okay, l paid for it already. Let's go.

255
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:30,883
Let's go.

256
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:36,753
Wait, Aunt Lumen isn't back yet.

257
00:32:39,516 --> 00:32:40,783
Aunt Lumen?

258
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:45,150
Aunt Lumen!

259
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:51,385
We won't disregard
the angle of foul play here.

260
00:32:52,282 --> 00:32:54,751
We'll investigate this further.

261
00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:58,017
But you can't bring the body with you...

262
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:59,617
still under investigation.

263
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:14,084
Eric, wíll you be staying here?

264
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:17,151
No. I'm coming wíth you to ManíIa.

265
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:20,552
l need to inform my reIatíves there.

266
00:33:26,683 --> 00:33:26,683
Eric, my condolence.

267
00:33:28,015 --> 00:33:29,082
Thanks, Kristina.

268
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,484
C'mon, smile for me.

269
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:35,051
There's my house.

270
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:58,517
Thanks, guys.

271
00:33:58,949 --> 00:33:59,949
Thank you.

272
00:34:00,315 --> 00:34:01,182
Bye-bye.

273
00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:05,217
Hey handsome, thanks a lot.
l hope we meet again.

274
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:08,482
Bye!

275
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:09,483
- Bye!
- Take care.

276
00:34:23,115 --> 00:34:24,015
Bye!

277
00:34:28,015 --> 00:34:29,216
My daugher.

278
00:35:05,883 --> 00:35:07,851
What were you dreaming of, ffomano?

279
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:09,716
Nothíng.

280
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:11,049
Baste!

281
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,849
lt's a good thíng you woke up.

282
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:20,950
lf not, we míght be aIl dead by now.

283
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,617
l don't want to die that way.

284
00:35:29,783 --> 00:35:31,718
After what happened to my brother...

285
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:35,851
he didn't leave the house anymore.

286
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:41,253
Every week, his senior officer
from the military came to our house...

287
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:43,584
to convince him to go back to service.

288
00:35:44,149 --> 00:35:46,851
But he didn't talk to him.

289
00:35:47,516 --> 00:35:50,385
Do you think he was traumatized
by what happened to him?

290
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,616
Maybe.

291
00:35:54,149 --> 00:35:56,117
Please take a seat.

292
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:02,517
When we were at the highway...

293
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:05,617
l felt that he saw something.

294
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,584
Whatever it was, l really don't know.

295
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:11,317
Aunt Menggay told me that...

296
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:15,186
my brother went with her
one time to buy groceries.

297
00:36:16,482 --> 00:36:18,250
His face suddenly went blank.

298
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:21,885
Then he asked her
if they could go home already.

299
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,183
l had an accident when l was little.

300
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:35,750
l was playing with my brother.

301
00:37:37,616 --> 00:37:41,920
l fell from a tree and hit my head hard.

302
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:47,120
My eyesight went bad ever since.

303
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:51,917
We'll do a series of tests again...

304
00:37:52,015 --> 00:37:54,884
to evaluate the condition
of the cranial and optic nerves...

305
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:58,851
which were probably damaged
as a result of her head injury.

306
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:01,749
We can aIso perform laser surgery.

307
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:05,719
But that's not a guarantee
that we can restore her vísion...

308
00:38:06,015 --> 00:38:07,449
lt's a fífty-fífty chance.

309
00:38:08,516 --> 00:38:13,354
l hope that after this,
l can finally be able to see.

310
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:18,484
l really want to see you
and my brother.

311
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:22,350
Maybe he's very handsome.

312
00:38:23,983 --> 00:38:27,086
And maybe you're very pretty, too.

313
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,850
And l won't argue with that.

314
00:39:32,249 --> 00:39:32,249
Thank you.

315
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:33,516
Thank you.

316
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:46,382
DoubIe seven.

317
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:48,885
l got flowers.

318
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:49,549
Are you sure?

319
00:39:49,616 --> 00:39:50,183
Yes.

320
00:39:51,215 --> 00:39:51,949
Still plenty.

321
00:39:52,282 --> 00:39:52,282
You are cheeters.

322
00:39:53,149 --> 00:39:53,849
l lost.

323
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:54,983
They wilI look again, eh.

324
00:39:57,749 --> 00:39:57,749
Open.

325
00:39:58,449 --> 00:39:58,949
Oh gosh.

326
00:39:59,149 --> 00:39:59,149
Sister Louella...

327
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:02,484
Hold on to the rails.

328
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:08,083
Here, have some juice.

329
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:08,849
Thanks.

330
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:31,049
Eric.

331
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:34,049
lsabel.

332
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,419
Thank you for coming
to my uncle's wake.

333
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:40,917
lsabel, sit down here.

334
00:40:43,249 --> 00:40:44,883
Sister, brother, please take a seat.

335
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:47,382
Thanks.

336
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:53,952
Any news about your
Aunt Lumen's death?

337
00:40:54,382 --> 00:40:57,118
They say we can get her remains now.

338
00:40:57,315 --> 00:41:00,351
But we're still waiting
for the release papers in La Union.

339
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:07,719
By the way, we're going back
to Baguio in two days.

340
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:14,021
Sister Louella is thinking
you might want to ride with us.

341
00:41:17,582 --> 00:41:19,317
That's okay. Thanks.

342
00:41:20,382 --> 00:41:22,217
l already talked to my mother.

343
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:26,119
She said she's going here
to attend her sister's wake.

344
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:11,817
All of us have someone to fetch us.

345
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:16,585
When death is near,
they will come to pick us up.

346
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:20,684
They are the harbingers of Death.

347
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:26,086
They will come for us
and bring us to the other life.

348
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:29,151
All of us have someone to fetch us.

349
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,384
When death is near,
they will come to pick us up.

350
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:36,552
They are the harbingers of Death.

351
00:42:37,315 --> 00:42:42,453
They will come for us
and bring us to the other life.

352
00:42:43,949 --> 00:42:47,452
You...who will come to fetch you?

353
00:42:48,716 --> 00:42:49,316
Damn!

354
00:42:49,616 --> 00:42:50,216
you double-crossed me!

355
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:51,983
You're stupid!

356
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:53,283
There's a fíght goíng on.

357
00:42:53,382 --> 00:42:53,815
Why?

358
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:01,583
Wht's that, what?

359
00:43:01,983 --> 00:43:03,150
What's happening outside?

360
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:04,516
l don't know.

361
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:29,117
lsabel?

362
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:30,683
Isabel!

363
00:43:35,516 --> 00:43:36,416
Sister Louella!

364
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:38,683
Sister Louella!

365
00:43:39,716 --> 00:43:41,250
lsabel, open the door!

366
00:43:42,382 --> 00:43:44,851
Eric, what's happening?

367
00:43:46,649 --> 00:43:48,617
lsabel, open the door!

368
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:53,384
When death is near,
they will come to pick us up.

369
00:43:54,115 --> 00:43:56,517
They are the harbingers of Death.

370
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:00,585
They will come for us
and bring us to the other life.

371
00:44:02,249 --> 00:44:03,683
Death is here now.

372
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:31,816
Eric?

373
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:38,449
Why is it wet here?

374
00:44:55,716 --> 00:44:57,784
- Isabel, open it now!
- Isabel!

375
00:45:06,783 --> 00:45:07,283
frjc!

376
00:45:08,649 --> 00:45:10,417
Eric, what's happening?

377
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:14,016
Eric!

378
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:19,582
Isabel !

379
00:45:29,382 --> 00:45:30,816
Brother, what's going on?

380
00:45:31,716 --> 00:45:33,017
Why has this happened to Eric, too?

381
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:36,650
This is bad luck.

382
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:39,817
Why are we experiencing
bad things one after the other?

383
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:43,184
Romano, l know
you're hídíng something to us.

384
00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:46,784
You know something about this.

385
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:50,550
The incident that happened
in the highway.. .

386
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,183
to Lumen...to Eric.

387
00:45:55,716 --> 00:45:57,284
What really was that?

388
00:45:57,849 --> 00:45:59,817
Why don't you just tell us?

389
00:46:03,249 --> 00:46:04,817
l myself can't understand it.

390
00:46:07,716 --> 00:46:09,184
After my accident...

391
00:46:12,382 --> 00:46:13,416
l went on comatose.

392
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:18,586
When l woke,
strange things started happening.

393
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:22,283
When l dreamt
that we were in an accident...

394
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:25,483
l asked Baste to stop the van.

395
00:46:30,949 --> 00:46:32,150
l saw something.

396
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:33,082
What did you see?

397
00:46:37,516 --> 00:46:39,184
Spirits.

398
00:46:43,616 --> 00:46:44,616
Five souls.

399
00:46:48,382 --> 00:46:50,350
They were surrounding the van.

400
00:46:51,716 --> 00:46:53,684
What do you mean by ~spírits''?

401
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:56,484
Before Lumen's death.

402
00:46:57,783 --> 00:46:59,618
When we were eatíng at the canteen...

403
00:47:01,315 --> 00:47:03,283
l saw thís spirit again.

404
00:47:04,382 --> 00:47:06,350
Outside the doctor's office.

405
00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:09,017
When IsabeI had her eyes checked...

406
00:47:10,115 --> 00:47:11,549
l saw another one agaín.

407
00:47:12,516 --> 00:47:15,919
That was the soul
l've seen during the wake.

408
00:47:17,582 --> 00:47:18,683
Before Eríc's death.

409
00:47:21,182 --> 00:47:24,118
Brother Romano, l know a spiritist.

410
00:47:25,315 --> 00:47:26,516
She may be able to help.

411
00:47:27,716 --> 00:47:29,117
Let's see her tomorrow.

412
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:41,417
l saw it upstairs, near the table.

413
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:50,586
Romano, how does it feel
like whenever you see a ghost?

414
00:48:01,182 --> 00:48:02,583
lt doesn't seem real.

415
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:11,954
You think you're just seeing things.

416
00:48:16,249 --> 00:48:21,954
Then your hair starts to rise.

417
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:34,188
And you suddenly feel light-headed.

418
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:47,417
You know what, when Papa died...

419
00:48:49,049 --> 00:48:53,219
l always wondered what l would feel
when he shows himself to me.

420
00:48:57,315 --> 00:48:59,216
Will l get scared
or be happy to see him?

421
00:49:01,582 --> 00:49:04,785
l waited and waited
for him but he never came.

422
00:49:07,716 --> 00:49:11,653
l guess l really don't have
the eye to see those things.

423
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:19,789
The books says that anyone
can see a spirit if he wants to.

424
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:32,093
You just need to focus.
Concentrate on the room...

425
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,983
in every corner.

426
00:49:40,249 --> 00:49:45,621
Then try to open your eyes
in different ways.

427
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,217
Try to feel everything around you.

428
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:54,619
Whisper whatever you want
to the wind.

429
00:50:01,049 --> 00:50:02,383
Okay, l'll read it.

430
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:05,383
l'll go inside now.

431
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,350
Give me one kilo of pork.

432
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:22,884
One kiIo of porkchop.

433
00:50:23,049 --> 00:50:25,017
HoId on, please.

434
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:27,549
Here.

435
00:50:28,249 --> 00:50:29,683
One hundred forty.

436
00:50:32,716 --> 00:50:32,716
How much is this?

437
00:50:33,315 --> 00:50:34,482
Excuse me, boss.

438
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:36,717
Do you know where l can find
Mrs. Elma?

439
00:50:37,215 --> 00:50:38,082
Mrs. Elma?

440
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:39,583
Oh, Mrs. Elma.

441
00:50:39,683 --> 00:50:41,684
She's over there.

442
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:42,716
Let's go.

443
00:50:43,215 --> 00:50:43,215
Thank you.

444
00:50:43,983 --> 00:50:44,483
Okay.

445
00:50:48,983 --> 00:50:50,084
Excuse me...

446
00:50:50,449 --> 00:50:51,616
are you Mrs. Elma?

447
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:52,849
Why? What do you want?

448
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:54,282
Your Mrs. Elma.

449
00:50:54,683 --> 00:50:56,251
Brother Romano, she's Mrs. Elma.

450
00:50:59,315 --> 00:51:00,983
l want to ask you something.

451
00:51:01,215 --> 00:51:03,951
Hurry up. l don't have all day.

452
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:09,017
Maam Elma...

453
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:12,785
l can see things that l don't
understand.

454
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:21,516
Do you have money?

455
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:26,350
Let's go to a place that's more quiet.

456
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:27,450
follow me!

457
00:51:30,683 --> 00:51:31,583
Hey, faster!

458
00:51:31,949 --> 00:51:33,417
Careful now.

459
00:51:53,149 --> 00:51:54,350
What do you see?

460
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:56,617
Ever since l woke up...

461
00:52:00,082 --> 00:52:01,750
from being comatose...

462
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:06,984
l've been seeing spirits.

463
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:08,783
But now...

464
00:52:11,082 --> 00:52:12,983
they're bothering me.

465
00:52:15,683 --> 00:52:17,217
And everytime l see a ghost...

466
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:22,217
someone dies.

467
00:52:24,149 --> 00:52:25,583
Like one of our friends...

468
00:52:26,749 --> 00:52:28,150
before she died in the accident.

469
00:52:28,582 --> 00:52:30,650
l'm just thínking of our bus fare.

470
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:33,817
l can save it and add to our
funeral expenses.

471
00:52:36,749 --> 00:52:38,917
l saw the spirit of her husband.

472
00:52:41,649 --> 00:52:42,883
The other one...

473
00:52:45,482 --> 00:52:46,749
l saw his friend.

474
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:49,017
My best friend died.

475
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:52,451
He kíIled hímself Iast year.

476
00:53:02,716 --> 00:53:04,150
Your third eye is open.

477
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,585
lt may have opened during the
accident you encountered.

478
00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:10,217
The spirits you see...

479
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:13,518
are no doubt the harbingers of Death.

480
00:53:14,215 --> 00:53:17,551
We all have someone to fetch us
when our time comes.

481
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:18,983
Your brother, sister...

482
00:53:19,582 --> 00:53:20,249
wife...

483
00:53:20,616 --> 00:53:21,917
best friend...

484
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,282
relative.

485
00:53:24,315 --> 00:53:26,850
But why are they after Romano?

486
00:53:27,516 --> 00:53:28,283
Maybe...

487
00:53:28,883 --> 00:53:31,318
they know that Romano sees them.

488
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:34,351
And they want to tell him something.

489
00:53:35,482 --> 00:53:37,917
That's why l saw them in the tunnel.

490
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:39,815
The tunnel?

491
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:42,316
Yes.

492
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:44,816
We almost met an accident.

493
00:53:45,416 --> 00:53:46,817
But Romano saved us.

494
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:50,484
l see other spirits, too.

495
00:53:52,182 --> 00:53:53,516
There are more?

496
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:55,783
lf that's the case...

497
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:58,885
you have cheated death.

498
00:54:00,516 --> 00:54:02,684
Now, Death wants you to pay.

499
00:54:03,249 --> 00:54:04,917
What should we do?

500
00:54:05,382 --> 00:54:09,285
You were given that power to
see those spirits.

501
00:54:10,382 --> 00:54:12,350
And they are here to warn you.

502
00:54:13,182 --> 00:54:15,784
But how can we escape from Death?

503
00:54:16,582 --> 00:54:17,349
What l know...

504
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:20,151
is that when you cheat death...

505
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:22,250
you have to pay with death, too.

506
00:54:28,749 --> 00:54:30,884
What are you gettíng?

507
00:54:52,115 --> 00:54:53,816
What's wrong, Brother Romano?

508
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:00,816
Romano...

509
00:55:01,683 --> 00:55:03,351
have you seen another one again?

510
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:04,817
Yes.

511
00:55:05,482 --> 00:55:06,983
He's the old man...

512
00:55:07,716 --> 00:55:10,785
l saw at the highway,
while we're walking.

513
00:55:13,749 --> 00:55:14,950
He's wearing a necklace.

514
00:55:15,883 --> 00:55:16,750
A necklace?

515
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,749
With an animal tooth pendant?

516
00:55:22,015 --> 00:55:23,716
Brother Romano, he's my grandfather.

517
00:55:24,683 --> 00:55:26,051
He was the one who raised me.

518
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:29,983
Am l next?

519
00:55:31,649 --> 00:55:33,250
Am l going to die?

520
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:54,751
Romano.

521
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:10,115
Louella...

522
00:56:11,249 --> 00:56:12,583
go to the van.

523
00:56:39,582 --> 00:56:42,084
Run!

524
00:57:18,883 --> 00:57:20,084
Baste got away.

525
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:21,950
But is he really safe?

526
00:57:22,516 --> 00:57:23,116
How about us?

527
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:24,884
Who's next in line?

528
00:57:25,749 --> 00:57:27,617
We need to calm down.

529
00:57:28,115 --> 00:57:30,784
Brother, who else did you see at
the highway.

530
00:57:33,282 --> 00:57:34,750
l saw five souls.

531
00:57:37,282 --> 00:57:40,451
The three have already reappeared.

532
00:57:41,816 --> 00:57:43,117
There are seven of us.

533
00:57:44,783 --> 00:57:47,719
This means two will be saved?

534
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:50,517
l saw my mother.

535
00:57:51,115 --> 00:57:51,915
What?

536
00:57:55,282 --> 00:57:57,150
lt's either Isabel or l...

537
00:57:58,182 --> 00:57:58,949
who's next.

538
00:57:59,616 --> 00:58:01,017
But who's the fifth one?

539
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:03,683
A woman.

540
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:08,783
l don't know who she is.

541
00:58:09,716 --> 00:58:11,317
Her hair covered her face.

542
00:58:12,816 --> 00:58:14,417
And there's another one.

543
00:58:15,849 --> 00:58:16,816
You saw another one?

544
00:58:17,716 --> 00:58:19,217
l didn't see it.

545
00:58:20,749 --> 00:58:21,950
l just heard it?

546
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,483
What did you hear?

547
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:27,116
l heard a baby crying.

548
00:58:29,182 --> 00:58:31,117
Let's go. We need to see Kristina.

549
00:58:34,749 --> 00:58:37,218
She left her cellphone while in a hurry.

550
00:58:37,582 --> 00:58:41,352
But she'll be here soon.
She's coming from a shooting.

551
00:58:42,049 --> 00:58:43,884
Oh, here she is.

552
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:45,116
Kristína.

553
00:58:45,182 --> 00:58:45,715
Hey, Baste.

554
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:46,349
My fare.

555
00:58:48,649 --> 00:58:48,649
Romano!

556
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:49,816
Romano!

557
00:58:50,582 --> 00:58:51,749
l missed you.

558
00:58:52,049 --> 00:58:53,350
Did you miss me, too?

559
00:58:53,616 --> 00:58:55,584
We need to talk.

560
00:58:59,149 --> 00:59:01,017
l don't remember anythíng.

561
00:59:01,282 --> 00:59:03,283
Besides, l really don't have a child.

562
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:03,416
And l don't even have a niece or
nephew who died.

563
00:59:04,315 --> 00:59:05,883
And l don't even have a niece or
nephew who died.

564
00:59:06,449 --> 00:59:08,050
Aren't you forgetting someone?

565
00:59:08,382 --> 00:59:10,717
We haven't had any child deaths in
our family.

566
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,584
l think we're a family with long lives.

567
00:59:14,282 --> 00:59:16,517
Wait, are you really telling the truth?

568
00:59:17,482 --> 00:59:17,482
Kristina, serve them some coffee first.

569
00:59:19,315 --> 00:59:20,783
Kristina, serve them some coffee first.

570
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:30,017
Ma'am...

571
00:59:31,282 --> 00:59:31,282
please don't take this personally but...

572
00:59:34,315 --> 00:59:34,615
please don't take this personally but...

573
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:38,517
has she never given birth?

574
00:59:39,315 --> 00:59:41,283
l am sure of it.

575
00:59:41,983 --> 00:59:43,584
She doesn't even have a boyfriend.

576
00:59:44,482 --> 00:59:46,483
She's very choosy.

577
00:59:57,783 --> 00:59:59,384
Hey handsome, here's your coffee.

578
01:00:01,115 --> 01:00:02,449
l made this for you.

579
01:00:14,582 --> 01:00:17,551
Kristina, why won't you believe in us?

580
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:24,551
We'll just go out for some fresh air.

581
01:00:25,049 --> 01:00:26,183
Come, Isabel.

582
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:33,851
Sister Kristina, please be careful.

583
01:00:34,516 --> 01:00:35,750
How sweet.

584
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:42,851
Your sister's so nice.

585
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:47,286
But l don't like the other girl.
She's always frowning at me?

586
01:00:47,883 --> 01:00:47,883
l think she likes you.

587
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:52,118
l think she likes you.

588
01:00:54,015 --> 01:00:56,217
What we're saying is true.

589
01:00:58,015 --> 01:00:59,983
We came here...

590
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:02,250
to warn you.

591
01:01:03,716 --> 01:01:03,716
Know what?

592
01:01:03,949 --> 01:01:03,949
Know what?

593
01:01:04,783 --> 01:01:06,351
l'm not afraid of dying.

594
01:01:07,249 --> 01:01:08,883
What can l do if my time is up?

595
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,083
Will l fight against Death?

596
01:01:11,182 --> 01:01:12,750
l'll just tire myself out.

597
01:01:13,249 --> 01:01:15,551
l just don't want to die looking ugly.

598
01:01:16,849 --> 01:01:16,849
But if you want to...

599
01:01:18,949 --> 01:01:18,949
But if you want to...

600
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:20,783
look after me...

601
01:01:21,149 --> 01:01:23,784
protect or guard me...

602
01:01:24,282 --> 01:01:27,985
twenty four hours a day,
l won't stop you.

603
01:01:36,649 --> 01:01:37,983
What did she say?

604
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:40,350
She still doesn't believe me.

605
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,183
Be careful.

606
01:02:05,716 --> 01:02:06,450
Baste...

607
01:02:08,115 --> 01:02:09,382
let's go back to Kristina's place.

608
01:02:10,015 --> 01:02:11,383
Why? Did you forget something?

609
01:02:11,816 --> 01:02:13,217
Just do what l tell you.

610
01:02:13,649 --> 01:02:14,983
Romano, what's wrong?

611
01:02:18,382 --> 01:02:18,382
l know who has come to get her.

612
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:20,083
l know who has come to get her.

613
01:02:27,315 --> 01:02:28,849
Your daughter had a twin.

614
01:02:31,382 --> 01:02:32,716
Tell me the truth.

615
01:02:36,816 --> 01:02:37,850
How did you know about it?

616
01:02:40,082 --> 01:02:41,716
That's no longer important.

617
01:02:48,382 --> 01:02:48,382
l had to give up the other
because we were very poor.

618
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:52,219
l had to give up the other
because we were very poor.

619
01:02:53,616 --> 01:02:57,553
l chose Kristina because she's
sweeter and more quiet.

620
01:03:01,816 --> 01:03:03,284
What l know is that...

621
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:06,984
that the people who adopted her
treated her badly.

622
01:03:08,282 --> 01:03:11,284
She got very sick and died
because of this.

623
01:03:20,349 --> 01:03:22,017
Where is Kristina now?

624
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,184
She's in her manager's spa.

625
01:04:39,382 --> 01:04:39,915
Yes, ma'am.

626
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:41,183
Miss...

627
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:41,349
Yes?

628
01:04:41,749 --> 01:04:41,749
is Kristina here?

629
01:04:42,816 --> 01:04:42,816
Oh, the one having a spa?
Yes, she is.

630
01:04:44,816 --> 01:04:44,816
Where is she?

631
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:46,716
She's inside.

632
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:46,849
Sir, you're not allowed to enter here.

633
01:04:48,482 --> 01:04:48,482
Sir, you're not allowed to enter here.

634
01:04:48,949 --> 01:04:49,716
- Sjr!
- Kristina!

635
01:04:49,849 --> 01:04:49,849
Sír!

636
01:04:50,249 --> 01:04:50,716
Kristina!

637
01:04:52,849 --> 01:04:54,083
l'll follow Romano.

638
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:56,017
Please take care of Isabel.

639
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:57,717
Don't leave her alone.

640
01:05:16,649 --> 01:05:18,183
How much for everthing?

641
01:05:18,983 --> 01:05:19,717
Twenty-three.

642
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:20,949
Here.

643
01:05:21,049 --> 01:05:21,916
Oh, it's a big money.

644
01:05:22,115 --> 01:05:23,082
Don't you have a smaller amount?

645
01:05:23,449 --> 01:05:24,483
Sorry, l don't have loose change.

646
01:05:25,015 --> 01:05:26,416
Okay, wait for me.

647
01:05:37,482 --> 01:05:38,015
What's wrong?

648
01:05:38,315 --> 01:05:39,049
Hey!

649
01:05:40,349 --> 01:05:42,451
lf l see a scratch there,
you'll be paying for it!

650
01:05:43,015 --> 01:05:44,916
Let's go! Hurry up!

651
01:05:48,115 --> 01:05:48,115
Kristina!

652
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:49,016
Kristina!

653
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,249
Help me.

654
01:06:19,282 --> 01:06:19,715
Baste.

655
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:20,482
Help me.

656
01:06:21,549 --> 01:06:22,449
Romano!

657
01:06:22,616 --> 01:06:23,984
Romano, please help me.

658
01:06:24,149 --> 01:06:24,883
Kristina?

659
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:26,883
Krjstjna!

660
01:06:33,382 --> 01:06:33,382
Kristina!

661
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:34,049
Kristina!

662
01:06:34,382 --> 01:06:34,749
Kristina!

663
01:06:37,616 --> 01:06:38,049
Baste!

664
01:06:38,816 --> 01:06:38,816
Isabel !

665
01:06:39,449 --> 01:06:41,117
- Baste!
- Isabel, please help me!

666
01:06:41,416 --> 01:06:42,817
What's happening to you?

667
01:06:48,616 --> 01:06:49,383
Kristina?

668
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:50,650
Kristina?

669
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:01,449
Kristina?

670
01:07:32,149 --> 01:07:32,149
Do you think we will avoid any
accidents now?

671
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:35,016
Do you think we will avoid any
accidents now?

672
01:07:43,215 --> 01:07:45,817
We're fighting against spirits
Romano, not humans.

673
01:07:46,349 --> 01:07:48,117
He can do anything he wants.

674
01:07:48,683 --> 01:07:50,551
We can't hide from him.

675
01:07:50,749 --> 01:07:52,417
We are all going to die.

676
01:07:55,182 --> 01:07:56,316
l'm a doctor.

677
01:07:56,983 --> 01:08:00,686
l've seen death.
But not this way, not like this.

678
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:01,416
l don't want to believe,
but how couldn't l?

679
01:08:03,315 --> 01:08:03,682
l don't want to believe,
but how couldn't l?

680
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:08,785
We need to do everything to
keep us safe.

681
01:08:09,382 --> 01:08:11,717
You don't understand what Mrs.
Elma told us.

682
01:08:14,182 --> 01:08:16,083
Death is chasing us.

683
01:08:17,282 --> 01:08:17,282
We need to sacrifice a life.

684
01:08:18,315 --> 01:08:18,748
We need to sacrifice a life.

685
01:08:18,883 --> 01:08:21,919
He is after someone alive,
now we need someone in exchange.

686
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:28,850
What do you want to do?

687
01:08:31,716 --> 01:08:32,917
Kill someone?

688
01:08:48,449 --> 01:08:49,383
Brother...

689
01:08:51,182 --> 01:08:52,082
isn't that...

690
01:08:54,115 --> 01:08:56,016
l'm to blame for all of this.

691
01:08:58,182 --> 01:08:59,683
lf not for me...

692
01:09:00,582 --> 01:09:00,582
we wouldn't be here in Manila.

693
01:09:03,015 --> 01:09:03,782
we wouldn't be here in Manila.

694
01:09:05,749 --> 01:09:07,016
Don't think about those things.

695
01:09:10,749 --> 01:09:11,916
lt's not your fault.

696
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:14,884
Go get some rest.

697
01:09:18,215 --> 01:09:22,385
Brother, is mom fetching me or you?

698
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:40,951
Do you remember that picture?

699
01:09:43,616 --> 01:09:45,551
The drawing in Isabel's hand?

700
01:09:48,082 --> 01:09:49,349
l did that.

701
01:09:50,816 --> 01:09:53,084
Those are stick figures of a family.

702
01:09:54,049 --> 01:09:56,317
A dad and a mom...

703
01:09:57,149 --> 01:09:58,583
and a baby.

704
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:00,717
Louella...

705
01:10:03,149 --> 01:10:05,417
you don't have to worry about
anything.

706
01:10:07,616 --> 01:10:09,918
l can't see any spirits right now.

707
01:10:15,149 --> 01:10:17,150
That could fetch you.

708
01:10:21,382 --> 01:10:22,883
l told myself before...

709
01:10:25,082 --> 01:10:29,085
that when l have a child...

710
01:10:30,983 --> 01:10:32,351
a boy.

711
01:10:33,916 --> 01:10:35,150
Romano...

712
01:10:35,749 --> 01:10:38,017
that crying baby you heard.

713
01:10:40,516 --> 01:10:42,317
l am being fetched.

714
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:46,250
What do you mean?

715
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:46,916
l got pregnant...

716
01:10:47,983 --> 01:10:48,883
l got pregnant...

717
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,883
lt was a bad time for me.

718
01:10:54,215 --> 01:10:56,050
when l was in med school.

719
01:10:58,282 --> 01:11:00,951
l had the baby, my child...aborted.

720
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:02,416
l aborted the child.

721
01:11:02,816 --> 01:11:04,651
l aborted the child.

722
01:11:05,582 --> 01:11:09,285
That's why l know that l'm
the next one.

723
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,552
My baby is coming to get me.

724
01:11:15,949 --> 01:11:15,949
He's coming to get me.

725
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:18,282
He's coming to get me.

726
01:11:41,683 --> 01:11:43,584
Romano, we need to be careful.

727
01:13:31,983 --> 01:13:33,184
Where are you?

728
01:13:33,516 --> 01:13:34,817
Show yourself to me!

729
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:36,650
Show yourself!

730
01:15:36,549 --> 01:15:38,384
lsabel.

731
01:15:41,849 --> 01:15:43,817
Mom.

732
01:16:19,115 --> 01:16:20,649
lsabel.

733
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:23,717
lsabel.

734
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,316
Isabel !

735
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:55,017
That's enough.

736
01:17:56,449 --> 01:17:57,917
That's enough! l can't take it
anymore!

737
