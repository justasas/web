3
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,531
I'm so tired.
I could sleep a thousand years.

4
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,440
Don't worry.
You'll pick up again tonight.

5
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,216
It hasn't changed much here.

6
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,023
It has changed.

7
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,031
It changes slowly.

8
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,999
How?.

9
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:17,025
It changes slowly.
That's all.

10
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,879
Wait.

11
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,790
I'd like to talk to you.

12
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,987
I'm listening.

13
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,489
Is this a proposal?.

14
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,531
The jewel, is it a proposal?.

15
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,246
You stare at me...

16
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,450
And seem to want to hurt me.

17
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,252
Then your face
turns normal again.

18
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,928
It's the old you.

19
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,796
You continue to stare at me.

20
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,232
And then...

21
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,031
I feel you're coming.

22
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,705
As you come between my thighs,

23
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,233
I feel your sperm rise up
within me

24
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:43,375
and fill me
and flow out through my eyes.

25
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:48,183
There are white tears,
thick ones, coating my cheeks.

26
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,848
My mouth is red,

27
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,154
and the white tears
trickle over it.

28
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,023
I don't want to wipe them away.

29
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,291
I cry so much.

30
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,992
I can't stop crying.

31
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,566
You don't have an emerald?.

32
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,502
No, I don't have an emerald.

33
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,535
Maybe next time.

34
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,479
Maybe.

35
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,142
You always remember
your dreams?.

36
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,621
No.

37
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:32,394
"HOUSE OF PLEASURES"

38
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:16,625
"HOUSE OF PLEASURES"

39
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,237
"November 1 899"

40
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,300
"The twilight
of the 19th century"

41
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,170
Near the mirror.

42
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,816
Near the mirror, Clothilde.

43
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,184
I'll show you.

44
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:43,055
Pass me a hairpin?.

45
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,289
Leave me some.

46
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,491
Don't worry.

47
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,416
He's nice but heavy.

48
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,582
Physically heavy too.

49
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,616
When he's on top of me,
I'm crushed.

50
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,330
I hope he hasn't given me
the clap.

51
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,269
Claptrap.

52
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,636
I hope Victor
doesn't come tonight.

53
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,163
I'm sick of him.

54
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,405
Three times in a row.
What a drag!

55
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,608
Always asking what I think
of his crooked cock,

56
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,515
before I kiss his ass.

57
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,609
Who did you have?.

58
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,051
Michaux.

59
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,954
- He's sweet on you.
- For now he is.

60
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,389
It's only been twice.

61
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,324
He doesn't want me now.

62
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,520
Do you like him?.

63
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,756
Yes, I like him.

64
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,993
- That's all?.
- It's something.

65
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,866
You like him or you think
he could pay your debts

66
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,268
to get you out?.

67
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,862
Is that a problem?.

68
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,897
Maybe I have fewer debts
than you.

69
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,067
I doubt it.

70
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,645
Sir...

71
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,180
Good evening.

72
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,004
Mine doesn't work.

73
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,407
You lose!

74
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,117
There.

75
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,453
- Can we come closer?.
- Of course.

76
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,891
She's very meek.

77
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,326
I call her Ninon.

78
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,354
- A female?.
- Yes.

79
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,763
Show me your hands.

80
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,808
You won a point?.

81
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,837
Yes, my blow got me the...

82
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,522
Doctor, you've lost.

83
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,549
- You have to drink.
- I've lost?.

84
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,524
See you later.

85
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,869
I just finished
an amazing English novel,

86
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,205
full of aliens and Martians...

87
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,905
who invade Earth using rays
and chemical weapons.

88
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,811
They're very powerful

89
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:59,750
and easily eliminate
human beings.

90
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:03,721
They devastate the cities...

91
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,953
But not being immune
to human diseases,

92
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,654
they end up dying.

93
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,560
The story is told
by a journalist

94
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:21,835
who escapes the first attacks

95
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,843
and who seeks his wife
in a deserted land.

96
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,811
Idiotic but pure genius.

97
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,211
Have you read it?.

98
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,546
No, my only books are
Sade's diaries and the Bible.

99
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,711
And I haven't read the Bible.

100
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,483
Samira, Louis's glass is empty.

101
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,649
I had this letter today.

102
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,524
Shall I read it?.

103
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,727
"Madame,

104
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,064
"Having heard of L'Apollonide

105
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,593
"and keen to enter your house,
I hereby offer myself.

106
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,196
"I'm 1 5 and a half.

107
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,141
"I'm pretty, with nice hair
and fine teeth,

108
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:01,169
"shapely, with very white skin
and not a blemish on my body,

109
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:05,149
"and if you want to send someone
from Paris to check

110
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,642
"if the details I mention
are correct.

111
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:12,646
"l have a kind heart,
and I shall be obedient.

112
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,159
"lf I prove suitable,

113
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,027
"you may send someone
to fetch me

114
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,054
"and bring me to your house.

115
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,259
Pauline Deshaies."

116
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,269
She drew a self-portrait.
She's pretty.

117
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,295
A pretty drawing
means nothing.

118
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,333
May l?.

119
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,505
Yes.

120
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,538
Very nice, Marie.

121
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,779
I'd like to be here
to welcome her.

122
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,979
She's a baby.

123
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,317
With the countess dead,

124
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,346
who'll be
the 20th century's beauty?.

125
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,483
I say you are.

126
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,017
What was that?.

127
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,053
The Jewess is the new beauty.

128
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,496
Thank you.

129
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,101
I've missed you.

130
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,007
Caca, I was here two days ago.

131
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,012
But not yesterday.

132
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,482
Where were you?.

133
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,642
With my wife.

134
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,345
No!

135
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,820
The shame of it...

136
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,239
It's been two weeks.

137
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,968
I stayed in.

138
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,272
I wasn't in the mood for it.

139
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,904
And now?.
Are you in the mood?.

140
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,677
Very much.

141
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,277
I had an odd dream about you
last week.

142
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,288
All the girls say that.

143
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,846
I swear, it's true.

144
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,585
What was it?.

145
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,890
It's rather unusual.

146
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,489
Want to tell me upstairs?.

147
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,466
I'd like that.

148
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:39,335
Get drinks and come to the room
with black curtains.

149
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,643
What are you doing?.

150
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,168
It's a gift.

151
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,696
I'm so tired.
I could sleep a thousand years.

152
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,635
Don't worry.
You'll pick up again tonight.

153
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,542
Give me a glass?.

154
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,139
- Which one?.
- I don't mind.

155
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,615
Got any antiseptic soap?.

156
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,590
I can't afford any.

157
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,253
- And you?.
- You're a pain.

158
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:46,287
I'll lend you some,
but buy your own.

159
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,664
Thank you.

160
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,498
Clothilde?.

161
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,368
Can you help me?.

162
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,238
Hold this.

163
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,607
Thanks.

164
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,447
What are you doing?.

165
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,010
It's a gift.

166
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,416
What's wrong?.

167
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,975
Nothing's wrong.

168
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,516
No one knows
what you're thinking.

169
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,550
I don't think anything.

170
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,873
She's nearly done.

171
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,405
Send her to me after.

172
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,581
She's as pretty
as a blazing flower.

173
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:34,638
My fingers must be cursed...

174
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,842
The sound of the sirens...

175
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,996
I start to undress.

176
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,368
And you put a box down
on the bed.

177
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,203
A tiny box.

178
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,106
I open it.

179
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,670
There's an emerald inside.

180
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,479
You still say nothing,
so I'm convinced that...

181
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,042
Well, I ask if it's a proposal.

182
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,179
You don't reply.

183
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,102
That's it then.

184
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,303
Loubet has pardoned Dreyfus
at last.

185
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:49,110
If the talk turns to Dreyfus,
I'm going up.

186
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,308
Come on.

187
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,783
Let's go up.

188
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,810
With pleasure.

189
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,062
Shall we have commerce?.

190
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,723
I'd love to.

191
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,756
You always remember
your dreams?.

192
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,896
I want to tie you up.
May l?.

193
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,768
Yes, you may.

194
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,877
He's envious of everything.

195
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,179
I'm happy with you.

196
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,882
Vuitton...

197
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:09,353
Vuitton...

198
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,165
What?.

199
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,862
Vuitton?.

200
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,066
I love saying that name.

201
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,234
He's a genius.

202
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,268
Vuitton.

203
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,640
I love this song.

204
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:09,085
"March 1900"

205
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:13,888
"The dawn of the 20th century"

206
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:45,681
Spread your thighs.

207
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,887
- Go on, spread them.
- No!

208
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:55,794
I need to see inside your sex
to paint you.

209
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,132
Even to do your face.

210
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,173
It's very important.

211
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:08,043
Men never look into
the sex of women enough.

212
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,309
There...

213
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:18,345
I'm beginning to see
the picture.

214
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,062
I have the impression
I've painted your face 40 times.

215
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:40,006
This face...

216
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,037
This face...

217
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,909
You smell nice.

218
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,512
Jicky by Guerlain.

219
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,114
I know.
I loved a woman who wore it.

220
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,149
I'm not jealous.

221
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,436
How old are you?.

222
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:11,965
Why do you ask?.

223
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,341
So I'll know.

224
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:20,514
I'm 28.

225
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,715
How long have you been here?.

226
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,588
1 2 years.

227
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:33,191
I'll leave this here.

228
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,223
It's for you.

229
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:45,065
I really have to go.

230
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,497
It moved!

231
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:18,031
It moved!

232
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,839
Even with two
I lose.

233
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,972
It's pathetic!

234
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,722
How are you, children?.

235
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,891
Say hello to Pauline.

236
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,196
Okay, girls?.
Met Pauline?.

237
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,226
We saw her earlier.

238
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,674
Chinese arm lock!

239
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,182
You didn't get me.

240
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,281
Where are you off to?.

241
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:08,451
Maurice is taking me out
for the afternoon.

242
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:11,621
Lucky you.
I want to go out too.

243
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,392
Hello.

244
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,659
Caca...

245
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,098
Julie, please.

246
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,125
- My name's Julie.
- Everyone calls her Caca.

247
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,932
My name's Julie.

248
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,701
What are you doing
with my doll?.

249
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,168
Don't touch it!

250
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,878
You are pretty.

251
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,952
You went for your permit?.

252
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,014
Yes, before I came here.

253
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,992
They examined you?.

254
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:45,190
I'm perfectly healthy.

255
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,827
Any scars?.

256
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,495
No.

257
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,629
Your breasts...

258
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,004
- Are they firm?.
- Very.

259
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:00,203
- Even without a corset?.
- They're firm.

260
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,974
All right.

261
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,914
- You have your permit?.
- Yes, I told you.

262
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,417
My papers are in order.

263
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,920
Undress, please.

264
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,684
- Now?.
- Yes, get used to it.

265
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,716
You're not here to make jam.

266
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,601
- How old are you now?.
- 1 6.

267
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,635
I have a letter from my parents.

268
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:44,244
Do you speak well?.

269
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,952
- You're polite?.
- Yes, I've been taught.

270
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,386
- Can you read?.
- Yes.

271
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,420
- And write?.
- Yes.

272
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,336
Go on.

273
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,769
Turn round.

274
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,681
Nice buttocks.

275
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,151
- Nice breasts.
- I'm young.

276
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,416
You mustn't slim.

277
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,447
Can you let your hair down?.

278
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,341
- Your voice...
- What about it?.

279
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,870
It's a bit weak.

280
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,281
- I can try harder.
- Try.

281
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,251
- I'll manage it.
- Show me.

282
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,618
If I say I'll manage it,
I will.

283
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,748
This isn't a knocking shop.

284
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,190
I know.

285
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,354
That's why I wrote to you.

286
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,627
If you don't fit in,
I can't keep you.

287
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,658
You learn the job as you go.
It's not easy.

288
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,938
Can I get dressed now?.

289
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,669
You have a nickname?.

290
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,678
La Petite.
Will that do?.

291
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,077
Do you have a lover?.

292
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,013
No lover.

293
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,244
Are you a virgin?.

294
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,081
Tell me.
It's not a problem.

295
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,245
I can check.

296
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,552
- Are you a virgin?.
- No.

297
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,422
Why choose this place?.

298
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,792
To be independent.
To be free.

299
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,229
To be free?.
In a house of tolerance?.

300
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,290
Freedom's outside, not here.

301
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:12,235
To earn money of my own.

302
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,238
Do you want to marry?.

303
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:17,070
- No.
- Why are you lying?.

304
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,099
Don't fool yourself.

305
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:22,169
A man rarely marries
a prostitute.

306
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,147
We all live together.

307
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,979
We're always together.

308
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:29,817
We're nice to each other,
respect each other.

309
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,879
All right?.

310
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,058
We share beds.

311
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,028
You can sleep here.

312
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,088
There's room with Clothilde.

313
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,199
You stay until the clients go,

314
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,674
but get up when you want.

315
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:55,736
When you get up,
go down to the dining room.

316
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,543
You never go out alone.

317
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,277
Only with Madame or a man.

318
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,286
If you're alone outside,
that's soliciting.

319
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,550
At around 4:00, we wash.

320
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,784
We have to be clean.
Very clean.

321
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,655
Smell nice. Clean hair.

322
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:12,652
Soap your body and hair daily
and rub down with cologne.

323
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,528
Often we do it in pairs.

324
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,760
I wash you, you wash me...

325
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,497
I'll show you the creams.

326
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,437
A hairdresser comes at 6:00.

327
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,464
He can curl your hair,
dye it and so on.

328
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,807
You don't pay him.
Madame does.

329
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,972
If a client likes your hair
one particular way,

330
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,505
don't change it too often.

331
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,710
Come on.

332
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,982
If a client says you smell
or you're dirty,

333
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,648
Madame will fine you.

334
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,454
It'll only increase your debts.

335
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,983
So wash yourself.

336
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,796
We all buy our own perfume.

337
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:54,567
You don't use another girl's.
You buy your own.

338
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,436
After each client,

339
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,808
rinse your mouth with water
and a few drops of mouthwash.

340
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,837
It's strong, but it works.

341
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,612
- My name's Léa.
- Pauline.

342
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,713
I know.

343
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,917
Welcome.

344
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,189
When the client undresses,
discreetly check his cock.

345
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,492
Check for sores or spots.

346
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,055
Check his body for rashes too.

347
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,227
Any doubts, don't have sex.

348
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,139
After each job,
wash your lips,

349
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,607
rinse and rub them
with cologne.

350
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,700
Ever used it?.

351
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,268
No.

352
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,872
It stings,
but that's normal.

353
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,906
When you get to the room,
what do you do?.

354
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,748
- Talk?.
- Yes, you talk.

355
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,152
You chat a little.

356
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,122
They might talk
about themselves.

357
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,784
You have another drink.

358
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,816
It helps.

359
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,728
Find out what he's like
and adapt.

360
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,756
After a while,
you get the same ones.

361
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,665
Just arouse them
and make them come.

362
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,534
But fake it during sex.

363
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,540
- Why?.
- Because.

364
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,566
That's how we do it.

365
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,685
Hello.

366
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,846
Pauline.

367
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,721
Madeleine.

368
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,590
This is for you.

369
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,934
What's that?.

370
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,665
A wine stain.
I can't get it out.

371
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:37,367
Let me see.

372
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,916
I'll wear it anyway.

373
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,944
The old woman will only add it
to my debts.

374
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,689
- Tighter.
- Don't move.

375
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,438
Looking for wrinkles?.

376
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,780
Let me see.

377
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:22,251
No, you're fine.

378
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,254
Just a few around the eyes.

379
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,222
That's okay.

380
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,191
You don't have one.

381
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,218
They'll come.

382
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,851
Want to try?.

383
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,729
It helps with love.

384
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,630
Good evening.

385
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,663
I'm Jacques.

386
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,699
I follow you?.

387
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:25,208
Did Madame buy you
from another house or not?.

388
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,376
No.

389
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,978
You have no debts then.

390
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,354
- What were you before?.
- A seamstress.

391
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,859
I was a laundress.

392
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,521
It was torture, believe me.

393
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:42,397
My lungs are full of ammonia.

394
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,560
What did you do before?.

395
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:47,571
Me?.
I did nothing special.

396
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,335
You're from the bourgeoisie?.

397
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,537
The petty bourgeoisie.
Very petty.

398
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,678
- You have no debts then.
- We all have debts.

399
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,877
You work to pay them off.

400
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,408
In your dreams.

401
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:06,583
She makes sure you never pay
them off and leave.

402
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,922
Even with a lot of clients,
you always need perfume...

403
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,192
Go easy on that stuff.

404
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,995
But, Madame,
Mondays are quiet.

405
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,001
- It helps us relax.
- It won't be quiet for long.

406
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,003
Come on, up you get.

407
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,528
He's a new one.

408
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,645
- Are you all right?.
- Yes, fine.

409
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,775
That's good.
Very good.

410
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,308
Just...

411
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:46,160
Michaux could pay off
your debts.

412
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,360
If he does, I'll marry him.

413
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,477
The tall girl is popular.

414
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:08,417
Next to her, the Algerian.

415
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,285
Samira.

416
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:23,399
That young one there is 15.
She's a virgin.

417
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,138
I can send for a boy too.

418
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,730
19, very pretty.

419
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,265
He can be here in an hour.

420
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,305
I need to think about it.

421
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,416
- Do you like champagne?.
- Not really.

422
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,582
But he loves it.

423
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,236
Come on.

424
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,676
It's cold.

425
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,778
You'll get used to it.

426
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:54,484
You'll see, it's delicious.

427
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,933
Very nice.

428
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,282
It's wonderful here.

429
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,311
You see girls without corsets...

430
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,495
Léa...

431
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,524
- Someone for you.
- Who is it?.

432
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,331
Victor.

433
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,362
Hurry up now.
He's in the blue room.

434
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:57,741
Michaux will be in at one.
Try to see someone else first.

435
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,484
When Pauline finishes,
check it went well.

436
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,185
Why me?.

437
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:14,088
So shall we have commerce?.

438
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,895
- No, not today.
- Why not?.

439
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,401
Because.

440
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,767
Pity.

441
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,206
Who did Charles go with?.

442
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,650
Léa.

443
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:39,281
She milked the first one?.

444
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,314
That other guy...

445
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,417
Who did he go with?.

446
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,894
No idea.

447
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,468
Won't you sit down?.

448
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,557
Can you lift your veil?.

449
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,415
What's your name?.

450
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,214
- The Jewess.
- No. Your real name.

451
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:45,221
Madeleine.

452
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:48,053
I'm Jacques.

453
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:51,323
Why did you come up?.

454
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,354
I paid for the night.

455
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:13,339
- Does that hurt?.
- No.

456
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,149
How did it happen?.

457
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,988
You don't have to tell me.

458
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,334
It was a man...

459
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,466
A man I knew well.

460
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:14,272
We were in one of the rooms.

461
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:17,439
He asked
if he could tie me up.

462
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:18,948
I said he could.

463
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,815
I played along.

464
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:25,015
And that was that.

465
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,624
No one ever comes to see you?.

466
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,254
No.

467
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:37,097
So what do you do here?.

468
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:40,194
I make the beds.

469
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,535
I help in the kitchen.

470
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,406
I help in the laundry.

471
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,605
I look after the girls.

472
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:53,583
- Does she hide you?.
- No.

473
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,517
Why are you asking me all this?.

474
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:56,644
I don't know.

475
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,656
Didn't you want to have
a normal life?.

476
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,021
Outside.

477
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,390
You could find a job.

478
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,089
I can help if you want.

479
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,564
I don't know.

480
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,863
Do you want to make love or not?.

481
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,802
I don't want to talk anymore.

482
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:16,829
Vuitton...

483
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:29,145
- Thank you again.
- My pleasure.

484
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,613
I'll get my animal.

485
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,838
I adore her.

486
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,810
I've never had her.

487
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,506
When she goes off you,
you get this.

488
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,846
Pussy fur?.

489
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,579
Who were you with?.

490
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,588
My Julie.

491
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,487
Caca.

492
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,826
How many?.

493
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,522
Four.
You?.

494
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,360
Six.

495
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,763
Five.

496
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,164
Three.

497
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:25,793
I'll never get out of here.

498
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,201
Okay?.

499
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,105
This shit is sticky...

500
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,975
Let me help.

501
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,484
What's this?.

502
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,786
It's not easy in a bathtub
but I'm okay.

503
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:50,987
- Want some ointment?.
- I'm okay.

504
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,689
Did it go well?.

505
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,723
I think so.

506
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:03,266
How do I clean the sperm
with the sponge?.

507
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,400
Use this cream and rub gently.

508
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,434
It stings but that's normal.

509
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,492
It's so depressing.

510
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:26,519
It'll be dawn soon.

511
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,374
I've drunk too much.

512
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:48,978
Thank you.

513
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,025
80.

514
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,966
"Mr. Prefect,

515
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,663
"l am a widow

00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:25,445
"finding a trade other than

00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,315

"Allow me the consolation

Marie-France Dallaire."

538
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,722
It reeks of sperm
and champagne here.

539
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:55,586
Why do they call you Caca?.

540
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,100
Why do they
call you Caca?.

541
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,034
Why am I Long Hair?.

542
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,169
Let's just say...

543
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,903
I have a specialty.

544
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:11,141
I get the picture.

545
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:12,842
Want to know anyway?.

546
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,577
Julie, we're eating!

547
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,882
Why?.

548
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,057
Don't spoil it.

549
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,960
Does it still hurt?.

550
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,191
Only a little at night now.

551
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,733
- Did Madame make you?.
- No.

552
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,236
She asked me.

553
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,330
And?.

554
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:39,206
He paid for the night,
but didn't want sex.

555
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,641
Why not?.

556
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:45,373
Probably just to see
the monster close up.

557
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:48,077
He was sweet.

558
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,348
He said he'd come back
next week.

559
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,684
But I don't believe him.

560
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:55,687
Want to check in the cards?.

561
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,022
No, it's okay.

562
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,290
Last night was
a real freak show.

563
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,126
I had one...

564
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:02,426
He keeps going to confession

565
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:06,231
to talk filth
to get the priest hard.

566
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,760
He wanks off at the same time.

567
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:12,338
That's sick!

568
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,173
I'd like to see
a brothel for women.

569
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:19,272
A great place with great men
who are hard all the time

570
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,648
and tell us we're pretty,

571
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,516
even if we're old
with saggy tits.

572
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:26,113
We'd never ask
the stupid questions they do.

573
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,716
Do you like my tits?.

574
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,055
Do you like my big tits?.

575
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,151
What's "whore" in Arabic?.

576
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,320
"Zaniya"...

577
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:36,196
or "Qahba,"
depending how polite you are.

578
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,995
What's the polite one?.

579
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:42,403
"Zaniya," the kept woman.

580
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:45,897
I don't mind being
a kept woman.

581
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:49,538
Is Maurice going to propose?.

582
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,740
Perhaps.

583
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:54,079
If his wife dies.

584
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,709
Are you in love?.

585
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,879
No.

586
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,388
But he's sweet.

587
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,515
The other day,

588
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:04,152
we went to the Wepler
for oysters.

589
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,721
Then we went dancing.

590
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:11,359
Know what I told him?.

591
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,494
"l would pluck out my eyes
for you

592
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,766
"so you'd have more holes

593
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:18,035
to make love to me."

594
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:20,474
He loved that!

595
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,307
Is this only for Madeleine?.

596
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:23,869
No, for all of us.

597
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:33,546
Four show the past,

598
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:37,583
four the present
and four the future.

599
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:03,543
No, it's all right.

600
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,611
That's the good spade card.

601
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:08,886
It means stability, luck,
security...

602
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,122
The nine of clubs
means a job, a situation.

603
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:15,154
The Queen is a kind woman.

604
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:22,060
There's a young man, single.

605
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,206
He's next to a diamond card.

606
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:30,770
There's a romantic project,
but it's upside down.

607
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:34,973
That means there's a problem.

608
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,153
A girl with long hair.

609
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,282
She's upside down too.

610
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,795
You have to be wary of her.

611
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,923
- Are you sure?.
- Of course.

612
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,832
That it's upside down.

613
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,768
It's in relation
to the dealer.

614
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,964
They're only cards.

615
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,735
If you draw them,
they're more than that.

616
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,936
You're a bit of a mystic?.

617
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,945
I want to stop.

618
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,948
We've started, let's finish.

619
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,212
Come on, the future.

620
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,412
What did they call you before?.

621
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,011
The Jewess.

622
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,068
Which is the worst one?.

623
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,800
The ten.

624
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,880
Do you like that?.

625
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,583
Yes.

626
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:55,990
What do you want?.

627
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,755
To see the Woman Who Laughs.

628
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,922
For sex or just to see her?.

629
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:04,297
To see her first,
then decide.

630
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,029
Inside a room,
you do as you like,

631
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:10,301
but you see girls here for sex,
the normal way.

632
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:14,174
I'd like Léa as a doll then.

633
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:21,300
Come here.

634
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:43,849
You smell nice, my doll.

635
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,887
Who did you have?.

636
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,551
Simon.
And you?.

637
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:51,924
Louis.

638
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,998
Julie, no!

639
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,472
Help me!
Julie!

640
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,029
I want the peach.

641
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,401
Well?.

642
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:38,100
I'll get you!
You have to strip right now.

643
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,873
Catch.

644
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:57,993
Marie-France, where do
the clients get their money?.

645
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:00,587
In industry, textiles,
paper...

646
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,120
Family fortunes too.

647
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:04,997
Fortunes of the aristocracy.

648
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,433
Are there a lot
of aristocrats?.

649
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,130
Yes.

650
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,104
We get a lot of aristocrats.

651
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,300
What does Louis work in?.

652
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,832
Louis is in textiles.

653
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:16,902
He made his fortune
in textiles.

654
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:19,574
Michaux has a family fortune.

655
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:23,984
Charles is a family fortune too.

656
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,080
Who's the richest one?.

657
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:30,354
The richest one?.

658
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:32,486
Charles.

659
01:05:32,992 --> 01:05:37,190
He doesn't spend the most,
but he's the richest one.

660
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:39,926
Has he been coming long?.

661
01:05:39,966 --> 01:05:42,457
Yes, since the days
when I worked at L'Apollonide

662
01:05:42,502 --> 01:05:45,733
Iike you do.

663
01:06:10,596 --> 01:06:12,223
My back hurts.

664
01:06:12,265 --> 01:06:14,426
I'm sick of his doll thing.

665
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:16,230
Don't complain.
There's worse.

666
01:06:16,269 --> 01:06:19,568
I'm not saying that,
just that I'm sick of it.

667
01:06:19,605 --> 01:06:21,630
You do as you want.

668
01:06:21,674 --> 01:06:24,802
You get rid of creeps
with a few pussy hairs.

669
01:06:24,844 --> 01:06:28,336
My whole bush wouldn't do that!

670
01:06:38,925 --> 01:06:43,555
It feels like an eternity
since we had a day out.

671
01:06:48,267 --> 01:06:49,859
It's me.

672
01:06:49,902 --> 01:06:51,426
Give me your cigarette.

673
01:06:51,471 --> 01:06:54,770
All right.

674
01:06:54,807 --> 01:06:56,172
What is it?.

675
01:06:56,209 --> 01:06:59,303
I was thinking a Lanvin hat
would suit you.

676
01:06:59,345 --> 01:07:01,245
Go on then, Polo.

677
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,113
Treat me to a hat.

678
01:07:06,552 --> 01:07:09,680
The fresh air loosens you up.

679
01:07:09,722 --> 01:07:11,690
Want a drop of champagne?.

680
01:07:11,724 --> 01:07:14,056
Please.

681
01:07:16,596 --> 01:07:17,585
Want some too?.

682
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:20,064
Yeah, okay.

683
01:07:22,268 --> 01:07:24,259
Gently!

684
01:07:24,303 --> 01:07:25,861
Sorry.

685
01:07:25,905 --> 01:07:28,271
Pardon me.

686
01:07:28,307 --> 01:07:29,365
It slipped out.

687
01:07:29,408 --> 01:07:31,035
Calm down, Polo.

688
01:07:31,077 --> 01:07:33,272
Oh, you know...

689
01:07:33,312 --> 01:07:37,476
I'm sorry, it's old age.

690
01:07:37,517 --> 01:07:38,779
This is nice.

691
01:07:38,818 --> 01:07:39,910
Oh, yes!

692
01:07:39,952 --> 01:07:41,647
I feel so good!

693
01:08:42,114 --> 01:08:46,016
I don't think
I'll be here long.

694
01:08:46,052 --> 01:08:47,781
I said that too.

695
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,287
Now look at me.

696
01:08:49,322 --> 01:08:51,415
We'll see.

697
01:08:51,457 --> 01:08:54,858
I don't have any debts yet.

698
01:08:54,894 --> 01:08:57,727
We'll see.

699
01:09:08,507 --> 01:09:11,499
"l understand
your sense of injustice,

700
01:09:11,544 --> 01:09:14,342
"and I've always given you
my support.

701
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:17,508
"But, as a prefect,
I can't work miracles.

702
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:22,510
I cannot oppose
a landlord's decision."

703
01:09:22,555 --> 01:09:25,752
Good evening.

704
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:27,224
Who's here this evening?.

705
01:09:27,259 --> 01:09:30,092
The same ones.

706
01:09:30,129 --> 01:09:33,462
- Still want to see the Jewess?.
- Pardon me?.

707
01:09:33,499 --> 01:09:37,492
The Woman Who Laughs.
Want to go up to see her?.

708
01:09:37,536 --> 01:09:39,094
You can,
but it'll cost you more.

709
01:09:39,138 --> 01:09:41,402
No.
I was a bit tipsy last time.

710
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:42,634
Who else is there?.

711
01:09:42,675 --> 01:09:43,835
Who else...

712
01:09:43,876 --> 01:09:47,277
Sweetness, Cléa, Climbing Rose,
Fine Thigh...

713
01:10:04,764 --> 01:10:08,791
Afterwards, women couldn't
compete in the games.

714
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:11,029
Why not?.

715
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:13,470
Good question.

716
01:10:13,506 --> 01:10:18,671
They were thrown from a rock
if ever they went there.

717
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:22,875
But now they can go.

718
01:10:22,915 --> 01:10:25,782
They couldn't go
because the athletes were nude.

719
01:10:25,818 --> 01:10:28,685
Now they're dressed.

720
01:10:28,721 --> 01:10:31,747
So women can take part.

721
01:10:50,309 --> 01:10:52,971
Will you go up with me
and another girl?.

722
01:10:53,012 --> 01:10:54,980
Who?.

723
01:10:55,014 --> 01:10:56,845
Anyone.
You choose.

724
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:59,681
I don't know.

725
01:10:59,719 --> 01:11:02,882
I'd rather go alone
if you don't mind.

726
01:11:13,866 --> 01:11:16,858
Shall I put you in my will?.

727
01:11:21,173 --> 01:11:24,142
Do you want to be in my will?.

728
01:11:24,176 --> 01:11:25,370
No.

729
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:28,539
I want you to stay alive.

730
01:11:28,581 --> 01:11:32,278
If anyone here is alive,

731
01:11:32,318 --> 01:11:34,809
I am.

732
01:11:40,192 --> 01:11:41,716
Good evening.

733
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:43,058
Ah, Louis!

734
01:11:45,431 --> 01:11:49,231
A drink
or shall I call Samira?.

735
01:11:49,268 --> 01:11:52,101
Both.

736
01:11:56,108 --> 01:12:00,169
"l understand
your sense of injustice,

737
01:12:00,212 --> 01:12:04,046
"and I've always given you
my support.

738
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:07,951
But, as a prefect,
I can't work miracles."

739
01:12:16,662 --> 01:12:19,688
Thank you.

740
01:12:19,732 --> 01:12:22,132
Some women
have very large breasts.

741
01:12:23,536 --> 01:12:26,903
They could have an accident,
knock themselves out...

742
01:12:26,939 --> 01:12:28,406
Yes, that's true.

743
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,204
They could bandage them.

744
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:35,538
It's not so much fun.

745
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:54,399
Fine Thigh.

746
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:02,838
Fine Thigh...

747
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:04,274
Clothed or naked?.

748
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:06,540
I prefer you naked.

749
01:13:06,579 --> 01:13:09,377
- It costs more.
- I know.

750
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:05,401
Talk to me in Japanese.

751
01:14:07,806 --> 01:14:10,798
Go on, make it up.

752
01:14:12,912 --> 01:14:16,370
Make it up.

753
01:14:23,555 --> 01:14:25,921
More.

754
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:51,640
What does that mean?.

755
01:14:51,684 --> 01:14:56,883
It means my tongue
comes towards you.

756
01:14:56,922 --> 01:15:00,824
Slowly.
It slithers across the floor.

757
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:02,827
It slips under the bed.

758
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:05,421
It rises up the side of it.

759
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:07,455
It reaches your feet.

760
01:15:07,499 --> 01:15:09,330
It licks them.

761
01:15:09,368 --> 01:15:11,768
It glides up along your leg.

762
01:15:11,804 --> 01:15:13,863
Along your thigh.

763
01:15:13,906 --> 01:15:16,067
It reaches your sex.

764
01:15:16,108 --> 01:15:18,167
It winds around it.

765
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:20,542
It swallows it completely.

766
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:23,412
Sword swallower.

767
01:15:26,685 --> 01:15:29,677
Your Japanese is very good.

768
01:15:36,996 --> 01:15:38,896
Do you want some?.

769
01:15:40,733 --> 01:15:42,200
You don't have to smoke it.

770
01:15:42,234 --> 01:15:45,692
You can take a bit and eat it.

771
01:15:45,738 --> 01:15:48,263
It's okay, I know.

772
01:16:20,472 --> 01:16:22,770
I want to see you often.

773
01:16:22,808 --> 01:16:25,572
Won't Clothilde
be angry with me?.

774
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:27,408
I can see more than one girl.

775
01:16:27,446 --> 01:16:32,281
Now stop asking questions
and talk to me in Japanese.

776
01:16:45,898 --> 01:16:47,263
You're very young.

777
01:16:47,299 --> 01:16:48,391
Not that young.

778
01:16:50,502 --> 01:16:52,527
Really?.

779
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:57,099
Not many girls my age
have been fucked in champagne.

780
01:16:57,142 --> 01:16:59,042
Did you like it?.

781
01:16:59,078 --> 01:17:01,911
I loved it.

782
01:17:10,055 --> 01:17:14,219
Men never look into the sex
of women enough.

783
01:17:23,735 --> 01:17:26,727
Wonderful.

784
01:17:28,073 --> 01:17:31,167
After one night with you,
I could kill myself.

785
01:17:50,896 --> 01:17:53,023
Say "Ah."

786
01:17:53,065 --> 01:17:54,157
Good.

787
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:55,427
What's that spot?.

788
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:56,729
Nothing.

789
01:17:56,768 --> 01:17:58,429
Have you had it long?.

790
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:00,404
It's nothing.

791
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:01,497
All right.

792
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:02,564
One month?. Two?.

793
01:18:02,608 --> 01:18:04,007
No, a few days.

794
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:07,034
All right.

795
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:08,546
Any itching?.

796
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,571
No.

797
01:18:17,723 --> 01:18:20,715
- No new rashes on your body?.
- No.

798
01:18:20,759 --> 01:18:24,126
Let me take a look.

799
01:18:28,934 --> 01:18:31,266
Let me see.

800
01:18:33,672 --> 01:18:37,005
Lie down now
and let me examine you.

801
01:18:51,323 --> 01:18:54,156
Let me see.

802
01:18:57,963 --> 01:19:01,524
Nothing around the anus.

803
01:19:01,567 --> 01:19:04,559
I'll use the speculum now.

804
01:19:14,179 --> 01:19:19,014
If ever I get out of here,
I'll never make love again.

805
01:19:21,753 --> 01:19:22,879
- No...
- Yes.

806
01:19:22,921 --> 01:19:24,013
I have to examine you.

807
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:26,115
You have to lie down.

808
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:28,319
- No!
- I have to examine you.

809
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,021
I have to.

810
01:19:30,062 --> 01:19:31,393
Come on.

811
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:32,897
Now spread your thighs.

812
01:19:32,931 --> 01:19:35,024
No two ways about it.

813
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:38,730
I can't see your sex otherwise.
Come on now.

814
01:19:42,307 --> 01:19:44,138
Look at me.

815
01:19:44,176 --> 01:19:45,905
You have to lie down.

816
01:19:45,944 --> 01:19:49,436
Lie down and spread your thighs.
You have to do it.

817
01:19:53,151 --> 01:19:55,483
The cervix is fine.

818
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,715
Heavy but normal discharge.

819
01:19:57,756 --> 01:20:00,281
How about your period?.

820
01:20:00,325 --> 01:20:02,919
It comes and goes.

821
01:20:02,961 --> 01:20:04,929
When did you last have it?.
Two months ago?.

822
01:20:04,963 --> 01:20:06,021
Three?.

823
01:20:06,064 --> 01:20:08,032
Not long ago.
I forget.

824
01:20:08,066 --> 01:20:10,933
Six months?.

825
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:13,836
You don't have your period
anymore?.

826
01:20:13,872 --> 01:20:16,136
I'm not pregnant.

827
01:20:16,174 --> 01:20:19,109
Six months...

828
01:20:19,144 --> 01:20:21,510
I just don't have my period
anymore.

829
01:20:21,546 --> 01:20:23,810
How about your period?.

830
01:20:23,849 --> 01:20:25,942
Same thing.

831
01:20:25,984 --> 01:20:28,043
It comes and goes.

832
01:20:28,086 --> 01:20:29,644
And you?.

833
01:20:29,688 --> 01:20:30,746
Normal.

834
01:20:30,789 --> 01:20:32,484
And you there?.

835
01:20:32,524 --> 01:20:34,219
Mine's fine.

836
01:20:34,259 --> 01:20:35,920
Let me examine you.

837
01:20:47,773 --> 01:20:49,104
Lie down.

838
01:20:55,013 --> 01:20:58,005
- Okay?.
- Yes, I'm healthy.

839
01:21:20,939 --> 01:21:22,600
Well?.

840
01:21:22,641 --> 01:21:25,439
I'm fine.
I'm healthy.

841
01:21:25,477 --> 01:21:27,445
And the others?.

842
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:28,776
I don't know.

843
01:21:28,814 --> 01:21:29,974
I swear...

844
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:34,315
What am I supposed to do now?.

845
01:21:34,353 --> 01:21:36,844
You think they're not pregnant?.

846
01:21:36,888 --> 01:21:39,015
No, I'm sure.

847
01:21:39,057 --> 01:21:43,323
But, I'm sorry,
that girl there has syphilis.

848
01:21:54,573 --> 01:21:57,667
- It's okay. I accept it.
- Bravo.

849
01:22:02,481 --> 01:22:05,973
I'd just like someone
to give me a hug.

850
01:22:17,863 --> 01:22:20,855
I want a macaroon.

851
01:22:25,203 --> 01:22:27,899
What a shit job.

852
01:22:34,746 --> 01:22:37,738
Fucking is a fuck awful job.

853
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:16,715
It won't be easy tonight.

854
01:23:16,755 --> 01:23:18,313
No.

855
01:23:18,356 --> 01:23:21,291
Have you seen my bracelet?.

856
01:23:21,326 --> 01:23:24,090
- Which one?.
- The pearl one.

857
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:27,292
I think I saw it in the box.

858
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:40,501
I put a charm on her doll.

859
01:23:40,545 --> 01:23:41,842
I got a needle and...

860
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,848
It's not your fault, Samira.

861
01:23:43,882 --> 01:23:45,611
It could have been me or you.

862
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:47,515
It's the clap.

863
01:23:47,552 --> 01:23:50,112
Samira, go down.
Louis will be here soon.

864
01:23:56,528 --> 01:23:58,155
Madame...

865
01:23:58,196 --> 01:23:59,527
I have my period.

866
01:23:59,564 --> 01:24:01,555
We're too busy.

867
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,067
- Take a cold bath.
- Please...

868
01:24:03,101 --> 01:24:04,193
I can't.

869
01:24:04,236 --> 01:24:08,036
I'm already one girl short
as it is.

870
01:24:08,073 --> 01:24:10,166
You'll have to work more.

871
01:24:10,208 --> 01:24:11,641
Yes, Madame.

872
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:15,476
And try to show
a little joy tonight.

873
01:24:15,514 --> 01:24:17,414
All right?.

874
01:24:21,653 --> 01:24:23,780
Tonight,
just pretend I'm dead.

875
01:25:42,934 --> 01:25:45,266
You really have a tiny head.

876
01:25:45,303 --> 01:25:47,066
So?.

877
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:49,073
A tiny head is pretty,
isn't it?.

878
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:52,133
It's very pretty.
Charming.

879
01:25:52,177 --> 01:25:54,008
You have a tiny head too.

880
01:25:54,045 --> 01:25:55,307
I'm sorry?.

881
01:25:55,347 --> 01:25:57,747
The size of your head...

882
01:25:57,782 --> 01:26:00,012
My head is fine and delicate.

883
01:26:00,051 --> 01:26:02,645
I knew it.

884
01:26:02,687 --> 01:26:07,989
A woman called Pauline Tarnowsky
has written a scientific study

885
01:26:08,026 --> 01:26:09,755
on prostitutes.

886
01:26:09,794 --> 01:26:13,093
She says their heads are smaller
than average.

887
01:26:13,131 --> 01:26:15,656
The same is true of criminals.

888
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,429
Really?.

889
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:20,097
I can lend it to you
if you want.

890
01:26:20,138 --> 01:26:21,867
If it's good.

891
01:26:21,906 --> 01:26:24,739
It's very good.

892
01:26:36,054 --> 01:26:40,115
Right now, a normal girl
goes for 300.

893
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:42,888
400 for a Negress.

894
01:26:42,927 --> 01:26:45,157
- Plus the debts.
- I can't.

895
01:26:45,196 --> 01:26:47,892
Even to keep Julie
without working, I can't.

896
01:26:47,932 --> 01:26:50,765
Paris is too expensive now.

897
01:26:53,104 --> 01:26:59,339
I have a friend
who organizes special evenings.

898
01:26:59,377 --> 01:27:02,710
The Woman Who Laughs
interests him.

899
01:27:20,765 --> 01:27:23,757
I want to pay off your debts.

900
01:27:44,022 --> 01:27:45,751
Five times six.

901
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:47,917
Eight...

902
01:27:47,959 --> 01:27:49,790
- 30...40.
- 40.

903
01:27:49,828 --> 01:27:53,559
Here you are.

904
01:27:53,598 --> 01:27:55,293
Five times seven?.

905
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:58,200
No, five times nine.

906
01:27:58,236 --> 01:27:59,635
What time is it?.

907
01:27:59,671 --> 01:28:02,139
It's only 8:00.
Go to bed.

908
01:28:02,173 --> 01:28:05,165
You'll look like hell tonight.

909
01:28:06,511 --> 01:28:07,773
Five times nine?.

910
01:28:11,516 --> 01:28:14,076
You're still here?.

911
01:28:14,119 --> 01:28:16,110
Will you sleep with me?.

912
01:28:16,154 --> 01:28:17,314
No.

913
01:28:17,355 --> 01:28:19,016
It's too late now.

914
01:28:19,057 --> 01:28:20,183
Or too early.

915
01:28:21,326 --> 01:28:24,295
I didn't mean sex.
Just sleeping.

916
01:28:24,329 --> 01:28:27,321
I don't want to go home.
I feel bad.

917
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:33,097
Just sleep then?.

918
01:28:33,138 --> 01:28:34,571
At 8:00 a.m.,

919
01:28:34,606 --> 01:28:38,474
there's no more commerce.

920
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:40,478
You can lie
between Samira and me.

921
01:28:40,512 --> 01:28:42,139
I promise.

922
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:43,772
I'll be fine between you.

923
01:28:43,815 --> 01:28:46,340
Léa, go to bed.

924
01:28:46,384 --> 01:28:48,079
Sorry.

925
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:52,613
Good night.

926
01:28:52,657 --> 01:28:55,956
I can't bring myself
to go home.

927
01:28:55,994 --> 01:28:58,485
- Where's Pauline?.
- She's asleep by now.

928
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:02,933
Who with?.

929
01:29:02,967 --> 01:29:06,300
Do you mind
if I stay here awhile?.

930
01:29:06,337 --> 01:29:09,238
If I go home,
I'll be a wreck.

931
01:29:09,274 --> 01:29:10,901
You've gone off Clothilde?.

932
01:29:10,942 --> 01:29:12,102
I don't know.

933
01:29:12,143 --> 01:29:13,633
I adore her, but...

934
01:29:13,678 --> 01:29:15,145
we don't have fun.

935
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:17,478
I make her sad.

936
01:29:17,515 --> 01:29:20,450
But I'm very fond of her.

937
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:22,476
I love whores.

938
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:26,820
I find them wonderful.
They move me.

939
01:29:26,858 --> 01:29:29,827
I'm happy with them.
Terrible, isn't it?.

940
01:29:29,861 --> 01:29:32,830
I understand.

941
01:29:32,864 --> 01:29:34,855
I understand you.

942
01:30:59,186 --> 01:31:01,017
It's occupied.

943
01:31:17,671 --> 01:31:21,903
"Anthropometric Study
of Prostitutes and Thieves"

944
01:31:21,942 --> 01:31:25,173
"Pauline Tarnowsky - 1 889"

945
01:32:09,122 --> 01:32:11,420
Spread your legs.

946
01:32:11,458 --> 01:32:15,360
So I can see you.

947
01:32:15,395 --> 01:32:18,387
Tighter.

948
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:23,226
My geisha...

949
01:32:34,681 --> 01:32:38,913
"The prostitute
is a female criminal.

950
01:32:38,952 --> 01:32:46,120
"We observe an encephalon
several millimeters smaller,

951
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:47,956
"due to the fact

952
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:51,931
"that prostitutes
have smaller heads.

953
01:32:51,965 --> 01:32:58,928
"Consequently, this means they
have much less brain matter.

954
01:32:58,972 --> 01:33:02,271
"Their weak intelligence

955
01:33:02,309 --> 01:33:04,709
"and mental abnormality
is natural.

956
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:10,081
"The dull spirit of some
can become stupor in others

957
01:33:10,117 --> 01:33:15,749
and even attain
a state verging on idiocy."

958
01:33:21,461 --> 01:33:24,624
Get up, Clothilde.

959
01:33:28,435 --> 01:33:30,630
- I'm fine here.
- You are?.

960
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:33,071
Stupefied, you're fine?.

961
01:33:36,109 --> 01:33:38,600
You'll end up
in a Marseille brothel

962
01:33:38,645 --> 01:33:43,082
turning tricks
on a vermin-ridden mattress.

963
01:33:43,116 --> 01:33:45,550
No.

964
01:33:45,585 --> 01:33:48,281
Know what I'm going to do?.

965
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:49,755
I'll sell myself

966
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:51,849
to another house.

967
01:33:51,892 --> 01:33:55,851
For a high price,
so I can pay off my debts.

968
01:33:55,896 --> 01:33:57,693
Of course.

969
01:33:57,731 --> 01:34:02,168
No one will want your debts.

970
01:34:02,202 --> 01:34:03,829
Well, I'll sell my teeth.

971
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:10,575
A Marseille brothel,
with the clap.

972
01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:13,602
Great.
Fine.

973
01:34:13,647 --> 01:34:17,811
We deserve the clap.

974
01:34:17,851 --> 01:34:20,285
We deserve our punishment.

975
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:24,253
I've been here 1 2 years.

976
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:27,158
The clap will be a nice break.

977
01:34:44,611 --> 01:34:46,044
Be brave.

978
01:34:50,817 --> 01:34:53,650
Good-bye.

979
01:34:57,324 --> 01:34:59,918
My dear Julie...

980
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,360
my little Caca...

981
01:35:02,396 --> 01:35:04,091
it hurts me to write this

982
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:08,625
because it will hurt you
to read it.

983
01:35:08,668 --> 01:35:11,262
You're ill, my little Julie,

984
01:35:11,304 --> 01:35:14,000
and I wish I was there
to comfort you.

985
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:18,034
But there are things
I must say.

986
01:35:22,482 --> 01:35:26,543
Don't think I'm abandoning you.

987
01:35:26,586 --> 01:35:30,147
I'd never abandon someone
I cherish as much as you

988
01:35:30,190 --> 01:35:33,591
after all these months.

989
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:37,495
But I must tell you this.

990
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:38,759
Our relations must change.

991
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:41,859
I don't want to catch
your disease.

992
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:45,235
I never hesitate
to sacrifice myself,

993
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:50,767
but now that sacrifice
would hurt me and not help you.

994
01:35:55,215 --> 01:35:58,981
You know I cannot pursue
your disease.

995
01:35:59,019 --> 01:36:02,511
I think I have eluded it
as I have no symptoms,

996
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:06,925
but I'm not safe yet.

997
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,259
I have to wait two more weeks.

998
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:15,929
Julie, if I were ill,
I would forgive you.

999
01:36:15,969 --> 01:36:19,837
But no one in my family
has ever had such diseases,

1000
01:36:19,873 --> 01:36:23,104
and I wouldn't like
to infect others.

1001
01:36:23,143 --> 01:36:26,044
Men have secrets
but no mystery,

1002
01:36:26,079 --> 01:36:29,571
and I'm so sorry,
my little Julie.

1003
01:36:29,616 --> 01:36:32,107
I still love you,

1004
01:36:32,152 --> 01:36:36,816
even more now
because you're ill.

1005
01:36:36,857 --> 01:36:41,385
Your loving friend, Maurice.

1006
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:43,259
"Men...

1007
01:36:43,296 --> 01:36:45,730
"Men have secrets
but no mystery,

1008
01:36:45,765 --> 01:36:47,926
"and I'm so sorry,
my little Julie.

1009
01:36:47,968 --> 01:36:49,230
"l still love you,

1010
01:36:49,269 --> 01:36:51,760
"even more now
because you're ill.

1011
01:36:51,805 --> 01:36:53,796
Your loving friend, Maurice."

1012
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,330
Where was it?.

1013
01:36:55,375 --> 01:36:56,433
In the mail.

1014
01:36:56,476 --> 01:36:57,943
Tear it up.

1015
01:36:57,978 --> 01:36:59,240
She mustn't read it.

1016
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:05,609
That's really sick.

1017
01:37:05,652 --> 01:37:08,553
I can keep her
because he's still paying.

1018
01:37:08,588 --> 01:37:11,716
Even if he no longer sees her.

1019
01:37:11,758 --> 01:37:13,385
Any news of Pauline?.

1020
01:37:13,426 --> 01:37:15,792
No.

1021
01:37:17,864 --> 01:37:20,424
Is the house closing down?.

1022
01:37:20,467 --> 01:37:22,992
I don't know.

1023
01:37:30,577 --> 01:37:33,546
Does it suit me?.

1024
01:39:18,785 --> 01:39:21,618
It's funny.
She looks like an old doll.

1025
01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:23,384
No, she's too thin.

1026
01:39:23,423 --> 01:39:25,288
She's like a big puppet.

1027
01:39:25,325 --> 01:39:28,158
But I like her breasts.

1028
01:40:01,227 --> 01:40:03,491
Pinch her nipples

1029
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:06,522
to see
if she stops smiling.

1030
01:41:41,661 --> 01:41:45,927
Has Pauline left,
or did something happen to her?.

1031
01:41:45,965 --> 01:41:49,401
Could Madame have sold her
without saying?.

1032
01:41:49,436 --> 01:41:51,904
Will she sell us one by one?.

1033
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,812
Will she sell us one by one?.

1034
01:42:00,847 --> 01:42:03,509
I don't know.

1035
01:42:06,052 --> 01:42:09,317
God only knows
where we'll end up.

1036
01:42:09,355 --> 01:42:13,451
Maybe in some seedy brothel,
with revolting clients.

1037
01:42:13,493 --> 01:42:16,485
Especially past 25.

1038
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:33,335
Looking at the freak?.

1039
01:42:40,653 --> 01:42:43,144
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.

1040
01:42:48,127 --> 01:42:50,618
You too.

1041
01:43:04,344 --> 01:43:06,005
I don't want to die.

1042
01:43:06,045 --> 01:43:09,037
You're not going to.
I promise.

1043
01:43:12,552 --> 01:43:14,349
I want to see Maurice.

1044
01:43:16,189 --> 01:43:19,522
He's going to come.
Soon.

1045
01:47:54,066 --> 01:47:57,331
I feel your sperm fill me up

1046
01:47:57,370 --> 01:47:58,962
and flow out through my eyes.

1047
01:47:59,005 --> 01:48:04,637
There are white tears,
thick ones, coating my cheeks.

1048
01:48:04,677 --> 01:48:07,009
My mouth is red,

1049
01:48:07,046 --> 01:48:11,107
and the white tears
trickle over it.

1050
01:48:11,150 --> 01:48:13,710
I don't want to wipe them away.

1051
01:48:13,753 --> 01:48:14,811
I cry so much...

1052
01:48:14,854 --> 01:48:17,049
I can't stop crying.

1053
01:48:17,089 --> 01:48:19,114
You don't have an emerald?.

1054
01:48:19,158 --> 01:48:20,955
No, I don't have one.

1055
01:48:20,993 --> 01:48:23,120
I want to tie you up.
May l?.

1056
01:48:29,502 --> 01:48:30,628
Shh.

1057
01:48:53,759 --> 01:48:56,455
You were on the floor.

1058
01:48:56,495 --> 01:49:00,431
I picked you up.

1059
01:49:00,466 --> 01:49:02,195
Thank you.

1060
01:49:10,176 --> 01:49:13,634
You said something
in your sleep.

1061
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:17,513
What did I say?.

1062
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:19,575
"lf we don't burn,

1063
01:49:19,619 --> 01:49:21,917
"how will the night be lit?.

1064
01:49:21,954 --> 01:49:24,946
"Michaux...

1065
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:28,119
"my fragment...

1066
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:30,526
meteorite."

1067
01:49:31,998 --> 01:49:33,488
I said that?.

1068
01:49:38,704 --> 01:49:43,004
Don't be afraid
to express your love.

1069
01:49:43,042 --> 01:49:47,479
Don't be afraid.

1070
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:22,606
What's your name?.

1071
01:50:22,648 --> 01:50:24,309
Madeleine.

1072
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:26,511
No nickname?.

1073
01:50:26,552 --> 01:50:28,577
Just Madeleine.

1074
01:50:36,362 --> 01:50:38,125
Long live France.

1075
01:50:42,835 --> 01:50:44,700
Where will they go?.

1076
01:50:44,737 --> 01:50:47,797
I've sold some
to other houses.

1077
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,001
A man has bought Samira.

1078
01:50:50,042 --> 01:50:53,478
The others will do
what they can.

1079
01:50:53,512 --> 01:50:57,243
Enjoy them while they're here.

1080
01:50:57,283 --> 01:50:59,376
I'm not staying.

1081
01:50:59,418 --> 01:51:01,909
I'm in no mood for fun.

1082
01:51:01,954 --> 01:51:04,184
I just wanted
to give you a kiss.

1083
01:51:15,267 --> 01:51:17,064
A new Jeanne Paquin dress?.

1084
01:51:17,103 --> 01:51:18,400
Yes.

1085
01:51:18,437 --> 01:51:20,496
You're ravishing.

1086
01:51:20,539 --> 01:51:24,441
Thank you.

1087
01:51:24,477 --> 01:51:27,105
Cheers.

1088
01:51:27,146 --> 01:51:30,377
My favorite sound.

1089
01:51:30,416 --> 01:51:34,182
It's not crystal now,
just glass.

1090
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:35,847
Never mind.

1091
01:51:35,888 --> 01:51:38,379
It's still champagne.

1092
01:51:38,424 --> 01:51:41,791
You look wonderful.

1093
01:51:48,234 --> 01:51:50,464
Look, they're having fun now.

1094
01:51:50,503 --> 01:51:52,767
Do it.

1095
01:51:52,805 --> 01:51:56,536
Go on.

1096
01:51:56,575 --> 01:52:00,067
I attended the opening
of the metro yesterday.

1097
01:52:00,112 --> 01:52:01,374
It's horrendous.

1098
01:52:02,715 --> 01:52:04,649
It's dark,
the seats are hard,

1099
01:52:04,683 --> 01:52:06,207
and it's so grim.

1100
01:52:06,252 --> 01:52:08,152
Everyone seemed happy.

1101
01:52:08,187 --> 01:52:10,451
Stupidly happy.

1102
01:52:10,489 --> 01:52:14,118
They loved crossing Paris
underground!

1103
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:16,822
It's appalling.

1104
01:52:18,864 --> 01:52:22,129
I walked back from Porte Maillot
to Palais Royal.

1105
01:52:22,168 --> 01:52:24,159
I thought of you.

1106
01:52:24,203 --> 01:52:26,899
What will we do without you?.

1107
01:52:26,939 --> 01:52:30,705
You'll have other experiences.

1108
01:52:30,743 --> 01:52:35,043
All the other houses
will be closing too.

1109
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:38,175
It's sad, but too bad.

1110
01:52:38,217 --> 01:52:40,742
Today love is out
on the street.

1111
01:52:40,786 --> 01:52:43,277
No one can stop that.

1112
01:52:45,958 --> 01:52:48,927
What will you do now?.

1113
01:52:48,961 --> 01:52:50,360
I don't know.

1114
01:52:50,396 --> 01:52:53,797
I'm a bit tired.

1115
01:52:57,436 --> 01:53:02,567
Promise to stay yourself,
even without L'Apollonide.

1116
01:53:02,608 --> 01:53:04,872
Keep the flowers, the music,

1117
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:06,810
the fine dresses,

1118
01:53:06,846 --> 01:53:08,973
the color, the champagne,

1119
01:53:09,014 --> 01:53:11,073
even in glass...

1120
01:53:11,117 --> 01:53:14,109
Make noise, please.
We're going to need it.

1121
01:54:37,169 --> 01:54:39,160
Have we met before?.

1122
01:54:39,205 --> 01:54:41,605
Perhaps.

1123
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:43,039
I'd remember.

1124
01:54:43,075 --> 01:54:44,838
What's your name?.

1125
01:54:44,877 --> 01:54:46,538
Madeleine.

1126
01:54:55,254 --> 01:54:56,881
A little perfume...

1127
01:55:06,432 --> 01:55:08,957
What are you like under there?.

1128
01:55:09,001 --> 01:55:10,468
However you want.

1129
01:55:10,502 --> 01:55:13,198
How do you want me to be?.

1130
01:55:13,239 --> 01:55:14,536
I don't know.

1131
01:55:14,573 --> 01:55:18,509
Aren't you asking me
what I'm like?.

1132
01:55:18,544 --> 01:55:20,978
No.

1133
01:55:47,473 --> 01:55:48,735
Léa?.

1134
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:53,810
Léa's up in a room.

1135
01:55:59,418 --> 01:56:01,147
Hear that, Simone?.

1136
01:56:01,186 --> 01:56:02,778
The fireworks?.

1137
01:56:02,821 --> 01:56:06,416
It's the fireworks!

1138
01:56:18,537 --> 01:56:20,437
Don't be scared.

1139
01:56:20,472 --> 01:56:21,837
My pretty Ninon...

1140
01:56:21,874 --> 01:56:25,833
It's Bastille Day,
but no one's beheading you.

1141
01:57:03,882 --> 01:57:06,783
It's the fireworks!

1142
01:57:06,819 --> 01:57:10,482
I want champagne.

1143
01:58:45,217 --> 01:58:46,878
Come in.

1144
01:59:22,654 --> 01:59:25,418
You really do like it.

1145
01:59:36,935 --> 01:59:38,061
I want to stop.

1146
01:59:38,103 --> 01:59:41,004
I don't like it anymore.

1147
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:44,031
I'm paying, so I decide.

1148
02:01:23,342 --> 02:01:28,006
What will you do now?.

1149
02:01:28,046 --> 02:01:31,038
I don't know.
