3
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,520
I'm so tired.
I could sleep a thousand years.

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,320
Don't worry.
You'll pick up again tonight.

5
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,000
It hasn't changed much here.

6
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,720
It has changed.

7
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,640
It changes slowly.

8
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,520
How?

9
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,400
It changes slowly.
That's all.

10
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,480
Wait.

11
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,240
I'd like to talk to you.

12
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
I'm listening.

13
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,600
Is this a proposal?

14
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,280
The jewel, is it a proposal?

15
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,960
You stare at me...

16
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,000
And seem to want to hurt me.

17
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,680
Then your face
turns normal again.

18
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,120
It's the old you.

19
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,880
You continue to stare at me.

20
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,240
And then...

21
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,960
I feel you're coming.

22
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,440
As you come between my thighs,

23
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,840
I feel your sperm rise up
within me

24
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,760
and fill me
and flow out through my eyes.

25
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,360
There are white tears,
thick ones, coating my cheeks.

26
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,960
My mouth is red,

27
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,160
and the white tears
trickle over it.

28
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,920
I don't want to wipe them away.

29
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,120
I cry so much.

30
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,720
I can't stop crying.

31
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,000
You don't have an emerald?

32
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,760
No, I don't have an emerald.

33
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,680
Maybe next time.

34
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,560
Maybe.

35
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,000
You always remember
your dreams?

36
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,360
No.

37
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,760
"HOUSE OF PLEASURES"

38
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,760
"HOUSE OF PLEASURES"

39
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,160
"November 1899"

40
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,120
"The twilight
of the 19th century"

41
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,760
Near the mirror.

42
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,280
Near the mirror, Clothilde.

43
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,520
I'll show you.

44
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,080
Pass me a hairpin?

45
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,280
Leave me some.

46
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,400
Don't worry.

47
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,360
He's nice but heavy.

48
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,440
Physically heavy too.

49
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,360
When he's on top of me,
I'm crushed.

50
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,720
I hope he hasn't given me
the clap.

51
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,560
Claptrap.

52
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,840
I hope Victor
doesn't come tonight.

53
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,320
I'm sick of him.

54
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,400
Three times in a row.
What a drag!

55
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,480
Always asking what I think
of his crooked cock,

56
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,280
before I kiss his ass.

57
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Who did you have?

58
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,720
Michaux.

59
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,480
- He's sweet on you.
- For now he is.

60
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,880
It's only been twice.

61
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,720
He doesn't want me now.

62
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,880
Do you like him?

63
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes, I like him.

64
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,120
- That's all?
- It's something.

65
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,880
You like him or you think
he could pay your debts

66
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,240
to get you out?

67
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,760
Is that a problem?

68
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,720
Maybe I have fewer debts
than you.

69
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,840
I doubt it.

70
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,480
Sir...

71
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,920
Good evening.

72
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,960
Mine doesn't work.

73
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,040
You lose!

74
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,600
There.

75
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,840
- Can we come closer?
- Of course.

76
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,160
She's very meek.

77
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,560
I call her Ninon.

78
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,440
- A female?
- Yes.

79
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,120
Show me your hands.

80
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,960
You won a point?

81
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,880
Yes, my blow got me the...

82
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,200
Doctor, you've lost.

83
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,120
- You have to drink.
- I've lost?

84
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,880
See you later.

85
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,880
I just finished
an amazing English novel,

86
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,120
full of aliens and Martians...

87
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,680
who invade Earth using rays
and chemical weapons.

88
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
They're very powerful

89
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,280
and easily eliminate
human beings.

90
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,080
They devastate the cities...

91
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,160
But not being immune
to human diseases,

92
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,760
they end up dying.

93
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
The story is told
by a journalist

94
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,440
who escapes the first attacks

95
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,320
and who seeks his wife
in a deserted land.

96
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,240
Idiotic but pure genius.

97
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,560
Have you read it?

98
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,760
No, my only books are
Sade's diaries and the Bible.

99
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,840
And I haven't read the Bible.

100
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,480
Samira, Louis's glass is empty.

101
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,560
I had this letter today.

102
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,320
Shall I read it?

103
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,320
"Madame,

104
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,560
"Having heard of L'Apollonide

105
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,960
"and keen to enter your house,
I hereby offer myself.

106
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,480
"I'm 1 5 and a half.

107
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,320
"I'm pretty, with nice hair
and fine teeth,

108
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,160
"shapely, with very white skin
and not a blemish on my body,

109
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,000
"and if you want to send someone
from Paris to check

110
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,320
"if the details I mention
are correct.

111
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,160
"l have a kind heart,
and I shall be obedient.

112
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,600
"lf I prove suitable,

113
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,320
"you may send someone
to fetch me

114
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,280
"and bring me to your house.

115
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,440
Pauline Deshaies."

116
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,320
She drew a self-portrait.
She's pretty.

117
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,240
A pretty drawing
means nothing.

118
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,120
May l?

119
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Yes.

120
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,080
Very nice, Marie.

121
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,200
I'd like to be here
to welcome her.

122
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,360
She's a baby.

123
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,640
With the countess dead,

124
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,520
who'll be
the 20th century's beauty?

125
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,560
I say you are.

126
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,000
What was that?

127
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,960
The Jewess is the new beauty.

128
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
Thank you.

129
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,240
I've missed you.

130
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,040
Caca, I was here two days ago.

131
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,920
But not yesterday.

132
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,240
Where were you?

133
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,360
With my wife.

134
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,000
No!

135
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,360
The shame of it...

136
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,080
It's been two weeks.

137
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,720
I stayed in.

138
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,960
I wasn't in the mood for it.

139
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,480
And now?
Are you in the mood?

140
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,080
Very much.

141
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,560
I had an odd dream about you
last week.

142
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,480
All the girls say that.

143
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,960
I swear, it's true.

144
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,640
What was it?

145
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,800
It's rather unusual.

146
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,280
Want to tell me upstairs?

147
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,160
I'd like that.

148
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,840
Get drinks and come to the room
with black curtains.

149
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,960
What are you doing?

150
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,360
It's a gift.

151
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm so tired.
I could sleep a thousand years.

152
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,840
Don't worry.
You'll pick up again tonight.

153
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,640
Give me a glass?

154
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,120
- Which one?
- I don't mind.

155
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,280
Got any antiseptic soap?

156
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,200
I can't afford any.

157
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,760
- And you?
- You're a pain.

158
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,600
I'll lend you some,
but buy your own.

159
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,840
Thank you.

160
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,600
Clothilde?

161
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,400
Can you help me?

162
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,160
Hold this.

163
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,200
Thanks.

164
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,960
What are you doing?

165
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,400
It's a gift.

166
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,600
What's wrong?

167
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,040
Nothing's wrong.

168
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,360
No one knows
what you're thinking.

169
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,280
I don't think anything.

170
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,800
She's nearly done.

171
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,240
Send her to me after.

172
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,200
She's as pretty
as a blazing flower.

173
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,520
My fingers must be cursed...

174
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,520
The sound of the sirens...

175
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,720
I start to undress.

176
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,960
And you put a box down
on the bed.

177
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,680
A tiny box.

178
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,480
I open it.

179
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,920
There's an emerald inside.

180
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,560
You still say nothing,
so I'm convinced that...

181
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,040
Well, I ask if it's a proposal.

182
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,080
You don't reply.

183
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,240
That's it then.

184
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Loubet has pardoned Dreyfus
at last.

185
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,960
If the talk turns to Dreyfus,
I'm going up.

186
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,040
Come on.

187
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,480
Let's go up.

188
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,360
With pleasure.

189
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,280
Shall we have commerce?

190
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,880
I'd love to.

191
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,800
You always remember
your dreams?

192
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,640
I want to tie you up.
May l?

193
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,320
Yes, you may.

194
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,960
He's envious of everything.

195
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,160
I'm happy with you.

196
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,640
Vuitton...

197
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,920
Vuitton...

198
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,480
What?

199
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,080
Vuitton?

200
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,120
I love saying that name.

201
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,160
He's a genius.

202
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,080
Vuitton.

203
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,240
I love this song.

204
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,200
"March 1900"

205
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,800
"The dawn of the 20th century"

206
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,280
Spread your thighs.

207
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,360
- Go on, spread them.
- No!

208
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,000
I need to see inside your sex
to paint you.

209
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,240
Even to do your face.

210
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,080
It's very important.

211
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,720
Men never look into
the sex of women enough.

212
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,680
There...

213
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,600
I'm beginning to see
the picture.

214
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,720
I have the impression
I've painted your face 40 times.

215
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,400
This face...

216
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,280
This face...

217
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,000
You smell nice.

218
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,520
Jicky by Guerlain.

219
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,000
I know.
I loved a woman who wore it.

220
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,920
I'm not jealous.

221
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,560
How old are you?

222
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,040
Why do you ask?

223
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
So I'll know.

224
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,240
I'm 28.

225
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,320
How long have you been here?

226
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,040
1 2 years.

227
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,400
I'll leave this here.

228
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,280
It's for you.

229
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,760
I really have to go.

230
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,000
It moved!

231
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,400
It moved!

232
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,120
Even with two
I lose.

233
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,120
It's pathetic!

234
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,320
How are you, children?

235
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,320
Say hello to Pauline.

236
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,520
Okay, girls?
Met Pauline?

237
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,440
We saw her earlier.

238
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,440
Chinese arm lock!

239
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,920
You didn't get me.

240
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,720
Where are you off to?

241
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Maurice is taking me out
for the afternoon.

242
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Lucky you.
I want to go out too.

243
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,480
Hello.

244
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,720
Caca...

245
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,080
Julie, please.

246
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,040
- My name's Julie.
- Everyone calls her Caca.

247
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,760
My name's Julie.

248
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,400
What are you doing
with my doll?

249
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,680
Don't touch it!

250
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,120
You are pretty.

251
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,040
You went for your permit?

252
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes, before I came here.

253
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,920
They examined you?

254
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm perfectly healthy.

255
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,480
Any scars?

256
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,040
No.

257
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Your breasts...

258
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,360
- Are they firm?
- Very.

259
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,400
- Even without a corset?
- They're firm.

260
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,080
All right.

261
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,880
- You have your permit?
- Yes, I told you.

262
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,320
My papers are in order.

263
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,720
Undress, please.

264
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,360
- Now?
- Yes, get used to it.

265
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,240
You're not here to make jam.

266
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,480
- How old are you now?
- 1 6.

267
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,400
I have a letter from my parents.

268
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,600
Do you speak well?

269
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,160
- You're polite?
- Yes, I've been taught.

270
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
- Can you read?
- Yes.

271
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,400
- And write?
- Yes.

272
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,680
Go on.

273
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,760
Turn round.

274
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,520
Nice buttocks.

275
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,920
- Nice breasts.
- I'm young.

276
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,080
You mustn't slim.

277
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,000
Can you let your hair down?

278
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,000
- Your voice...
- What about it?

279
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,440
It's a bit weak.

280
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,760
- I can try harder.
- Try.

281
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,640
- I'll manage it.
- Show me.

282
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,920
If I say I'll manage it,
I will.

283
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
This isn't a knocking shop.

284
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,320
I know.

285
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,360
That's why I wrote to you.

286
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,480
If you don't fit in,
I can't keep you.

287
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,400
You learn the job as you go.
It's not easy.

288
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,480
Can I get dressed now?

289
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,120
You have a nickname?

290
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,000
La Petite.
Will that do?

291
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,320
Do you have a lover?

292
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,200
No lover.

293
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,320
Are you a virgin?

294
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,080
Tell me.
It's not a problem.

295
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,200
I can check.

296
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,400
- Are you a virgin?
- No.

297
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,160
Why choose this place?

298
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,400
To be independent.
To be free.

299
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,760
To be free?
In a house of tolerance?

300
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,720
Freedom's outside, not here.

301
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,560
To earn money of my own.

302
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,480
Do you want to marry?

303
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,200
- No.
- Why are you lying?

304
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,120
Don't fool yourself.

305
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,080
A man rarely marries
a prostitute.

306
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,960
We all live together.

307
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,720
We're always together.

308
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,400
We're nice to each other,
respect each other.

309
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,400
All right?

310
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,400
We share beds.

311
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,280
You can sleep here.

312
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,200
There's room with Clothilde.

313
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,000
You stay until the clients go,

314
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,360
but get up when you want.

315
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,280
When you get up,
go down to the dining room.

316
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,000
You never go out alone.

317
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,680
Only with Madame or a man.

318
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,560
If you're alone outside,
that's soliciting.

319
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,720
At around 4:00, we wash.

320
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,880
We have to be clean.
Very clean.

321
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,640
Smell nice. Clean hair.

322
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,480
Soap your body and hair daily
and rub down with cologne.

323
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,280
Often we do it in pairs.

324
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,440
I wash you, you wash me...

325
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,040
I'll show you the creams.

326
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,920
A hairdresser comes at 6:00.

327
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,800
He can curl your hair,
dye it and so on.

328
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,080
You don't pay him.
Madame does.

329
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,120
If a client likes your hair
one particular way,

330
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,520
don't change it too often.

331
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,680
Come on.

332
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,840
If a client says you smell
or you're dirty,

333
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,440
Madame will fine you.

334
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,120
It'll only increase your debts.

335
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,520
So wash yourself.

336
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,120
We all buy our own perfume.

337
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,680
You don't use another girl's.
You buy your own.

338
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,480
After each client,

339
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,680
rinse your mouth with water
and a few drops of mouthwash.

340
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,560
It's strong, but it works.

341
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,160
- My name's Léa.
- Pauline.

342
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,120
I know.

343
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,240
Welcome.

344
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,400
When the client undresses,
discreetly check his cock.

345
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,600
Check for sores or spots.

346
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,040
Check his body for rashes too.

347
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,120
Any doubts, don't have sex.

348
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,840
After each job,
wash your lips,

349
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,200
rinse and rub them
with cologne.

350
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,240
Ever used it?

351
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,760
No.

352
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,280
It stings,
but that's normal.

353
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,160
When you get to the room,
what do you do?

354
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,920
- Talk?
- Yes, you talk.

355
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,240
You chat a little.

356
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,120
They might talk
about themselves.

357
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,720
You have another drink.

358
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,680
It helps.

359
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,480
Find out what he's like
and adapt.

360
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,360
After a while,
you get the same ones.

361
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,200
Just arouse them
and make them come.

362
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,920
But fake it during sex.

363
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,840
- Why?
- Because.

364
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,720
That's how we do it.

365
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,480
Hello.

366
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,600
Pauline.

367
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,360
Madeleine.

368
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,120
This is for you.

369
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,080
What's that?

370
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,680
A wine stain.
I can't get it out.

371
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,280
Let me see.

372
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,400
I'll wear it anyway.

373
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,280
The old woman will only add it
to my debts.

374
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
- Tighter.
- Don't move.

375
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
Looking for wrinkles?

376
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,960
Let me see.

377
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,320
No, you're fine.

378
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,240
Just a few around the eyes.

379
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,120
That's okay.

380
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,040
You don't have one.

381
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,920
They'll come.

382
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,160
Want to try?

383
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,920
It helps with love.

384
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,600
Good evening.

385
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,520
I'm Jacques.

386
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,400
I follow you?

387
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,720
Did Madame buy you
from another house or not?

388
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,800
No.

389
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,280
You have no debts then.

390
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,520
- What were you before?
- A seamstress.

391
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,920
I was a laundress.

392
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,480
It was torture, believe me.

393
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,200
My lungs are full of ammonia.

394
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,280
What did you do before?

395
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,160
Me?
I did nothing special.

396
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,800
You're from the bourgeoisie?

397
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,880
The petty bourgeoisie.
Very petty.

398
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,800
- You have no debts then.
- We all have debts.

399
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,920
You work to pay them off.

400
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,360
In your dreams.

401
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,400
She makes sure you never pay
them off and leave.

402
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,640
Even with a lot of clients,
you always need perfume...

403
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,720
Go easy on that stuff.

404
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,400
But, Madame,
Mondays are quiet.

405
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,320
- It helps us relax.
- It won't be quiet for long.

406
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,240
Come on, up you get.

407
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,680
He's a new one.

408
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,560
- Are you all right?
- Yes, fine.

409
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,520
That's good.
Very good.

410
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,920
Just...

411
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,320
Michaux could pay off
your debts.

412
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,400
If he does, I'll marry him.

413
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,880
The tall girl is popular.

414
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,680
Next to her, the Algerian.

415
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,440
Samira.

416
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,040
That young one there is 15.
She's a virgin.

417
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,600
I can send for a boy too.

418
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,120
19, very pretty.

419
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,560
He can be here in an hour.

420
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,360
I need to think about it.

421
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,840
- Do you like champagne?
- Not really.

422
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,920
But he loves it.

423
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,960
Come on.

424
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,840
It's cold.

425
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,840
You'll get used to it.

426
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,400
You'll see, it's delicious.

427
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,360
Very nice.

428
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,360
It's wonderful here.

429
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,280
You see girls without corsets...

430
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,000
Léa...

431
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,920
- Someone for you.
- Who is it?

432
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,680
Victor.

433
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,560
Hurry up now.
He's in the blue room.

434
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,600
Michaux will be in at one.
Try to see someone else first.

435
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,040
When Pauline finishes,
check it went well.

436
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,640
Why me?

437
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,280
So shall we have commerce?

438
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,000
- No, not today.
- Why not?

439
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,440
Because.

440
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,680
Pity.

441
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,640
Who did Charles go with?

442
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,960
Léa.

443
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,440
She milked the first one?

444
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,400
That other guy...

445
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,400
Who did he go with?

446
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,800
No idea.

447
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,680
Won't you sit down?

448
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,880
Can you lift your veil?

449
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,120
What's your name?

450
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,800
- The Jewess.
- No. Your real name.

451
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,680
Madeleine.

452
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,400
I'm Jacques.

453
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,560
Why did you come up?

454
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,440
I paid for the night.

455
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,640
- Does that hurt?
- No.

456
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,720
How did it happen?

457
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,320
You don't have to tell me.

458
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,400
It was a man...

459
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,400
A man I knew well.

460
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,080
We were in one of the rooms.

461
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,120
He asked
if he could tie me up.

462
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,560
I said he could.

463
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,320
I played along.

464
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,400
And that was that.

465
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,720
No one ever comes to see you?

466
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,280
No.

467
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,000
So what do you do here?

468
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,960
I make the beds.

469
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,200
I help in the kitchen.

470
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,960
I help in the laundry.

471
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,040
I look after the girls.

472
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,800
- Does she hide you?
- No.

473
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,640
Why are you asking me all this?

474
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,720
I don't know.

475
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,640
Didn't you want to have
a normal life?

476
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,920
Outside.

477
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,200
You could find a job.

478
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,800
I can help if you want.

479
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,160
I don't know.

480
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,360
Do you want to make love or not?

481
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,200
I don't want to talk anymore.

482
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,080
Vuitton...

483
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,920
- Thank you again.
- My pleasure.

484
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,160
I'll get my animal.

485
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,920
I adore her.

486
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,800
I've never had her.

487
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,400
When she goes off you,
you get this.

488
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,600
Pussy fur?

489
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,280
Who were you with?

490
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,160
My Julie.

491
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,960
Caca.

492
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,120
How many?

493
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,760
Four.
You?

494
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,520
Six.

495
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,880
Five.

496
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,200
Three.

497
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,760
I'll never get out of here.

498
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,000
Okay?

499
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,840
This shit is sticky...

500
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,560
Let me help.

501
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,720
What's this?

502
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,880
It's not easy in a bathtub
but I'm okay.

503
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,920
- Want some ointment?
- I'm okay.

504
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,440
Did it go well?

505
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,400
I think so.

506
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,720
How do I clean the sperm
with the sponge?

507
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,760
Use this cream and rub gently.

508
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,680
It stings but that's normal.

509
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,120
It's so depressing.

510
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,000
It'll be dawn soon.

511
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,960
I've drunk too much.

512
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,080
Thank you.

513
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,320
80.

514
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,160
"Mr. Prefect,

515
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,760
"l am a widow

516
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,440

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,080
"finding a trade other than

00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,800

"Allow me the consolation

537
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,520
Marie-France Dallaire."

538
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,480
It reeks of sperm
and champagne here.

539
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,040
Why do they call you Caca?

540
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,480
Why do they
call you Caca?

541
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,320
Why am I Long Hair?

542
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,280
Let's just say...

543
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,920
I have a specialty.

544
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,960
I get the picture.

545
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,600
Want to know anyway?

546
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,280
Julie, we're eating!

547
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,480
Why?

548
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,400
Don't spoil it.

549
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,200
Does it still hurt?

550
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,320
Only a little at night now.

551
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,720
- Did Madame make you?
- No.

552
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,120
She asked me.

553
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,120
And?

554
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,880
He paid for the night,
but didn't want sex.

555
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,280
Why not?

556
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,800
Probably just to see
the monster close up.

557
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,400
He was sweet.

558
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,560
He said he'd come back
next week.

559
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,840
But I don't believe him.

560
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,680
Want to check in the cards?

561
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,960
No, it's okay.

562
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,160
Last night was
a real freak show.

563
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,920
I had one...

564
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,160
He keeps going to confession

565
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,800
to talk filth
to get the priest hard.

566
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,240
He wanks off at the same time.

567
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,680
That's sick!

568
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,400
I'd like to see
a brothel for women.

569
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,320
A great place with great men
who are hard all the time

570
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,600
and tell us we're pretty,

571
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,400
even if we're old
with saggy tits.

572
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,880
We'd never ask
the stupid questions they do.

573
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,360
Do you like my tits?

574
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,640
Do you like my big tits?

575
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,720
What's "whore" in Arabic?

576
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,840
"Zaniya"...

577
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,560
or "Qahba,"
depending how polite you are.

578
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,280
What's the polite one?

579
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,480
"Zaniya," the kept woman.

580
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,840
I don't mind being
a kept woman.

581
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,360
Is Maurice going to propose?

582
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,440
Perhaps.

583
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,680
If his wife dies.

584
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,240
Are you in love?

585
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,360
No.

586
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,800
But he's sweet.

587
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,840
The other day,

588
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,360
we went to the Wepler
for oysters.

589
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,760
Then we went dancing.

590
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,280
Know what I told him?

591
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,320
"l would pluck out my eyes
for you

592
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,480
"so you'd have more holes

593
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,680
to make love to me."

594
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,000
He loved that!

595
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,760
Is this only for Madeleine?

596
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,280
No, for all of us.

597
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,560
Four show the past,

598
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,400
four the present
and four the future.

599
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,320
No, it's all right.

600
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,280
That's the good spade card.

601
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,440
It means stability, luck,
security...

602
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,560
The nine of clubs
means a job, a situation.

603
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,440
The Queen is a kind woman.

604
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,080
There's a young man, single.

605
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,000
He's next to a diamond card.

606
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,440
There's a romantic project,
but it's upside down.

607
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,440
That means there's a problem.

608
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,400
A girl with long hair.

609
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,400
She's upside down too.

610
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,800
You have to be wary of her.

611
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,840
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

612
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,640
That it's upside down.

613
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,480
It's in relation
to the dealer.

614
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,600
They're only cards.

615
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,240
If you draw them,
they're more than that.

616
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,360
You're a bit of a mystic?

617
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,280
I want to stop.

618
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,160
We've started, let's finish.

619
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,320
Come on, the future.

620
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,440
What did they call you before?

621
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,960
The Jewess.

622
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,440
Which is the worst one?

623
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,000
The ten.

624
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,120
Do you like that?

625
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,760
Yes.

626
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,680
What do you want?

627
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,360
To see the Woman Who Laughs.

628
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,440
For sex or just to see her?

629
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,680
To see her first,
then decide.

630
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,320
Inside a room,
you do as you like,

631
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,440
but you see girls here for sex,
the normal way.

632
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,120
I'd like Léa as a doll then.

633
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,520
Come here.

634
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,680
You smell nice, my doll.

635
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,080
Who did you have?

636
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,680
Simon.
And you?

637
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,960
Louis.

638
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,440
Julie, no!

639
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,600
Help me!
Julie!

640
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,360
I want the peach.

641
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,680
Well?

642
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,240
I'll get you!
You have to strip right now.

643
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,640
Catch.

644
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:08,320
Marie-France, where do
the clients get their money?

645
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,800
In industry, textiles,
paper...

646
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,280
Family fortunes too.

647
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:15,040
Fortunes of the aristocracy.

648
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,440
Are there a lot
of aristocrats?

649
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,040
Yes.

650
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,960
We get a lot of aristocrats.

651
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,040
What does Louis work in?

652
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,480
Louis is in textiles.

653
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,480
He made his fortune
in textiles.

654
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,040
Michaux has a family fortune.

655
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:33,240
Charles is a family fortune too.

656
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,240
Who's the richest one?

657
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:39,360
The richest one?

658
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,400
Charles.

659
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,920
He doesn't spend the most,
but he's the richest one.

660
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,560
Has he been coming long?

661
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,960
Yes, since the days
when I worked at L'Apollonide

662
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,120
Iike you do.

663
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,520
My back hurts.

664
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,640
I'm sick of his doll thing.

665
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,360
Don't complain.
There's worse.

666
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,560
I'm not saying that,
just that I'm sick of it.

667
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,560
You do as you want.

668
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,600
You get rid of creeps
with a few pussy hairs.

669
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,960
My whole bush wouldn't do that!

670
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:49,560
It feels like an eternity
since we had a day out.

671
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,600
It's me.

672
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,120
Give me your cigarette.

673
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,320
All right.

674
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,680
What is it?

675
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,680
I was thinking a Lanvin hat
would suit you.

676
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,520
Go on then, Polo.

677
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,280
Treat me to a hat.

678
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,640
The fresh air loosens you up.

679
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,560
Want a drop of champagne?

680
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,840
Please.

681
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,200
Want some too?

682
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,600
Yeah, okay.

683
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,600
Gently!

684
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,160
Sorry.

685
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,440
Pardon me.

686
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,520
It slipped out.

687
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,120
Calm down, Polo.

688
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,240
Oh, you know...

689
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:41,280
I'm sorry, it's old age.

690
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,520
This is nice.

691
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,600
Oh, yes!

692
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,280
I feel so good!

693
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,000
I don't think
I'll be here long.

694
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,720
I said that too.

695
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,160
Now look at me.

696
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,200
We'll see.

697
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,480
I don't have any debts yet.

698
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,240
We'll see.

699
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,440
"l understand
your sense of injustice,

700
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,200
"and I've always given you
my support.

701
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,200
"But, as a prefect,
I can't work miracles.

702
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:22,000
I cannot oppose
a landlord's decision."

703
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:25,120
Good evening.

704
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,520
Who's here this evening?

705
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,280
The same ones.

706
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,520
- Still want to see the Jewess?
- Pardon me?

707
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:36,400
The Woman Who Laughs.
Want to go up to see her?

708
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,920
You can,
but it'll cost you more.

709
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,120
No.
I was a bit tipsy last time.

710
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,320
Who else is there?

711
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,480
Who else...

712
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,760
Sweetness, Cléa, Climbing Rose,
Fine Thigh...

713
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,400
Afterwards, women couldn't
compete in the games.

714
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,560
Why not?

715
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,880
Good question.

716
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,880
They were thrown from a rock
if ever they went there.

717
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,920
But now they can go.

718
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,680
They couldn't go
because the athletes were nude.

719
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,480
Now they're dressed.

720
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,400
So women can take part.

721
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,760
Will you go up with me
and another girl?

722
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,680
Who?

723
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,480
Anyone.
You choose.

724
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,200
I don't know.

725
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,280
I'd rather go alone
if you don't mind.

726
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,680
Shall I put you in my will?

727
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,680
Do you want to be in my will?

728
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,840
No.

729
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,880
I want you to stay alive.

730
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,480
If anyone here is alive,

731
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,880
I am.

732
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,520
Good evening.

733
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,800
Ah, Louis!

734
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:42,720
A drink
or shall I call Samira?

735
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,480
Both.

736
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:53,200
"l understand
your sense of injustice,

737
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,920
"and I've always given you
my support.

738
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,680
But, as a prefect,
I can't work miracles."

739
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,920
Thank you.

740
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,280
Some women
have very large breasts.

741
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,840
They could have an accident,
knock themselves out...

742
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,280
Yes, that's true.

743
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,960
They could bandage them.

744
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,120
It's not so much fun.

745
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:45,240
Fine Thigh.

746
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,320
Fine Thigh...

747
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,680
Clothed or naked?

748
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,880
I prefer you naked.

749
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,600
- It costs more.
- I know.

750
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,320
Talk to me in Japanese.

751
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,480
Go on, make it up.

752
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,840
Make it up.

753
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:13,000
More.

754
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,680
What does that mean?

755
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:42,680
It means my tongue
comes towards you.

756
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,480
Slowly.
It slithers across the floor.

757
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,400
It slips under the bed.

758
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,880
It rises up the side of it.

759
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,840
It reaches your feet.

760
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,640
It licks them.

761
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,960
It glides up along your leg.

762
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,960
Along your thigh.

763
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,080
It reaches your sex.

764
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,120
It winds around it.

765
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,400
It swallows it completely.

766
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,120
Sword swallower.

767
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,160
Your Japanese is very good.

768
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,000
Do you want some?

769
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,160
You don't have to smoke it.

770
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,520
You can take a bit and eat it.

771
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,960
It's okay, I know.

772
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,040
I want to see you often.

773
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,760
Won't Clothilde
be angry with me?

774
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,520
I can see more than one girl.

775
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,200
Now stop asking questions
and talk to me in Japanese.

776
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,560
You're very young.

777
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,640
Not that young.

778
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,600
Really?

779
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:38,000
Not many girls my age
have been fucked in champagne.

780
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,840
Did you like it?

781
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,600
I loved it.

782
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,400
Men never look into the sex
of women enough.

783
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,400
Wonderful.

784
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,640
After one night with you,
I could kill myself.

785
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,600
Say "Ah."

786
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,720
Good.

787
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,920
What's that spot?

788
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,160
Nothing.

789
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,800
Have you had it long?

790
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,680
It's nothing.

791
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,760
All right.

792
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,760
One month? Two?

793
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,160
No, a few days.

794
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,040
All right.

795
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,520
Any itching?

796
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,440
No.

797
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,160
- No new rashes on your body?
- No.

798
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,440
Let me take a look.

799
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,280
Let me see.

800
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,800
Lie down now
and let me examine you.

801
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:30,240
Let me see.

802
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,320
Nothing around the anus.

803
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,240
I'll use the speculum now.

804
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:54,080
If ever I get out of here,
I'll never make love again.

805
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,800
- No...
- Yes.

806
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,880
I have to examine you.

807
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,880
You have to lie down.

808
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,000
- No!
- I have to examine you.

809
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,640
I have to.

810
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:05,960
Come on.

811
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,400
Now spread your thighs.

812
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,440
No two ways about it.

813
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:13,000
I can't see your sex otherwise.
Come on now.

814
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,160
Look at me.

815
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,880
You have to lie down.

816
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,280
Lie down and spread your thighs.
You have to do it.

817
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,040
The cervix is fine.

818
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,200
Heavy but normal discharge.

819
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,680
How about your period?

820
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,200
It comes and goes.

821
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,120
When did you last have it?
Two months ago?

822
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,160
Three?

823
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,080
Not long ago.
I forget.

824
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,880
Six months?

825
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,680
You don't have your period
anymore?

826
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,880
I'm not pregnant.

827
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:51,720
Six months...

828
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,040
I just don't have my period
anymore.

829
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,240
How about your period?

830
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,280
Same thing.

831
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,280
It comes and goes.

832
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,840
And you?

833
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,880
Normal.

834
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,560
And you there?

835
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,200
Mine's fine.

836
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,840
Let me examine you.

837
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,480
Lie down.

838
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:29,040
- Okay?
- Yes, I'm healthy.

839
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,600
Well?

840
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,320
I'm fine.
I'm healthy.

841
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,240
And the others?

842
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,520
I don't know.

843
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,680
I swear...

844
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,840
What am I supposed to do now?

845
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,280
You think they're not pregnant?

846
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,360
No, I'm sure.

847
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,480
But, I'm sorry,
that girl there has syphilis.

848
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,240
- It's okay. I accept it.
- Bravo.

849
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,200
I'd just like someone
to give me a hug.

850
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,480
I want a macaroon.

851
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,240
What a shit job.

852
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,680
Fucking is a fuck awful job.

853
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:42,040
It won't be easy tonight.

854
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,600
No.

855
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:46,440
Have you seen my bracelet?

856
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,120
- Which one?
- The pearl one.

857
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,200
I think I saw it in the box.

858
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:04,880
I put a charm on her doll.

859
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,160
I got a needle and...

860
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,080
It's not your fault, Samira.

861
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,760
It could have been me or you.

862
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,600
It's the clap.

863
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,080
Samira, go down.
Louis will be here soon.

864
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,800
Madame...

865
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,120
I have my period.

866
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,040
We're too busy.

867
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,520
- Take a cold bath.
- Please...

868
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,600
I can't.

869
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:31,280
I'm already one girl short
as it is.

870
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,320
You'll have to work more.

871
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,720
Yes, Madame.

872
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,400
And try to show
a little joy tonight.

873
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,280
All right?

874
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,360
Tonight,
just pretend I'm dead.

875
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,520
You really have a tiny head.

876
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,240
So?

877
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,160
A tiny head is pretty,
isn't it?

878
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:11,120
It's very pretty.
Charming.

879
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,880
You have a tiny head too.

880
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,160
I'm sorry?

881
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,480
The size of your head...

882
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,640
My head is fine and delicate.

883
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,200
I knew it.

884
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:26,320
A woman called Pauline Tarnowsky
has written a scientific study

885
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,000
on prostitutes.

886
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:31,200
She says their heads are smaller
than average.

887
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,680
The same is true of criminals.

888
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,360
Really?

889
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,920
I can lend it to you
if you want.

890
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,600
If it's good.

891
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:42,360
It's very good.

892
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:57,120
Right now, a normal girl
goes for 300.

893
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,760
400 for a Negress.

894
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,960
- Plus the debts.
- I can't.

895
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,560
Even to keep Julie
without working, I can't.

896
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,320
Paris is too expensive now.

897
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:15,560
I have a friend
who organizes special evenings.

898
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,800
The Woman Who Laughs
interests him.

899
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,960
I want to pay off your debts.

900
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,080
Five times six.

901
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,160
Eight...

902
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,920
- 30...40.
- 40.

903
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,560
Here you are.

904
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,200
Five times seven?

905
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:12,000
No, five times nine.

906
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,400
What time is it?

907
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,800
It's only 8:00.
Go to bed.

908
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,680
You'll look like hell tonight.

909
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,200
Five times nine?

910
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,240
You're still here?

911
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,200
Will you sleep with me?

912
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:30,320
No.

913
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,960
It's too late now.

914
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,080
Or too early.

915
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,040
I didn't mean sex.
Just sleeping.

916
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,920
I don't want to go home.
I feel bad.

917
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:45,480
Just sleep then?

918
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,880
At 8:00 a.m.,

919
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,640
there's no more commerce.

920
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,560
You can lie
between Samira and me.

921
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,160
I promise.

922
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,720
I'll be fine between you.

923
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,160
Léa, go to bed.

924
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,840
Sorry.

925
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,200
Good night.

926
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:07,400
I can't bring myself
to go home.

927
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,840
- Where's Pauline?
- She's asleep by now.

928
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:14,080
Who with?

929
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:17,320
Do you mind
if I stay here awhile?

930
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,120
If I go home,
I'll be a wreck.

931
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,720
You've gone off Clothilde?

932
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,880
I don't know.

933
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,360
I adore her, but...

934
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,800
we don't have fun.

935
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,040
I make her sad.

936
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,880
But I'm very fond of her.

937
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,840
I love whores.

938
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:37,000
I find them wonderful.
They move me.

939
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,880
I'm happy with them.
Terrible, isn't it?

940
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,760
I understand.

941
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,720
I understand you.

942
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,320
It's occupied.

943
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:27,360
"Anthropometric Study
of Prostitutes and Thieves"

944
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:30,520
"Pauline Tarnowsky - 1 889"

945
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,840
Spread your legs.

946
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,640
So I can see you.

947
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,520
Tighter.

948
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,160
My geisha...

949
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:41,200
"The prostitute
is a female criminal.

950
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:48,120
"We observe an encephalon
several millimeters smaller,

951
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,880
"due to the fact

952
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,720
"that prostitutes
have smaller heads.

953
01:28:53,720 --> 01:29:00,400
"Consequently, this means they
have much less brain matter.

954
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:03,640
"Their weak intelligence

955
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,960
"and mental abnormality
is natural.

956
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,120
"The dull spirit of some
can become stupor in others

957
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:16,560
and even attain
a state verging on idiocy."

958
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:25,040
Get up, Clothilde.

959
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,800
- I'm fine here.
- You are?

960
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:33,160
Stupefied, you're fine?

961
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,480
You'll end up
in a Marseille brothel

962
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,760
turning tricks
on a vermin-ridden mattress.

963
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,120
No.

964
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,760
Know what I'm going to do?

965
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,160
I'll sell myself

966
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,160
to another house.

967
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:55,000
For a high price,
so I can pay off my debts.

968
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,760
Of course.

969
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:01,080
No one will want your debts.

970
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,640
Well, I'll sell my teeth.

971
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,120
A Marseille brothel,
with the clap.

972
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:12,040
Great.
Fine.

973
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:16,080
We deserve the clap.

974
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:18,440
We deserve our punishment.

975
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,240
I've been here 1 2 years.

976
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:25,040
The clap will be a nice break.

977
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,160
Be brave.

978
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,440
Good-bye.

979
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:56,440
My dear Julie...

980
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,800
my little Caca...

981
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,440
it hurts me to write this

982
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,800
because it will hurt you
to read it.

983
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:07,320
You're ill, my little Julie,

984
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,960
and I wish I was there
to comfort you.

985
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,840
But there are things
I must say.

986
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:22,000
Don't think I'm abandoning you.

987
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:25,440
I'd never abandon someone
I cherish as much as you

988
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:28,760
after all these months.

989
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:32,480
But I must tell you this.

990
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,680
Our relations must change.

991
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,680
I don't want to catch
your disease.

992
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,920
I never hesitate
to sacrifice myself,

993
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:45,200
but now that sacrifice
would hurt me and not help you.

994
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:53,080
You know I cannot pursue
your disease.

995
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,480
I think I have eluded it
as I have no symptoms,

996
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:00,720
but I'm not safe yet.

997
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,920
I have to wait two more weeks.

998
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:09,360
Julie, if I were ill,
I would forgive you.

999
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:13,080
But no one in my family
has ever had such diseases,

1000
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:16,240
and I wouldn't like
to infect others.

1001
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,040
Men have secrets
but no mystery,

1002
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:22,440
and I'm so sorry,
my little Julie.

1003
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,880
I still love you,

1004
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:29,360
even more now
because you're ill.

1005
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:33,760
Your loving friend, Maurice.

1006
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,560
"Men...

1007
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,920
"Men have secrets
but no mystery,

1008
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,040
"and I'm so sorry,
my little Julie.

1009
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,280
"l still love you,

1010
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,720
"even more now
because you're ill.

1011
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,680
Your loving friend, Maurice."

1012
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,120
Where was it?

1013
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,200
In the mail.

1014
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:49,640
Tear it up.

1015
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:50,880
She mustn't read it.

1016
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
That's really sick.

1017
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,800
I can keep her
because he's still paying.

1018
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,840
Even if he no longer sees her.

1019
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,440
Any news of Pauline?

1020
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,760
No.

1021
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,200
Is the house closing down?

1022
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,680
I don't know.

1023
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:23,800
Does it suit me?

1024
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,440
It's funny.
She looks like an old doll.

1025
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,120
No, she's too thin.

1026
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,960
She's like a big puppet.

1027
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,720
But I like her breasts.

1028
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,600
Pinch her nipples

1029
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:50,480
to see
if she stops smiling.

1030
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:25,840
Has Pauline left,
or did something happen to her?

1031
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:29,160
Could Madame have sold her
without saying?

1032
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:31,560
Will she sell us one by one?

1033
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:40,120
Will she sell us one by one?

1034
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:42,680
I don't know.

1035
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:48,280
God only knows
where we'll end up.

1036
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:52,240
Maybe in some seedy brothel,
with revolting clients.

1037
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,120
Especially past 25.

1038
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,280
Looking at the freak?

1039
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,720
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.

1040
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,880
You too.

1041
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,640
I don't want to die.

1042
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:45,520
You're not going to.
I promise.

1043
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,640
I want to see Maurice.

1044
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,600
He's going to come.
Soon.

1045
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:22,000
I feel your sperm fill me up

1046
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:23,600
and flow out through my eyes.

1047
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:29,040
There are white tears,
thick ones, coating my cheeks.

1048
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:31,320
My mouth is red,

1049
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:35,240
and the white tears
trickle over it.

1050
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,720
I don't want to wipe them away.

1051
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:38,800
I cry so much...

1052
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:40,920
I can't stop crying.

1053
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,920
You don't have an emerald?

1054
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,680
No, I don't have one.

1055
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,760
I want to tie you up.
May l?

1056
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:53,960
Shh.

1057
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:18,720
You were on the floor.

1058
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:22,520
I picked you up.

1059
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,240
Thank you.

1060
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:35,200
You said something
in your sleep.

1061
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:38,920
What did I say?

1062
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,880
"lf we don't burn,

1063
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:43,160
"how will the night be lit?

1064
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:46,040
"Michaux...

1065
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,080
"my fragment...

1066
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:51,400
meteorite."

1067
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,240
I said that?

1068
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:03,360
Don't be afraid
to express your love.

1069
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:07,640
Don't be afraid.

1070
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:41,360
What's your name?

1071
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:42,960
Madeleine.

1072
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,080
No nickname?

1073
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:47,080
Just Madeleine.

1074
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,240
Long live France.

1075
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:02,520
Where will they go?

1076
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:05,520
I've sold some
to other houses.

1077
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:07,600
A man has bought Samira.

1078
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:10,960
The others will do
what they can.

1079
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,560
Enjoy them while they're here.

1080
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,600
I'm not staying.

1081
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:19,040
I'm in no mood for fun.

1082
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:21,200
I just wanted
to give you a kiss.

1083
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,560
A new Jeanne Paquin dress?

1084
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,840
Yes.

1085
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,880
You're ravishing.

1086
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:40,640
Thank you.

1087
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:43,200
Cheers.

1088
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:46,320
My favorite sound.

1089
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:50,000
It's not crystal now,
just glass.

1090
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,600
Never mind.

1091
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:54,000
It's still champagne.

1092
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:57,280
You look wonderful.

1093
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:05,600
Look, they're having fun now.

1094
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:07,800
Do it.

1095
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:11,440
Go on.

1096
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:14,800
I attended the opening
of the metro yesterday.

1097
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,080
It's horrendous.

1098
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,200
It's dark,
the seats are hard,

1099
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:20,720
and it's so grim.

1100
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:22,560
Everyone seemed happy.

1101
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:24,760
Stupidly happy.

1102
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:28,280
They loved crossing Paris
underground!

1103
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,880
It's appalling.

1104
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:35,960
I walked back from Porte Maillot
to Palais Royal.

1105
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,920
I thought of you.

1106
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:40,560
What will we do without you?

1107
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:44,200
You'll have other experiences.

1108
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:48,360
All the other houses
will be closing too.

1109
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:51,360
It's sad, but too bad.

1110
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:53,840
Today love is out
on the street.

1111
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:56,240
No one can stop that.

1112
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:01,680
What will you do now?

1113
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:03,040
I don't know.

1114
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:06,360
I'm a bit tired.

1115
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:14,760
Promise to stay yourself,
even without L'Apollonide.

1116
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,960
Keep the flowers, the music,

1117
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,840
the fine dresses,

1118
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:20,880
the color, the champagne,

1119
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:22,920
even in glass...

1120
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:25,840
Make noise, please.
We're going to need it.

1121
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,400
Have we met before?

1122
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:49,720
Perhaps.

1123
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,120
I'd remember.

1124
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:52,840
What's your name?

1125
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,480
Madeleine.

1126
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:04,400
A little perfume...

1127
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,960
What are you like under there?

1128
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,400
However you want.

1129
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:20,040
How do you want me to be?

1130
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,320
I don't know.

1131
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:25,120
Aren't you asking me
what I'm like?

1132
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:27,480
No.

1133
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,120
Léa?

1134
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,000
Léa's up in a room.

1135
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:06,000
Hear that, Simone?

1136
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:07,600
The fireworks?

1137
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:11,080
It's the fireworks!

1138
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:24,520
Don't be scared.

1139
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:25,880
My pretty Ninon...

1140
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:29,680
It's Bastille Day,
but no one's beheading you.

1141
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,960
It's the fireworks!

1142
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,520
I want champagne.

1143
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,960
Come in.

1144
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,920
You really do like it.

1145
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,040
I want to stop.

1146
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:36,880
I don't like it anymore.

1147
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:39,760
I'm paying, so I decide.

1148
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,480
What will you do now?

1149
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,400
I don't know.
