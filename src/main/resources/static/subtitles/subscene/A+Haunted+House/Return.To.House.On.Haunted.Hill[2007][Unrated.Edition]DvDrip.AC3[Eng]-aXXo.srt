1
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:30,986
Ariel, this is Sara.

2
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:33,958
How many voice mails do I have to leave
before you call back?

3
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,257
Damn it, I need to talk to you.
Please, call me ba...

4
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:56,009
Ethan, listen.
Our circulation is up 6 percent.

5
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:57,209
You want to know why?

6
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,255
Because I live on five hours' sleep and the
only man in my life is Mr. Coffee, okay?

7
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:02,652
Hang on. Hi. Thanks.

8
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:04,986
If advertisers don't like the new rates...

9
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:08,062
...then find a magazine
with bigger words and smaller pictures.

10
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:09,289
Ethan, I got to go.

11
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,729
I will talk to you about it later.

12
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:14,728
I am so glad you're here, Ariel.

13
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:18,271
Pearl Jam's manager just called,
they want to reschedule the interview.

14
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:20,500
That's exactly why
I don't date musicians.

15
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,805
Oh, and also, one more thing,
your sister called last night.

16
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,881
I will shoot her an e-mail
when I get a chance.

17
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:29,851
Not bad.
Have the article on my desk by 3:00.

18
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:33,689
Paul was hoping that you could make it
to the shoot later.

19
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,187
Really, now?

20
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:39,385
He says he wants creative input, but I think
he's looking for an excuse to see you.

21
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:41,427
I thought all photographers were gay.

22
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:44,725
Oh, well, for a gay guy,
he sure likes to stare at your ass.

23
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:57,039
Having fun?

24
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:59,973
It's a tough job,
but someone's got to do it.

25
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,045
- Hey. Oh.
- Hey. Oh, come on.

26
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,821
When faced with natural beauty,
I just can't help myself.

27
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:10,619
- Does this rap ever work with women?
- It's not a rap if it's true.

28
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:12,226
- Right.
Huh.

29
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,530
The Middle Ages were
a breeding ground for superstition.

30
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:24,304
Visions of departed souls,
angels and devils were common.

31
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,280
While the Church grew
in power and influence...

32
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,408
...another movement began to spread
across the Continent like a dark plague:

33
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,154
The cult of the demon Baphomet.

34
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:43,451
The Inquisition forced the cult members
to go underground.

35
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:46,493
And that's when the Baphomet idol
disappeared.

36
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:51,423
The statue has been lost for centuries.
I have been trying to find it for decades.

37
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:57,297
My search has taken me all across Europe
and deep into the Old World's bloody past.

38
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:02,767
Man has always been drawn
to the dark side, which is good for me.

39
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:04,936
Otherwise, I wouldn't be selling
any books today.

40
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:08,840
And after that shameless plug,
I thank you.

41
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,146
Thank you.

42
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:15,816
Woo. Yeah. Right on.

43
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:23,460
Guys, guys, please, one at a time, really.
The book's not even that good.

44
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,293
Ho, ho, ho.

45
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:32,864
So, what does a girl have to do
to get her book signed?

46
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,573
Hold it.
Oh. Okay.

47
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:39,476
Okay.

48
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,583
Dr. Hammer.

49
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,654
- Oh. Heh, heh, heh.
- Dude, can you knock?

50
00:06:46,654 --> 00:06:49,724
Someone's working hard on their Ph. D.
Fuck you, Kyle.

51
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:53,128
Cut it out, the both of you.

52
00:06:53,128 --> 00:06:54,661
What is it, Kyle?

53
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:58,065
Oh, shit, sorry.
I thought this couldn't wait.

54
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:01,668
It's about Sara Wolfe.

55
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,165
Sorry, sorry.
No, no, it's okay.

56
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:10,476
Mom, this isn't a good time.

57
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:13,976
Mom?

58
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:16,509
Mom, what's wrong?

59
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:30,966
Hey.

60
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,268
Thanks.

61
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:39,101
The neighbors found her
early this morning.

62
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,943
The cops say she shot herself.

63
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,980
I am... I am so sorry.

64
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:53,779
You know, my sister needed to talk me,
and all I could think about was work.

65
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,122
If there's anything you need, just...

66
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,557
Are you free tonight?

67
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,737
I really appreciate you coming along.
I don't think I could do this by myself.

68
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:13,432
Yeah, I am glad to help out.

69
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,809
You sure you want to do this?

70
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:22,775
You know, Sara was trying to reach me
before she died.

71
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:25,011
I need to know why.

72
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:43,905
Holy shit.

73
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,810
Isn't this the house where
all those people died a few years ago?

74
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,582
Yeah. My sister was one of the few
that made it out alive.

75
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,725
I remember seeing it on the news.

76
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:07,989
Steven Price flipped out,
went on a killing spree.

77
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:10,064
Not what happened,
according to my sister.

78
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:13,634
- What do you mean?
- Sara believed the house was haunted.

79
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:17,000
That ghosts killed Price's party guests.

80
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:19,834
Well, that's insane.

81
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:23,541
That's why we stopped talking.

82
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:30,716
Sara?

83
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:43,198
You must help them.

84
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:47,764
Hey, what...? What is it?
Are you okay? What's wrong?

85
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:52,002
- You didn't see that?
- See what?

86
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:55,603
God, I think I am losing my mind.

87
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:58,008
That's exactly
what your sister used to say.

88
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:01,516
Who are you? What are you doing here?

89
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:04,209
I am here for the same reason you are.

90
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:07,413
I want to know
what really happened to your sister.

91
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:09,782
My name is Dr. Richard Hammer.

92
00:10:09,782 --> 00:10:13,395
I teach archaeology
and medieval history at Forman College.

93
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:15,792
Your sister contacted me two weeks ago.

94
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,493
Contacted you about what?

95
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:23,161
Sara had gotten hold of
Dr. Vannacutt's journal.

96
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:25,432
Okay, I am sorry,
I still don't understand.

97
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:29,066
I have been trying to find the 
Baphomet idol... Wait, the what?

98
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,480
It's a statue
of incredible archaeological value.

99
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,616
I have been trying to find it 
for years now.

100
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:38,777
According to Dr. Vannacutt's journal,
the statue is here in Los Angeles...

101
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:41,218
...inside the hill house.

102
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:45,349
Your sister was going to come back
to the house and help me find it.

103
00:10:45,349 --> 00:10:47,189
Now I know you're full of shit.

104
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,764
Sara would never go back to that house,
she was terrified of it.

105
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:52,996
We're out of here.

106
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,532
You're right.
Sara was afraid of the house.

107
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,675
But she was ready to face her demons.

108
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:01,309
Hey, back off.

109
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,844
Ariel, do you know
what happened to Vannacutt's journal?

110
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:09,484
How should I know?
Let go of the damn door.

111
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:12,951
- Sara thought she was being followed.
- What are you talking about?

112
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:16,057
The idol is worth millions
to the right collector.

113
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:18,489
There could be other
interested parties out there.

114
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:22,459
What are you saying, someone went after
my sister for this journal?

115
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:26,456
All I am saying is, be careful.

116
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,347
Thank you.

117
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:47,552
For being you.

118
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:50,648
Hey, it's...

119
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,203
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

120
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,647
Night.

121
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:38,601
What the?

122
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:57,516
Sara, what were you up to?

123
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:04,523
The journal.

124
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:08,725
Paul?

125
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,236
- You're never going to believe this.
Ariel, don't....

126
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:17,639
Hey.

127
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,781
Let him go.

128
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:24,779
Hey.

129
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,323
- Leave her the fuck alone.
- Yeah?

130
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,820
What are you going to do?

131
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:36,462
You going to take a picture of me while
I put a fucking bullet in your head? Hmm?

132
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:40,867
Sit down.

133
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,556
Ah, yes. Your little magazine.

134
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:06,717
Wow.

135
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:09,690
You should be proud.

136
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,493
Oh.

137
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:16,269
What?
I swear, I only read it for the articles.

138
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:25,374
- Who the hell are you people?
- Well, let's just say we're art lovers.

139
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:30,114
- You're after the Baphomet statue.
- Bingo, give that girl a prize.

140
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:35,383
- You're the bastard who killed my sister.
- That's not what the police say. Not at all.

141
00:14:35,383 --> 00:14:38,425
But I must admit, the suicide note?
Oh.

142
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,356
That was inspired.

143
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:53,000
I think Helmut Newton here
has got the hots for his boss.

144
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,302
You're going to pay
for what you did to my sister.

145
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:58,002
Oh, let's not get abusive,
now, sweetheart.

146
00:14:58,002 --> 00:15:03,641
I urged your sister to cooperate.
She chose to be a bitch.

147
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:06,720
I highly suggest
you don't follow her example.

148
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,089
Let's go, kids.

149
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:15,027
Get up. Come on.

150
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:16,829
Come on.

151
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:19,661
- Get up. Come on.
What are you doing?

152
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:22,770
Looks like the two of you
are going to be joining us on a trip.

153
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,906
Why? You got what you came for.

154
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:26,769
I can't have you running
to the cops.

155
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:33,075
I seriously doubt the authorities would fall
for yet another suicide in the family.

156
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:34,408
Do you?

157
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,831
Pretty creepy, isn't it?

158
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:27,230
You know, they say that the souls
of the people who died here...

159
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,598
...apparently still haunt the house.

160
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:33,173
They also say that people who
believe in ghosts should be on Prozac.

161
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,579
I am sorry, I wasn't listening,
I was looking at your breasts.

162
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,338
Kyle.

163
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:45,917
So why is it that this can't wait
till tomorrow, again?

164
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:48,784
The journal is missing
and I am not taking any chances.

165
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:51,448
If the Baphomet idol really is here...

166
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:54,892
...you think I am going to let someone 
else walk away with the prize?

167
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,671
It will be okay.

168
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,843
You make a beautiful couple.

169
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:28,418
Wow.

170
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:35,131
This place is gnarly.

171
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:36,737
Ironic, isn't it?

172
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:38,372
Years of searching the globe...

173
00:17:38,372 --> 00:17:40,974
...when I should have been looking
in my own backyard.

174
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,775
Uh, question.

175
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,243
What?

176
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:48,975
How does a medieval artifact end up
in Vannacutt's loony bin, anyway?

177
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:52,314
Vannacutt was a big art collector,
traveled all across the world.

178
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:54,752
He believed art could be therapeutic.

179
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:57,858
You know, soothe disturbed minds.

180
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:03,328
Heh. Isn't that the way you feel about
your action-figure collection, Kyle?

181
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:05,764
Ow. Not funny.

182
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,545
Lovely, isn't it?

183
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,355
Who needs the journal when
you got the best gear money can buy?

184
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:34,724
Now, listen up, class.
GPR, ground-penetrating radar.

185
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:36,797
Emits an electromagnetic signal.

186
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:40,059
Allows you to locate anomalies
or hollow spaces.

187
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,429
Huh.

188
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:47,904
Oh, my God, you're right. It so works.

189
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,007
All right. You're coming with us.

190
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,207
- Why?
- Well, your sister was obsessed...

191
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,079
...with the house. Um...

192
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,050
I figure she told you a thing or two
that could prove useful.

193
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,588
Why would I help the man
that killed my sister?

194
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:06,091
Because you don't want me to become
the man who killed your boyfriend.

195
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:09,062
Sam's going to stay here with pretty boy.

196
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:12,462
Make sure you don't get any funny ideas,
because Samuel will kill you.

197
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:13,658
Right, Samuel?

198
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:16,394
Huh?
Oh, yeah, I will kill you.

199
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:18,999
See?

200
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,439
I will be okay.

201
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:24,272
All right.

202
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,913
Let's crash this party.

203
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:32,419
Get off. Get off me.

204
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:52,697
What's going on?

205
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:58,179
Looks like we have got visitors.

206
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:12,056
Ariel. What are you doing here?

207
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:15,022
Desmond.

208
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:21,134
Oh, shit.

209
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:23,737
Ariel, why did you
bring these people here?

210
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:29,677
Mmm... She didn't.
We just kind of let ourselves in.

211
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,541
Guess what I found.

212
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:36,074
What's going on? You know this asshole?

213
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:39,345
Desmond Niles,
a former student of mine.

214
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:45,255
"Asshole." That's not very friendly, Ariel.

215
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:48,254
And actually, Richie boy...

216
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:53,397
...nowadays, I am not your student...

217
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:55,263
...I am your competition.

218
00:20:55,263 --> 00:20:58,770
Who's your buyer? Maxwell? Rupert?

219
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:01,300
A gentleman never kisses and tells.

220
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:06,674
This statue belongs in a museum,
not in the hands of some private collector.

221
00:21:06,674 --> 00:21:10,909
I got 5 million reasons that say otherwise.

222
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:14,889
How did you find out about the journal?

223
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,558
This is where it gets ugly.

224
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,539
Why am I not surprised?

225
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,873
Michelle, what the hell's going on here?

226
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:43,014
It's really simple, honey.

227
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:45,449
I am about to graduate.

228
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:49,154
Am I going to teach a bunch of freshmen...

229
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:53,590
...the difference between Homo erectus...

230
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,128
...and Homo sapiens?

231
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:59,665
Or am I going to sit on a yacht
and work on my tan?

232
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:02,129
How can you be saying these things?

233
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:04,763
What did he do to you?

234
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,203
- Everything?
- Yeah.

235
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,505
That you were too busy to do.

236
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:14,547
Jesus. I don't know you.

237
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:18,017
You going to leave
without giving me a goodbye kiss?

238
00:22:22,357 --> 00:22:25,326
Did you hear that?
The house is going into lockdown.

239
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:26,961
What are you talking about?

240
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:30,956
Vannacutt installed a mechanism
that can seal up the whole asylum.

241
00:22:30,956 --> 00:22:34,296
Made it impossible for patients to escape.

242
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:37,667
That's how Price's guests
got trapped in the first place.

243
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,639
Good old Vannacutt.

244
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,138
The field of medicine
wouldn't be the same without him.

245
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:46,178
If this place goes into lockdown,
we will be trapped.

246
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:51,810
Well, that's why our first stop's
going to be the master control room.

247
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,118
Let the tour begin.

248
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,243
Mansions with their own mental wards.

249
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:24,010
Only in fucking L.A.

250
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,178
How twisted.

251
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:23,206
Having a hard time deciphering
Vannacutt's handwriting?

252
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:24,902
You should let me take a look.

253
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:44,156
Richard.

254
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:47,361
Oh.

255
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:56,733
Does anyone else want to take a look?

256
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,638
No? Okay. I didn't think so.

257
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:03,079
As far as I can tell,
Vannacutt hid the idol...

258
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,617
...in a secret chamber
deep in the basement.

259
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:09,314
So why don't we all take a corridor...

260
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:11,923
...and cover as much ground as possible?

261
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:14,561
Whoa, time-out.

262
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:17,197
Desmond, right?

263
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:22,667
You're not seriously suggesting
that we all split up...

264
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:26,364
...in a haunted house, are you?

265
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,386
Fucking shitty water.

266
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,256
That's all I needed.

267
00:25:46,256 --> 00:25:48,692
Knee-high in shitty water.

268
00:25:48,692 --> 00:25:49,852
Thanks a lot.

269
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,400
Come on, mate.

270
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:08,749
You kind of look familiar to me.

271
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,891
Oh, my God, I have got it.
You're "Notorious" Norris Boz, right?

272
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:22,359
You were like
UFC heavyweight champ, dude.

273
00:26:23,365 --> 00:26:24,923
Yeah. Ha, ha, ha.

274
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,827
Those were the good old days.
Heh, heh, heh.

275
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:28,992
Ow.

276
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:31,138
Yeah, good old days.

277
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,702
Just so you know, you fight like a girl.

278
00:26:34,702 --> 00:26:36,776
Like a lady.

279
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,246
Oh, fuck this, mate. Come on, whatever.

280
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:51,020
This place is something else, huh?

281
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,018
Are you going to mope all night long now?

282
00:26:54,018 --> 00:26:56,129
What could I possibly have to say to you?

283
00:26:56,129 --> 00:27:00,257
Don't be such a baby. The only thing
hurting you right now is your big ego.

284
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:04,466
- How long has this been going on?
- Does it really matter?

285
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:07,975
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- You will get over it.

286
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:09,440
I loved you, Michelle.

287
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,943
The only thing you love, Richard, is you.

288
00:27:11,943 --> 00:27:13,978
It's time I looked out for myself.

289
00:27:13,978 --> 00:27:18,108
Yeah, well,
you seem to have a knack for that.

290
00:27:18,108 --> 00:27:20,151
Yeah, well, I learned from the best.

291
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:35,098
Come on, baby. Where are you?

292
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:37,331
Where are you? Come on.

293
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,674
There's something here.

294
00:27:52,153 --> 00:27:54,121
Where the fuck are you?

295
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:00,251
It's about fucking time.

296
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:04,660
Five million dead presidents,
here I fucking come.

297
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,869
Yo, D. Can you read me?

298
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,307
I think I got...

299
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:38,491
God, no.

300
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:44,303
God, no, no, no.

301
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:05,555
So your sister,
she really believed in ghosts, huh?

302
00:29:05,555 --> 00:29:07,718
Leave me the fuck alone.

303
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,523
Call me crazy if you like...

304
00:29:13,134 --> 00:29:16,433
...but I only believe in what I can see...

305
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:18,663
...and touch...

306
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:22,710
...and taste.

307
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:27,914
You really don't like me now, do you?

308
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:13,852
Kinky shit.

309
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:26,662
What the hell?

310
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:42,612
Stay right where you are.

311
00:30:42,612 --> 00:30:45,350
Don't fucking move.

312
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:51,224
Who the hell are you?

313
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:54,801
How did you get in here?

314
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:06,179
Holy shit.

315
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:07,456
Shit.

316
00:33:08,302 --> 00:33:10,930
Desmond to Norris, do you copy?

317
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:13,166
Norris, answer me, goddamn it.

318
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:15,673
Desmond, I am here, mate.
What's going on? Come on.

319
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:18,038
- Hello?
Look, I need you to head back.

320
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,305
Meet me in the main salon.
I heard gunshots.

321
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,549
Warren, Harue, can you read me?

322
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:25,448
Do you copy?

323
00:33:25,448 --> 00:33:28,453
Warren, Harue, can you read me?
What's going on?

324
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:35,258
Shit.

325
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,122
Do it, Ariel.

326
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:41,957
Open the door.

327
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:25,010
What the fuck happened?

328
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:28,406
Exactly what my sister said
would happen.

329
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,853
You okay?

330
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:41,086
How did she get that thing on by herself?

331
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:48,497
Samuel, we need you in the house.

332
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,370
Is everything okay in there?

333
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,440
Come into the house.

334
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:58,909
Shit. Okay, looks like we're going to
get wet, pretty boy. Let's go.

335
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:01,105
All this time, I thought she was crazy.

336
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:04,779
My sister was telling the truth
about this place.

337
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,389
- We're not alone in this house.
- What the hell is she babbling about?

338
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,550
I saw a man.

339
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,663
He was a patient here.

340
00:35:16,663 --> 00:35:20,289
I think he led an uprising
the night that the hospital burnt down.

341
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:22,459
I think he was trying
to stop Dr. Vannacutt.

342
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:25,730
Okay, it's official. You're fucking crazy.

343
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,431
I have heard enough of this.

344
00:35:27,431 --> 00:35:30,771
Enough. Let's go back upstairs
and find the others.

345
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:34,046
- Come on, move.
Let's go.

346
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:45,724
Desmond, mate.
We're back upstairs in the main area.

347
00:35:45,724 --> 00:35:47,520
Desmond?

348
00:35:48,763 --> 00:35:49,752
Hey.

349
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,666
The fuck was that?

350
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:17,650
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Whew. Huh.

351
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,821
It's nothing, mate.

352
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:24,689
This place is ass-fucking my mind.

353
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,134
Desmond, mate. Come in, where are you?

354
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:34,196
What the...?

355
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:36,138
Ow.

356
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:43,176
Fuck.

357
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:45,819
- Oh, my God.
Hey, mate, help me out.

358
00:36:49,323 --> 00:36:50,813
Get them off me.

359
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,195
Fucking help me, mate, come on.

360
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,297
- Fuck.
Help.

361
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,733
Help me, man. Ah.

362
00:37:44,478 --> 00:37:45,638
Holy shit.

363
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,212
Kyle?

364
00:37:47,882 --> 00:37:50,442
Aah.
Shit.

365
00:37:52,153 --> 00:37:53,245
Where the hell's Norris?

366
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:55,547
I think you're standing in Norris.

367
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:08,397
Norris, where the hell are you?

368
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,900
Warren, Harue. Goddamn it,
will one of you guys answer me?

369
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:18,307
Kyle, what happened here?

370
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,343
Oh, God.

371
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,181
Hey.

372
00:38:30,124 --> 00:38:32,354
It's true, isn't it?

373
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,318
The house, it's...

374
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:08,519
Fuck.

375
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:26,010
What the fuck is going on?

376
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,114
You took care
of the lockdown mechanism.

377
00:39:28,682 --> 00:39:30,912
What the hell are you doing in here?

378
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,550
The fuck are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the car.

379
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:43,690
Paul?

380
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,991
Paul. Paul.

381
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:46,741
No.

382
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,552
No.

383
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,739
No. No. No.

384
00:39:57,044 --> 00:39:58,909
Ariel.

385
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:32,472
Fuck you too.

386
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:41,320
- Hey, back off. You told me to come in.
I did no such thing.

387
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,686
I spoke to you on the two-way.
- Whoever you talked to, it wasn't me.

388
00:40:44,686 --> 00:40:46,850
It was the house.

389
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,527
Ariel.

390
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:53,030
- Oh, thank God. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

391
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,792
Hey.

392
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:57,127
How did you get back in here?

393
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,305
The house wanted me to return.

394
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:04,607
So what?
You just walked straight back in.

395
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:07,576
- You're crazy.
- I don't leave my friends behind.

396
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:09,672
Yeah. How touching.

397
00:41:13,187 --> 00:41:15,985
Wait, the house wanted you to...?
I don't... The house?

398
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:19,285
Look, according to my sister,
last time it was seeking revenge.

399
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:22,827
Going after the descendants
of the orderlies that escaped the fire.

400
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:25,090
But this time is different.

401
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:30,226
What's wrong with you?
There's no such thing as ghosts.

402
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:34,165
Dude. I just saw one of your guerrillas
ripped to little pieces.

403
00:41:34,165 --> 00:41:38,004
- This shit is as real as it fucking gets.
- Somebody's playing a game with us.

404
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:39,908
Don't you get it? All right?

405
00:41:39,908 --> 00:41:42,480
I bet it's Warren, all right?
Greedy little fucker.

406
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,811
He's probably playing a trick on us, right?

407
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:46,247
I mean... Fucking prick.

408
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:48,547
And I bet the whole lot is in on it.
All right?

409
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,656
You're so in denial, man.

410
00:41:51,192 --> 00:41:54,320
You know what? He's right.
Your team has nothing to do with this.

411
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,258
My guess is they're all dead.

412
00:42:08,768 --> 00:42:10,531
Where's Samuel?

413
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,400
Wasn't he right behind me?

414
00:42:16,176 --> 00:42:17,609
Then there were six.

415
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:20,007
Samuel, where the fuck are you?

416
00:42:22,616 --> 00:42:24,277
Oh, fuck. What the fuck?

417
00:42:25,051 --> 00:42:28,612
You crazy bitch. Help.

418
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:31,188
You crazy fuck.

419
00:42:31,188 --> 00:42:33,349
Let me out of the fucking chair.

420
00:42:34,694 --> 00:42:37,720
Samuel, answer, and right fucking now.

421
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:45,827
Who is it?

422
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,100
Hello?

423
00:43:26,746 --> 00:43:28,077
This isn't real.

424
00:43:32,018 --> 00:43:33,576
Or is it?

425
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,487
What are you doing?

426
00:43:44,698 --> 00:43:46,063
Stop it. Stop...

427
00:43:46,266 --> 00:43:48,131
Wait. Wait. Wait.

428
00:43:58,044 --> 00:44:02,310
Listen. Is there any way we can reverse
the lockdown mechanism?

429
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:04,984
I doubt the house is going
to let us do that.

430
00:44:04,984 --> 00:44:07,142
You know what?
Fuck this. I am out of here.

431
00:44:08,388 --> 00:44:11,289
Nobody goes anywhere until we get
what we came for, understand?

432
00:44:16,229 --> 00:44:20,063
Really? Little girls with big guns
only look good in movies, kid.

433
00:44:20,063 --> 00:44:22,133
Shut the fuck up.

434
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,934
You're not a killer, Ariel.

435
00:44:23,934 --> 00:44:25,196
Really? Are you sure?

436
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:27,670
You're the scumbag who killed my sister.

437
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:32,278
Let's just relax and put those guns down
before someone gets hurt.

438
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:37,608
There's a $5 million check out there with
my name on it, and I intend to cash it.

439
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,843
Really? Five million dollars?

440
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,146
Is that how much
my sister's life was worth?

441
00:44:42,522 --> 00:44:46,822
Our only chance of getting out of here
in one piece is if we work together.

442
00:44:48,762 --> 00:44:50,423
Too bad I am not a team player,
Richie boy.

443
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:52,326
- Say bye-bye.
Desmond, watch out.

444
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:57,293
Fuck.

445
00:45:01,007 --> 00:45:02,440
Shit. Fuck. Fuck.

446
00:45:05,979 --> 00:45:07,105
Fuck.

447
00:45:11,317 --> 00:45:13,842
I'd be careful with that if I was you.

448
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:16,621
That was for Sara.

449
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:19,655
Keep an eye on them, will you?

450
00:45:20,527 --> 00:45:22,222
No problem.

451
00:45:23,496 --> 00:45:25,123
According to these blueprints...

452
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:28,859
...the asylum was connected
to a water-supply system in 1897.

453
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,868
There's a sewer tunnel
that runs underneath the house.

454
00:45:32,272 --> 00:45:33,967
Go on.

455
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:38,870
Well, the shower area is located
above the drainage system.

456
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:42,310
I bet we could find a sewer grate
down there that we could access.

457
00:45:43,249 --> 00:45:44,409
Hey, that could work.

458
00:45:45,685 --> 00:45:48,347
All right. So the quickest way
to the shower area...

459
00:45:48,347 --> 00:45:51,786
...is through the hydrotherapy room,
down the east corridor...

460
00:45:51,786 --> 00:45:54,188
...and up another hallway. Here.

461
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:56,328
Yeah, that looks easy enough.

462
00:45:58,164 --> 00:46:01,861
The house is going to do
everything in its power to stop us.

463
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:05,161
Of course.
Because that's what houses do.

464
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,005
I just had a thought.

465
00:46:09,005 --> 00:46:11,439
I remember Vannacutt
mentioning in his journal...

466
00:46:11,439 --> 00:46:14,045
...that the Baphomet idol
was guarded by the dead.

467
00:46:14,045 --> 00:46:18,207
I figured he was speaking metaphorically,
now I am not so sure, because guess what.

468
00:46:19,185 --> 00:46:21,710
- There's a crematorium in the basement.
Wait a minute.

469
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:26,018
Why the hell would there be
a crematorium inside a mental asylum?

470
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:30,424
I know during the tuberculosis epidemic,
the institute took in regular patients.

471
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:32,690
Presumably,
some were cremated in the hospital...

472
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,959
...in order to minimize further infection.

473
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:38,331
So if we find the crematorium,
we find the idol.

474
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:41,599
I don't give a damn about the idol.
I care about getting out alive.

475
00:46:42,442 --> 00:46:46,139
What about you, Richard?
Is that all you care about?

476
00:46:46,646 --> 00:46:49,979
Are you really going to let
this opportunity pass you by?

477
00:46:49,979 --> 00:46:52,583
We're talking about the Baphomet idol.

478
00:46:53,586 --> 00:46:56,316
The prize you have been chasing
all these years.

479
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:59,688
Personally, I don't think you can.

480
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,828
I know you too well.

481
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:06,932
It's your life's work.

482
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:13,100
If you guys want to get yourselves killed
chasing after this stupid thing, be my guest.

483
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,604
Paul and I are getting out.

484
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,309
So, what's it going to be?

485
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,939
I am coming with you.

486
00:47:23,917 --> 00:47:28,320
Vannacutt was known for being a brilliant 
physician and great humanitarian.

487
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,956
Nominated for the Nobel Prize in the '20s.

488
00:47:30,956 --> 00:47:35,322
But somehow, this great man went from
saving people to butchering them.

489
00:47:35,322 --> 00:47:36,322
Why?

490
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,265
Um, I have a theory. Maybe he was nuts?

491
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:46,005
The Church believed the statue
possessed an evil influence over men.

492
00:47:46,005 --> 00:47:48,800
Those who wanted its power
were susceptible.

493
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,002
Are you saying this statue corrupted
Vannacutt and his staff somehow?

494
00:47:53,546 --> 00:47:54,979
Crazy, huh?

495
00:48:33,086 --> 00:48:35,577
What the fuck did they use this for?

496
00:48:35,577 --> 00:48:37,518
Hydro-pool therapy.

497
00:48:38,224 --> 00:48:39,851
Hydro-what?

498
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:43,518
One of Vannacutt's special
contributions to modern medicine.

499
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:48,289
Expose a patient to a pool
filled with freezing water.

500
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:52,199
Replace internal pain with external pain
and they will cancel each other out.

501
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:55,864
Nice. Wonder why it didn't catch on.

502
00:48:58,378 --> 00:49:00,107
Shut up.

503
00:49:18,264 --> 00:49:19,561
What's going on?

504
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:24,095
Richard.

505
00:49:28,441 --> 00:49:30,739
No, you shut up.

506
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:44,923
I got the map, Desmond. Let's go.

507
00:49:55,935 --> 00:49:56,924
Ariel.

508
00:50:02,508 --> 00:50:03,839
Ariel.

509
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:08,970
Kyle. Kyle. Please, Kyle.

510
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:11,639
Ariel. Hold on.

511
00:50:12,285 --> 00:50:13,912
Kyle.

512
00:50:15,455 --> 00:50:16,752
Kyle.

513
00:50:20,093 --> 00:50:22,357
Guys, you got to find a way
to get us out of here.

514
00:50:48,821 --> 00:50:49,810
Ariel.

515
00:51:00,066 --> 00:51:03,035
Oh, God. Please, wait.

516
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:12,638
- I can't. I can't.
I can't reach you.

517
00:51:16,182 --> 00:51:18,912
Aah. Holy shit.

518
00:51:56,255 --> 00:51:58,553
I will kill you, you bitch.

519
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:01,422
Kyle.

520
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,579
Kyle.

521
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:28,047
Help me.

522
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:35,288
Hurry.

523
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,671
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

524
00:52:57,483 --> 00:52:59,246
Okay.

525
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,702
You have no idea where we are, do you?

526
00:53:17,702 --> 00:53:22,466
I would if you kept your trap shut
for one second, sweetheart.

527
00:53:23,843 --> 00:53:26,835
How hard can it be
to find a goddamn crematorium?

528
00:53:26,835 --> 00:53:29,106
It's on the map, isn't it?

529
00:53:29,482 --> 00:53:30,710
I will get us there.

530
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:33,511
You mean
if the house doesn't get us first.

531
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:36,177
- Getting a little superstitious?
- No, of course not.

532
00:53:36,177 --> 00:53:38,152
But why aren't your men answering you?

533
00:53:38,152 --> 00:53:41,953
Look, I already told you.
They're probably after the idol themselves.

534
00:53:41,953 --> 00:53:44,619
Maybe, but why not find the idol
and then turn on us?

535
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:46,059
It doesn't make any sense.

536
00:53:46,299 --> 00:53:48,460
That crazy bitch is finally getting to you.

537
00:53:53,139 --> 00:53:55,130
Or maybe...

538
00:53:59,178 --> 00:54:01,339
Or maybe you're part of this.

539
00:54:03,883 --> 00:54:05,783
Why are you looking at me like that?

540
00:54:05,783 --> 00:54:08,750
You're trying to tell me
that you suddenly believe in ghosts?

541
00:54:12,558 --> 00:54:13,547
What are you doing?

542
00:54:14,794 --> 00:54:16,762
That's it, isn't it?

543
00:54:17,363 --> 00:54:19,490
You're looking to play me
like you did Richard.

544
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,828
- Desmond, don't be ridiculous.
- How do I know you're not with them?

545
00:54:22,828 --> 00:54:24,697
Desmond, put the gun away.

546
00:54:24,697 --> 00:54:27,236
Betray one man,
how soon before the next?

547
00:54:27,236 --> 00:54:30,398
Jesus Christ, Desmond, it's me.
Put the goddamn gun down.

548
00:54:30,398 --> 00:54:32,510
- Get them on the radio.
- What?

549
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,942
Put whoever's behind this
on the goddamn radio.

550
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:37,947
You're not making any sense,
you're crazy. Put them on.

551
00:54:37,947 --> 00:54:40,085
- There's nothing going on.
- Put them on the radio.

552
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,853
Oh, my God.

553
00:54:50,396 --> 00:54:51,727
Michelle.

554
00:54:55,067 --> 00:54:56,295
Jesus.

555
00:54:56,295 --> 00:54:58,130
Why didn't those things
come after us?

556
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,794
I don't know.

557
00:54:59,794 --> 00:55:03,669
But I think some of these souls
are reliving their final moments...

558
00:55:03,669 --> 00:55:05,208
...over and over again.

559
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:08,074
Trapped in the place where they died.

560
00:55:09,415 --> 00:55:11,610
Thanks for saving my life back there.

561
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:14,080
Both of you.

562
00:55:16,155 --> 00:55:17,816
Are you okay?

563
00:55:20,226 --> 00:55:22,786
I convinced Kyle to come along for this.

564
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,589
The kid's dead because of me.

565
00:55:25,131 --> 00:55:26,655
Don't say that.

566
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:29,596
You didn't kill Kyle. Desmond did.

567
00:55:34,473 --> 00:55:37,237
You think you can get us out of here
without the blueprints?

568
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:40,468
I will give it my best shot.

569
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,079
Goddamn it, Desmond.

570
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:56,995
Michelle.

571
00:55:57,596 --> 00:55:59,621
Michelle.

572
00:56:16,715 --> 00:56:18,444
Oh, my God.

573
00:56:18,444 --> 00:56:20,414
Oh, my God.

574
00:57:28,787 --> 00:57:30,687
This must be it.

575
00:57:43,369 --> 00:57:45,929
Hey, I found something.

576
00:57:56,315 --> 00:57:58,442
Okay, help me lift it.

577
00:58:06,759 --> 00:58:10,957
- I don't think that's going to happen.
- It has to. It's the only way out.

578
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:13,828
Damn it.

579
00:58:39,124 --> 00:58:41,922
Destroy the statue.

580
00:58:53,806 --> 00:58:55,330
Ariel, what is it? You okay?

581
00:58:55,674 --> 00:58:57,039
We can't leave.

582
00:58:57,039 --> 00:58:58,676
What?

583
00:58:59,011 --> 00:59:02,606
- I know how to make it stop.
- What are you talking about?

584
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:06,273
The spirits here. They want to be 
at peace, but the evil won't let them.

585
00:59:06,785 --> 00:59:08,912
You're talking about Vannacutt.

586
00:59:09,989 --> 00:59:12,355
Vannacutt is just a servant.

587
00:59:12,355 --> 00:59:14,515
Of Baphomet.

588
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:17,794
That's why my sister was trying to
help you find the statue.

589
00:59:17,794 --> 00:59:20,329
The idol is the heart of this place.

590
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:23,195
You destroy it,
you break Baphomet's hold.

591
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:27,171
It's the only way to defeat the house.

592
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:56,735
What do we do now?

593
00:59:57,469 --> 01:00:00,768
One of these furnaces
has a chamber that leads to the idol.

594
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:05,576
You're saying we have to crawl
into one of these things?

595
01:00:07,713 --> 01:00:09,374
Yeah.

596
01:00:10,082 --> 01:00:12,073
Yeah, it's the only way.

597
01:00:20,426 --> 01:00:22,223
This is it.

598
01:00:26,432 --> 01:00:28,423
This is the entrance.

599
01:00:42,581 --> 01:00:44,572
You ready to do this?

600
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,411
Ready as I will ever be.

601
01:00:50,756 --> 01:00:52,383
Listen, um...

602
01:00:53,325 --> 01:00:56,158
- If we don't make it out of here, I...
- We will make it.

603
01:00:56,495 --> 01:00:59,760
If we don't make it,
I just want you to know that...

604
01:01:00,766 --> 01:01:02,063
What?

605
01:01:02,063 --> 01:01:04,225
That, uh...

606
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:08,301
That you make a lot of typos
for the editor of a magazine?

607
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:11,104
It's okay.
Like half your staff know by now.

608
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:18,775
All right, you two,
I am getting all choked up over here.

609
01:01:19,518 --> 01:01:21,452
Let's do this.

610
01:01:43,609 --> 01:01:45,702
I think we're almost there.

611
01:02:42,901 --> 01:02:45,995
Jesus. What the hell is this stuff?

612
01:02:48,006 --> 01:02:50,167
It seems to be organic.

613
01:02:51,777 --> 01:02:53,836
The heart of the house.

614
01:03:04,223 --> 01:03:05,383
It's remarkable.

615
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,029
What are you doing?

616
01:03:21,273 --> 01:03:23,867
Richard, what are you doing?

617
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:28,279
Richard, step aside.

618
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:30,108
Richard.

619
01:03:31,149 --> 01:03:33,913
I have to destroy it. I said, move.

620
01:03:33,913 --> 01:03:36,452
Hey, Richard. Hey.

621
01:03:36,452 --> 01:03:38,249
Jesus, hey.

622
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,754
Hey.

623
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:42,153
Richard.

624
01:03:44,997 --> 01:03:48,524
- Step aside.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

625
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,167
Yeah.

626
01:03:52,804 --> 01:03:54,328
It was calling me.

627
01:03:54,328 --> 01:03:57,066
I could feel its power.

628
01:04:06,351 --> 01:04:07,784
Damn it.

629
01:04:07,784 --> 01:04:10,888
Shit, you didn't even scratch it.

630
01:04:12,491 --> 01:04:15,858
If we can't destroy the statue,
then maybe there's another way.

631
01:04:16,361 --> 01:04:17,851
Such as?

632
01:04:19,998 --> 01:04:21,090
Well...

633
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,530
...as long as the Baphomet idol
is in the house...

634
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:26,034
...the souls are trapped here, right?

635
01:04:26,034 --> 01:04:28,297
So, what happens if we remove it?

636
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,566
How do you plan on doing that?

637
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:32,835
In case you hadn't noticed,
we can't get out.

638
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:35,946
Yeah. We noticed.

639
01:04:37,149 --> 01:04:38,980
The sewer tunnel.

640
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,779
The statue is small enough
to fit through the grate.

641
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,017
I don't know about this.

642
01:04:44,017 --> 01:04:46,817
Well, do you have
any better suggestions?

643
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,856
I say it's worth a shot.

644
01:04:52,698 --> 01:04:54,359
All right.

645
01:05:24,997 --> 01:05:26,828
I don't think we're alone anymore.

646
01:05:26,828 --> 01:05:28,023
Let's go.

647
01:05:54,393 --> 01:05:55,382
Going somewhere?

648
01:05:55,861 --> 01:05:57,260
We don't have time for this.

649
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,896
Yeah, well, you better make time.

650
01:06:01,633 --> 01:06:02,622
Is that it?

651
01:06:03,235 --> 01:06:06,136
Well, Richard, I knew
you wouldn't leave without it.

652
01:06:10,876 --> 01:06:12,867
All right, come on. Give it to me.

653
01:06:14,279 --> 01:06:15,940
Come on.

654
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,105
Give it to me, now.

655
01:06:20,218 --> 01:06:21,242
Come on.

656
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:23,286
Come on.

657
01:06:24,723 --> 01:06:26,190
What?

658
01:06:46,745 --> 01:06:48,372
No. No.

659
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:49,212
No. No.

660
01:06:52,517 --> 01:06:55,486
No. No. No.

661
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,500
Run.
Oh, shit.

662
01:07:14,139 --> 01:07:15,265
Paul.

663
01:07:18,777 --> 01:07:21,337
Keep going. Get the idol out of here,
I will be all right.

664
01:07:22,848 --> 01:07:23,837
Go.

665
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,202
No.

666
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:04,552
What are you doing?

667
01:08:04,552 --> 01:08:07,317
I have been looking for this statue
for 20 years.

668
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:08,754
It belongs to me.

669
01:08:08,754 --> 01:08:11,987
Richard, if we don't do this,
we're all going to die.

670
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:22,724
Richard, get off me.

671
01:09:27,739 --> 01:09:29,798
You can fight it.

672
01:09:35,347 --> 01:09:36,405
Fight it.

673
01:09:36,815 --> 01:09:38,009
Fight it.

674
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:03,200
Ariel.

675
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,364
Ariel, I am okay.

676
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,047
Ariel, wake up.

677
01:10:25,563 --> 01:10:28,464
Ariel, the idol.

678
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,001
Oh, God. Oh, God.

679
01:11:58,123 --> 01:11:59,112
No.

680
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:03,089
No. No.

681
01:12:48,273 --> 01:12:51,333
- Paul.
- Ariel.

682
01:13:25,577 --> 01:13:26,908
Come on.

683
01:13:56,207 --> 01:13:57,799
Hey.

684
01:13:58,009 --> 01:13:59,874
What is it? You okay?

685
01:13:59,874 --> 01:14:03,673
Baphomet's evil has been trapped
in that house for over 50 years.

686
01:14:04,282 --> 01:14:06,182
We set it free.

687
01:14:07,886 --> 01:14:09,376
You're...

688
01:14:09,687 --> 01:14:11,518
You're saying the house...

689
01:14:11,518 --> 01:14:14,180
The house wanted us to succeed?

690
01:14:16,794 --> 01:14:18,455
I don't know.

691
01:14:22,767 --> 01:14:24,029
Let's go home.

692
01:20:42,647 --> 01:20:45,309
What is it?
I don't know.

693
01:20:45,309 --> 01:20:48,213
I think it might be worth something.
