1
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:32,985
Ariel, this is Sara.

2
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:35,957
How many voice mails do I have to leave
before you call back?

3
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,258
Damn it, I need to talk to you.
Please, call me ba...

4
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:58,010
Ethan, listen.
Our circulation is up 6 percent.

5
00:03:58,011 --> 00:03:59,210
You want to know why?

6
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:03,257
Because I live on five hours' sleep and the
only man in my life is Mr. Coffee, okay?

7
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:04,654
Hang on. Hi. Thanks.

8
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:06,988
If advertisers don't like the new rates...

9
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,064
then find a magazine
with bigger words and smaller pictures.

10
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:11,291
Ethan, I got to go.

11
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,733
I will talk to you about it later.

12
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,731
I am so glad you're here, Ariel.

13
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:20,274
Pearl Jam's manager just called,
they want to reschedule the interview.

14
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:22,503
That's exactly why
I don't date musicians.

15
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:25,809
Oh, and also, one more thing,
your sister called last night.

16
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,886
I will shoot her an e-mail
when I get a chance.

17
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:31,856
Not bad.
Have the article on my desk by 3:00.

18
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:35,693
Paul was hoping that you could make it
to the shoot later.

19
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:37,192
Really, now?

20
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:41,390
He says he wants creative input, but I think
he's looking for an excuse to see you.

21
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:43,432
I thought all photographers were gay.

22
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:46,731
Oh, well, for a gay guy,
he sure likes to stare at your ass.

23
00:04:57,852 --> 00:04:59,046
Having fun?

24
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,981
It's a tough job,
but someone's got to do it.

25
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:05,053
- Hey. Oh.
- Hey. Oh, come on.

26
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:08,828
When faced with natural beauty,
I just can't help myself.

27
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:12,627
- Does this rap ever work with women?
- It's not a rap if it's true.

28
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:14,235
- Right.
Huh.

29
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:20,539
The Middle Ages were
a breeding ground for superstition.

30
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:26,314
Visions of departed souls,
angels and devils were common.

31
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:35,290
While the Church grew
in power and influence...

32
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:39,419
another movement began to spread
across the Continent like a dark plague:

33
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:42,164
The cult of the demon Baphomet.

34
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:45,461
The Inquisition forced the cult members
to go underground.

35
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:48,505
And that's when the Baphomet idol
disappeared.

36
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:53,435
The statue has been lost for centuries.
I have been trying to find it for decades.

37
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,310
My search has taken me all across Europe
and deep into the Old World's bloody past.

38
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,779
Man has always been drawn
to the dark side, which is good for me.

39
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,949
Otherwise, I wouldn't be selling
any books today.

40
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:10,854
And after that shameless plug,
I thank you.

41
00:06:13,034 --> 00:06:14,160
Thank you.

42
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:17,830
Woo. Yeah. Right on.

43
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:25,475
Guys, guys, please, one at a time, really.
The book's not even that good.

44
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:27,308
Ho, ho, ho.

45
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:34,880
So, what does a girl have to do
to get her book signed?

46
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:39,588
Hold it.
Oh. Okay.

47
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:41,492
Okay.

48
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:45,599
Dr. Hammer.

49
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,670
- Oh. Heh, heh, heh.
- Dude, can you knock?

50
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:51,741
Someone's working hard on their Ph. D.
Fuck you, Kyle.

51
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:55,144
Cut it out, the both of you.

52
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:56,678
What is it, Kyle?

53
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,083
Oh, shit, sorry.
I thought this couldn't wait.

54
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:03,686
It's about Sara Wolfe.

55
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:09,184
Sorry, sorry.
No, no, it's okay.

56
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,495
Mom, this isn't a good time.

57
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,995
Mom?

58
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,528
Mom, what's wrong?

59
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:32,987
Hey.

60
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,289
Thanks.

61
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,122
The neighbors found her
early this morning.

62
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:44,965
The cops say she shot herself.

63
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,002
I am... I am so sorry.

64
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:55,802
You know, my sister needed to talk me,
and all I could think about was work.

65
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:59,145
If there's anything you need, just...

66
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,580
Are you free tonight?

67
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:12,760
I really appreciate you coming along.
I don't think I could do this by myself.

68
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:15,456
Yeah, I am glad to help out.

69
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:20,834
You sure you want to do this?

70
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,799
You know, Sara was trying to reach me
before she died.

71
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,036
I need to know why.

72
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,932
Holy shit.

73
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:59,837
Isn't this the house where
all those people died a few years ago?

74
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:03,609
Yeah. My sister was one of the few
that made it out alive.

75
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,752
I remember seeing it on the news.

76
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:10,017
Steven Price flipped out,
went on a killing spree.

77
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:12,092
Not what happened,
according to my sister.

78
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,662
- What do you mean?
- Sara believed the house was haunted.

79
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:19,030
That ghosts killed Price's party guests.

80
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:21,864
Well, that's insane.

81
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:25,571
That's why we stopped talking.

82
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,747
Sara?

83
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:45,230
You must help them.

84
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:49,796
Hey, what...? What is it?
Are you okay? What's wrong?

85
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:54,035
- You didn't see that?
- See what?

86
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,635
God, I think I am losing my mind.

87
00:09:57,636 --> 00:10:00,041
That's exactly
what your sister used to say.

88
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:03,548
Who are you? What are you doing here?

89
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:06,242
I am here for the same reason you are.

90
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:09,447
I want to know
what really happened to your sister.

91
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:11,815
My name is Dr. Richard Hammer.

92
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:15,428
I teach archaeology
and medieval history at Forman College.

93
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:17,827
Your sister contacted me two weeks ago.

94
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,527
Contacted you about what?

95
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:25,195
Sara had gotten hold of
Dr. Vannacutt's journal.

96
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:27,466
Okay, I am sorry,
I still don't understand.

97
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:31,102
I have been trying to find the
Baphomet idol... Wait, the what?

98
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:34,515
It's a statue
of incredible archaeological value.

99
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,651
I have been trying to find it
for years now.

100
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:40,813
According to Dr. Vannacutt's journal,
the statue is here in Los Angeles...

101
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:43,254
inside the hill house.

102
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:47,385
Your sister was going to come back
to the house and help me find it.

103
00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:49,225
Now I know you're full of shit.

104
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:52,802
Sara would never go back to that house,
she was terrified of it.

105
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:55,034
We're out of here.

106
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:59,569
You're right.
Sara was afraid of the house.

107
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,712
But she was ready to face her demons.

108
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:03,347
Hey, back off.

109
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:08,882
Ariel, do you know
what happened to Vannacutt's journal?

110
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:11,522
How should I know?
Let go of the damn door.

111
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:14,989
- Sara thought she was being followed.
- What are you talking about?

112
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,096
The idol is worth millions
to the right collector.

113
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:20,529
There could be other
interested parties out there.

114
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:24,499
What are you saying, someone went after
my sister for this journal?

115
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:28,497
All I am saying is, be careful.

116
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:47,389
Thank you.

117
00:11:48,297 --> 00:11:49,594
For being you.

118
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:52,691
Hey, it's...

119
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:12,247
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

120
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,692
Night.

121
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,648
What the?

122
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:59,564
Sara, what were you up to?

123
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:06,572
The journal.

124
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:10,785
Paul?

125
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:16,286
- You're never going to believe this.
Ariel, don't....

126
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:19,689
Hey.

127
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,832
Let him go.

128
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,830
Hey.

129
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:32,374
- Leave her the fuck alone.
- Yeah?

130
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:34,871
What are you going to do?

131
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:38,514
You going to take a picture of me while
I put a fucking bullet in your head? Hmm?

132
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,919
Sit down.

133
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:07,609
Ah, yes. Your little magazine.

134
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,771
Wow.

135
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:11,744
You should be proud.

136
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:14,548
Oh.

137
00:14:15,457 --> 00:14:18,324
What?
I swear, I only read it for the articles.

138
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,430
- Who the hell are you people?
- Well, let's just say we're art lovers.

139
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:32,169
- You're after the Baphomet statue.
- Bingo, give that girl a prize.

140
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:37,439
- You're the bastard who killed my sister.
- That's not what the police say. Not at all.

141
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,482
But I must admit, the suicide note?
Oh.

142
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:43,413
That was inspired.

143
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,057
I think Helmut Newton here
has got the hots for his boss.

144
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:57,359
You're going to pay
for what you did to my sister.

145
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,060
Oh, let's not get abusive,
now, sweetheart.

146
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:05,699
I urged your sister to cooperate.
She chose to be a bitch.

147
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,779
I highly suggest
you don't follow her example.

148
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:14,149
Let's go, kids.

149
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:17,087
Get up. Come on.

150
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:18,888
Come on.

151
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:21,720
- Get up. Come on.
What are you doing?

152
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,830
Looks like the two of you
are going to be joining us on a trip.

153
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:26,966
Why? You got what you came for.

154
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,830
I can't have you running
to the cops.

155
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:35,136
I seriously doubt the authorities would
fall for yet another suicide in the family.

156
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:36,470
Do you?

157
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:25,896
Pretty creepy, isn't it?

158
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:29,295
You know, they say that the souls
of the people who died here...

159
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:31,663
apparently still haunt the house.

160
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:35,240
They also say that people who
believe in ghosts should be on Prozac.

161
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:39,645
I am sorry, I wasn't listening,
I was looking at your breasts.

162
00:16:39,646 --> 00:16:41,405
Kyle.

163
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:47,984
So why is it that this can't wait
till tomorrow, again?

164
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:50,851
The journal is missing
and I am not taking any chances.

165
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:53,515
If the Baphomet idol really is here...

166
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:56,961
you think I am going to let someone
else walk away with the prize?

167
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,741
It will be okay.

168
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:16,913
You make a beautiful couple.

169
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Wow.

170
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:37,202
This place is gnarly.

171
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:38,808
Ironic, isn't it?

172
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,443
Years of searching the globe...

173
00:17:40,444 --> 00:17:43,046
when I should have been looking
in my own backyard.

174
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:45,847
Uh, question.

175
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:47,315
What?

176
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:51,047
How does a medieval artifact end up
in Vannacutt's loony bin, anyway?

177
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:54,386
Vannacutt was a big art collector,
traveled all across the world.

178
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:56,825
He believed art could be therapeutic.

179
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,931
You know, soothe disturbed minds.

180
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:05,402
Heh. Isn't that the way you feel about
your action-figure collection, Kyle?

181
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:07,839
Ow. Not funny.

182
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:28,621
Lovely, isn't it?

183
00:18:29,098 --> 00:18:32,431
Who needs the journal when
you got the best gear money can buy?

184
00:18:32,432 --> 00:18:36,800
Now, listen up, class.
GPR, ground-penetrating radar.

185
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:38,873
Emits an electromagnetic signal.

186
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:42,136
Allows you to locate anomalies
or hollow spaces.

187
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:43,507
Huh.

188
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:49,982
Oh, my God, you're right. It so works.

189
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:55,085
All right. You're coming with us.

190
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:57,285
- Why?
- Well, your sister was obsessed...

191
00:18:57,286 --> 00:18:59,157
with the house. Um...

192
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:02,128
I figure she told you a thing or two
that could prove useful.

193
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:04,666
Why would I help the man
that killed my sister?

194
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:08,171
Because you don't want me to become
the man who killed your boyfriend.

195
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:11,141
Sam's going to stay here with pretty boy.

196
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:14,541
Make sure you don't get any funny ideas,
because Samuel will kill you.

197
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,738
Right, Samuel?

198
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:18,475
Huh?
Oh, yeah, I will kill you.

199
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:21,080
See?

200
00:19:22,757 --> 00:19:24,519
I will be okay.

201
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,353
All right.

202
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,994
Let's crash this party.

203
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,501
Get off. Get off me.

204
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,781
What's going on?

205
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:00,263
Looks like we have got visitors.

206
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,141
Ariel. What are you doing here?

207
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,108
Desmond.

208
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,219
Oh, shit.

209
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,823
Ariel, why did you
bring these people here?

210
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:31,764
Mmm... She didn't.
We just kind of let ourselves in.

211
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:35,628
Guess what I found.

212
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:38,160
What's going on? You know this asshole?

213
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:41,433
Desmond Niles,
a former student of mine.

214
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,343
"Asshole." That's not very friendly, Ariel.

215
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:50,342
And actually, Richie boy...

216
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:55,485
nowadays, I am not your student...

217
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:57,351
I am your competition.

218
00:20:57,352 --> 00:21:00,859
Who's your buyer? Maxwell? Rupert?

219
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,390
A gentleman never kisses and tells.

220
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:08,763
This statue belongs in a museum,
not in the hands of some private collector.

221
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:12,999
I got 5 million reasons that say otherwise.

222
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:16,980
How did you find out about the journal?

223
00:21:19,283 --> 00:21:21,649
This is where it gets ugly.

224
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,631
Why am I not surprised?

225
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:40,966
Michelle, what the hell's going on here?

226
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:45,106
It's really simple, honey.

227
00:21:45,107 --> 00:21:47,542
I am about to graduate.

228
00:21:47,914 --> 00:21:51,247
Am I going to teach a bunch of freshmen...

229
00:21:51,248 --> 00:21:55,683
the difference between Homo erectus...

230
00:21:55,684 --> 00:21:58,221
and Homo sapiens?

231
00:21:58,222 --> 00:22:01,759
Or am I going to sit on a yacht
and work on my tan?

232
00:22:02,597 --> 00:22:04,224
How can you be saying these things?

233
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,858
What did he do to you?

234
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,297
- Everything?
- Yeah.

235
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:13,600
That you were too busy to do.

236
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:16,643
Jesus. I don't know you.

237
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:20,113
You going to leave
without giving me a goodbye kiss?

238
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:27,422
Did you hear that?
The house is going into lockdown.

239
00:22:27,423 --> 00:22:29,058
What are you talking about?

240
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:33,052
Vannacutt installed a mechanism
that can seal up the whole asylum.

241
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:36,393
Made it impossible for patients to escape.

242
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,765
That's how Price's guests
got trapped in the first place.

243
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:41,737
Good old Vannacutt.

244
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,235
The field of medicine
wouldn't be the same without him.

245
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:48,276
If this place goes into lockdown,
we will be trapped.

246
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:53,909
Well, that's why our first stop's
going to be the master control room.

247
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:56,217
Let the tour begin.

248
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,344
Mansions with their own mental wards.

249
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:26,112
Only in fucking L.A.

250
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:56,282
How twisted.

251
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:25,312
Having a hard time deciphering
Vannacutt's handwriting?

252
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:27,009
You should let me take a look.

253
00:24:45,206 --> 00:24:46,264
Richard.

254
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,470
Oh.

255
00:24:55,384 --> 00:24:58,843
Does anyone else want to take a look?

256
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:01,747
No? Okay. I didn't think so.

257
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:05,188
As far as I can tell,
Vannacutt hid the idol...

258
00:25:05,189 --> 00:25:07,726
in a secret chamber
deep in the basement.

259
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:11,425
So why don't we all take a corridor...

260
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:14,033
and cover as much ground as possible?

261
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:16,671
Whoa, time-out.

262
00:25:16,672 --> 00:25:19,308
Desmond, right?

263
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:24,778
You're not seriously suggesting
that we all split up...

264
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:28,476
in a haunted house, are you?

265
00:25:43,235 --> 00:25:45,500
Fucking shitty water.

266
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:48,369
That's all I needed.

267
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,805
Knee-high in shitty water.

268
00:25:50,806 --> 00:25:51,966
Thanks a lot.

269
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:03,515
Come on, mate.

270
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:10,865
You kind of look familiar to me.

271
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:22,007
Oh, my God, I have got it.
You're "Notorious" Norris Boz, right?

272
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:24,476
You were like
UFC heavyweight champ, dude.

273
00:26:25,482 --> 00:26:27,040
Yeah. Ha, ha, ha.

274
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:29,943
Those were the good old days.
Heh, heh, heh.

275
00:26:29,944 --> 00:26:31,109
Ow.

276
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:33,256
Yeah, good old days.

277
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,819
Just so you know, you fight like a girl.

278
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,894
Like a lady.

279
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,365
Oh, fuck this, mate. Come on, whatever.

280
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,139
This place is something else, huh?

281
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,137
Are you going to mope all night long now?

282
00:26:56,138 --> 00:26:58,248
What could I possibly have to say to you?

283
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:02,377
Don't be such a baby. The only thing
hurting you right now is your big ego.

284
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:06,586
- How long has this been going on?
- Does it really matter?

285
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,095
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- You will get over it.

286
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:11,560
I loved you, Michelle.

287
00:27:11,561 --> 00:27:14,063
The only thing you love, Richard, is you.

288
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:16,098
It's time I looked out for myself.

289
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:20,229
Yeah, well,
you seem to have a knack for that.

290
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,273
Yeah, well, I learned from the best.

291
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:37,221
Come on, baby. Where are you?

292
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,454
Where are you? Come on.

293
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:50,798
There's something here.

294
00:27:54,277 --> 00:27:56,246
Where the fuck are you?

295
00:28:00,818 --> 00:28:02,375
It's about fucking time.

296
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:06,786
Five million dead presidents,
here I fucking come.

297
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:18,995
Yo, D. Can you read me?

298
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:20,434
I think I got...

299
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:40,619
God, no.

300
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:46,432
God, no, no, no.

301
00:29:02,952 --> 00:29:07,685
So your sister,
she really believed in ghosts, huh?

302
00:29:07,686 --> 00:29:09,849
Leave me the fuck alone.

303
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:14,654
Call me crazy if you like...

304
00:29:15,265 --> 00:29:18,564
but I only believe in what I can see...

305
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:20,795
and touch...

306
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:24,842
and taste.

307
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:30,047
You really don't like me now, do you?

308
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:15,989
Kinky shit.

309
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:28,811
What the hell?

310
00:30:43,261 --> 00:30:44,750
Stay right where you are.

311
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:47,489
Don't fucking move.

312
00:30:51,203 --> 00:30:53,364
Who the hell are you?

313
00:30:55,007 --> 00:30:56,941
How did you get in here?

314
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:08,320
Holy shit.

315
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:09,618
Shit.

316
00:33:10,453 --> 00:33:13,082
Desmond to Norris, do you copy?

317
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,317
Norris, answer me, goddamn it.

318
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:17,824
Desmond, I am here, mate.
What's going on? Come on.

319
00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:20,189
- Hello?
Look, I need you to head back.

320
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,457
Meet me in the main salon.
I heard gunshots.

321
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,702
Warren, Harue, can you read me?

322
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,600
Do you copy?

323
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:30,606
Warren, Harue, can you read me?
What's going on?

324
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,412
Shit.

325
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:42,287
Do it, Ariel.

326
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:44,122
Open the door.

327
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:27,168
What the fuck happened?

328
00:34:27,504 --> 00:34:30,564
Exactly what my sister said
would happen.

329
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:36,012
You okay?

330
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:43,245
How did she get that thing on by herself?

331
00:34:48,427 --> 00:34:50,657
Samuel, we need you in the house.

332
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:54,529
Is everything okay in there?

333
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,600
Come into the house.

334
00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:01,069
Shit. Okay, looks like we're going to
get wet, pretty boy. Let's go.

335
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,266
All this time, I thought she was crazy.

336
00:35:03,743 --> 00:35:06,940
My sister was telling the truth
about this place.

337
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:14,551
- We're not alone in this house.
- What the hell is she babbling about?

338
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:16,711
I saw a man.

339
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:18,824
He was a patient here.

340
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:22,451
I think he led an uprising
the night that the hospital burnt down.

341
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:24,622
I think he was trying
to stop Dr. Vannacutt.

342
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:27,892
Okay, it's official. You're fucking crazy.

343
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:29,593
I have heard enough of this.

344
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,935
Enough. Let's go back upstairs
and find the others.

345
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,210
- Come on, move.
Let's go.

346
00:35:44,488 --> 00:35:47,888
Desmond, mate.
We're back upstairs in the main area.

347
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:49,685
Desmond?

348
00:35:50,928 --> 00:35:51,928
Hey.

349
00:35:53,364 --> 00:35:54,831
The fuck was that?

350
00:36:17,189 --> 00:36:19,818
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Whew. Huh.

351
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,989
It's nothing, mate.

352
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:26,857
This place is ass-fucking my mind.

353
00:36:28,368 --> 00:36:30,302
Desmond, mate. Come in, where are you?

354
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:36,376
What the...?

355
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:38,307
Ow.

356
00:36:43,685 --> 00:36:45,346
Fuck.

357
00:36:46,055 --> 00:36:47,989
- Oh, my God.
Hey, mate, help me out.

358
00:36:51,493 --> 00:36:52,983
Get them off me.

359
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:00,366
Fucking help me, mate, come on.

360
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:02,468
- Fuck.
Help.

361
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:09,905
Help me, man. Ah.

362
00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:47,812
Holy shit.

363
00:37:47,813 --> 00:37:49,387
Kyle?

364
00:37:50,057 --> 00:37:52,617
Aah.
Shit.

365
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:55,419
Where the hell's Norris?

366
00:37:56,129 --> 00:37:57,721
I think you're standing in Norris.

367
00:38:08,306 --> 00:38:10,570
Norris, where the hell are you?

368
00:38:11,343 --> 00:38:14,073
Warren, Harue. Goddamn it,
will one of you guys answer me?

369
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:20,479
Kyle, what happened here?

370
00:38:21,752 --> 00:38:23,515
Oh, God.

371
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:31,353
Hey.

372
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:34,525
It's true, isn't it?

373
00:38:35,431 --> 00:38:36,489
The house, it's...

374
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:10,687
Fuck.

375
00:39:26,312 --> 00:39:28,176
What the fuck is going on?

376
00:39:28,177 --> 00:39:30,281
You took care
of the lockdown mechanism.

377
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:33,079
What the hell are you doing in here?

378
00:39:33,953 --> 00:39:36,716
The fuck are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the car.

379
00:39:44,195 --> 00:39:45,855
Paul?

380
00:39:45,856 --> 00:39:48,155
Paul. Paul.

381
00:39:48,156 --> 00:39:49,156
No.

382
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:50,967
No.

383
00:39:51,935 --> 00:39:54,904
No. No. No.

384
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:01,073
Ariel.

385
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:34,634
Fuck you too.

386
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,480
- Hey, back off. You told me to come in.
I did no such thing.

387
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:46,846
I spoke to you on the two-way.
- Whoever you talked to, it wasn't me.

388
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:49,011
It was the house.

389
00:40:51,356 --> 00:40:52,686
Ariel.

390
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:55,189
- Oh, thank God. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

391
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,952
Hey.

392
00:40:57,763 --> 00:40:59,287
How did you get back in here?

393
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,464
The house wanted me to return.

394
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:06,765
So what?
You just walked straight back in.

395
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:09,735
- You're crazy.
- I don't leave my friends behind.

396
00:41:10,341 --> 00:41:11,831
Yeah. How touching.

397
00:41:15,345 --> 00:41:18,142
Wait, the house wanted you to...?
I don't... The house?

398
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,442
Look, according to my sister,
last time it was seeking revenge.

399
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:24,984
Going after the descendants
of the orderlies that escaped the fire.

400
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:27,248
But this time is different.

401
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:32,383
What's wrong with you?
There's no such thing as ghosts.

402
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:36,321
Dude. I just saw one of your guerrillas
ripped to little pieces.

403
00:41:36,322 --> 00:41:40,159
- This shit is as real as it fucking gets.
- Somebody's playing a game with us.

404
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,063
Don't you get it? All right?

405
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:44,635
I bet it's Warren, all right?
Greedy little fucker.

406
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,966
He's probably playing a trick on us, right?

407
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:48,402
I mean... Fucking prick.

408
00:41:48,403 --> 00:41:50,702
And I bet the whole lot is in on it.
All right?

409
00:41:50,703 --> 00:41:52,811
You're so in denial, man.

410
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:56,474
You know what? He's right.
Your team has nothing to do with this.

411
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:58,413
My guess is they're all dead.

412
00:42:10,922 --> 00:42:12,685
Where's Samuel?

413
00:42:14,393 --> 00:42:16,554
Wasn't he right behind me?

414
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:19,761
Then there were six.

415
00:42:19,762 --> 00:42:22,160
Samuel, where the fuck are you?

416
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:26,430
Oh, fuck. What the fuck?

417
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:30,763
You crazy bitch. Help.

418
00:42:30,764 --> 00:42:33,339
You crazy fuck.

419
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,501
Let me out of the fucking chair.

420
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:39,872
Samuel, answer, and right fucking now.

421
00:42:46,989 --> 00:42:47,989
Who is it?

422
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:20,249
Hello?

423
00:43:28,894 --> 00:43:30,225
This isn't real.

424
00:43:34,165 --> 00:43:35,723
Or is it?

425
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:37,634
What are you doing?

426
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:48,209
Stop it. Stop...

427
00:43:48,412 --> 00:43:50,277
Wait. Wait. Wait.

428
00:44:00,189 --> 00:44:04,455
Listen. Is there any way we can reverse
the lockdown mechanism?

429
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:07,128
I doubt the house is going
to let us do that.

430
00:44:07,129 --> 00:44:09,287
You know what?
Fuck this. I am out of here.

431
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:13,433
Nobody goes anywhere until we get
what we came for, understand?

432
00:44:18,373 --> 00:44:22,206
Really? Little girls with big guns
only look good in movies, kid.

433
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:24,276
Shut the fuck up.

434
00:44:24,678 --> 00:44:26,076
You're not a killer, Ariel.

435
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:27,338
Really? Are you sure?

436
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:29,812
You're the scumbag who killed my sister.

437
00:44:29,813 --> 00:44:34,421
Let's just relax and put those guns down
before someone gets hurt.

438
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:39,749
There's a $5 million check out there with
my name on it, and I intend to cash it.

439
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,984
Really? Five million dollars?

440
00:44:41,985 --> 00:44:44,288
Is that how much
my sister's life was worth?

441
00:44:44,664 --> 00:44:48,963
Our only chance of getting out of here
in one piece is if we work together.

442
00:44:50,903 --> 00:44:52,563
Too bad I am not a team player,
Richie boy.

443
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,467
- Say bye-bye.
Desmond, watch out.

444
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,434
Fuck.

445
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:04,580
Shit. Fuck. Fuck.

446
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:09,245
Fuck.

447
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:15,981
I'd be careful with that if I was you.

448
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,760
That was for Sara.

449
00:45:19,462 --> 00:45:21,794
Keep an eye on them, will you?

450
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:24,361
No problem.

451
00:45:25,635 --> 00:45:27,260
According to these blueprints...

452
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:30,996
the asylum was connected
to a water-supply system in 1897.

453
00:45:30,997 --> 00:45:34,006
There's a sewer tunnel
that runs underneath the house.

454
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:36,105
Go on.

455
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:41,006
Well, the shower area is located
above the drainage system.

456
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:44,447
I bet we could find a sewer grate
down there that we could access.

457
00:45:45,386 --> 00:45:46,546
Hey, that could work.

458
00:45:47,822 --> 00:45:50,483
All right. So the quickest way
to the shower area...

459
00:45:50,484 --> 00:45:53,921
is through the hydrotherapy room,
down the east corridor...

460
00:45:53,922 --> 00:45:56,323
and up another hallway. Here.

461
00:45:56,324 --> 00:45:58,464
Yeah, that looks easy enough.

462
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,996
The house is going to do
everything in its power to stop us.

463
00:46:04,236 --> 00:46:07,296
Of course.
Because that's what houses do.

464
00:46:09,275 --> 00:46:11,139
I just had a thought.

465
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,573
I remember Vannacutt
mentioning in his journal...

466
00:46:13,574 --> 00:46:16,179
that the Baphomet idol
was guarded by the dead.

467
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:20,341
I figured he was speaking metaphorically,
now I am not so sure, because guess what.

468
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:23,843
- There's a crematorium in the basement.
Wait a minute.

469
00:46:23,844 --> 00:46:28,151
Why the hell would there be
a crematorium inside a mental asylum?

470
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:32,556
I know during the tuberculosis epidemic,
the institute took in regular patients.

471
00:46:32,557 --> 00:46:34,822
Presumably,
some were cremated in the hospital...

472
00:46:34,823 --> 00:46:37,091
in order to minimize further infection.

473
00:46:37,092 --> 00:46:40,463
So if we find the crematorium,
we find the idol.

474
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,731
I don't give a damn about the idol.
I care about getting out alive.

475
00:46:44,574 --> 00:46:48,271
What about you, Richard?
Is that all you care about?

476
00:46:48,778 --> 00:46:52,110
Are you really going to let
this opportunity pass you by?

477
00:46:52,111 --> 00:46:54,714
We're talking about the Baphomet idol.

478
00:46:55,717 --> 00:46:58,447
The prize you have been chasing
all these years.

479
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:01,819
Personally, I don't think you can.

480
00:47:02,991 --> 00:47:04,959
I know you too well.

481
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:09,062
It's your life's work.

482
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:15,229
If you guys want to get yourselves killed
chasing after this stupid thing, be my guest.

483
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,734
Paul and I are getting out.

484
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:20,438
So, what's it going to be?

485
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:25,068
I am coming with you.

486
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:30,448
Vannacutt was known for being a brilliant
physician and great humanitarian.

487
00:47:30,449 --> 00:47:33,083
Nominated for the Nobel Prize in the '20s.

488
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:37,449
But somehow, this great man went from
saving people to butchering them.

489
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:38,450
Why?

490
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:42,393
Um, I have a theory. Maybe he was nuts?

491
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:48,131
The Church believed the statue
possessed an evil influence over men.

492
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:50,926
Those who wanted its power
were susceptible.

493
00:47:50,927 --> 00:47:55,129
Are you saying this statue corrupted
Vannacutt and his staff somehow?

494
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,105
Crazy, huh?

495
00:48:35,209 --> 00:48:37,699
What the fuck did they use this for?

496
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,641
Hydro-pool therapy.

497
00:48:40,347 --> 00:48:41,973
Hydro-what?

498
00:48:41,974 --> 00:48:45,641
One of Vannacutt's special
contributions to modern medicine.

499
00:48:46,919 --> 00:48:50,410
Expose a patient to a pool
filled with freezing water.

500
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:54,320
Replace internal pain with external pain
and they will cancel each other out.

501
00:48:54,321 --> 00:48:57,986
Nice. Wonder why it didn't catch on.

502
00:49:00,499 --> 00:49:02,228
Shut up.

503
00:49:20,384 --> 00:49:21,681
What's going on?

504
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:26,214
Richard.

505
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,858
No, you shut up.

506
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,041
I got the map, Desmond. Let's go.

507
00:49:58,052 --> 00:49:59,052
Ariel.

508
00:50:04,624 --> 00:50:05,955
Ariel.

509
00:50:08,595 --> 00:50:11,085
Kyle. Kyle. Please, Kyle.

510
00:50:11,086 --> 00:50:13,755
Ariel. Hold on.

511
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:16,027
Kyle.

512
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:18,867
Kyle.

513
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:24,472
Guys, you got to find a way
to get us out of here.

514
00:50:50,934 --> 00:50:51,934
Ariel.

515
00:51:02,178 --> 00:51:05,146
Oh, God. Please, wait.

516
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:14,749
- I can't. I can't.
I can't reach you.

517
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:21,022
Aah. Holy shit.

518
00:51:58,362 --> 00:52:00,660
I will kill you, you bitch.

519
00:52:01,766 --> 00:52:03,529
Kyle.

520
00:52:05,436 --> 00:52:06,686
Kyle.

521
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:30,152
Help me.

522
00:52:35,663 --> 00:52:37,392
Hurry.

523
00:52:53,647 --> 00:52:55,774
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

524
00:52:59,585 --> 00:53:01,348
Okay.

525
00:53:17,335 --> 00:53:19,802
You have no idea where we are, do you?

526
00:53:19,803 --> 00:53:24,566
I would if you kept your trap shut
for one second, sweetheart.

527
00:53:25,943 --> 00:53:28,934
How hard can it be
to find a goddamn crematorium?

528
00:53:28,935 --> 00:53:31,206
It's on the map, isn't it?

529
00:53:31,582 --> 00:53:32,809
I will get us there.

530
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,610
You mean
if the house doesn't get us first.

531
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:38,275
- Getting a little superstitious?
- No, of course not.

532
00:53:38,276 --> 00:53:40,250
But why aren't your men answering you?

533
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:44,051
Look, I already told you.
They're probably after the idol themselves.

534
00:53:44,052 --> 00:53:46,717
Maybe, but why not find the idol
and then turn on us?

535
00:53:46,718 --> 00:53:48,158
It doesn't make any sense.

536
00:53:48,397 --> 00:53:50,558
That crazy bitch is finally getting to you.

537
00:53:55,237 --> 00:53:57,228
Or maybe...

538
00:54:01,275 --> 00:54:03,436
Or maybe you're part of this.

539
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,879
Why are you looking at me like that?

540
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,847
You're trying to tell me
that you suddenly believe in ghosts?

541
00:54:14,654 --> 00:54:15,654
What are you doing?

542
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,858
That's it, isn't it?

543
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:21,585
You're looking to play me
like you did Richard.

544
00:54:21,586 --> 00:54:24,923
- Desmond, don't be ridiculous.
- How do I know you're not with them?

545
00:54:24,924 --> 00:54:26,791
Desmond, put the gun away.

546
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:29,330
Betray one man,
how soon before the next?

547
00:54:29,331 --> 00:54:32,492
Jesus Christ, Desmond, it's me.
Put the goddamn gun down.

548
00:54:32,493 --> 00:54:34,604
- Get them on the radio.
- What?

549
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,036
Put whoever's behind this
on the goddamn radio.

550
00:54:37,037 --> 00:54:40,040
You're not making any sense,
you're crazy. Put them on.

551
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:42,179
- There's nothing going on.
- Put them on the radio.

552
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:44,947
Oh, my God.

553
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,820
Michelle.

554
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,387
Jesus.

555
00:54:58,388 --> 00:55:00,222
Why didn't those things
come after us?

556
00:55:00,223 --> 00:55:01,886
I don't know.

557
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:05,760
But I think some of these souls
are reliving their final moments...

558
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,299
over and over again.

559
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,166
Trapped in the place where they died.

560
00:55:11,507 --> 00:55:13,702
Thanks for saving my life back there.

561
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,171
Both of you.

562
00:55:18,246 --> 00:55:19,907
Are you okay?

563
00:55:22,317 --> 00:55:24,876
I convinced Kyle to come along for this.

564
00:55:24,877 --> 00:55:26,680
The kid's dead because of me.

565
00:55:27,222 --> 00:55:28,744
Don't say that.

566
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:31,686
You didn't kill Kyle. Desmond did.

567
00:55:36,563 --> 00:55:39,327
You think you can get us out of here
without the blueprints?

568
00:55:41,034 --> 00:55:42,557
I will give it my best shot.

569
00:55:43,803 --> 00:55:45,168
Goddamn it, Desmond.

570
00:55:57,149 --> 00:55:59,083
Michelle.

571
00:55:59,684 --> 00:56:01,709
Michelle.

572
00:56:18,802 --> 00:56:20,529
Oh, my God.

573
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,500
Oh, my God.

574
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:32,768
This must be it.

575
00:57:45,449 --> 00:57:48,008
Hey, I found something.

576
00:57:58,394 --> 00:58:00,520
Okay, help me lift it.

577
00:58:08,837 --> 00:58:13,034
- I don't think that's going to happen.
- It has to. It's the only way out.

578
00:58:14,108 --> 00:58:15,905
Damn it.

579
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:43,997
Destroy the statue.

580
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,404
Ariel, what is it? You okay?

581
00:58:57,748 --> 00:58:59,112
We can't leave.

582
00:58:59,113 --> 00:59:00,750
What?

583
00:59:01,085 --> 00:59:04,678
- I know how to make it stop.
- What are you talking about?

584
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:08,346
The spirits here. They want to be
at peace, but the evil won't let them.

585
00:59:08,858 --> 00:59:10,985
You're talking about Vannacutt.

586
00:59:12,062 --> 00:59:14,427
Vannacutt is just a servant.

587
00:59:14,428 --> 00:59:16,587
Of Baphomet.

588
00:59:16,999 --> 00:59:19,865
That's why my sister was trying to
help you find the statue.

589
00:59:19,866 --> 00:59:22,400
The idol is the heart of this place.

590
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:25,267
You destroy it,
you break Baphomet's hold.

591
00:59:26,342 --> 00:59:29,242
It's the only way to defeat the house.

592
00:59:56,836 --> 00:59:58,804
What do we do now?

593
00:59:59,538 --> 01:00:02,837
One of these furnaces
has a chamber that leads to the idol.

594
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:07,644
You're saying we have to crawl
into one of these things?

595
01:00:09,781 --> 01:00:11,442
Yeah.

596
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,141
Yeah, it's the only way.

597
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,290
This is it.

598
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,489
This is the entrance.

599
01:00:44,646 --> 01:00:46,637
You ready to do this?

600
01:00:47,315 --> 01:00:49,476
Ready as I will ever be.

601
01:00:52,821 --> 01:00:54,448
Listen, um...

602
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:58,222
- If we don't make it out of here, I...
- We will make it.

603
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,824
If we don't make it,
I just want you to know that...

604
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,126
What?

605
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,289
That, uh...

606
01:01:06,634 --> 01:01:10,364
That you make a lot of typos
for the editor of a magazine?

607
01:01:10,937 --> 01:01:13,167
It's okay.
Like half your staff know by now.

608
01:01:18,278 --> 01:01:20,837
All right, you two,
I am getting all choked up over here.

609
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,514
Let's do this.

610
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:47,762
I think we're almost there.

611
01:02:44,957 --> 01:02:48,050
Jesus. What the hell is this stuff?

612
01:02:50,061 --> 01:02:52,222
It seems to be organic.

613
01:02:53,832 --> 01:02:55,891
The heart of the house.

614
01:03:06,277 --> 01:03:07,437
It's remarkable.

615
01:03:17,353 --> 01:03:19,082
What are you doing?

616
01:03:23,326 --> 01:03:25,919
Richard, what are you doing?

617
01:03:28,363 --> 01:03:30,330
Richard, step aside.

618
01:03:30,331 --> 01:03:32,160
Richard.

619
01:03:33,201 --> 01:03:35,964
I have to destroy it. I said, move.

620
01:03:35,965 --> 01:03:38,502
Hey, Richard. Hey.

621
01:03:38,503 --> 01:03:40,299
Jesus, hey.

622
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,805
Hey.

623
01:03:42,577 --> 01:03:44,204
Richard.

624
01:03:47,048 --> 01:03:50,574
- Step aside.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

625
01:03:50,575 --> 01:03:52,217
Yeah.

626
01:03:54,854 --> 01:03:56,377
It was calling me.

627
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:59,116
I could feel its power.

628
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,832
Damn it.

629
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:12,937
Shit, you didn't even scratch it.

630
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:17,906
If we can't destroy the statue,
then maybe there's another way.

631
01:04:18,409 --> 01:04:19,899
Such as?

632
01:04:22,046 --> 01:04:23,137
Well...

633
01:04:23,138 --> 01:04:25,577
as long as the Baphomet idol
is in the house...

634
01:04:25,578 --> 01:04:28,081
the souls are trapped here, right?

635
01:04:28,082 --> 01:04:30,343
So, what happens if we remove it?

636
01:04:30,344 --> 01:04:32,612
How do you plan on doing that?

637
01:04:32,613 --> 01:04:34,881
In case you hadn't noticed,
we can't get out.

638
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:37,993
Yeah. We noticed.

639
01:04:39,196 --> 01:04:41,025
The sewer tunnel.

640
01:04:41,026 --> 01:04:43,825
The statue is small enough
to fit through the grate.

641
01:04:44,266 --> 01:04:46,062
I don't know about this.

642
01:04:46,063 --> 01:04:48,863
Well, do you have
any better suggestions?

643
01:04:50,139 --> 01:04:51,902
I say it's worth a shot.

644
01:04:54,743 --> 01:04:56,404
All right.

645
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,870
I don't think we're alone anymore.

646
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:30,066
Let's go.

647
01:05:56,433 --> 01:05:57,433
Going somewhere?

648
01:05:57,901 --> 01:05:59,299
We don't have time for this.

649
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,936
Yeah, well, you better make time.

650
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:04,673
Is that it?

651
01:06:05,275 --> 01:06:08,176
Well, Richard, I knew
you wouldn't leave without it.

652
01:06:12,915 --> 01:06:14,906
All right, come on. Give it to me.

653
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:17,978
Come on.

654
01:06:17,979 --> 01:06:20,144
Give it to me, now.

655
01:06:22,256 --> 01:06:23,280
Come on.

656
01:06:23,891 --> 01:06:25,324
Come on.

657
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:28,228
What?

658
01:06:48,781 --> 01:06:50,407
No. No.

659
01:06:50,408 --> 01:06:51,408
No. No.

660
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:57,522
No. No. No.

661
01:07:10,135 --> 01:07:12,534
Run.
Oh, shit.

662
01:07:16,173 --> 01:07:17,299
Paul.

663
01:07:20,811 --> 01:07:23,371
Keep going. Get the idol out of here,
I will be all right.

664
01:07:24,881 --> 01:07:25,881
Go.

665
01:07:54,141 --> 01:07:55,233
No.

666
01:08:05,251 --> 01:08:06,581
What are you doing?

667
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:09,346
I have been looking for this statue
for 20 years.

668
01:08:09,347 --> 01:08:10,783
It belongs to me.

669
01:08:10,784 --> 01:08:14,017
Richard, if we don't do this,
we're all going to die.

670
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:24,748
Richard, get off me.

671
01:09:29,762 --> 01:09:31,821
You can fight it.

672
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:38,428
Fight it.

673
01:09:38,838 --> 01:09:40,032
Fight it.

674
01:10:03,594 --> 01:10:05,220
Ariel.

675
01:10:05,221 --> 01:10:06,385
Ariel, I am okay.

676
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:16,067
Ariel, wake up.

677
01:10:27,582 --> 01:10:30,483
Ariel, the idol.

678
01:11:10,355 --> 01:11:12,016
Oh, God. Oh, God.

679
01:12:00,135 --> 01:12:01,134
No.

680
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:05,100
No. No.

681
01:12:50,281 --> 01:12:53,340
- Paul.
- Ariel.

682
01:13:27,582 --> 01:13:28,912
Come on.

683
01:13:58,209 --> 01:13:59,801
Hey.

684
01:14:00,011 --> 01:14:01,875
What is it? You okay?

685
01:14:01,876 --> 01:14:05,675
Baphomet's evil has been trapped
in that house for over 50 years.

686
01:14:06,283 --> 01:14:08,183
We set it free.

687
01:14:09,887 --> 01:14:11,377
You're...

688
01:14:11,688 --> 01:14:13,518
You're saying the house...

689
01:14:13,519 --> 01:14:16,181
The house wanted us to succeed?

690
01:14:18,794 --> 01:14:20,455
I don't know.

691
01:14:24,767 --> 01:14:26,029
Let's go home.

692
01:20:44,617 --> 01:20:47,278
What is it?
I don't know.

693
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:50,182
I think it might be worth something.
