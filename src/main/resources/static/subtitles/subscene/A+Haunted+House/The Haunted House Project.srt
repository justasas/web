June 26, 2010

2
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:27,060
A documentary team,
which was filming a documentary about

3
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,823
'The Haunted House Explorers,'
went missing.

4
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,056
The six missing persons are:.

5
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:36,503
producer Lee Young-joo,
cameraman Choi Gyu-suk,
sound recorder Jung Ji-young,

6
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:40,132
'The Haunted House Explorers' club members
Lim Wan-soo, Won Mi-jin and Choi Woo-ram.

00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,936
June 28, 201 0

8
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,673
The production staff,
who went to look for them, found their tapes.

9
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:49,442
They were badly damaged.

10
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,186
July 5, 201 0

11
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,788
The tapes were digitally restored,

12
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:59,059
and their last remaining hours
can be witnessed through them.

13
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,117
Hello?

14
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,731
At 4:.40 AM on the day of the incident,
Won Mi-jin's call to the emergency line
was recorded.

15
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,395
Please help,
people are dead here...

16
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,338
Someone's tryni to kyll me!.

17
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,480
This is 'intro'
for the documentary

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,710
that producer Lee Young-joo was
working on prior to the incident.

19
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,236
This doesn't look right.

20
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,606
Do you know where you're going?.

21
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,198
Yeah, but GPS is off here.

22
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:02,304
One day someone called
Mr. Kim came to town,

23
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,184
and said he wanted
to build a factory.

24
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,053
When we asked
what kind of factory,

25
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,611
he said a cookie factory.

26
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,179
He built it and succeeded.

27
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,021
It was doing really well
for a couple of years.

28
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,731
People were slaughtered there.

29
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,097
Mr. Kim's family was butchered.

30
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,662
'Entyre Famyly Found Dead'

31
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,403
The killer?. Not caught yet.

32
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,772
Police just gave up.

33
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,846
It was a grudge,
it was a robbery,

34
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,251
so many possibilities popped up,

35
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,216
but there weren't any evidences
nor any leads.

36
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,621
Killer didn't kill just one person,
but five people.

37
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,754
I don't know how
he could sleep at night.

38
00:03:54,501 --> 00:04:02,601
Then... Mr. Kim had an affair
with a female worker.

39
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,246
His wife didn't know
about the affair,

40
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,977
but when she found out,
tragedy struck.

41
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:31,505
Just before his family was killed,
he had a relation with the secretary,

42
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,133
and had a big fight with his wife.

43
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,569
You could hear it from a mile away.

44
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:39,974
But...

45
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:49,451
after that incident...
the secretary disappeared.

46
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,460
She was reported missing,
we filed her missing.

47
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,625
But if that person
is not found in 60 days,

48
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,568
she's automatically
classified as deceased.

49
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:06,973
And the detectives in charge of the case
halted the investigation.

50
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,099
She was presumed dead.

51
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:12,003
One day the female
worker just vanished.

52
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:21,720
So the rumor was... it must've been
the president's wife who killed her.

53
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:32,065
People said the ghost
of the secretary

54
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,590
killed the president's entire family,

55
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:41,108
and that the body of the secretary's buried

56
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,338
inside the puddle beside the factory.

57
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:49,109
Afterwards,
the ghost would come out

58
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:54,682
wearing white dress
and messy hair, screaming...

59
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,628
On rainy days, steam would rise
from the puddle.

60
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:06,588
But when you touch the
surface even in the winter,

61
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:11,304
there's absolutely no temperature.

62
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,295
Hot water's supposed to be hot.

63
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,571
That shop must be it.

64
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,040
It's a haunted house...

65
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,218
Just leavel.

66
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:36,495
Head of the village thought
he had to do something,

67
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,698
so he called a shaman for an exorcism,
it was a huge exorcism.

68
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:44,828
But he passed out foaming
at the mouth.

69
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,744
Then they heard the body
was in the puddle

70
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,646
so the police called in
a hydraulic shovel

71
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,086
to dig the puddle.
But it crashed and the operator died.

72
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,656
After the rumor of ghost appearing

73
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,715
from there, no one went near it.

74
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,091
It was quiet for
a few years but

75
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,593
a new rumor started
several days ago.

76
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,469
They say kids saw
a bleeding female ghost

77
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,205
while playing there.

78
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,673
And one of them
went crazy afterwards.

79
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:27,005
It's that corner shop, yeah,
that shop owner's daughter.

80
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,849
She was a smart kid but she became

81
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,612
an idiot after going there
with her friends.

82
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:35,355
You should not go there.
You'll not come out alive.

83
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,882
The ghost will possess
whoever enters the house.

84
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:43,826
It will kill you
without you knowing,

85
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,520
no one comes out alive.

86
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:05,240
Possessed by ihosts
THE HANTED HOASE PROJECT

87
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,990
The following is shot
by producer Lee Young-joo
and cameraman Choi Gyu-suk

88
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,753
during their trip to the house prior
to the main shoot.

89
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,821
I think we're lost...

90
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,864
Should I call him?.

91
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,103
Yeah, do it.

92
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,127
Hold on...

93
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,004
Do you know where you're going?.

94
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,669
Ah, hello?.

95
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,505
Wan-soo?. Oh, hi.

96
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:40,751
We're looking for the house but
we can't find it with your directions.

97
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:45,488
We're passing Bokwang Steel right now.

98
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,191
- Yeah, head straight...
- Look out, a truck.

99
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,394
One moment.

100
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,703
The road's really rough here...

101
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,142
A temple sign straight ahead?.

102
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,602
Then turn left?.

103
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,438
Hold on...

104
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,817
Is it beside the building
with blue roof?.

105
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,884
How would he know like that?.

106
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,687
- I'm not sure...
- Over there, we found it.

107
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,264
Ah, I found the temple sign.

108
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,062
Yeah, that's it...
Great, thank you.

109
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,436
We're here.

110
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,230
How do you find a place like this?.

111
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,672
That's what I'm saying.

112
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,144
Did the intro come out all right?.

113
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:42,478
It has to be good...
I have to debut with this.

114
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,043
All right.

115
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,378
You'll be big help.

116
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,355
Didn't the shaman
say there's a ghost?.

117
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,389
That would be nice.

118
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,785
'Chanisoo Food, InC.'

119
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,257
Gyu-suk, the sign over here.

120
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,136
Safety line's in the way.

121
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,713
- Should I cut it?.
- Yeah.

122
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,596
This ain't too bad.

123
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,076
Isn't your camera still on?.

124
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,014
Huh?. What the...

125
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,180
Something there?.

126
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,047
No, nothing.

127
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,716
Gyu-suk, hurry up, let's go.

128
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,436
This place is really grim...

129
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,851
This must be the puddle
where the accident took place...

130
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,393
where that hydraulics
operator got hurt.

131
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,434
It was like this for 1 0 years...

132
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,099
Do you think there really is
a body down there?.

133
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,069
You think it's real?.

134
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,773
I doubt it.

135
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,351
What the... an attic room?.

136
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,925
I guess old houses had these.

137
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:16,870
I'll go check it out.

138
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,894
Yeah?. Okay.

139
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,471
It's very narrow.
Need help?.

140
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,209
Up you go.

141
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,345
- Be careful...
- Damn... so dustyl.

142
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,448
Careful.

143
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,212
Have fun!

144
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,882
Ah! Shit!

145
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,153
Hey, are you okay?.

146
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,401
Gyu-suk, I'm gonna
look around outside.

147
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,491
Yeah.

148
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,847
- Are you in charge here?.
- Who are you?.

149
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,253
Are you in charge?.!

150
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,754
- No, I'm not...
- Turn that damn camera off!

151
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,291
Sir, just a moment!

152
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,300
We're planning to
shoot something here.

153
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,426
Shoot what?.

154
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,336
We're here to check out
the location of our doc.

155
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,273
There's an online club that explores
these haunted houses...

156
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,470
Turn that damn thing off!
You son of a bitch!

157
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,942
He's not shooting.

158
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,807
- A documentary?.
- Yes sir.

159
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,176
What kind of doc?.

160
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,986
Leave. Both of you.

161
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,248
Who are you?.

162
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,981
Are you the current owner?.

163
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,759
Leave! I said leave
the fucking premise!

164
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,690
No need to swear at us.

165
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,700
Couldn't you let us film?. We...

166
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,848
I don't think he's the owner...

167
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,585
He looks crazy.

168
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,314
Yeah, crazy all right.

169
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,152
What a basket case.

170
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,745
Godammit...

171
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,051
Hello?.

172
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,222
Yeah, what?.

173
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,727
We came down to see the place.

174
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,026
Yeah.

175
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,738
Whatever, it's weird here.

176
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,571
Some asshole just came
and bitched at us.

177
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,540
And the camera
doesn't go into standby.

178
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,370
Then I scraped my leg.

179
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,274
Yeah.

180
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:21,052
We'll talk when I come back
after the shoot.

181
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,849
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,621
It's on again...

183
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,792
What is that?.

184
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:22,638
'Another Happy Day!. '
'Always HyiyenyC'

185
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,772
Shit...

186
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:55,948
What the...

187
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,444
Damn it!

188
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,098
Huh, what's wrong with this?.

189
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,803
Gyu-suk, what happened?.

190
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,136
Are you okay?.

191
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:32,509
This is edited footage of the
restored tape found at the scene.

192
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,059
How's the camera?.
Is it fixed?.

193
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,218
Yeah, it's fine.

194
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,621
Absolutely sure?.

195
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,061
Yep!

196
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,228
Why aren't they here already?.

197
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,929
Shouldn't you call them?.

198
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,472
Hello!

199
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,035
Oh, hi there!

200
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,112
I'm sorry we're late.
It was a bit confusing getting here.

201
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,515
But we met around here last time.

202
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,382
Yeah, but it was still confusing...
I'm sorry.

203
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,087
Okay, let me introduce you to
our cameraman.

204
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,188
- And our sound recorder.
- Hello.

205
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,056
Hello.

206
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,546
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

207
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,192
Is it just two of you?.

208
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,728
No, there's one more...
She's not here yet?.

209
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:16,662
Where is she...

210
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,290
We live far away from each other
so we decided to meet up here.

211
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,766
She said she wasn't far.

212
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,324
- Is that so?.
- Yeah.

213
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,370
- She'll be here soon.
- Ah, there she is.

214
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,463
Mi-jin! Over here!

215
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,339
Yep, that's the one.

216
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,138
You sure have a lot of luggage.

217
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,748
We'll be staying overnight.

218
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,114
Hello.

219
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,015
- Hurry up!
- Hurry!

220
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,860
- So we're all here then?.
- Yeah, everyone's here.

221
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,320
Nice to meet you.

222
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,022
Pleased to meet you!

223
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,595
We'll be on our way soon,

224
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,968
so... Iet's make a great show!

225
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,900
Sure!

226
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,195
We'll do our best!

227
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,763
Thank you!

228
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,873
Okay, Wan-soo,
could you briefly introduce your team?.

229
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,636
- Right now?.
- Yeah, one at a time.

230
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,141
Ah, okay.

231
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,549
First of all,

232
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:16,078
this is our club's youngest,
'Black Widow', aka Won Mi-jin.

233
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,523
Hello.

234
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,686
She's the most
beautiful girl in our club.

235
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:26,593
Beside him is Choi Woo-ram,
or 'Horror Master'.

236
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:32,936
Lastly I'm the club administrator,
'Ghost Hunter' Lim Wan-soo.

237
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,642
Thank you.
Before we leave,

238
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,633
I would like to conduct
individual interviews.

239
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,682
I'd like to ask you about the expedition
so answer them naturally.

240
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,649
Sure thing.

241
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,510
How was this expedition organized?.

242
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,986
Our club was formed in 2003
and has been active since then.

243
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:54,183
Currently there are over a thousand
registered members.

244
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:57,922
But those who participate
in expeditions are about 40-50.

245
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,133
We have regular expeditions with
the entire members every year.

246
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,636
Or with a core group
for the purpose of research.

247
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:10,633
In this case, think of it as a field
investigation with permanent members.

248
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,478
- So you're all permanent?.
- Yes.

249
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,070
Is it usually three of you?.

250
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:20,913
Well, Woo-ram and I are
the regulars in today's expedition.

251
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,982
We often swap one or two members
pending expedition conditions.

252
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,490
So this time,
we decided to go with three members.

253
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:33,323
I see. How many members
are usually enough?.

254
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,769
We take photos and
investigate with equipment,

255
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,293
so it's different every time,

256
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,139
but usually two or three.

257
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,007
Like today?.

258
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,635
Yes. We brought six members
at one time,

259
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,804
but it was hard to concentrate
with so many people,

260
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:52,179
so three is just right
for the purpose of field investigation.

261
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,450
Okay!

262
00:20:55,054 --> 00:21:00,356
Mi-jin, during the interview,
you could look at me or the camera.

263
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,749
Let's do it!

264
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:06,294
I heard this is your first expedition,
how do you feel?.

265
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:14,397
Um, well... A little excited
and intimidated

266
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,502
but I really want to see a ghost.

267
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:22,940
I've only observed through
writings or pictures at our site...

268
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,518
It's okay,
just say what you feel.

269
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,251
I forgot...

270
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,394
You've only seen pictures,

271
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,487
how would you feel
if you see one in person?.

272
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:46,404
I don't think seeing it in person would be
as scary as the writings and photos

273
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,769
I've seen at our club...
I can't do this.

274
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:54,810
Okay, I heard this is your
first expedition, how do you feel?.

275
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:03,884
I'm excited and intimidated but
I really want to see a real ghost.

276
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:09,695
And it wouldn't be as scary
to see it myself

277
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:13,688
than the writings and
photos I've seen online.

278
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,068
Is that okay?.

279
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,330
Yeah, that's great.

280
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:22,173
When did you first get interested
in ghost expeditions?.

281
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:27,607
Yeah, I've always enjoyed
horror movies and thrillers,

282
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:34,219
and I wondered what it would be like
to experience it myself.

283
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,787
So it was around high school?.

284
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,221
That's when I started.

285
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:46,394
Wan-soo, or Ghost Hunter,
I met him and learned a lot from him.

286
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,569
It was like that for a while,
but I'll be drafted to military soon.

287
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,596
So I told him,
we should go somewhere hardcore.

288
00:22:54,974 --> 00:23:02,210
He said there was a place where no one
dares to enter because it's so haunted.

289
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,373
That's how I first heard
about this place.

290
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,184
I got very excited when I heard
we're really going there.

291
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:12,217
Was there a particular reason
for choosing this house?.

292
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:19,556
Yes, after hearing about the place,
I checked it out while passing by.

293
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:25,226
It was during the day,
but it still felt very weird.

294
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:33,201
But most of all, I took a picture there
and something was caught in it.

295
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,414
A picture?.

296
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:39,441
Yes. I posted it up
on our club once.

297
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,579
There was a lot of debate,

298
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:47,760
and Wan-soo and
I talked about it,

299
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,628
and he said this would be
our next expedition.

300
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,529
That's why I'm very excited.

301
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,528
Could we see the picture?.

302
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:59,729
I don't think it's a good idea
to show the picture here.

303
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,872
Perhaps next time...

304
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,132
Why?.

305
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,667
It's a picture that was pulled down...

306
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,845
You said you would show it to us.

307
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,447
Is it that reflection
on the window?.

308
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:12,642
Yes.

309
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,922
It kind of looks like a face.

310
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,584
Doesn't it?.
I knew it was a ghost right away.

311
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:24,763
When you took this,
was there anyone around the house?.

312
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,458
Nope, I was all alone.

313
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,369
'The Haunted House Explorers'

314
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,607
We'll get a shot of you guys arriving.
Woo-ram, right?.

315
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:35,403
Yes.

316
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,340
You'll enter from
that side with her,

317
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:42,681
Woo-ram, I mean Wan-soo, you'll
greet them from here and get in the car.

318
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:43,545
Okay, okay.

319
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,476
Ms. Jung, please get ready.

320
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:46,844
We'll begin now!

321
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:49,814
- Please go ahead, Wan-soo.
- Okay.

322
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,919
Over here. Good to see you.

323
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,122
Hey!

324
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:21,153
- Didn't sleep well?.
- Shoot inserts of signs as we go

325
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,519
Iike you're doing now.

326
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,691
There'll be plenty of things to shoot.

327
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,629
Wan-soo, how many expeditions
have you done?.

328
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,324
Last year I think l...

329
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,499
Have you had lunch yet?.

330
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,261
Yeah, we had some.

331
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:43,108
Why don't we stop by at a rest stop
and get some snack for the road?.

332
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,405
Walnut cookies! Walnut cookies!

333
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,669
- Closer?.
- Yeah.

334
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,502
Okay.

335
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,552
- How's this?.
- Yeah, lower it a bit.

336
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:27,780
- Got it.
- Okay.

337
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:32,483
- Let's start with them entering.
- Producer, could you check the angle?.

338
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,716
Careful, careful.

339
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,339
Floor's slippery so watch your feet.

340
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,707
Who stepped on this beforehand?.

341
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,980
Why must we go through here?.

342
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,354
Okay?.

343
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,695
Here, over here.

344
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:56,734
Look around...
Tons of dust so be careful, Mi-jin.

345
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,742
It's asbestos all around.

346
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,315
Are you all right?.

347
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,029
What happened?.

348
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,590
Wan-soo, we'll get a shot
from inside.

349
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:25,537
Please do what you just did,
look around and flash the light,

350
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,574
see what's on the floor
and on the walls.

351
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:30,309
- You got it?.
- Yep, yep.

352
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,573
And look as natural as possible.

353
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:36,248
If you're expressionless,
it'll look dull on the screen.

354
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:39,485
Shine the light, look intrigued
and use a lot of gestures.

355
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:41,119
- Okay, okay.
- Let's do it.

356
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,156
- We'll start beforehand.
- Okay.

357
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,623
- Give us a sign!
- One sec.

358
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:50,929
Producer Lee, can you ask Wan-soo to
not point the flashlight at the camera?.

359
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,556
Okay, I got it.

360
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,766
- Everyone! Wan-soo!
- Yeah?.

361
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:59,605
When we shoot, could you not
point the flashlight towards the camera?.

362
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,940
Point it at the wall
or the ground.

363
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,276
- Okay!
- Let's shoot!

364
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,937
- Yeah!
- Ready?.

365
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:06,974
Yep.

366
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,380
Camera!

367
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,181
Hold on!

368
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,582
- What?.
- Am I in the shot?.

369
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,847
No, but you can go in deeper.

370
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,588
Okay, let's begin.

371
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,918
Sound!

372
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,658
- Is sound ready?.
- Roll!

373
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,361
Cue!

374
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,196
Let's go this way.

375
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,284
Mi-jin, dust will fly everywhere
if you touch that.

376
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,582
It's covered in asbestos, remember?.

377
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,351
It's bad for your hands too.

378
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,448
Mi-jin, cue!

379
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,614
Ms. Jung, be careful.

380
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:35,924
Watch your head.

381
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,264
This looks like kitchen.

382
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,631
Ouch!

383
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,299
Hey, be careful!

384
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,469
You good?.

385
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:55,983
Over here,
the dining hall's here.

386
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:00,050
That cracked mirror looks
like a kid's face.

387
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,551
Wow! That's amazing.

388
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:14,939
Come.

389
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,600
Hold it up like this... Whoa!

390
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,211
Be careful.

391
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,108
Mi-jin, don't wander around,
it might be dangerous.

392
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,546
Hold on, I'll step on it first.

393
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,052
- Are you okay?.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

394
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:29,984
It just sounds loud.

395
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,618
Here, here. Watch your feet.

396
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,893
Keep rolling, they look
natural resting like that.

397
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,065
Hey kitty!

398
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,578
Tired?. Feeling okay?.

399
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,385
Drink some water and rest a bit.

400
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,081
- We'll rest some and move on.
- Drink some water.

401
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,957
Washroom?. Go ahead.

402
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,049
Thank you.

403
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:20,338
- Hey! Hey!
- What's going on!

404
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:20,895
How?.!

405
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,368
I'm... fine.

406
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,468
- Woo-ram!
- I'm sorry.

407
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,884
I was so startled before.

408
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:37,951
Who does a prank like that?.

409
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,323
Only in grammar school.

410
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,950
They're just kids.

411
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,858
- They feel like kids.
- Yeah.

412
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:53,595
Maybe I can plant some tricks,
we might get some good reaction shots.

413
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,741
You could do that for the night shoot.

414
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,732
Yeah?. Okay.

415
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,419
Almost there.

416
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:17,222
- Over there, a door!
- We're here!

417
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,708
Let me explain the layout
of the premise.

418
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,977
That right there is...

419
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,111
What's that over there?.

420
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,238
That?. It's storage.

421
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,681
Oh, not the factory?.

422
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,452
This building is the
owner's private residence.

423
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:41,714
I see...

424
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,012
We'll spend the night here...

425
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,624
What about that?.

426
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:48,821
And that's the employees' dorm.

427
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,958
Interesting layout over there.

428
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:58,001
I can't quite figure out whether
that's a storage or factory.

429
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,968
Careful with second floor,
don't go up there alone at night.

430
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,099
It's dangerous.
Can't see anything at night.

431
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,779
- Sir! Let's take a picture!
- We have to take a group photo!

432
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:08,513
Um, l...

433
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:12,210
- Just one picture! Please! Come!
- Ms. Jung, join us.

434
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,754
Sir! Sir!
Take a photo with us!

435
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,857
- No, I'm fine.
- It's to commemorate.

436
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:20,154
No, it's okay.

437
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,522
Then, could you take the photo?.
Could you do that?.

438
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:27,699
Is it just point and shoot?.

439
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,767
Yeah just click the button.

440
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,463
- Wan-soo, over here.
- Stand beside me, Ms. Jung.

441
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,201
It's a special occasion.

442
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,231
Strike a pose everyone.

443
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,406
Ready?.

444
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,037
Two, three!

445
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,851
Done.

446
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,079
Thank you.

447
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:54,092
- Will you upload it?.
- No, not to our site.

448
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,160
What's wrong with this?.

449
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,491
We'll only upload what we take.

450
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,294
This is called elord.

451
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,898
This is usually used by
those practicing feng shui

452
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:34,490
in order to find water underground.

453
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:38,570
So when presence of spirit
or water is detected,

454
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,698
the rods spread apart like so.

455
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,768
This is called EMF detector.

456
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,437
It's originally used to
detect electromagnetic waves,

457
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:52,484
but we use it to detect magnetic field
released by astral bodies,

458
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,645
and check it with this screen here.

459
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,387
This is a thermal camera.

460
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:05,130
Think of it as a thermometer
in a camera form.

461
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,590
Hypothetically, you would see
the shape of ghosts with it.

462
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,098
Woo-ram, have you seen a ghost?.

463
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:16,503
I haven't but my grandma
has seen them though.

464
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:17,709
Grandma?.

465
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:21,613
Yes. She was known
to possess such energy.

466
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:26,209
So I've heard many ghost stories
from grandma when I was young.

467
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:29,719
That's probably why
I think ghosts exist.

468
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:33,091
- Will you switch to different angles?.
- No, no. We'll follow them.

469
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:37,391
How's a shot from inside
then another following them?.

470
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,622
Sure, but should we go in
after the sun sets?.

471
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,768
- Am I doing this right?.
- Yeah.

472
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:17,025
Hm?. It's spreading.

473
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,031
What?.

474
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:23,099
Step aside for a sec.

475
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,039
Weird.

476
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,484
- Mi-jin?.
- Yes?.

477
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,645
Could you open that closet?.

478
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,013
I don't want to do it...

479
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:43,026
Something wrong?.

480
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,963
- It's fine, try it.
- No, I don't want to.

481
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:45,997
It's nothing.

482
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,191
No.

483
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,501
Wan-soo, could you open it then?.

484
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,799
Sure... Hold this.

485
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,074
Here we go.

486
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,749
Could you lift up the clothes there?.

487
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,652
- Down here?.
- Yeah, yeah.

488
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,630
I gotta put on my gloves.

489
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,597
Why the gloves?.

490
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,267
It'll get really dusty.

491
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,136
It doesn't suit you.

492
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,116
Gyu-suk! Gyu-suk!
Come out now!

493
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:39,344
Please come out!

494
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,419
- Gyu-suk!
- Come out! Come out!

495
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,046
- Go!
- Mi-jin!

496
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,946
- Gyu-suk!
- Come out!

497
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,130
- Was anyone outside?.
- What just happened?.

498
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,164
Did you see that?.

499
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,233
Did someone throw something
from outside?.

500
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:56,835
Did you capture all that?.

501
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:57,936
- Yeah.
- Got it?.

502
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,370
- Ms. Jung?.
- I got the breaking sound.

503
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,428
How...

504
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,666
- Wasn't anybody outside?.
- Are you okay, Mi-jin?.

505
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:07,837
Mi-jin, you okay?.

506
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,082
- I think...
- I think the DP should go in alone

507
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,550
and shoot some footages.

508
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,986
Let's wait till tomorrow morning,

509
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:16,254
when it's bright.
I think that's the best way.

510
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,778
No, that's not right.

511
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,325
I'm just concerned about
the kids getting hurt.

512
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:23,886
Wan-soo, we can't do that.
We'll go in and shoot first.

513
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,686
Go on.

514
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,988
Hold on a sec.

515
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:58,629
What?.

516
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,632
I should've done this before.

517
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:01,973
What is that?.

518
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,965
- Spraying salt will help repel ghosts...
- Really?.

519
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,246
- Okay, ready.
- Let's go.

520
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,576
Hey! Hey!

521
00:45:58,022 --> 00:45:59,819
Take the camera.
Ji-young, are you okay?.!

522
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:02,750
Oh my god!

523
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,120
Ji-young!

524
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:07,965
Quickly!

525
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:08,863
Are you okay?.

526
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,434
Ji-young, catch this!

527
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,664
- Gyu-suk, be careful!
- Grab it!

528
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:14,562
Are you okay?.

529
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:20,401
Over here!

530
00:46:21,846 --> 00:46:22,676
Grab it!

531
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:30,610
Go find some towel for her.

532
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,484
Are you okay?.

533
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:34,792
Take this.

534
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,761
Producer Lee!
Please turn the camera off!

535
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:39,590
Turn it off!

536
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:41,591
Here, kitty!

537
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,160
Kitty!

538
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,876
- You okay?.
- Uh, yeah.

539
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,589
Are you shooting inserts?.

540
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:11,456
Come down.

541
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,369
It was a family of five.

542
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:34,551
4-year old, and 1 2-year old daughters
were found stabbed in their rooms.

543
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:41,190
And the 4-year old son
suffocated in the iron pot.

544
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:45,524
Mom's charred body was
discovered in the kitchen.

545
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:51,665
Father and president
of the factory Mr. Kim

546
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,632
was found hanging by his neck

547
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:58,799
in the second floor of
that building.

548
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:03,875
It happened on
a long holiday weekend,

549
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,916
so no one was at the factory.

550
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,317
Thus the bodies were
discovered late.

551
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:14,353
Police stated that
someone held grudge

552
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:18,427
against the family
but no one was arrested.

553
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:25,667
Another thing is, distant family
tried to sell the factory,

554
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:31,274
but probably due to the incident,
there weren't any buyers.

555
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:38,942
So the premise remained untouched
exactly as you see here,

556
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:42,247
since the lMF era 1 0 years ago.

557
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,702
Wait, wait, Mi-jin.

558
00:48:57,702 --> 00:48:58,691
Huh?.

559
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:20,874
It's so cold.

560
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:27,710
Is that good?.

561
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:29,618
Yes!

562
00:51:31,355 --> 00:51:32,379
Ms. Jung?.

563
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:33,353
Yeah?.

564
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,024
Is Gyu-suk there?.

565
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:36,819
He's not here.

566
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:38,822
They'll be tired then.

567
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,495
I'm about to pass out.

568
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:42,766
Have you caught a cold?.

569
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,960
No.

570
00:51:45,236 --> 00:51:48,000
- We look like caterpillars.
- Why aren't you sleeping already?.

571
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,101
We need a shot of you sleeping.

572
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:51,708
Okay! We can do that!

573
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:53,644
Please lay down for one minute.

574
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:54,678
Okay!

575
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,873
Mi-jin! Okay!

576
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:58,374
- One minute.
- Yes.

577
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:00,741
Woo-ram, please.

578
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:07,815
It's so cold!

579
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:22,695
Oh... Hold on... Hold on...

580
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:27,069
Producer! Producer Lee!

581
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,506
Yes?.

582
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,611
Could you come up for a minute?.

583
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,750
- Why?.
- Just a minute.

584
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:48,789
Go on.

585
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:53,263
I'm picking up strange noise,
I think you should check it.

586
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:58,639
What strange noise?.

587
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:10,386
Where is this coming from?.

588
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,719
I think it's from over there.

589
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,916
Come downstairs,
we need to talk.

590
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:19,029
Wan-soo, lay down
for one minute, okay?.

591
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:19,859
Okay.

592
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,407
Wan-soo, which way?.

593
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:05,803
Up and turn right.

594
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,248
What the heck?.

595
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:11,835
What are you doing now?.

596
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:18,013
This is something we do
on every expedition.

597
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:24,979
Think of it as a spell that will
bring out the ghosts living here.

598
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:31,520
We put the rice
at the bottom like this,

599
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,357
and light the candle on top of it.

600
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:36,929
Then,

601
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:51,304
cover the pot with this paper and
receive message from ghost through soot.

602
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,683
It's a superstition.

603
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,201
I'll be back.

604
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:46,795
- Okay, starting timer!
- Be careful!

605
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:48,172
Where are you going?.

606
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:54,111
I'm on a mission to find an object
at the site of murders.

607
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:57,581
We hide something
for each other to find.

608
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:58,980
That's what I have to do.

609
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:19,091
What do we do while waiting?.

610
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:21,363
Check the time,

611
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:22,766
- and see how long he takes.
- No, not that...

612
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:25,132
Hey, I found it!

613
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,694
Good job!

614
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:30,140
Why did you hide it there?.

615
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,441
Scared the hell out of me.

616
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:32,772
- Stopping timer.
- How long did I take?.

617
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,240
3 minutes and 8 seconds.

618
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:36,569
Not too bad.

619
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:38,375
It was pretty quick.

620
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,282
You did well.

621
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,517
- Mi-jin, it's your turn.
- You're up.

622
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:46,356
- I really have to go alone?.
- Of course!

623
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,722
- He did it on his own.
- Yeah, it was just me.

624
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:50,083
Are you ready?.

625
00:58:50,294 --> 00:58:51,386
Don't be nervous!

626
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,191
I'm ready!

627
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:21,208
Mi-jin! Mi-jin!

628
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,540
Mi-jin! Are you okay?.!

629
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:27,845
Mi-jin! Snap out of it!

630
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:33,723
Mi-jin! Wake up!

631
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:35,384
Take her shoes off!

632
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,527
Is there water?.

633
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,321
Woo-ram, check the bag!

634
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:16,490
She's not breathing!

635
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,925
Are you calm now?.

636
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:21,461
Yes.

637
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:27,766
Would it be okay if I interview you
about what happened?.

638
01:02:30,347 --> 01:02:31,279
Okay.

639
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,489
Ground was damp...

640
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,897
When I sat down,
the ground was damp.

641
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:50,567
I think my hand got wet.

642
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:53,730
I shook the water off
with my fingers.

643
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:57,474
Then... there was total silence.

644
01:02:57,474 --> 01:02:59,237
It was quiet for a moment...

645
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:04,439
Suddenly... suddenly
I had a weird sensation...

646
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:08,177
Into my pants...

647
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,953
Pants?.

648
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:17,959
Like something came in and out.

649
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:21,324
What went inside your pants?.

650
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,800
I don't know...

651
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,770
Can you describe
the texture or feeling?.

652
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,101
Tell us about that.

653
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:39,643
It was hair...

654
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:42,950
Hair?. Are you sure?.

655
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:49,258
Hair... Iong hair...

656
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:53,786
Did you see what color it was?.

657
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:56,099
It was hair...

658
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,167
Just hair?.

659
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:58,602
I think it was just hair... hair...

660
01:03:58,602 --> 01:04:00,399
Could you explain
a bit more in detail?.

661
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,835
Did you see it?.

662
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:07,408
Do you remember
what kind of hair it was?.

663
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:11,675
- It was... human hair...
- One moment.

664
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,385
I think it's best we
continue this later.

665
01:04:17,988 --> 01:04:21,549
Could you do that later?.
Please turn it off.

666
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:41,735
Please don't...
Can't you see she's sick?.

667
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:44,680
Turn the camera off.

668
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:51,815
Don't! I said don't shoot!

669
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,523
Mi-jin! Mi-jin!

670
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:57,725
Slowly,

671
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,256
drink slowly.

672
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:01,294
Take it easy.

673
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:04,234
That's enough!

674
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:06,636
Woo-ram, go to the car
and bring some meds.

675
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:07,370
- Meds?.
- Yeah.

676
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,438
- Okay.
- Hurry up!

677
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:09,803
Mi-jin, are you okay?.

678
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,877
What are you doing?.
What's wrong?.

679
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:22,942
What?.

680
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:24,445
I'm leaving...

681
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,655
Mi-jin, where are you going?.
Wait a minute, will you?.!

682
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:31,761
Mi-jin, you're not well,
you shouldn't leave in this condition.

683
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,530
Rest up.
Take a break and go.

684
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:36,066
Yeah, where will you go
in the middle of the night?.

685
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:37,465
Ms. Jung, we should leave together.

686
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:39,164
We can't continue.

687
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,670
You think this is a joke?.

688
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,570
Then how can we go on
at this point?.

689
01:05:42,706 --> 01:05:46,642
Mi-jin, wait!
You were very startled earlier.

690
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,669
Come in!

691
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:52,179
What was that?.

692
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:53,907
I think it came from upstairs?.

693
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,122
Just leave! Run outside!

694
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:38,724
- Wait...
- What?.

695
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,331
- How can we just leave him there?.!
- Just leave for now!

696
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:42,821
Find the exit first!

697
01:06:42,899 --> 01:06:45,129
- No signal here!
- Hurry!

698
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:06,846
- What's going on?.
- Why are we back here again?.!

699
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:12,586
What is that?.

700
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:16,390
There! There!

701
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:19,462
Something's wrong here!

702
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,884
Damn it! This door's locked!

703
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:35,919
What?.

704
01:07:35,919 --> 01:07:37,079
Shit!

705
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:40,779
Anyone out there?.!

706
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:46,395
Go!

707
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,582
Producer!

708
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:16,984
Anyone outside! Please!

709
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,729
We were just here!

710
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:39,013
All right!

711
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,824
We'll never leave...

712
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:24,858
We have to find the exit!

713
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:29,362
Mi-jin, snap out of it!

714
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:34,465
We're locked in...

715
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:42,435
Wait a minute.

716
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:43,937
Wan-soo!

717
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:46,212
Where's Wan-soo?.!

718
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:47,642
Wan-soo!

719
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:50,714
Wan-soo!

720
01:09:58,161 --> 01:10:00,288
Wan-soo! Wan-soo!

721
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:12,740
Where did he go?.!

722
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:53,694
Please help...

723
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:57,629
Mi-jin, save me...

724
01:12:59,509 --> 01:13:02,945
Please help me, please!

725
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:06,039
Mi-jin, please...

726
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,650
Help me...

727
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:16,849
Mi-jin...

728
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:07,828
Gyu-suk...

729
01:15:13,576 --> 01:15:15,043
Is that you?.

730
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:24,910
Mi-jin!

731
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:15,720
Thys ys 911.

732
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:16,887
Hello?.

733
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:18,556
What's your emerienCy?

734
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:26,337
Please save me,
people are dead here...

735
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,808
Someone's trying to kill me...

736
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:30,901
Please stay Calm...

737
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:05,973
Leave! Leave!...

738
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:08,615
I told you to leave!

739
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:09,783
Leave!

740
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:25,321
We've lived here
for about 30 years.

741
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,989
Yes, that's about right.

742
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:35,260
1 5 years ago, someone came to town
and wanted to build a cookie factory

743
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:40,498
and built Changsoo Food.

744
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:46,564
His family arrived
and they were doing well.

745
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:49,007
But there was a female employee.

746
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:59,388
There was a rumor that she had
an affair with the president

747
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:01,913
but there weren't any evidences.

748
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:06,918
Suddenly the employee disappeared.

749
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:16,534
Another rumor went around
that the wife had killed the woman.

750
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:22,569
There was a big puddle
behind the factory.

751
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:28,550
Another rumor said
the wife had killed

752
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:34,113
the employee and
dumped the body there.

753
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:39,919
Mr. Kim's family was butchered.

754
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:44,533
When she first disappeared
no one took any actions,

755
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:52,074
but once the family was killed,
everyone took notice, even the police.

756
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:53,509
any witnesses and evidences,

757
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:56,745
neither for the disappearance
of the employee nor

758
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,475
the killing of the
owner's family.

759
01:21:59,548 --> 01:22:05,714
Then people started saying that
a ghost appears beside the puddle.

760
01:22:06,989 --> 01:22:10,793
The ghost would appear
and disturb villagers,

761
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:18,461
and on rainy days
steam would rise from the puddle.

762
01:22:19,835 --> 01:22:25,000
Some people say that they've seen the ghost
or a woman with disheveled hair.

763
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:31,340
Most people left town
and moved far away.

764
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:35,116
Aside from several elders, who can't leave,
there's no one left here...
