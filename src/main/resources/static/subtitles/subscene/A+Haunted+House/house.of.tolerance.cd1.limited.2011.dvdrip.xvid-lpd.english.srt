You stay until the clients go,

371
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,686
but get up when you want.

372

When you get up,
go down to the dining room.

373
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,555
You never go out alone.

374
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,289
Only with Madame or a man.

375
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,298
If you're alone outside,
that's soliciting.

376
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,561
At around 4:00, we wash.

A hairdresser comes at 6:00.

384

He can curl your hair,
dye it and so on.

385

You don't pay him.
Madame does.

386
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,984

one particular way,

387

You buy your own.

and a few drops of mouthwash.

397

00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,067
Check his body for rashes too.

404

Any doubts, don't have sex.

405

what do you do?

- Yes, you talk.

Find out what he's like
and adapt.

417
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,768
- After a while,
you get the same ones.

418
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,677

and make them come.

419

But fake it during sex.
