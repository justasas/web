00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,493
Like, I hit you with the force,
like with the follow-through.

511
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,330
I wanna instant replay
that shit. Damn!

512

God, I hope this works.

515
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,099
What is that thing?

516
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,103
That is not human.

517
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,785
That was weird.

520
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,070
I caught your ass!

521
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,655
No, you didn't.

522
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,490

It's your box.

524
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,007
What?

525
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:51,011
I want you to touch me.

526
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,847
Mmm.

527
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,350
Okay.

528
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,273
Not that box.

529
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,698
You know I love you and
those kids, right? Yeah.

530
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,950
And I'm gonna do everything in my
power to keep you guys protected.

531
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,326
Yeah.

532
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,081
What was that?
What?

00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,544
That!
The wind?

535
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,298
Nigga, the windows
are closed! Okay?

536
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,550
I'm tellin' you, that was
either a ghost or a demon.

537
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,760
Or maybe it was a demon
pregnant with a ghost.

538
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,389
Oh, this is cute!

539
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,810
I will so wear this,
all day, every day.

540

(GASPS)
What if it's a burglar?

541
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,899
Why the fuck are you
excited? It's a burglar!

542
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,984
Either way it goes,
it's some scary shit!

543
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,986
Okay,
not all burglars are scary.

544
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,572
It is a burglar or a ghost! If
you talk to him, he'll leave.

545
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,325
You shoot it in the face! If
you talk to him, he'll leave.

546
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,827
And if the motherfucker's foot do
this, you shoot him in the face again!

547
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,580
That is way too harsh.
What're you gonna do?

548
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,082
I know what I'm gonna do.
What're you gonna do?

549
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,417
Shoot him.

550
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,711
You are not allowed to shoot
anyone in the face, mister!

551
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,723
Becky?

552
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,101

Okay, gimme!

Get that thing outta here!
I got an idea!

Come on! Bitch,
why ain't you movin'? Fuck!

565

See, now this
is a good idea.

566
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,815

Havin' a tea party.
Oh.

You wanna go outside and do
somethin' a little bit more masculine?

No, not really.

Um, you know, Wyatt,
about your little buddy, Tony.

578
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:52,192
I don't think he's such a good
influence on you, know what I mean?

579

What the... That's straight
vodka! Tony calls it tea.

580
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,411

need to stop this friendship.

Tony doesn't think
that's such a good idea.

you tell Tony

shit gotta stop. It's gone too far.

with Megan, are you fuckin' crazy?

all right? This is my bad.

my stuffed animals.

you reached out.

What exactly
am I dealing with here?

you described to me

is a demon.

00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,084

from Babylonian times
named Aghoul.

639

And he's a trickster!

640
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,218
And chances are this is not your
first encounter with this demon.

641
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,221

experiences in your past?

to trick people into
bringing him into our world

and it can come through
the form of a possession,

a spirit that
only a child can see

661
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:56,353
or an ancient object that
lures in the impressionable.

is coming after me and my family.

what I'm saying.

Okay, well you need to start
remembering. She was fucking beautiful!

that's the... It's all this...

She's crazy! She was crazy,
baby, like she was possessed!

832
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,244
You mean she was possessive.
No, the bitch was possessed.

What?
Yes!

834
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,748

she was verbally abusive.

what's for dinner?

communicate with me.

bit. Yes, I can hear that.

847

Don't look at me.
Don't look at me!

Sometimes the victim may be
tormented by more than one demon.

1191
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,129
These cases lead
to transference.

That happened to me.

1201
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,566
I was first in prison, I was
tryin' to give myself head, right?

1202
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,276
'Cause I ain't know nobody.

1203
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,820
If I woulda knew somebody, I
wouldn't have had to do it to myself.

1204
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,448
And it wasn't no gay shit.
First get that out your head.

enough of your insolence!

nothin'. That's the only one I had.

00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,426
I used to have two shanks,
but I don't keep that anymore.

1233
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,802
I stopped doin' two shanks

1234
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,262
'cause it just
was a thang, and

1235
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,680
everybody was like,
"Two shanks. "

comin' over there

creepy lil' bitch again!

that bitch no more!

I just don't know
who else to go to.

1245
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,200
Let me just explain to you
why I became a priest.

00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,328
Now, obvious one is
for the little boys. Yes.

1247

What're you talkin' about?

1248
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,374
It's a joke, Malcolm!

1249
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,502
Oh, God, no, it was a joke.
I did that, you know,

1250
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,588
for the other priests
and we laugh, that's all.

1251
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:51,758
But I don't know if I can help
you with your demon situation

1252
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,470
because I haven't
been stayin' steady

1253
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,389
on my demon fightin' skills,
is what I'm tryin' to tell you.

1254
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,809
So Malcolm, day after day,

1255
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:07,524
when you know you can't win, you're
just prolonging the inevitable!

1256

All you gotta do
is let them in.

1257
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,987
Are you talkin'
about the Devil?

00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:14,740

with Bruce Jenner face?

1266

1267
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:34,635
He scares me at night!
And he on in daytime.

1268
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,887
He don't look like the nigga
that was on the Wheaties box!

1269
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,890
And Kanye! And Kanye!
And Julianne Hough!

1270
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:44,186

took Kanye and they changed him.

Doug, you gotta let go of me!

1275
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:54,655
There's no place you can hide.
He has a plan for you.

1276

He will get you!

1277
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,408
Doug, get your hands off me!

1278
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,744
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

1279
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,871
(POUNDING ON WINDOWS)

1280
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,582
Ow!

1281
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,669
Oh, you're the one that got
us out here in the hot heat!

1282
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:11,588
Making me bang all on the
windows with my good church hat!

1283
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,341
Hon, I could be at home
watchin' that new Madea movie!

1284
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,467
What's the name
of that Madea movie

1285
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,302
with the little girl
from The Fresh Prince?

1286

head of NASA! With the aliens!

00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:26,562
(MUMBLING) Hold up,
ain't you that brother

1290
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,273
that just moved
into old Burton place?

1291
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,192
Yeah, it's just...
With a white woman!

1292
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,902
Well, she's not
all the way white.

1293
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,572
She's a white woman,
damn near clear!

1294
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:40,993
Come on now, it's 2013. Interracial
relationships is not a big deal.

1295
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,288
What? You need to
tell that to the lonely sista.

1296
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,998
Look at this one right here.
Right here!

1297
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,542
Honey, show him how you
drop it like it's hot!

1298
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,837
Whoo! Hold up, Bertha, hold up. Hold
up. We ain't got no defibrillator.

1299
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:53,630
Oh, you know what it is
with the white girl?

1300
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,466
They do that cungalingus,
the finga-ligga-linga.

1301
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,927
What is it, the fellatio?
MALCOLM: Uh...

1302
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,554
That's what it is,
they go deep.

1303
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:01,888
You know they
ain't got no insides.

1304
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,682
I think that's my cue to go.

1305
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:06,602
Excuse me, sistas.
Have a good sermon.

1306
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,186
Where you goin'?

1307
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,605
MALCOLM: Love is love.
You're so bitter.

1308
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,897
See?
MALCOLM: You angry.

1309
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:14,735
Brothers be trippin'. That's
why I got me a white man at home.

1310
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,778
Yeah, girl.
WOMAN: Vanilla my flavor.

1311
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,074
PROFESSOR: Hello, Malcolm.

1312
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,409
Oh, Professor Wilde,
thank God.

1313
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,994
I've been tryin' to reach you!

1314
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,954
I'm sorry, Malcolm,
I've been a bit tied up.

1315
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,915
I haven't been able to find
any more on Aghoul,

1316
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,043
though my resources
are a bit limited.

1317
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,629
Uh, Professor?
Where the hell are you?

1318
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,131
Ooh, doin' a stretch
of five to 10.

1319
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,592
Apparently, the authorities
frown on sellin' meth

1320
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,636
to college students.

1321
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:42,220
Yeah, apparently.

1322
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,472
You need to hang up

1323
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:44,598
that computer call,

1324
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:47,059
come over here and kiss me
on my hot mouth.

1325
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,811
I'm feelin' romantical.

1326
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,981
Well, Malcolm,
I suppose I should get going.

1327
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,816
But I will be
e- mailing you the contacts

1328
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:55,984
of associates
who'll be able to help.

1329
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,653
I don't mean to be pushy,
but any way

1330
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,279
you could do that
before you get raped?

1331
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,531
What part of mandingo party

1332
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,700
do you not understand?

1333
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,161
It's time to power
the white rabbit.

1334
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:09,122
You know. Dirty the snow.

1335
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:10,957
Oh, I'm screwed.

1336
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,417
PROFESSOR: Don't!
That's not that bad.

1337
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,588
Lights, please. Thank you.

1338
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,717
So after several exhausting
days of the exorcism,

1339
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:24,054
I threw some holy water
on her, read an incantation

1340
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:27,683
and the demon left
the woman's body.

1341
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:31,103
(CHUCKLING) I suppose I just
sat back and watched.

1342
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:34,481
I mean, I'm just the medium
who puts her life in danger

1343
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:37,067
every time she reaches out
to demonic forces.

1344
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,778
But you've got a Bible
and a bottle of holy water,

1345
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,071
so you make
the world a safer place!

1346
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,490
The fact is, people,
is that God is real,

1347
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:46,785
the Devil is real,
and monsters exist.

1348
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,956
Well... They're vicious,
terrifying entities!

1349
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,750
But the good news is,
Santa Claus doesn't exist

1350
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,419
so you don't have to worry
about some creepy old guy

1351
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:56,920
coming down your chimney.
(ALL SOBBING)

1352
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,046
Okay...
Got your nose!

1353
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,799
So, what exactly are you guys?
And who the fuck hired you?

1354
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,301
You can call us
Ned and Noreen.

1355
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:06,096
See? This is why you
don't hire from Craigslist.

1356
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,556
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
Asshole!

1357
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:13,520
I don't understand why you
always have to take the credit!

1358
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,981
I mean, even your name comes
first on our book cover,

1359
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,691
and I am the one with a gift!
It's not my fault

1360
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,235
that Ned comes before
Noreen in alphabetical order!

1361
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,946
Is that why Ned comes
before Noreen in the bedroom?

1362
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,823
Just once I'd like
you to do that thing

1363
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,074
with your thumb
and your forefinger.

1364
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,534
I think they
call it the shocker?

1365
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:31,413
Yeah, well, I would like you to do
that thing with my balls and the...

1366
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,623
Hi!
Hi! Can we help you?

1367
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,668
Yes. Um, there's something
horrible happening in my house.

1368
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:39,129
My family doesn't realize
what's going on, but I do!

1369
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,548
I'm sure that there's
a rational explanation...

1370
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:42,716
Please! They're white!

1371
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,926
Oh, my God!
Why didn't you say that?

1372
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,261
Yeah,
you should lead with that!

1373
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:49,973
I mean, if you're black we just
assume that your hauntings are

1374
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,851
bill collectors or
racist police officers.

1375
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,853
But 99% of all hauntings

1376
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,813
happen to white people,
that's a fact.

1377
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,649
What he means to say is,
of course we'll help you.

1378
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,026
Thank you so much.

1379
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,111
So we're here to
help you people.

1380
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,655
And before you get worked up,
I mean "you people" as a couple.

1381
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,449
It wasn't racist
till you explained it.

1382
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:08,658
Yeah.

1383
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:11,161
The bad news is you have
a demon in your house.

1384
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,245
Here we go again.

1385
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:15,665
Okay, wait. So the house
really is haunted?

1386
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:19,169
Megan, it's not
the house that's haunted.

1387
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,172
A-ha! I knew it! I knew it!
It's always the little white girl.

1388
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,133
Think about it. The Exorcist,
The Last Exorcism,

1389
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,302
The Exorcism of Emily Rose.
All white girls.

1390
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,637
'Cause there ain't no black
parents gonna have

1391
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:29,971
no little white girl
talkin' like that.

1392
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,431
"Bitch, who are you?
Who're you cursin' at?

1393
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,099
"And turn
the fuckin' air down in here!"

1394
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,602
Malcolm, Malcolm, just
listen for a second. Yes.

1395
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:39,356
When we first met you, there
was something attached to you.

1396
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:42,025
Oh, that was a hemorrhoid.
That was... It's good now.

1397
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,736
This dark entity has
attached itself to him

1398
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,905
and now it's
feeding off of all of you.

1399
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,866
So what you're saying is that
this is all Malcolm's fault.

1400
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,952
That's right. Your family
could've left here at

1401
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:53,954
any time,
but now you're stuck.

1402
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,956
Like a piece of
toilet paper

1403
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,791
stuck on your shoe
when you leave the bathroom.

1404
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,043
And your wife knew the whole
time, but she didn't tell you

1405
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:03,046
because she wanted you to walk
around and look like an idiot.

1406
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:06,508
Oh, get over it! I'm not
the one who had an affair

1407
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,844
with some low-rent
palm reader from Akron!

1408
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,054
And you never would've known
if you weren't a psychic!

1409
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,889
But I am psychic, Ned!

1410
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,140
BOTH: Oh!
Ow.

1411
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,226
Shit!
What is that for?

1412
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,562
What you'll be thinking about
doing to Megan in two seconds.

1413
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,981
"Thinking about doing
to Megan?" One, two, see?

1414
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,735
Uh, guys,
we came on short notice.

1415
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,445
We may need
an extra pair of hands.

1416
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,406
Anyone you trust to help?

1417
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,575
I know a guy. He's Mexican.

1418
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,620
Megan,
let's go to your contacts.

1419
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,625
Hey, nice camera.
Right?

1420
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,919
I take it your third cousin
owns electronics shops.

1421
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:45,338
Eh, somethin' like that. He sells
them out of the back of his truck.

1422
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,924
It's a mobile operation.
Let me know if you want one.

1423
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,051
Hey, Ned, something weird.

1424
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:53,263
All these clocks stop at 3:27
when the hauntings happen.

1425
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:57,517
Normally, it's 3:07.
Nope, we're on CP time.

1426
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,937
The demon will manifest itself
in many ways.

1427
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:03,064
To your son,
it's his imaginary friend.

1428
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,317
To your daughter
it's the voice inside the box.

1429
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,777
For Malcolm it's that
sexy little doll Abigail.

1430
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:11,114
See? It's a manifestation! You
think I'd bang a doll for no reason?

1431
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,408
Malcolm! Shut up.
What we're about to do

1432
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:16,328
is the first step in banishing
the demon to the netherworld.

1433
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,455
Oh, what is that?

1434
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,291
This helps me communicate
with the demon.

1435
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,669
Organic,
hydroponically grown OG Kush.

1436
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,004
Very strong.

1437
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,467
This is some good shit.

1438
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:31,676
(CHUCKLES)

1439
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,511
Well, pass the mask, shit.

1440
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,430
NOREEN: We grow it ourselves.

1441
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:37,390
NED: High water bill.
(COUGHING)

1442
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:39,142
That's that shit right there!

1443
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,019
Let me get another hit.
I'm goin' to the Further.

1444
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:46,232
Tony, where are you?

1445
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,360
(CREAKING)

1446
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:51,363
Smells like that OG Kush.

1447
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,371
WYATT: Mom!

1448
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,667
What...
Becky!

1449
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,629
Cool!
Wyatt, get upstairs!

1450
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,714
MALCOLM: Wyatt, come on!
DEMON: Fuck you, you bitch!

1451
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,259
Why are you tying
my baby to a chair?

1452
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,928
Because the bitch
got a demon in her!

1453
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,721
BECKY: Make it stop!
(GROWLS)

1454
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,808
This is some scary
Cucuy shit right here, man.

1455
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,476
I don't know who Cucuy is.

1456
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,395
A Cucuy is a
ghetto Mexican bogeyman.

1457
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,146
Oh, like George Lopez.

1458
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,398
(CHUCKLES) I know, huh?

1459
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:29,275
I agree,
it is scary as fuck.

1460
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:31,736
(GROWLING) This spirit is
more powerful than I thought.

1461
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:34,572
We're gonna need to get a priest
and perform a real exorcism.

1462
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,909
I know a guy!
He's a little unconventional.

1463
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:41,538
I don't know, Malcolm.
(SCREAMING)

1464
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,415
I know, that bitch
don't look right.

1465
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:45,000
No, why you gotta
call her a bitch?

1466
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,501
You disrespecting
the little ho.

1467
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,336
Nigga,
did you just sell me out?

1468
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,422
There's certain words
that trigger white folk.

1469
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:53,717
I mean, bitch, ho, slut.
No offense.

1470
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,719
You can't say those words.
That's like our...

1471
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:56,803
Hey!

1472
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:57,929
What the hell are
you talking about?

1473
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,097
Are you out your damn mind?

1474
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,474
We would never say that.

1475
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,685
Oh, we would
behind closed doors.

1476
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,104
I mean, I wouldn't say it
in a bus or a waffle house.

1477
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,313
At the Atlanta Airport

1478
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:10,316
or in the parking lot of a
KFC, but, yeah, I would say it.

1479
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:12,318
Hey, I ain't your boy...
I got your back.

1480
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,070
This is a lovely
scarf you're wearing.

1481
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:15,780
It's a sash,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1482
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:18,533
I'm selling these. This a
part of my new clothing line,

1483
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,201
"Jesus Pieces,"
and I got, like,

1484
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,786
the shoe that
the Pope be wearin'.

1485
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:25,623
In leather, suede, in green,
brown, and the Pope hats!

1486
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,793
I can't keep that shit, you
know niggers love big hats.

1487
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,962
Okay, you know what, that's
enough. Thank you so much.

1488
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,466
That's right. Can we
help my daughter, please?

1489
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,593
Hell, she went
really white girl on me.

1490
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,470
"Oh, my God!"
I was like, "Whoa. "

1491
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:41,473
Speaking of white...
Are you doin' cocaine again?

1492
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,558
Cocaine?
No, man, this stuff's molly!

1493
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:46,394
ALL: Oh!
Can I try?

1494
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:47,979
It's all good.
NOREEN: Oh, wow.

1495

(TEETH CHATTERING)

1496
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,399
I'm gonna take
a little pinch for later.

1497
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:52,984
He's just bringing drugs?

1498
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,652
It's molly.
Wrap it up!

1499
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,071
Yeah, I'm sorry. I told you
he was unconventional.

1500
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:57,906
(GROWLING)

1501
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,032
All right.

Is it because I cuss a lot,

1553
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,284
Is it because I

that it was okay that
Chris Brown hit Rihanna?

01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:46,230
Oh.

1670
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,567
Puking like a runway model.

1671
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:52,028
I'm good. I'm good.
MEGAN: Are you done?

1672
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,280
You're gonna want to
Febreze all of this.

1673
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:56,407
You're gonna
wanna just clean this.

1674
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,784
I feel so much better now.

1675
01:14:58,869 --> 01:14:59,952
Whoo!

1676
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:01,245
ALL: Oh!

1677
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:03,414
(PANTING)
(GLASS SHATTERS)

1678
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:07,168
Can't be too sure. Oh, shit.

1679
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,419
I gotta get the
hell outta here.

1680
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:10,713
Once they see a black
guy in a pool of blood,

1681
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:12,089
you know who they're
gonna come after next.

1682
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:14,258
I gotta go. Hey, watch out!

1683
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:17,011
Now this place is clean.

1684
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:18,221
It sounded
better when I said it.

1685
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,306
Get the box.

1686
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:21,682
Thank you guys so much.

1687
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:23,267
No need to thank us.
We're happy to help.

1688
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:24,936
Come on, Ned.

1689
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:27,688
And we'll just take Abigail
with us as well, for safekeeping.

1690
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,440
Yeah, I know what you plan
on doing with that doll.

1691
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,235
What? No, I'm a professional.
She's a freak bitch.

1692
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:33,569
Stop it.
Trust me.

1693
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,113
Hey. How come Noreen ain't
pickin' up on the vibes?

1694
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:37,698
You know how when you're
trying to last longer,

1695
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:38,950
you think about baseball?
Mmm-hmm.

1696
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:41,702
It's kind of like that.
Throws a haze in their head.

1697
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:44,121
It's the only way to survive
when you're married to a psychic.

1698
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:48,292
Come on, Ned. I know you're
thinking about fucking that doll.

1699
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,253
Hey, hey, hey.

1700
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:57,260
You've had enough.
Bye, doll.

1701
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,556
(TELEVISION PLAYING)

1702
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:05,059
It's so nice being able
to just relax on the couch

1703
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:07,436
and watch The Bachelorette.
Yeah.

1704
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,480
(RUMBLING)

1705
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:11,023
Huh?

1706
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,276
(STAMMERS)
You didn't hear that?

1707
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:14,819
What?
(HINGES CREAKS)

1708
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:18,823
My nigga senses is tinglin'.
It's like my Spidey senses.

1709
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,993
Oh, would you hush?
It is fine!

1710
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,162
My white senses say we're fine. (LAUGHS)

1711
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,498
Everything's okay.
It's over.

1712
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,667
Okay? It's over.

1713
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:31,627
Okay, okay. I'm trippin'.
That's right.

1714
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,798
(SCREAMS)... dead white bitch!

1715
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,517
You already know how it's going
down, motherfuckers, all right?

1716
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,936
I looked on my
Dora the Explorer app,

1717
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,521
this the motherfuckin'
correct address.

1718
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:53,691
This ain't a drive-by, homie,
okay? This a walk-in, homie.

1719
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:56,319
So ain't no escape plan!
My cousin is in here, cuz!

1720
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:58,195
Y'all ready?

1721
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:03,367
Hey, yo, Malcolm! Whassup,

1722
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,036
RAY: Oh, shit!

1723
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:08,372
(SHRILL VOICE) What the fuck are
you doin', man? I gotta run for it!

1724
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:12,918
This is bullshit! Oh, my
God! I'm scared as fuck!

1725
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:14,420
(SOBBING)

1726
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:16,797
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1727
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:20,676
I'm good, dog. Let me get my
motherfuckin' bearings together, homie.

1728
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,219
(HUFFING)

1729
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,889
(WHISPERS) All right,
let's go up in there, cuz.

1730
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:27,183
It smell like
dead ass,

01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,226
baloney and sweat socks

1732
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:31,437
It smell like Honey Boo
Boo's boo-boo, homie!

1733
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,230
Malcolm?

1734
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:35,441
Where you at, cuz?

1735
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,905
Ain't nobody in here, cuz.

1736
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:44,033
Oh, shit!
Megan got fucked up!

1737
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:46,619
Head twisted all
backwards, niggie.

1738
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,914
Now, upon further
examination, my niggie,

1739
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:53,084
this white bitch smell like she

1740
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:56,587
I watch Dexter, niggie, CSI: New
York, Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta.

1741
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:59,048
Don't nobody get killed on
there, but they need to, my nigga.

1742
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:00,424
Stevie J.,

1743
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:03,219
This bitch smell

1744
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:06,430
Yah! Taekwondo! Oh, shit!

Oh, shit! There's another
dead body, cuz.

1750
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:26,617
Who the fuck is it, though,

01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,453

1754
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:37,628
Why the fuck they let
Doughboy live and Ricky dead?

1755
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,922
Doughboy was
the evil nigga, cuz!

1756
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,424
Oh!

1757
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,342
I can't believe this!

1758
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:46,053
See if the nigga got
some money, though.

1759
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:47,972
(SCREAMS)

1760
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:51,892
(GROANS)

1761
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:53,978

You know better than to be

MALCOLM: (GROANS)
You hit me with a brick!

All of them?
Even the little boy?

1769
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:11,162
He's on the back of a
motherfuckin' milk carton, niggie!

1770
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,414
Good. He may have lived.

1771
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:14,999
(HOUSE CREAKING)
Where's Kisha?

1772

The white girl's neck,
snapped it back.

1776
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,591
Kisha did that shit?

1777
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:25,426
Nigga, that bitch

You can't kill me! I'm like a
