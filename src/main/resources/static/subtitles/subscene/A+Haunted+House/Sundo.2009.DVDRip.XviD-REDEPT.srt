1
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:23,938
Why did you leave me?

2
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:12,899
My love,
I came back to fetch you.

3
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,457
You came back?

4
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,967
According to an ancient belief...

5
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,969
and based on experiences
by people whose friends...

6
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,805
or relatives have passed away...

7
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:51,059
a dying person often
is visited by the ghosts...

8
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:58,816
of their loved ones
who have already died.

9
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:05,077
We all have spirits who will fetch

10
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:10,077
We all have spirits who will fetch
each one of us in our final hours.

11
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,247
They are our...

12
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:18,710
HERALDS OF DEATH

13
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,476
Take cover.

14
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:13,248
- Go around them from the back.
- Take cover on the left.

15
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:26,910
Take cover.

16
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:03,958
Doctor, the patient
is hyperventilating.

17
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,709
Come on.

18
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:12,048
Check applicator.

19
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,001
Careful now.

20
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,423
This way.

21
00:06:57,424 --> 00:06:59,300
Move over there a little.

22
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,389
Oops!

23
00:07:05,473 --> 00:07:06,932
Why did you let go?

24
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:09,851
Please be careful.

25
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:11,353
We're sorry, ma'am.

26
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:12,395
Hello.

27
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:14,647
I'm still in Baguio.

28
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:17,066
Um, family matters.

29
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:19,735
No, no, no,
nothing like that.

30
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:23,489
Uh, I had mom's
remains transferred.

31
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:28,785
Are you really sure
of your plans?

32
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:34,666
That family is the cause
of your Papa's death.

33
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,627
Didn't you tell me yourself...

34
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:41,797
that even the land
isn't enough to pay...

35
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:46,260
for my brother's life,
your father?

36
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,640
And these papers won't bring
Papa back to life.

37
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,270
I want to end all this.

38
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:00,940
That is for you
to decide on, Louella.

39
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:05,819
If you really want to renew
ties with Romano's family...

40
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,446
I won't stop you.

41
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,489
But...

42
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:15,954
make sure that what you're doing
comes from the heart...

43
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:18,623
because when the time comes...

44
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,792
that everything you know
hasn't been forgotten yet...

45
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:26,672
and you discover that
you're not ready to forgive...

46
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,383
it might become
very difficult for you.

47
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,107
It's 500 pesos.

48
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:08,528
Don't forget to finish Mrs. Lapuz's
statue by Friday, okay?

49
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,072
- Yes, ma'am.
- Alright.

50
00:11:10,073 --> 00:11:11,907
Edong, take this to the
storeroom in the back.

51
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,367
- Okay, ma'am.
- Do it quick.

52
00:11:20,624 --> 00:11:22,833
Who is this?

53
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,785
Oh.

53
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,285
Hi...

54
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:30,924
Aunt Menggay.

55
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:33,601
- Louella?
- Hm.

56
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,345
Please come in.

57
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:38,139
Have a seat, please.

58
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,849
I'll just call Romano.

59
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,684
Make yourselves at home.

60
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:06,999
Romano?

61
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,418
Romano?

62
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,378
Come down here.

63
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:13,630
You have a visitor.

64
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:31,188
Isabel?

65
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,192
Sister, Louella?

66
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:38,277
Yes, it's me.

67
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:48,704
Sister Louella,
why did you leave so suddenly?

68
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:52,749
Louella.

69
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:04,927
How are you?

70
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:08,222
I'm okay.
How about you?

71
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:10,348
Baste.

72
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:11,808
Yes?

73
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:19,899
I came here
to give this back to you.

74
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:26,405
That caused the feud
between our families.

75
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:29,825
How about my debt
to your father?

76
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,245
He's no longer here.

77
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:37,915
I want to end whatever
misunderstanding we all have.

78
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:45,631
Thank you.

79
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:54,389
I also came here to tell you
that I have a doctor-friend...

80
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,099
an eye specialist.

81
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,936
Sabel might be interested
to have her eyes checked.

82
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:06,442
Brother, can we see him?

83
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:15,909
What'd you think made
Louella change her mind?

84
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:18,953
When she came home last year...

85
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:22,123
on the anniversary
of her father's death.

86
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:26,794
Linda said Louella kept drinking.

87
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:32,340
What's more, she was blaming
all of you for his death.

88
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:37,929
And now she's trying to
patch things up with you now.

89
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:44,101
I think there's nothing
wrong with that.

90
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:47,896
We've been friends
since we were young.

91
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:55,570
Well, I think it's high time
everything gets settled.

92
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:59,282
By the way, Isabel.

93
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:06,121
I'll have your clothes washed
and then get your bags packed.

94
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:09,124
Okay. Thank you.

95
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:18,675
Do you really want to see
a specialist again?

96
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:27,224
Why not?

97
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:30,018
Don't you want me to?

98
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,021
It's not that.

99
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,774
Just don't get your hopes up.

100
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:46,800
Brother, I'd prefer to have
something to hope for...

101
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,098
besides just missing you,

102
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:52,372
otherwise I will never
be able to see you.

103
00:16:01,214 --> 00:16:03,174
Alright.

104
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,223
Romano...

105
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:01,560
Isabel needs someone
to go with her to Manila.

106
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,024
I'm to old for that...

107
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:12,696
and no one will be here to take
care of your family's business.

108
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:20,620
I don't want to see
my sister getting hurt.

109
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:25,708
Is that the real reason?

110
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:29,962
Or you just don't want
to leave the house?

111
00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:35,425
What are you really afraid of?

112
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:44,600
Nothing.

113
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:48,770
Romano, your sister needs you.

114
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:52,691
And this is her only hope.

115
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:13,668
That's what I've
been telling you, Victor.

116
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:15,336
You're too generous.

117
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:17,463
Now, we're the ones in need.

118
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:20,341
How can you get better now?

119
00:18:20,342 --> 00:18:21,884
Let's not worry about it.

120
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:23,177
Not worry about it?

121
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:25,929
Victor, you're very sick.

122
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,598
You have cancer...

123
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,976
and the medications
are expensive.

124
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:34,062
If you wouldn't have let yourself
be swindled by Romano's father...

125
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:37,607
then we might have the money
to buy your medicine now.

126
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,580
Uh, Baste.

127
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:55,023
Yeah?

128
00:18:55,024 --> 00:19:00,086
Uh... can I catch a ride
with Aunt Lumen to Manila later?

129
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:02,254
Yes, of course.

130
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:04,949
What about Doctor Louella?
You don't think she'd mind?

131
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,468
She might not like the idea.

132
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:13,306
It's okay.
What are neighbors for?

133
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:16,434
I'm just thinking
about the bus fare.

134
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:19,228
I could save it and use it
for the funeral expenses.

135
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:20,771
Baste.

136
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:23,100
- Sister Louella.
- Please put this in there.

137
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:26,443
Uh... Sister Louella.
This is Mrs. Lumen.

138
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:30,655
She was wondering
if we could give them ride.

139
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:39,830
Brother.

140
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:42,917
Sister Menggay
wants me to give you this.

141
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,461
Thanks.

142
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:49,339
I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

143
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,758
You're really going
with me to Manila.

144
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:57,347
But can you please
take a bath first?

145
00:19:57,348 --> 00:19:59,348
You smell a little.

146
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:03,310
It might be embarrassing
especially to Sister Louella.

147
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:55,441
- Always take care of yourself.
- Okay.

148
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:58,786
- And remember to pray always.
- I will.

149
00:20:58,787 --> 00:20:59,779
I will.

150
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,072
Good evening, Mrs. Menggay.

151
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:02,782
- Good evening to you, also.
- Hi Isabel.

152
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:04,408
I'll put this in the back.

153
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:07,619
- Okay.
- Thank you.

154
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:11,289
Please take care.

155
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,833
Let me help you with that.

156
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:15,251
- Thanks Louella.
- Thank you.

157
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:17,170
Where's your brother Romano?

158
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:19,464
He'll be here in a minute.

159
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,467
Here he is.

160
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:26,679
It's a good thing we were able
to persuade him to go.

161
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:00,459
Wait, why are we stopping?

162
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
What're you doing?

163
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:03,212
I said I just wanted
to hitch a ride with you.

164
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:04,129
Don't be such a snob.

165
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,299
I'll introduce you to some people
who can help you with your career.

166
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,009
Introduce them to me first.

167
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,343
I've heard
too many stories already.

168
00:22:10,344 --> 00:22:12,095
Please.

169
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:14,180
What're you doing?
I said stop it.

170
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:15,890
Come on, please...

171
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:17,683
Stop it!

172
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,268
You jerk!

173
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:21,645
Hey, give me my things!
You're to damn ugly.

174
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:23,105
- You creep!
- You're gonna regret this.

175
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:24,690
Who the hell you think you are?
What'd you think I am?

176
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:26,108
- You're a bitch!
- Get lost!

177
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:27,718
You think you're mucho, huh?

178
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,611
You're disgusting!
Ass-hole!

179
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:31,404
And your breath stinks!

180
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:33,698
Damn idiot.

181
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:36,659
Oh, well! Huh?

182
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:39,787
Now, where am I?

183
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:46,126
Oh my God.

184
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:51,214
Oh, shit.

185
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,720
It's so cold...

186
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,100
Who is this?

187
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:05,561
Let's stop and see
if she needs a ride.

188
00:23:06,896 --> 00:23:11,441
Shit, I finely I get a ride
from someone the rain stops.

189
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:15,612
In all fairness, thank you.
You're all very kind.

190
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:18,072
Did you know I'm an actress?

191
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:19,490
Are you really?

192
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:20,783
Of course!

193
00:23:20,784 --> 00:23:23,953
I have a primetime show
with Dennis Trillo.

194
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:26,997
I was with him in...
in a scene in a restaurant.

195
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:29,541
My legs looked so good there.

196
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:33,336
And my line was,
"may I take your order, sir?"

197
00:23:33,337 --> 00:23:35,880
- That's it!
- Cute, right?

198
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:06,450
Baste.

199
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:18,503
Baste!

200
00:24:34,894 --> 00:24:36,895
Baste.

201
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:47,696
Mom.

202
00:24:52,243 --> 00:24:54,452
Baste, stop the van!

203
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,998
What happened?

204
00:25:57,886 --> 00:26:00,429
Where is he going?

205
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:32,042
Romano?

206
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,054
What's happening to you?

207
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,454
Let's go!

208
00:28:07,422 --> 00:28:11,591
Brother,
what really happened a while ago?

209
00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:17,555
Nothing.

210
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,766
I just had a bad dream.

211
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,643
At least you woke up.

212
00:28:22,644 --> 00:28:24,812
If you hadn't,
we might all be dead now.

213
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:26,480
I don't want to die that way.

214
00:28:26,481 --> 00:28:28,815
I might look disfigured,
especially my skin.

215
00:28:28,816 --> 00:28:30,859
I paid a lot for my face.

216
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,403
It really looks like it.

217
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,864
What were you
dreaming about, Romano?

218
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,659
What?

219
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,288
Didn't you just say
you had a bad dream?

220
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:46,790
Thanks.

221
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,668
I can't remember it.

222
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:52,587
I'm just going to
the ladies' room.

223
00:28:52,672 --> 00:28:54,297
Wow, that looks delicious.

224
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:56,382
Oh, sorry.

225
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:07,643
- Romano?
- What was that?

226
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:40,631
Hi. Looking for something?

227
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:50,779
Romano...

228
00:30:55,701 --> 00:30:58,411
I'm sorry
for the intrusion, Romano.

229
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:01,372
I just want to help you.

230
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:04,375
Don't you believe me?

231
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:07,961
No, Louella.

232
00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:10,964
That's not what I meant.

233
00:31:19,473 --> 00:31:21,641
Is somebody there?

234
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:39,157
Oh...

235
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,790
this is a gift from Carlos.

236
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:05,097
Mother asked me to go
with Aunt Lumen to Manila.

237
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:07,933
Her husband died.

238
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:11,061
It's really hard to accept a death...

239
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:15,148
especially if it's by accident.

240
00:32:15,774 --> 00:32:21,988
My best friend died.
He killed himself last year.

241
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:27,659
That is so sad.

242
00:32:28,745 --> 00:32:31,993
Okay, I already paid the check.
Come on.

243
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:33,665
Let's go.

244
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:39,545
Uh, wait,
aunt Lumen isn't back yet.

245
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,549
Aunt Lumen?

246
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:47,970
Aunt Lumen!

247
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:54,059
We're not ruling out
foul play of course.

248
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,562
We'll investigate this further.

249
00:32:57,855 --> 00:32:59,939
<i>But we can't
release the body to you...</i>

250
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,441
<i>until we're finished
with our investigation.</i>

251
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:16,079
<i>Eric, will you
be staying here?</i>

252
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,498
<i>No. I'm coming with you
to Manila.</i>

253
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:23,419
<i>I need to inform
my relatives there.</i>

254
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:29,883
<i>Eric, my condolence.</i>

255
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:31,509
<i>Thanks, Kristina.</i>

256
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,346
<i>Come on, smile for me.</i>

257
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,932
<i>That's my house.</i>

258
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,786
Uh, guys, thank you.

259
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:02,163
Thank you.

260
00:34:02,164 --> 00:34:04,081
Bye-bye.

261
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:08,085
Hey handsome, thanks a lot.
I hope we meet again.

262
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:10,712
Bye!

263
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:12,380
Bye!

264
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,935
Bye!

265
00:34:29,897 --> 00:34:32,065
My daughter.

266
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:10,475
What were you
dreaming about, Romano?

267
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:12,352
Nothing.

268
00:35:12,353 --> 00:35:13,979
Baste!

269
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:20,901
It's a good thing you woke up.

270
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:22,987
If you hadn't,
we might all be dead now.

271
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:25,572
I don't want to die that way.

272
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:34,664
After what happened
to my brother...

273
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,793
he wouldn't leave
the house anymore.

274
00:35:38,961 --> 00:35:43,339
Every week, his senior officer from
the military came by our house...

275
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,133
to convince him
to go back into the service.

276
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:49,469
But he didn't talk to him.

277
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,348
Do you think he was traumatized
by what happened to him?

278
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:55,558
Maybe.

279
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:59,061
Please take a seat.

280
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:05,526
When we were at the highway...

281
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,403
I felt that he saw something.

282
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:11,323
Whatever it was,
I really don't know.

283
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:13,867
Aunt Menggay told me that...

284
00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:18,162
my brother went one time
with her to buy groceries.

285
00:36:18,497 --> 00:36:20,581
His face suddenly went blank.

286
00:36:20,582 --> 00:36:24,877
Then he asked her
if they could go home already.

287
00:37:33,274 --> 00:37:36,150
I had an accident
when I was little.

288
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:38,820
I was playing with my brother.

289
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:44,491
I fell from a tree
and hit my head hard.

290
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:50,205
I lost my eyesight and...
haven't been able to see since.

291
00:37:52,124 --> 00:37:54,084
We'll do a series of tests again...

292
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:57,992
to evaluate the condition
of the cranial and optic nerves...

293
00:37:57,993 --> 00:38:01,924
which were probably damaged
as a result of her head injury.

294
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,760
We can also perform laser surgery.

295
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:08,096
But that's not a guarantee
that we can restore her vision...

296
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:10,557
It's a 50/50 chance.

297
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:16,479
I hope that after this,
I'll be able to see again.

298
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:21,909
I'd like to see how you
and my brother look.

299
00:38:22,786 --> 00:38:25,746
He's probably real handsome.

300
00:38:26,414 --> 00:38:30,500
And maybe you're
very pretty, too.

301
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:35,254
And I won't argue with that.

302
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:37,019
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

303
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:51,574
- Pair of sevens.
- I got a straight.

304
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:53,701
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

305
00:39:53,744 --> 00:39:54,786
Still plenty.

306
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:56,704
- Cheater!
- You lost.

307
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:58,497
They will look again, eh.

308
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,625
<i>- Open it.
- Oh gosh.</i>

309
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:05,963
- Sister Louella?
- Hold on to the rails.

310
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:10,759
Here, have some juice.

311
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,343
Thanks.

312
00:40:32,905 --> 00:40:34,614
Eric.

313
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:37,575
Isabel.

314
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,161
Thank you for coming
to my uncle's wake.

315
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:44,456
Isabel, sit down here.

316
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:48,418
Sister, brother,
please take a seat.

317
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,920
Thank you.

318
00:40:53,382 --> 00:40:56,926
Any news about your
Aunt Lumen's death?

319
00:40:56,927 --> 00:40:59,845
They say we can get
her remains now.

320
00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:03,932
But we're still waiting for
the release papers from La Union.

321
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:11,106
By the way, we're going back
to Baguio in 2 days.

322
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:17,570
Sister Louella thought that
you might want to ride with us.

323
00:41:17,998 --> 00:41:19,908
Uh, um...

324
00:41:20,198 --> 00:41:22,908
That's okay. Thanks.

325
00:41:22,992 --> 00:41:25,202
I already talked to my mother.

326
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:29,706
She said she's going to stay
to attend her sister's wake.

327
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:15,456
All of us have someone
to fetch us.

328
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:20,211
When death is near,
they will come to pick us up.

329
00:42:20,754 --> 00:42:24,172
They are the Heralds of Death.

330
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:29,719
They will come for us
and bring us to the other life.

331
00:42:30,054 --> 00:42:32,722
All of us
have someone to fetch us.

332
00:42:32,848 --> 00:42:36,601
When death is near,
they will come to pick us up.

333
00:42:36,602 --> 00:42:39,937
They are the Heralds of Death.

334
00:42:39,938 --> 00:42:46,151
They will come for us
and bring us to the other life.

335
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:51,156
And... who will come
to fetch you?

336
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:52,240
<i>Damn it!</i>

337
00:42:52,241 --> 00:42:53,533
<i>you double-crossed me!</i>

338
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:55,409
You're stupid!

339
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,453
<i>- There's a fight going on.
- How come?</i>

340
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:04,626
What's that for?

341
00:43:04,627 --> 00:43:06,586
What's happening outside?

342
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:08,213
I don't know.

343
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:32,694
Isabel?

344
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:34,362
Isabel!

345
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,117
Sister Louella!

346
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,369
Sister Louella!

347
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:44,997
Isabel, open the door!

348
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,583
Eric, what's happening?

349
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,337
Isabel, open the door!

350
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,799
When death is near,
they will come to pick us up.

351
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,219
They are the Heralds of Death.

352
00:44:00,553 --> 00:44:04,306
They will come for us
and bring us to the other life.

353
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:07,392
Death is here now.

354
00:44:34,126 --> 00:44:35,543
Eric?

355
00:44:40,215 --> 00:44:42,216
Why is it wet here?

356
00:44:58,482 --> 00:45:01,525
- Isabel, open it now!
- Isabel!

357
00:45:09,575 --> 00:45:11,076
Eric!

358
00:45:11,452 --> 00:45:14,162
Eric, what's happening?

359
00:45:16,248 --> 00:45:17,832
Eric!

360
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:23,378
Isabel!

361
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:34,555
Brother, what's going on?

362
00:45:34,556 --> 00:45:36,807
Why has this happened
to Eric too?

363
00:45:38,143 --> 00:45:40,436
This is bad luck.

364
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:43,605
Why are we experiencing
bad things one after the other?

365
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:47,025
Romano, I know
you're hiding something from us.

366
00:45:47,902 --> 00:45:50,570
You know something about this.

367
00:45:51,906 --> 00:45:54,324
The incident that happened
on the highway...

368
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,035
to Lumen... to Eric.

369
00:45:58,578 --> 00:46:00,704
What was that really?

370
00:46:00,705 --> 00:46:03,665
Why don't you just tell us?

371
00:46:06,085 --> 00:46:08,712
I can't understand it myself.

372
00:46:10,589 --> 00:46:13,007
After my accident...

373
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:17,261
I went in a coma.

374
00:46:17,763 --> 00:46:22,433
When I woke up,
strange things started to happen.

375
00:46:22,976 --> 00:46:26,144
When I dreamt
that we were in an accident...

376
00:46:26,687 --> 00:46:29,397
I asked Baste to stop the van.

377
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:35,194
I saw something.

378
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:36,988
What did you see?

379
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:43,077
Spirits.

380
00:46:46,497 --> 00:46:48,498
Five souls.

381
00:46:51,252 --> 00:46:54,253
They were surrounding the van.

382
00:46:54,588 --> 00:46:57,590
What do you mean by "spirits"?

383
00:46:57,799 --> 00:47:00,384
Before Lumen's death.

384
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:03,512
When we were eating
at the cafeteria...

385
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:07,182
I saw this spirit again.

386
00:47:07,266 --> 00:47:09,976
Outside the doctor's office.

387
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:12,937
When Isabel
had her eyes checked...

388
00:47:13,022 --> 00:47:15,405
I saw another one again.

389
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,777
That was the soul
I've seen during the wake.

390
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:22,571
Before Eric's death.

391
00:47:24,073 --> 00:47:28,034
Brother Romano,
I know a spiritualist.

392
00:47:28,202 --> 00:47:30,412
She may be able to help.

393
00:47:30,621 --> 00:47:33,081
Let's see her tomorrow.

394
00:47:42,382 --> 00:47:45,342
I saw it upstairs, near the table.

395
00:47:49,263 --> 00:47:54,517
Romano, what's it feel like
whenever you see a ghost?

396
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:06,486
It doesn't seem real.

397
00:48:09,865 --> 00:48:15,953
You think you're just
seeing things.

398
00:48:19,249 --> 00:48:25,921
Then your hair starts to rise.

399
00:48:30,134 --> 00:48:38,140
And you suddenly feel light-headed.

400
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:51,403
You know what, when dad died...

401
00:48:52,071 --> 00:48:57,199
I always wondered how I would feel
when he shows himself to me.

402
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:03,163
Will I be scared
or happy to see him?

403
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:08,752
I waited and waited
for him but he never came.

404
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:15,258
I guess I really don't have
the eye to see those things.

405
00:49:15,259 --> 00:49:20,406
The books says anyone
who wants to see a spirit...

405
00:49:20,407 --> 00:49:23,766
can definitely see the spirit,
if they really wanted to.

406
00:49:23,975 --> 00:49:36,110
You just need to focus.
Concentrate on the room...

407
00:49:39,364 --> 00:49:41,991
in every corner.

408
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:49,289
Then try to open your eyes
in different ways.

409
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:52,250
Try to feel
everything around you.

410
00:49:53,168 --> 00:49:58,673
Whisper whatever you want
into the wind.

411
00:50:04,053 --> 00:50:06,430
Okay, I'll read it.

412
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,432
I'll go inside now.

413
00:50:21,444 --> 00:50:24,029
<i>Give me one kilo of pork.</i>

414
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,114
<i>One kilo of porkchop.</i>

415
00:50:26,115 --> 00:50:29,117
<i>Hold on, please.</i>

416
00:50:29,744 --> 00:50:31,286
<i>Here.</i>

417
00:50:31,287 --> 00:50:33,788
<i>140.</i>

418
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:38,459
Excuse me, boss.

419
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,294
Do you know where I can find
Mrs. Elma?

420
00:50:40,295 --> 00:50:41,337
Mrs. Elma?

421
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:42,796
Oh, Mrs. Elma.

422
00:50:42,797 --> 00:50:44,840
She's over there.

423
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,300
Come on.

424
00:50:46,301 --> 00:50:48,593
- Thank you.
- Okay.

425
00:50:52,097 --> 00:50:53,556
Excuse me...

426
00:50:53,557 --> 00:50:54,932
are you Mrs. Elma?

427
00:50:54,933 --> 00:50:56,726
Why? What do you want?

428
00:50:56,727 --> 00:50:57,768
Your Mrs. Elma.

429
00:50:57,769 --> 00:51:00,396
Brother Romano, she's Mrs. Elma.

430
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,399
I want to ask you something.

431
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,111
Hurry up. I don't have all day.

432
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,490
Ma'am Elma...

433
00:51:12,491 --> 00:51:16,911
I can see things that I don't
understand.

434
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:25,627
Do you have money?

435
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:29,839
Let's go to a place
that's a litte more quiet.

436
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,591
follow me!

437
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:35,094
Hey, faster!

438
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,555
Careful now.

439
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,199
What do you see?

440
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,784
Ever since I came out...

441
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:05,914
fom a coma...

442
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:11,085
I've been seeing spirits.

443
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,962
But now...

444
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:17,133
they're bothering me.

445
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,387
And everytime I see a ghost...

446
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,391
someone dies.

447
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:29,769
Like one of our friends...

448
00:52:29,937 --> 00:52:31,729
before she died in the accident.

449
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,399
I'm just thinking
about the bus fare.

450
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,027
I can save it and use it
towards funeral expenses.

451
00:52:39,946 --> 00:52:43,157
I saw the spirit of her husband.

452
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:47,160
The other one...

453
00:52:48,663 --> 00:52:50,080
I saw his friend.

454
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:53,207
My best friend died.

455
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:56,669
He killed himself last year.

456
00:53:05,928 --> 00:53:08,096
Your 3rd eye is open.

457
00:53:08,097 --> 00:53:11,766
It may have opened during the
accident you encountered.

458
00:53:11,767 --> 00:53:13,643
The spirits you see...

459
00:53:13,644 --> 00:53:17,480
are no doubt
the Heralds of Death.

460
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:21,108
We all have someone to fetch us
when our time comes.

461
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:22,776
Your brother, sister...

462
00:53:22,777 --> 00:53:23,861
wife...

463
00:53:23,862 --> 00:53:25,320
best friend...

464
00:53:25,321 --> 00:53:27,489
relative.

465
00:53:27,532 --> 00:53:30,742
But why are they after Romano?

466
00:53:30,743 --> 00:53:32,160
Maybe...

467
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:35,121
they know that Romano sees them.

468
00:53:35,122 --> 00:53:38,582
And they want to
tell him something.

469
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:42,169
That's why I saw them
in the tunnel.

470
00:53:42,462 --> 00:53:44,046
The tunnel?

471
00:53:45,173 --> 00:53:46,465
Yes.

472
00:53:46,466 --> 00:53:48,717
We almost met an accident.

473
00:53:48,718 --> 00:53:51,052
But Romano saved us.

474
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:54,764
I see other spirits, too.

475
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,725
There are more?

476
00:53:57,893 --> 00:53:59,643
If that's the case...

477
00:53:59,644 --> 00:54:03,147
you have cheated death.

478
00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:06,525
Now, Death wants you to pay.

479
00:54:06,526 --> 00:54:08,652
What should we do?

480
00:54:08,653 --> 00:54:13,531
You were given that power
to see those spirits.

481
00:54:13,657 --> 00:54:16,450
And they are here to warn you.

482
00:54:16,451 --> 00:54:19,870
But how can we escape from Death?

483
00:54:19,871 --> 00:54:21,205
What I know...

484
00:54:21,206 --> 00:54:23,874
is that when you cheat death...

485
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:26,543
you have to pay with death, too.

486
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:35,134
What are you getting?

487
00:54:55,404 --> 00:54:58,155
What's wrong, Brother Romano?

488
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:04,995
Romano...

489
00:55:04,996 --> 00:55:07,205
have you seen another one again?

490
00:55:07,206 --> 00:55:08,790
Yes.

491
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:11,042
He's the old man...

492
00:55:11,043 --> 00:55:15,088
I saw him on the highway,
while we're walking.

493
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,216
He's wearing a necklace.

494
00:55:19,217 --> 00:55:21,093
A necklace?

495
00:55:21,678 --> 00:55:24,096
With an animal tooth pendant?

496
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:28,016
Brother Romano,
he's my grandfather.

497
00:55:28,017 --> 00:55:30,435
He was the one who raised me.

498
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:34,355
Am I next?

499
00:55:35,023 --> 00:55:37,608
Am I going to die?

500
00:55:56,168 --> 00:55:59,128
Romano.

501
00:56:12,683 --> 00:56:14,517
Louella...

502
00:56:14,601 --> 00:56:16,936
go to the van.

503
00:56:42,961 --> 00:56:46,505
Run!

504
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:23,956
Baste got away.

505
00:57:23,957 --> 00:57:25,899
But is he really safe?

506
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,975
How about us?

507
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:29,210
Who's next in line?

508
00:57:29,211 --> 00:57:31,588
We need to calm down.

509
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:35,216
Brother, who else did you see
on the highway.

510
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,220
I saw 5 spirits.

511
00:57:40,764 --> 00:57:44,933
3 of them
have already reappeared.

512
00:57:45,309 --> 00:57:47,602
There are 7 of us.

513
00:57:48,312 --> 00:57:52,232
This means 2 will be saved?

514
00:57:52,399 --> 00:57:54,567
I saw my mother.

515
00:57:54,568 --> 00:57:56,360
What?

516
00:57:58,738 --> 00:58:01,615
It's either Isabel or me...

517
00:58:01,658 --> 00:58:03,116
who's next.

518
00:58:03,117 --> 00:58:05,494
But who's the 5th one?

519
00:58:06,037 --> 00:58:08,163
A woman.

520
00:58:10,624 --> 00:58:13,209
I don't know who she is.

521
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,878
Her hair covered her face.

522
00:58:16,338 --> 00:58:18,881
And there's another one.

523
00:58:19,341 --> 00:58:21,216
You saw another one?

524
00:58:21,217 --> 00:58:23,760
I didn't see it.

525
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,471
I just heard it?

526
00:58:26,597 --> 00:58:28,974
What did you hear?

527
00:58:28,975 --> 00:58:31,601
I heard a baby crying.

528
00:58:32,686 --> 00:58:35,605
Let's go.
We need to see Kristina.

529
00:58:38,316 --> 00:58:41,110
She was in such a hurry
she forgot her cellphone.

530
00:58:41,111 --> 00:58:45,572
But she'll be here soon.
She's coming from a shooting.

531
00:58:45,573 --> 00:58:49,400
- Oh, here she is. Kristina.
- Hey, Baste.

532
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:50,910
My fare.

533
00:58:52,204 --> 00:58:54,122
Romano!

534
00:58:54,123 --> 00:58:55,623
I missed you.

535
00:58:55,624 --> 00:58:57,124
Did you miss me, too?

536
00:58:57,125 --> 00:59:00,085
We need to talk.

537
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,840
I don't remember anything.

538
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,925
Besides,
I really don't have a child.

539
00:59:06,926 --> 00:59:10,011
And I don't even have a niece
or nephew who died.

540
00:59:10,012 --> 00:59:11,930
Aren't you forgetting someone?

541
00:59:11,931 --> 00:59:14,765
We haven't had any
childrens' death in our family.

542
00:59:14,766 --> 00:59:17,852
I think we're a family
with a long live expectancy.

543
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:21,063
Wait, are you really telling the truth?

544
00:59:21,064 --> 00:59:25,400
Kristina, serve them
some coffee first.

545
00:59:32,533 --> 00:59:34,575
Ma'am...

546
00:59:34,868 --> 00:59:39,163
please,
don't take this personal, but...

547
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,916
she has never given birth?

548
00:59:42,917 --> 00:59:45,585
I am sure of it.

549
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:48,046
She don't even have a boyfriend.

550
00:59:48,047 --> 00:59:51,049
She's very choosy.

551
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:03,977
Hey handsome,
here's your coffee.

552
01:00:04,687 --> 01:00:07,022
I made this for you.

553
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,161
Kristina, why won't you
believe us?

554
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,708
We'll just go out
and get some fresh air.

555
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:30,835
Come, Isabel.

556
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:38,092
Sister Kristina,
please be careful.

557
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,427
How sweet.

558
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:47,017
Your sister's so nice.

559
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:51,479
But I don't like the other girl.
She's always frowning at me?

560
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:56,734
I think she has a crush on you.

561
01:00:57,652 --> 01:01:00,863
What we're saying is true.

562
01:01:01,656 --> 01:01:04,283
We came here...

563
01:01:04,284 --> 01:01:06,952
to warn you.

564
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:08,453
You know what?

565
01:01:08,454 --> 01:01:10,914
I'm not afraid of dying.

566
01:01:10,915 --> 01:01:12,749
What can I do if my time is up?

567
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,876
Will I fight against Death?

568
01:01:14,877 --> 01:01:16,919
I'll just tire myself out.

569
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,214
I just don't want to die
looking ugly.

570
01:01:20,507 --> 01:01:23,550
But if you want to...

571
01:01:23,551 --> 01:01:24,801
look after me...

572
01:01:24,802 --> 01:01:27,929
protect or guard me...

573
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:32,684
24 hours a day,
I won't stop you.

574
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,276
Brother...
What did she say?

575
01:01:42,277 --> 01:01:45,028
She still don't believe me.

576
01:02:02,796 --> 01:02:04,880
Be careful.

577
01:02:09,468 --> 01:02:11,177
Baste...

578
01:02:11,845 --> 01:02:13,721
let's go back
to Kristina's place.

579
01:02:13,722 --> 01:02:15,556
Why? Did you forget something?

580
01:02:15,557 --> 01:02:17,350
Just do what I tell you.

581
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:19,685
Romano, what's wrong?

582
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:24,773
I know who has come to get her.

583
01:02:31,071 --> 01:02:33,573
Your daughter has a twin.

584
01:02:35,117 --> 01:02:37,451
Tell me the truth.

585
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,623
How did you know about it?

586
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:46,501
That's no longer important.

587
01:02:52,132 --> 01:02:56,928
I had to give up the other
because we were very poor.

588
01:02:57,387 --> 01:03:02,307
I chose Kristina because
she's sweeter and more quiet.

589
01:03:05,561 --> 01:03:07,896
What I know is this...

590
01:03:07,897 --> 01:03:11,733
that the people who adopted her
treated her badly.

591
01:03:12,067 --> 01:03:16,070
She got very sick
and died because of it.

592
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,830
Where is Kristina now?

593
01:03:26,831 --> 01:03:29,958
She's in her manager's spa.

594
01:04:43,276 --> 01:04:44,276
Yes, ma'am.

595
01:04:44,277 --> 01:04:45,193
Miss...

596
01:04:45,194 --> 01:04:46,653
- Yes?
- is Kristina here?

597
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:48,655
Oh, the one who's in the spa?
Yes, she is.

598
01:04:48,656 --> 01:04:50,698
- Where is she?
- She's inside.

599
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:52,867
Sir, you can't go in there.

600
01:04:52,868 --> 01:04:53,843
Kristina!

601
01:04:53,844 --> 01:04:56,078
- Sir!
- Kristina!

602
01:04:56,705 --> 01:04:58,289
I'll follow Romano.

603
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:00,291
Please take care of Isabel.

604
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:02,626
Don't leave her alone.

605
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,853
How much for everything?

606
01:05:22,854 --> 01:05:24,313
23.

607
01:05:24,314 --> 01:05:25,981
- Here you go.
- Oh, that's a large bill.

608
01:05:25,982 --> 01:05:27,399
Don't you have anything smaller?

609
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,942
Sorry, I have nothing smaller.

610
01:05:28,943 --> 01:05:31,319
Okay, wait for me.

611
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:42,204
What's wrong?

612
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:43,956
Hey!

613
01:05:44,207 --> 01:05:46,958
If I see a scratch on there,
you gonna pay for it!

614
01:05:46,959 --> 01:05:49,836
Let's get outta here!
Hurry up!

615
01:05:52,006 --> 01:05:53,880
Kristina!

616
01:05:57,177 --> 01:05:59,178
Help me.

617
01:06:23,201 --> 01:06:24,451
Baste.

618
01:06:24,452 --> 01:06:25,494
Help me.

619
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:26,536
Romano!

620
01:06:26,537 --> 01:06:28,079
Romano, please help me.

621
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,789
Kristina?

622
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:31,833
Kristina!

623
01:06:37,339 --> 01:06:39,921
Kristina! Kristina!

624
01:06:41,593 --> 01:06:42,759
Baste!

625
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:43,827
Isabel!

626
01:06:43,828 --> 01:06:45,387
- Baste!
- Isabel, please help me!

627
01:06:45,388 --> 01:06:47,722
What's happening to you?

628
01:06:52,561 --> 01:06:53,953
Kristina?

629
01:06:53,954 --> 01:06:55,605
Kristina?

630
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:06,406
Kristina?

631
01:07:36,184 --> 01:07:40,020
Do you think we will avoid any
accidents now?

632
01:07:47,278 --> 01:07:50,363
We're fighting against spirits
Romano, not humans.

633
01:07:50,364 --> 01:07:52,699
He can do anything he wants.

634
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,784
We can't hide from him.

635
01:07:54,785 --> 01:07:57,411
We are all going to die.

636
01:07:59,164 --> 01:08:01,040
I'm a doctor.

637
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:05,460
I've seen death.
But not this way, not like this.

638
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:08,755
I don't want to believe,
but how couldn't I?

639
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:13,468
We have to do everything
that keeps us safe.

640
01:08:13,469 --> 01:08:16,762
You don't understand
what Mrs. Elma told us.

641
01:08:18,265 --> 01:08:21,183
Death is chasing us.

642
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:22,976
We need to sacrifice a life.

643
01:08:22,977 --> 01:08:26,980
He is after someone alive,
now we need someone in exchange.

644
01:08:31,527 --> 01:08:33,903
What do you want to do?

645
01:08:35,781 --> 01:08:38,032
Kill someone?

646
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:54,464
Brother...

647
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:57,174
isn't that...

648
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:01,095
I'm to blame for all of this.

649
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:04,640
If it wasn't for me...

650
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:08,894
we wouldn't have come to Manila.

651
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:12,105
Don't think about those things.

652
01:09:14,858 --> 01:09:17,026
It's not your fault.

653
01:09:17,527 --> 01:09:20,029
Go get some rest.

654
01:09:22,323 --> 01:09:27,494
Brother,
is he fetching you or me?

655
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:46,094
Do you remember that picture?

656
01:09:47,722 --> 01:09:50,682
The drawing on Isabel's hand?

657
01:09:52,226 --> 01:09:54,519
I did that.

658
01:09:54,937 --> 01:09:58,230
Those are the figures
of a family.

659
01:09:58,231 --> 01:10:01,316
Of a daddy a mommy...

660
01:10:01,317 --> 01:10:03,527
and a baby.

661
01:10:03,528 --> 01:10:05,862
Louella...

662
01:10:07,281 --> 01:10:10,575
you don't have to worry about
anything.

663
01:10:11,785 --> 01:10:15,079
I don't see
any spirit right now.

664
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:22,294
That wants to fetch you.

665
01:10:25,548 --> 01:10:28,008
I told myself before...

666
01:10:29,301 --> 01:10:34,263
that when I have a child...

667
01:10:35,182 --> 01:10:37,558
a boy.

668
01:10:38,059 --> 01:10:39,894
Romano...

669
01:10:39,895 --> 01:10:43,230
that baby you heard crying.

670
01:10:44,691 --> 01:10:47,526
Is why I'm being fetched.

671
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,112
What do you mean?

672
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:54,073
I had an abortion...

673
01:10:56,451 --> 01:10:58,410
It was a bad time for me.

674
01:10:58,411 --> 01:11:01,247
when I was in med school.

675
01:11:02,499 --> 01:11:06,168
I got pregnant,
aborted... my baby.

676
01:11:06,627 --> 01:11:09,754
I aborted the child.

677
01:11:09,755 --> 01:11:14,509
That's why I know that I'm
the next one.

678
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,763
My baby is coming to get me.

679
01:11:20,181 --> 01:11:23,517
It's coming to get me.

680
01:11:45,955 --> 01:11:48,832
Romano, we have to be careful.

681
01:13:36,306 --> 01:13:37,848
Who is there?

682
01:13:37,849 --> 01:13:39,433
Show yourself to me!

683
01:13:39,434 --> 01:13:41,977
Show yourself!

684
01:15:40,962 --> 01:15:43,839
Isabel.

685
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,302
Mama?

686
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:26,128
Isabel.

687
01:16:27,171 --> 01:16:29,214
Isabel.

688
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,855
Isabel!

689
01:17:58,004 --> 01:18:00,589
That's enough.

690
01:18:01,007 --> 01:18:02,674
That's enough! I can't take it
anymore!

691
01:18:02,675 --> 01:18:05,052
That's enough! Stop it!

692
01:18:05,053 --> 01:18:06,178
Stop it!

693
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:07,721
That's enough!

694
01:18:14,311 --> 01:18:16,562
Isabel...

695
01:18:17,022 --> 01:18:19,273
what are you doing there?

696
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:24,027
Brother, please come here.

697
01:18:28,449 --> 01:18:30,992
Come down from there.

698
01:18:42,295 --> 01:18:44,171
Isabel.

699
01:18:51,011 --> 01:18:52,887
Brother.

700
01:19:50,566 --> 01:19:53,067
Louella?

701
01:19:56,488 --> 01:19:58,614
I won't die now.

702
01:19:58,615 --> 01:20:01,533
I've already sacrificed a life.

703
01:20:03,494 --> 01:20:05,061
It's all your fault!

704
01:20:05,062 --> 01:20:08,164
It's your fault
why Papa is dead now.

705
01:20:08,332 --> 01:20:10,334
Isabel had to pay with her life.

706
01:20:10,335 --> 01:20:12,710
I don't want to die yet.

707
01:20:12,711 --> 01:20:14,629
I don't want to die yet.

708
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:17,339
You killed Isabel?

709
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,674
She can't kill me.

710
01:20:18,675 --> 01:20:21,010
She can't come after me.

711
01:20:29,685 --> 01:20:32,478
I have to stay alive.

712
01:20:32,563 --> 01:20:35,148
You'll have to die.

713
01:20:35,941 --> 01:20:39,026
You have to die now.

714
01:21:06,344 --> 01:21:09,721
Did you come to fetch me?

715
01:22:13,155 --> 01:22:15,948
I don't wanna die yet.

717
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:27,292
Stay away from me!

718
01:22:27,293 --> 01:22:29,586
Stay away from me!

719
01:22:30,463 --> 01:22:32,922
Stay away from me!
