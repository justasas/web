2
00:00:58,802 --> 00:01:00,803
I'm so tired.
I could sleep a thousand years.

3
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:03,565
Don't worry.
You'll pick up again tonight.

4
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,322
It hasn't changed much here.

5
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,043
It has changed.

6
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,925
It changes slowly.

7
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:58,806
How?

8
00:01:58,846 --> 00:02:01,730
It changes slowly.
That's all.

9
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:19,822
Wait.

10
00:02:19,862 --> 00:02:23,585
I'd like to talk to you.

11
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,707
I'm listening.

12
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,970
Is this a proposal?

13
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:03,656
The jewel, is it a proposal?

14
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:51,373
You stare at me...

15
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:55,375
And seem to want to hurt me.

16
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:58,097
Then your face
turns normal again.

17
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:03,542
It's the old you.

18
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:06,264
You continue to stare at me.

19
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:07,665
And then...

20
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,387
I feel you're coming.

21
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:13,870
As you come between my thighs,

22
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,272
I feel your sperm rise up
within me

23
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:22,195
and fill me
and flow out through my eyes.

24
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:26,799
There are white tears,
thick ones, coating my cheeks.

25
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,401
My mouth is red,

26
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:31,563
and the white tears
trickle over it.

27
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:33,364
I don't want to wipe them away.

28
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:35,567
I cry so much.

29
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:38,127
I can't stop crying.

30
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:44,452
You don't have an emerald?

31
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:49,176
No, I don't have an emerald.

32
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:51,138
Maybe next time.

33
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:53,019
Maybe.

34
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:58,424
You always remember
your dreams?

35
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:00,825
No.

36
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:08,610
"HOUSE OF PLEASURES"

37
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:49,268
"HOUSE OF PLEASURES"

38
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:53,711
"November 1899"

39
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:56,634
"The twilight
of the 19th century"

40
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:01,316
Near the mirror.

41
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:04,799
Near the mirror, Clothilde.

42
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:07,080
I'll show you.

43
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:14,648
Pass me a hairpin?

44
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:16,308
Leave me some.

45
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:17,929
Don't worry.

46
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,946
He's nice but heavy.

47
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:42,028
Physically heavy too.

48
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:44,949
When he's on top of me,
I'm crushed.

49
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,316
I hope he hasn't given me
the clap.

50
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:55,157
Claptrap.

51
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:57,440
I hope Victor
doesn't come tonight.

52
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm sick of him.

53
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,003
Three times in a row.
What a drag!

54
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:05,086
Always asking what I think
of his crooked cock,

55
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:07,887
before I kiss his ass.

56
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:08,967
Who did you have?

57
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:10,289
Michaux.

58
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:13,091
- He's sweet on you.
- For now he is.

59
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:14,452
It's only been twice.

60
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:16,333
He doesn't want me now.

61
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:17,535
Do you like him?

62
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:19,617
Yes, I like him.

63
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:22,738
- That's all?
- It's something.

64
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:25,501
You like him or you think
he could pay your debts

65
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:26,822
to get you out?

66
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:28,343
Is that a problem?

67
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,304
Maybe I have fewer debts
than you.

68
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,545
I doubt it.

69
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:16,139
Sir...

70
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:18,580
Good evening.

71
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:36,634
Mine doesn't work.

72
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,721
You lose!

73
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:48,284
There.

74
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:50,525
- Can we come closer?
- Of course.

75
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:52,847
She's very meek.

76
00:09:52,887 --> 00:09:54,209
I call her Ninon.

77
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:57,130
- A female?
- Yes.

78
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,841
Show me your hands.

79
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:42,685
You won a point?

80
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,567
Yes, my blow got me the...

81
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,933
Doctor, you've lost.

82
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:56,816
- You have to drink.
- I've lost?

83
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,619
See you later.

84
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:09,625
I just finished
an amazing English novel,

85
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,831
full of aliens and Martians...

86
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:15,390
who invade Earth using rays
and chemical weapons.

87
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,231
They're very powerful

88
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:20,994
and easily eliminate
human beings.

89
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:24,837
They devastate the cities...

90
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:27,919
But not being immune
to human diseases,

91
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,522
they end up dying.

92
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,086
The story is told
by a journalist

93
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:42,210
who escapes the first attacks

94
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,093
and who seeks his wife
in a deserted land.

95
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,974
Idiotic but pure genius.

96
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:48,334
Have you read it?

97
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,537
No, my only books are
Sade's diaries and the Bible.

98
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,619
And I haven't read the Bible.

99
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:56,262
Samira, Louis's glass is empty.

100
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:58,342
I had this letter today.

101
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:01,104
Shall I read it?

102
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:06,109
"Madame,

103
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:08,350
"Having heard of L'Apollonide

104
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,713
"and keen to enter your house,
I hereby offer myself.

105
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:13,274
"I'm 15 and a half.

106
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:16,075
"I'm pretty, with nice hair
and fine teeth,

107
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:19,958
"shapely, with very white skin
and not a blemish on my body,

108
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:23,761
"and if you want to send someone
from Paris to check

109
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:27,124
"if the details I mention
are correct.

110
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:30,966
"I have a kind heart,
and I shall be obedient.

111
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:33,370
"If I prove suitable,

112
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,131
"you may send someone
to fetch me

113
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:38,093
"and bring me to your house.

114
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,293
Pauline Deshaies. "

115
00:12:39,294 --> 00:12:42,135
She drew a self-portrait.
She's pretty.

116
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:45,017
A pretty drawing
means nothing.

117
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:48,901
May I?

118
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:51,943
Yes.

119
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:53,905
Very nice, Marie.

120
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:57,026
I'd like to be here
to welcome her.

121
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:58,186
She's a baby.

122
00:12:58,187 --> 00:12:59,434
With the countess dead,

123
00:12:59,469 --> 00:13:02,351
who'll be
the 20th century's beauty?

124
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:05,354
I say you are.

125
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:06,834
What was that?

126
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:08,795
The Jewess is the new beauty.

127
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:10,197
Thank you.

128
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,107
I've missed you.

129
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:52,909
Caca, I was here two days ago.

130
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:55,791
But not yesterday.

131
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,114
Where were you?

132
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:00,274
With my wife.

133
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,875
No!

134
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:04,238
The shame of it...

135
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:20,971
It's been two weeks.

136
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:22,612
I stayed in.

137
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:24,814
I wasn't in the mood for it.

138
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:27,335
And now?
Are you in the mood?

139
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:30,978
Very much.

140
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:34,422
I had an odd dream about you
last week.

141
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:36,343
All the girls say that.

142
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:37,864
I swear, it's true.

143
00:14:37,904 --> 00:14:39,510
What was it?

144
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,706
It's rather unusual.

145
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:45,189
Want to tell me upstairs?

146
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:48,031
I'd like that.

147
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:51,754
Get drinks and come to the room
with black curtains.

148
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:56,838
What are you doing?

149
00:14:56,878 --> 00:14:59,279
It's a gift.

150
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,936
I'm so tired.
I could sleep a thousand years.

151
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:22,778
Don't worry.
You'll pick up again tonight.

152
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:35,597
Give me a glass?

153
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:38,115
- Which one?
- I don't mind.

154
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,280
Got any antiseptic soap?

155
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,162
I can't afford any.

156
00:16:47,202 --> 00:16:49,724
- And you?
- You're a pain.

157
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:53,607
I'll lend you some,
but buy your own.

158
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:56,849
Thank you.

159
00:16:56,888 --> 00:16:58,610
Clothilde?

160
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,411
Can you help me?

161
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:03,174
Hold this.

162
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:11,180
Thanks.

163
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,941
What are you doing?

164
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:15,423
It's a gift.

165
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:43,644
What's wrong?

166
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:46,087
Nothing's wrong.

167
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:51,410
No one knows
what you're thinking.

168
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,332
I don't think anything.

169
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:12,867
She's nearly done.

170
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:15,308
Send her to me after.

171
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,272
She's as pretty
as a blazing flower.

172
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:37,605
My fingers must be cursed...

173
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:42,609
The sound of the sirens...

174
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:04,827
I start to undress.

175
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:08,069
And you put a box down
on the bed.

176
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:10,348
A tiny box.

177
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,592
I open it.

178
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:16,034
There's an emerald inside.

179
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:19,677
You still say nothing,
so I'm convinced that...

180
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:22,119
Well, I ask if it's a proposal.

181
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:24,201
You don't reply.

182
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,334
That's it then.

183
00:19:42,374 --> 00:19:45,417
Loubet has pardoned Dreyfus
at last.

184
00:19:45,457 --> 00:19:49,060
If the talk turns to Dreyfus,
I'm going up.

185
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,181
Come on.

186
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:52,583
Let's go up.

187
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:55,504
With pleasure.

188
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,431
Shall we have commerce?

189
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:05,032
I'd love to.

190
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:07,913
You always remember
your dreams?

191
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:14,800
I want to tie you up.
May I?

192
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:19,443
Yes, you may.

193
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:53,149
He's envious of everything.

194
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:56,311
I'm happy with you.

195
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:00,834
Vuitton...

196
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:06,079
Vuitton...

197
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,023
What?

198
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:14,244
Vuitton?

199
00:21:14,284 --> 00:21:17,327
I love saying that name.

200
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:20,369
He's a genius.

201
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:23,292
Vuitton.

202
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:28,456
I love this song.

203
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:03,401
"March 1900"

204
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:08,045
"The dawn of the 20th century"

205
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:38,548
Spread your thighs.

206
00:22:38,588 --> 00:22:41,631
- Go on, spread them.
- No!

207
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:48,236
I need to see inside your sex
to paint you.

208
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:50,477
Even to do your face.

209
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,322
It's very important.

210
00:22:55,362 --> 00:23:00,005
Men never look into
the sex of women enough.

211
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:06,970
There...

212
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,892
I'm beginning to see
the picture.

213
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:24,023
I have the impression
I've painted your face 40 times.

214
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:33,590
This face...

215
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:37,313
You smell nice.

216
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:39,795
Jicky by Guerlain.

217
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,317
I know.
I loved a woman who wore it.

218
00:23:42,357 --> 00:23:45,198
I'm not jealous.

219
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,889
How old are you?

220
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,372
Why do you ask?

221
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:02,693
So I'll know.

222
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:09,543
I'm 28.

223
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:12,620
How long have you been here?

224
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,383
12 years.

225
00:24:17,744 --> 00:24:21,746
I'll leave this here.

226
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:24,629
It's for you.

227
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:33,115
I really have to go.

228
00:24:59,335 --> 00:25:04,778
It moved!

229
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:06,500
Even with two
I lose.

230
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,503
It's pathetic!

231
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,714
How are you, children?

232
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:26,716
Say hello to Pauline.

233
00:25:26,756 --> 00:25:28,917
Okay, girls?
Met Pauline?

234
00:25:28,957 --> 00:25:31,840
We saw her earlier.

235
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,847
Chinese arm lock!

236
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:43,289
You didn't get me.

237
00:25:47,653 --> 00:25:50,094
Where are you off to?

238
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:53,137
Maurice is taking me out
for the afternoon.

239
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,178
Lucky you.
I want to go out too.

240
00:25:56,218 --> 00:25:57,899
Hello.

241
00:25:57,939 --> 00:25:59,106
Caca...

242
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,502
Julie, please.

243
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,424
- My name's Julie.
- Everyone calls her Caca.

244
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:04,186
My name's Julie.

245
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:06,827
What are you doing
with my doll?

246
00:26:08,228 --> 00:26:11,109
Don't touch it!

247
00:26:14,993 --> 00:26:17,555
You are pretty.

248
00:26:19,717 --> 00:26:21,478
You went for your permit?

249
00:26:21,518 --> 00:26:23,439
Yes, before I came here.

250
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,941
They examined you?

251
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:28,404
I'm perfectly healthy.

252
00:26:30,246 --> 00:26:31,926
Any scars?

253
00:26:31,962 --> 00:26:34,447
No.

254
00:26:34,487 --> 00:26:36,529
Your breasts...

255
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:38,810
- Are they firm?
- Very.

256
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:42,814
- Even without a corset?
- They're firm.

257
00:26:42,854 --> 00:26:44,535
All right.

258
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:47,338
- You have your permit?
- Yes, I told you.

259
00:26:47,378 --> 00:26:49,739
My papers are in order.

260
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,141
Undress, please.

261
00:26:52,181 --> 00:26:54,943
- Now?
- Yes, get used to it.

262
00:26:54,978 --> 00:26:57,705
You're not here to make jam.

263
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:12,958
- How old are you now?
- 16.

264
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,879
I have a letter from my parents.

265
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:25,086
Do you speak well?

266
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:28,649
- You're polite?
- Yes, I've been taught.

267
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,931
- Can you read?
- Yes.

268
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:33,893
- And write?
- Yes.

269
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:49,184
Go on.

270
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:21,250
Turn round.

271
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,051
Nice buttocks.

272
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:26,412
- Nice breasts.
- I'm young.

273
00:28:26,453 --> 00:28:28,614
You mustn't slim.

274
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:31,496
Can you let your hair down?

275
00:28:50,391 --> 00:28:52,512
- Your voice...
- What about it?

276
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:53,993
It's a bit weak.

277
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:56,314
- I can try harder.
- Try.

278
00:28:56,354 --> 00:28:58,196
- I'll manage it.
- Show me.

279
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,479
If I say I'll manage it,
I will.

280
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,520
This isn't a knocking shop.

281
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,842
I know.

282
00:29:04,882 --> 00:29:07,884
That's why I wrote to you.

283
00:29:07,924 --> 00:29:11,047
If you don't fit in,
I can't keep you.

284
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:13,929
You learn the job as you go.
It's not easy.

285
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,051
Can I get dressed now?

286
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,659
You have a nickname?

287
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:23,576
La Petite.
Will that do?

288
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:24,898
Do you have a lover?

289
00:29:24,938 --> 00:29:26,744
No lover.

290
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:28,900
Are you a virgin?

291
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,662
Tell me.
It's not a problem.

292
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:31,822
I can check.

293
00:29:31,823 --> 00:29:34,944
- Are you a virgin?
- No.

294
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:36,746
Why choose this place?

295
00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:39,988
To be independent.
To be free.

296
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,310
To be free?
In a house of tolerance?

297
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,311
Freedom's outside, not here.

298
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:47,114
To earn money of my own.

299
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:49,035
Do you want to marry?

300
00:29:49,075 --> 00:29:51,758
- No.
- Why are you lying?

301
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:53,719
Don't fool yourself.

302
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,682
A man rarely marries
a prostitute.

303
00:29:56,722 --> 00:29:58,563
We all live together.

304
00:29:58,603 --> 00:30:00,324
We're always together.

305
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:04,007
We're nice to each other,
respect each other.

306
00:30:04,047 --> 00:30:05,968
All right?

307
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,976
We share beds.

308
00:30:10,011 --> 00:30:11,892
You can sleep here.

309
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:14,815
There's room with Clothilde.

310
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,621
You stay until the clients go,

311
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:24,982
but get up when you want.

312
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:28,865
When you get up,
go down to the dining room.

313
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:30,626
You never go out alone.

314
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:32,268
Only with Madame or a man.

315
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:35,151
If you're alone outside,
that's soliciting.

316
00:30:35,191 --> 00:30:37,352
At around 4:00, we wash.

317
00:30:37,392 --> 00:30:39,474
We have to be clean.
Very clean.

318
00:30:39,514 --> 00:30:41,275
Smell nice. Clean hair.

319
00:30:41,315 --> 00:30:45,119
Soap your body and hair daily
and rub down with cologne.

320
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:46,920
Often we do it in pairs.

321
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,040
I wash you, you wash me...

322
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,683
I'll show you the creams.

323
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:53,529
A hairdresser comes at 6:00.

324
00:30:53,564 --> 00:30:56,446
He can curl your hair,
dye it and so on.

325
00:30:56,486 --> 00:30:58,689
You don't pay him.
Madame does.

326
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:01,731
If a client likes your hair
one particular way,

327
00:31:01,771 --> 00:31:04,172
don't change it too often.

328
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:05,372
Come on.

329
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:08,456
If a client says you smell
or you're dirty,

330
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:10,057
Madame will fine you.

331
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:12,779
It'll only increase your debts.

332
00:31:12,814 --> 00:31:15,180
So wash yourself.

333
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,749
We all buy our own perfume.

334
00:31:20,784 --> 00:31:25,349
You don't use another girl's.
You buy your own.

335
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:27,151
After each client,

336
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:31,353
rinse your mouth with water
and a few drops of mouthwash.

337
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:34,235
It's strong, but it works.

338
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:38,839
- My name's Lea.
- Pauline.

339
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:41,801
I know.

340
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:43,923
Welcome.

341
00:31:43,963 --> 00:31:47,045
When the client undresses,
discreetly check his cock.

342
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:49,252
Check for sores or spots.

343
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:51,729
Check his body for rashes too.

344
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:53,811
Any doubts, don't have sex.

345
00:31:55,692 --> 00:31:58,533
After each job,
wash your lips,

346
00:31:58,574 --> 00:32:00,895
rinse and rub them
with cologne.

347
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:01,975
Ever used it?

348
00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:03,457
No.

349
00:32:03,497 --> 00:32:05,940
It stings,
but that's normal.

350
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,861
When you get to the room,
what do you do?

351
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:10,623
- Talk?
- Yes, you talk.

352
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:12,945
You chat a little.

353
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:14,827
They might talk
about themselves.

354
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:16,428
You have another drink.

355
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,389
It helps.

356
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:21,151
Find out what he's like
and adapt.

357
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:24,073
After a while,
you get the same ones.

358
00:32:24,113 --> 00:32:25,915
Just arouse them
and make them come.

359
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:29,637
But fake it during sex.

360
00:32:29,672 --> 00:32:32,057
- Why?
- Because.

361
00:32:32,092 --> 00:32:34,441
That's how we do it.

362
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:43,208
Hello.

363
00:32:43,248 --> 00:32:44,367
Pauline.

364
00:32:44,368 --> 00:32:47,056
Madeleine.

365
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,813
This is for you.

366
00:32:56,497 --> 00:32:58,779
What's that?

367
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:01,422
A wine stain.
I can't get it out.

368
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:04,024
Let me see.

369
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:14,117
I'll wear it anyway.

370
00:33:14,152 --> 00:33:17,033
The old woman will only add it
to my debts.

371
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,401
- Tighter.
- Don't move.

372
00:33:39,491 --> 00:33:41,492
Looking for wrinkles?

373
00:33:41,532 --> 00:33:44,700
Let me see.

374
00:33:44,735 --> 00:33:47,096
No, you're fine.

375
00:33:47,137 --> 00:33:49,018
Just a few around the eyes.

376
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:50,900
That's okay.

377
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,780
You don't have one.

378
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:55,703
They'll come.

379
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:27,968
Want to try?

380
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:30,729
It helps with love.

381
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:36,414
Good evening.

382
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:39,296
I'm Jacques.

383
00:34:39,336 --> 00:34:42,217
I follow you?

384
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:47,502
Did Madame buy you
from another house or not?

385
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:49,584
No.

386
00:34:49,624 --> 00:34:52,106
You have no debts then.

387
00:34:52,146 --> 00:34:55,348
- What were you before?
- A seamstress.

388
00:34:55,383 --> 00:34:57,715
I was a laundress.

389
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,273
It was torture, believe me.

390
00:35:00,313 --> 00:35:03,994
My lungs are full of ammonia.

391
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:06,076
What did you do before?

392
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:08,958
Me?
I did nothing special.

393
00:35:08,998 --> 00:35:11,640
You're from the bourgeoisie?

394
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,683
The petty bourgeoisie.
Very petty.

395
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:19,646
- You have no debts then.
- We all have debts.

396
00:35:19,686 --> 00:35:21,729
You work to pay them off.

397
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:23,209
In your dreams.

398
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:27,213
She makes sure you never pay
them off and leave.

399
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:29,454
Even with a lot of clients,
you always need perfume...

400
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:33,577
Go easy on that stuff.

401
00:35:33,617 --> 00:35:36,259
But, Madame,
Mondays are quiet.

402
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:38,180
- It helps us relax.
- It won't be quiet for long.

403
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,102
Come on, up you get.

404
00:35:40,142 --> 00:35:42,545
He's a new one.

405
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:48,388
- Are you all right?
- Yes, fine.

406
00:35:48,428 --> 00:35:52,351
That's good.
Very good.

407
00:35:52,391 --> 00:35:54,793
Just...

408
00:36:01,998 --> 00:36:05,201
Michaux could pay off
your debts.

409
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:08,285
If he does, I'll marry him.

410
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,736
The tall girl is popular.

411
00:36:23,776 --> 00:36:26,578
Next to her, the Algerian.

412
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:29,340
Samira.

413
00:36:37,185 --> 00:36:40,948
That young one there is 15.
She's a virgin.

414
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,512
I can send for a boy too.

415
00:36:45,547 --> 00:36:47,033
19, very pretty.

416
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:49,475
He can be here in an hour.

417
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:55,239
I need to think about it.

418
00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:32,788
- Do you like champagne?
- Not really.

419
00:37:32,828 --> 00:37:34,869
But he loves it.

420
00:37:47,158 --> 00:37:49,881
Come on.

421
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,811
It's cold.

422
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:04,813
You'll get used to it.

423
00:38:04,853 --> 00:38:08,374
You'll see, it's delicious.

424
00:39:27,474 --> 00:39:30,398
Very nice.

425
00:39:36,602 --> 00:39:38,403
It's wonderful here.

426
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:41,285
You see girls without corsets...

427
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:52,019
Lea...

428
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:53,975
- Someone for you.
- Who is it?

429
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:55,701
Victor.

430
00:39:55,736 --> 00:39:58,619
Hurry up now.
He's in the blue room.

431
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:06,664
Michaux will be in at one.
Try to see someone else first.

432
00:40:11,428 --> 00:40:14,110
When Pauline finishes,
check it went well.

433
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,672
Why me?

434
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:22,357
So shall we have commerce?

435
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:25,039
- No, not today.
- Why not?

436
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,479
Because.

437
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,761
Pity.

438
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,691
Who did Charles go with?

439
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:43,052
Lea.

440
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:46,535
She milked the first one?

441
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:48,495
That other guy...

442
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:50,497
Who did he go with?

443
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:52,899
No idea.

444
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,792
Won't you sit down?

445
00:41:27,126 --> 00:41:30,007
Can you lift your veil?

446
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:44,258
What's your name?

447
00:41:44,298 --> 00:41:46,941
- The Jewess.
- No. Your real name.

448
00:41:46,981 --> 00:41:49,823
Madeleine.

449
00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:52,546
I'm Jacques.

450
00:41:52,586 --> 00:41:55,667
Why did you come up?

451
00:41:55,707 --> 00:41:58,590
I paid for the night.

452
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:16,804
- Does that hurt?
- No.

453
00:42:55,032 --> 00:42:57,915
How did it happen?

454
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:03,519
You don't have to tell me.

455
00:43:07,402 --> 00:43:09,603
It was a man...

456
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:12,606
A man I knew well.

457
00:43:12,646 --> 00:43:15,287
We were in one of the rooms.

458
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,330
He asked
if he could tie me up.

459
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,772
I said he could.

460
00:43:19,812 --> 00:43:22,533
I played along.

461
00:43:22,574 --> 00:43:25,616
And that was that.

462
00:43:28,779 --> 00:43:31,939
No one ever comes to see you?

463
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:33,502
No.

464
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:37,184
So what do you do here?

465
00:43:37,224 --> 00:43:40,187
I make the beds.

466
00:43:40,227 --> 00:43:42,428
I help in the kitchen.

467
00:43:42,468 --> 00:43:45,351
I help in the laundry.

468
00:43:45,386 --> 00:43:48,233
I look after the girls.

469
00:43:50,155 --> 00:43:52,515
- Does she hide you?
- No.

470
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,878
Why are you asking me all this?

471
00:43:54,918 --> 00:43:55,997
I don't know.

472
00:43:55,998 --> 00:43:58,840
Didn't you want to have
a normal life?

473
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,163
Outside.

474
00:44:00,203 --> 00:44:02,444
You could find a job.

475
00:44:02,484 --> 00:44:05,006
I can help if you want.

476
00:44:05,046 --> 00:44:07,407
I don't know.

477
00:44:07,447 --> 00:44:09,609
Do you want to make love or not?

478
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:12,411
I don't want to talk anymore.

479
00:44:12,451 --> 00:44:15,334
Vuitton...

480
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:27,143
- Thank you again.
- My pleasure.

481
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:32,387
I'll get my animal.

482
00:45:51,046 --> 00:45:53,248
I adore her.

483
00:45:53,288 --> 00:45:55,129
I've never had her.

484
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,731
When she goes off you,
you get this.

485
00:45:57,771 --> 00:46:00,934
Pussy fur?

486
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:02,576
Who were you with?

487
00:46:02,616 --> 00:46:05,457
My Julie.

488
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:07,299
Caca.

489
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,460
How many?

490
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,102
Four.
You?

491
00:46:13,142 --> 00:46:14,864
Six.

492
00:46:14,904 --> 00:46:16,185
Five.

493
00:46:16,225 --> 00:46:17,547
Three.

494
00:46:17,587 --> 00:46:19,108
I'll never get out of here.

495
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:23,351
Okay?

496
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:25,152
This shit is sticky...

497
00:46:25,192 --> 00:46:27,914
Let me help.

498
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:36,080
What's this?

499
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,203
It's not easy in a bathtub
but I'm okay.

500
00:46:40,243 --> 00:46:43,286
- Want some ointment?
- I'm okay.

501
00:46:46,288 --> 00:46:47,809
Did it go well?

502
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:49,771
I think so.

503
00:46:51,572 --> 00:46:55,056
How do I clean the sperm
with the sponge?

504
00:46:55,096 --> 00:46:57,137
Use this cream and rub gently.

505
00:46:57,177 --> 00:47:00,019
It stings but that's normal.

506
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:14,469
It's so depressing.

507
00:47:14,509 --> 00:47:17,392
It'll be dawn soon.

508
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:38,368
I've drunk too much.

509
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:36,532
Thank you.

510
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:55,786
80.

511
00:48:55,826 --> 00:48:57,628
"Mr. Prefect,

512
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,230
"I am a widow
raising two children.

513
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:04,913
"My duty is to provide for them

514
00:49:04,953 --> 00:49:06,394
"As I advance in years,

515
00:49:06,434 --> 00:49:11,519
"finding a trade other than
the one I have is impossible.

516
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:14,281
"You know I run
a respectable house.

517
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:15,802
"My girls are healthy,

518
00:49:15,842 --> 00:49:19,044
"and we abide by the rules
for such houses.

519
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:21,925
"I know the law and uphold it.

520
00:49:21,965 --> 00:49:24,969
"I've never offered a girl

521
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:27,010
"or used one for corruption.

522
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:30,373
"In a word, the house is clean.

523
00:49:30,413 --> 00:49:31,974
"The landlord,
the notary Hallereau,

524
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:35,377
"knows of your affection
for this house

525
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:38,459
"and so demands
a large increase in rent.

526
00:49:38,499 --> 00:49:41,541
"He refuses to negotiate.

"I paid for all the fittings.

"Business is now good.

529
00:49:45,784 --> 00:49:49,627
"But this increase in rent

00:49:49,668 --> 00:49:53,590
"obliging me to sell up

531
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,473
"I have no one else to turn to.

00:49:56,513 --> 00:50:00,756
"Please allow me to make

00:50:00,796 --> 00:50:05,119
"Allow me the consolation

534
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:08,001
Marie-France Dallaire. "

535
00:51:02,162 --> 00:51:05,045
It reeks of sperm
and champagne here.

536
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:35,626
Why do they call you Caca?

537
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:38,030
Why do they
call you Caca?

538
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,911
Why am I Long Hair?

539
00:51:42,153 --> 00:51:43,874
Let's just say...

540
00:51:43,914 --> 00:51:46,476
I have a specialty.

541
00:51:46,516 --> 00:51:50,559
I get the picture.

542
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:52,201
Want to know anyway?

543
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:53,842
Julie, we're eating!

544
00:51:53,882 --> 00:51:56,084
Why?

545
00:52:00,646 --> 00:52:02,007
Don't spoil it.

546
00:52:02,047 --> 00:52:04,770
Does it still hurt?

547
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:06,931
Only a little at night now.

548
00:52:08,493 --> 00:52:10,334
- Did Madame make you?
- No.

549
00:52:10,374 --> 00:52:12,736
She asked me.

550
00:52:12,776 --> 00:52:14,738
And?

551
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:17,499
He paid for the night,
but didn't want sex.

552
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:18,862
Why not?

553
00:52:20,423 --> 00:52:23,424
Probably just to see
the monster close up.

554
00:52:23,464 --> 00:52:26,026
He was sweet.

555
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:28,187
He said he'd come back
next week.

556
00:52:28,227 --> 00:52:29,469
But I don't believe him.

557
00:52:30,629 --> 00:52:33,312
Want to check in the cards?

558
00:52:33,352 --> 00:52:34,593
No, it's okay.

559
00:52:34,633 --> 00:52:36,795
Last night was
a real freak show.

560
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,520
I had one...

561
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,797
He keeps going to confession

562
00:52:39,837 --> 00:52:43,439
to talk filth
to get the priest hard.

563
00:52:43,479 --> 00:52:45,881
He wanks off at the same time.

564
00:52:47,522 --> 00:52:49,283
That's sick!

565
00:52:49,323 --> 00:52:52,006
I'd like to see
a brothel for women.

566
00:52:52,046 --> 00:52:55,969
A great place with great men
who are hard all the time

567
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:58,216
and tell us we're pretty,

568
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:00,012
even if we're old
with saggy tits.

569
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:02,534
We'd never ask
the stupid questions they do.

570
00:53:02,574 --> 00:53:05,016
Do you like my tits?

571
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,297
Do you like my big tits?

572
00:53:06,337 --> 00:53:07,376
What's "whore" in Arabic?

573
00:53:07,377 --> 00:53:08,497
"Zaniya"...

574
00:53:08,498 --> 00:53:12,182
or "Qahba,"
depending how polite you are.

575
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:15,183
What's the polite one?

576
00:53:15,218 --> 00:53:18,146
"Zaniya," the kept woman.

577
00:53:18,186 --> 00:53:21,508
I don't mind being
a kept woman.

578
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,991
Is Maurice going to propose?

579
00:53:25,031 --> 00:53:27,114
Perhaps.

580
00:53:27,154 --> 00:53:29,355
If his wife dies.

581
00:53:29,395 --> 00:53:30,915
Are you in love?

582
00:53:30,955 --> 00:53:32,997
No.

583
00:53:33,037 --> 00:53:34,438
But he's sweet.

584
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:36,479
The other day,

585
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:39,042
we went to the Wepler
for oysters.

586
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:42,444
Then we went dancing.

587
00:53:42,484 --> 00:53:45,927
Know what I told him?

588
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:48,008
"I would pluck out my eyes
for you

589
00:53:48,048 --> 00:53:50,170
"so you'd have more holes

590
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,372
to make love to me. "

591
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:54,694
He loved that!

592
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:56,455
Is this only for Madeleine?

593
00:53:56,495 --> 00:53:57,935
No, for all of us.

594
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,223
Four show the past,

595
00:54:07,263 --> 00:54:11,106
four the present
and four the future.

596
00:54:34,084 --> 00:54:36,046
No, it's all right.

597
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:38,007
That's the good spade card.

598
00:54:38,047 --> 00:54:41,168
It means stability, luck,
security...

599
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:44,250
The nine of clubs
means a job, a situation.

600
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:47,174
The Queen is a kind woman.

601
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:53,819
There's a young man, single.

602
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,742
He's next to a diamond card.

603
00:54:58,782 --> 00:55:02,145
There's a romantic project,
but it's upside down.

604
00:55:03,306 --> 00:55:06,187
That means there's a problem.

605
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:12,111
A girl with long hair.

606
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:15,115
She's upside down too.

607
00:55:15,155 --> 00:55:17,376
You have to be wary of her.

608
00:55:17,411 --> 00:55:19,598
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

609
00:55:19,638 --> 00:55:22,360
That it's upside down.

610
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,242
It's in relation
to the dealer.

611
00:55:24,282 --> 00:55:26,322
They're only cards.

612
00:55:26,363 --> 00:55:29,006
If you draw them,
they're more than that.

613
00:55:29,046 --> 00:55:31,127
You're a bit of a mystic?

614
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:33,048
I want to stop.

615
00:55:33,088 --> 00:55:35,930
We've started, let's finish.

616
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,091
Come on, the future.

617
00:55:38,131 --> 00:55:40,215
What did they call you before?

618
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:41,735
The Jewess.

619
00:55:53,344 --> 00:55:55,225
Which is the worst one?

620
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,788
The ten.

621
00:56:43,862 --> 00:56:45,903
Do you like that?

622
00:56:45,943 --> 00:56:47,545
Yes.

623
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,530
What do you want?

624
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:24,172
To see the Woman Who Laughs.

625
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:26,254
For sex or just to see her?

626
00:57:26,294 --> 00:57:29,497
To see her first,
then decide.

627
00:57:29,537 --> 00:57:31,178
Inside a room,
you do as you like,

628
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:35,261
but you see girls here for sex,
the normal way.

629
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:38,984
I'd like Lea as a doll then.

630
00:58:40,991 --> 00:58:43,433
Come here.

631
00:59:59,772 --> 01:00:02,652
You smell nice, my doll.

632
01:01:02,298 --> 01:01:04,100
Who did you have?

633
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:05,701
Simon.
And you?

634
01:01:05,741 --> 01:01:07,983
Louis.

635
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:22,433
Julie, no!

636
01:01:26,757 --> 01:01:29,639
Help me!
Julie!

637
01:01:46,332 --> 01:01:48,373
I want the peach.

638
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,694
Well?

639
01:01:49,734 --> 01:01:52,297
I'll get you!
You have to strip right now.

640
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:01,664
Catch.

641
01:02:06,186 --> 01:02:11,391
Marie-France, where do
the clients get their money?

642
01:02:11,431 --> 01:02:13,873
In industry, textiles,
paper...

643
01:02:13,913 --> 01:02:15,354
Family fortunes too.

644
01:02:15,394 --> 01:02:18,116
Fortunes of the aristocracy.

645
01:02:18,156 --> 01:02:19,477
Are there a lot
of aristocrats?

646
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:21,117
Yes.

647
01:02:21,157 --> 01:02:22,999
We get a lot of aristocrats.

648
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,121
What does Louis work in?

649
01:02:25,161 --> 01:02:27,563
Louis is in textiles.

650
01:02:27,603 --> 01:02:29,525
He made his fortune
in textiles.

651
01:02:29,565 --> 01:02:32,086
Michaux has a family fortune.

652
01:02:32,126 --> 01:02:36,329
Charles is a family fortune too.

653
01:02:36,369 --> 01:02:39,293
Who's the richest one?

654
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:42,455
The richest one?

655
01:02:42,495 --> 01:02:44,496
Charles.

656
01:02:44,536 --> 01:02:48,578
He doesn't spend the most,
but he's the richest one.

657
01:02:48,618 --> 01:02:51,181
Has he been coming long?

658
01:02:51,221 --> 01:02:53,623
Yes, since the days
when I worked at L'Apollonide

659
01:02:53,663 --> 01:02:56,745
Like you do.

660
01:03:20,643 --> 01:03:22,205
My back hurts.

661
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:24,286
I'm sick of his doll thing.

662
01:03:24,326 --> 01:03:26,047
Don't complain.
There's worse.

663
01:03:26,087 --> 01:03:29,250
I'm not saying that,
just that I'm sick of it.

664
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:31,210
You do as you want.

665
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:34,254
You get rid of creeps
with a few pussy hairs.

666
01:03:34,294 --> 01:03:37,656
My whole bush wouldn't do that!

667
01:03:47,825 --> 01:03:52,267
It feels like an eternity
since we had a day out.

668
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:58,312
It's me.

669
01:03:58,352 --> 01:03:59,833
Give me your cigarette.

670
01:03:59,873 --> 01:04:03,035
All right.

671
01:04:03,075 --> 01:04:04,357
What is it?

672
01:04:04,397 --> 01:04:07,358
I was thinking a Lanvin hat
would suit you.

673
01:04:07,398 --> 01:04:09,240
Go on then, Polo.

674
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,003
Treat me to a hat.

675
01:04:14,325 --> 01:04:17,326
The fresh air loosens you up.

676
01:04:17,366 --> 01:04:19,247
Want a drop of champagne?

677
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,529
Please.

678
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:24,971
Want some too?

679
01:04:24,972 --> 01:04:27,294
Yeah, okay.

680
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:31,337
Gently!

681
01:04:31,377 --> 01:04:32,858
Sorry.

682
01:04:32,898 --> 01:04:35,180
Pardon me.

683
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:36,260
It slipped out.

684
01:04:36,261 --> 01:04:37,822
Calm down, Polo.

685
01:04:37,862 --> 01:04:39,983
Oh, you know...

686
01:04:40,023 --> 01:04:44,026
I'm sorry, it's old age.

687
01:04:44,066 --> 01:04:45,267
This is nice.

688
01:04:45,307 --> 01:04:46,388
Oh, yes!

689
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:48,029
I feel so good!

690
01:05:46,034 --> 01:05:49,797
I don't think
I'll be here long.

691
01:05:49,837 --> 01:05:51,478
I said that too.

692
01:05:51,518 --> 01:05:52,918
Now look at me.

693
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,961
We'll see.

694
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:58,282
I don't have any debts yet.

695
01:05:58,322 --> 01:06:01,046
We'll see.

696
01:06:11,373 --> 01:06:14,255
"I understand
your sense of injustice,

697
01:06:14,295 --> 01:06:16,977
"and I've always given you
my support.

698
01:06:17,017 --> 01:06:20,019
"But, as a prefect,
I can't work miracles.

699
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:24,823
I cannot oppose
a landlord's decision. "

700
01:06:24,863 --> 01:06:27,946
Good evening.

701
01:06:27,986 --> 01:06:29,347
Who's here this evening?

702
01:06:29,387 --> 01:06:32,110
The same ones.

703
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:35,671
- Still want to see the Jewess?
- Pardon me?

704
01:06:35,706 --> 01:06:39,193
The Woman Who Laughs.
Want to go up to see her?

705
01:06:39,233 --> 01:06:40,755
You can,
but it'll cost you more.

706
01:06:40,795 --> 01:06:42,957
No.
I was a bit tipsy last time.

707
01:06:42,997 --> 01:06:44,157
Who else is there?

708
01:06:44,158 --> 01:06:45,318
Who else...

709
01:06:45,319 --> 01:06:48,602
Sweetness, Clea, Climbing Rose,
Fine Thigh...

710
01:07:05,374 --> 01:07:09,258
Afterwards, women couldn't
compete in the games.

711
01:07:09,298 --> 01:07:11,379
Why not?

712
01:07:11,419 --> 01:07:13,740
Good question.

713
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:18,704
They were thrown from a rock
if ever they went there.

714
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:22,747
But now they can go.

715
01:07:22,787 --> 01:07:25,549
They couldn't go
because the athletes were nude.

716
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:28,431
Now they're dressed.

717
01:07:28,466 --> 01:07:31,274
So women can take part.

718
01:07:49,087 --> 01:07:51,650
Will you go up with me
and another girl?

719
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:53,571
Who?

720
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,372
Anyone.
You choose.

721
01:07:56,332 --> 01:07:58,094
I don't know.

722
01:07:58,134 --> 01:08:01,137
I'd rather go alone
if you don't mind.

723
01:08:11,703 --> 01:08:14,587
Shall I put you in my will?

724
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:21,552
Do you want to be in my will?

725
01:08:21,592 --> 01:08:22,757
No.

726
01:08:22,792 --> 01:08:25,795
I want you to stay alive.

727
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:29,359
If anyone here is alive,

728
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:31,799
I am.

729
01:08:36,963 --> 01:08:38,444
Good evening.

730
01:08:38,484 --> 01:08:39,726
Ah, Louis!

731
01:08:42,008 --> 01:08:45,651
A drink
or shall I call Samira?

732
01:08:45,691 --> 01:08:48,412
Both.

733
01:08:52,255 --> 01:08:56,138
"I understand
your sense of injustice,

734
01:08:56,178 --> 01:08:59,860
"and I've always given you
my support.

735
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:03,623
But, as a prefect,
I can't work miracles. "

736
01:09:11,951 --> 01:09:14,872
Thank you.

737
01:09:14,913 --> 01:09:17,234
Some women
have very large breasts.

738
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:21,798
They could have an accident,
knock themselves out...

739
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:23,239
Yes, that's true.

740
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,920
They could bandage them.

741
01:09:28,123 --> 01:09:30,084
It's not so much fun.

742
01:09:45,335 --> 01:09:48,177
Fine Thigh.

743
01:09:54,063 --> 01:09:55,864
Fine Thigh...

744
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:57,665
Clothed or naked?

745
01:09:57,705 --> 01:09:59,827
I prefer you naked.

746
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:02,549
- It costs more.
- I know.

747
01:10:53,627 --> 01:10:56,349
Talk to me in Japanese.

748
01:10:58,632 --> 01:11:01,513
Go on, make it up.

749
01:11:03,555 --> 01:11:06,877
Make it up.

750
01:11:13,763 --> 01:11:16,044
More.

751
01:11:37,821 --> 01:11:40,703
What does that mean?

752
01:11:40,743 --> 01:11:45,747
It means my tongue
comes towards you.

753
01:11:45,787 --> 01:11:49,509
Slowly.
It slithers across the floor.

754
01:11:49,549 --> 01:11:51,432
It slips under the bed.

755
01:11:51,472 --> 01:11:53,953
It rises up the side of it.

756
01:11:53,993 --> 01:11:55,875
It reaches your feet.

757
01:11:55,915 --> 01:11:57,676
It licks them.

758
01:11:57,716 --> 01:12:00,037
It glides up along your leg.

759
01:12:00,077 --> 01:12:02,039
Along your thigh.

760
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:04,161
It reaches your sex.

761
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:06,163
It winds around it.

762
01:12:06,203 --> 01:12:08,444
It swallows it completely.

763
01:12:08,484 --> 01:12:11,207
Sword swallower.

764
01:12:14,328 --> 01:12:17,212
Your Japanese is very good.

765
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:26,057
Do you want some?

766
01:12:27,819 --> 01:12:29,219
You don't have to smoke it.

767
01:12:29,259 --> 01:12:32,583
You can take a bit and eat it.

768
01:12:32,623 --> 01:12:35,065
It's okay, I know.

769
01:13:05,968 --> 01:13:08,168
I want to see you often.

770
01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:10,852
Won't Clothilde
be angry with me?

771
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:12,613
I can see more than one girl.

772
01:13:12,653 --> 01:13:17,296
Now stop asking questions
and talk to me in Japanese.

773
01:13:30,386 --> 01:13:31,667
You're very young.

774
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:32,908
Not that young.

775
01:13:34,789 --> 01:13:36,751
Really?

776
01:13:36,791 --> 01:13:41,114
Not many girls my age
have been fucked in champagne.

777
01:13:41,154 --> 01:13:42,996
Did you like it?

778
01:13:43,036 --> 01:13:45,758
I loved it.

779
01:13:53,565 --> 01:13:57,567
Men never look into the sex
of women enough.

780
01:14:06,694 --> 01:14:09,577
Wonderful.

781
01:14:10,857 --> 01:14:13,820
After one night with you,
I could kill myself.

782
01:14:32,754 --> 01:14:34,796
Say "Ah. "

783
01:14:34,836 --> 01:14:35,916
Good.

784
01:14:35,917 --> 01:14:37,118
What's that spot?

785
01:14:37,158 --> 01:14:38,358
Nothing.

786
01:14:38,398 --> 01:14:39,999
Have you had it long?

787
01:14:40,039 --> 01:14:41,880
It's nothing.

788
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:42,960
All right.

789
01:14:42,961 --> 01:14:44,000
One month? Two?

790
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:45,324
No, a few days.

791
01:14:45,364 --> 01:14:48,246
All right.

792
01:14:48,286 --> 01:14:49,686
Any itching?

793
01:14:49,726 --> 01:14:51,648
No.

794
01:14:58,493 --> 01:15:01,377
- No new rashes on your body?
- No.

795
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:04,657
Let me take a look.

796
01:15:09,261 --> 01:15:11,503
Let me see.

797
01:15:13,825 --> 01:15:17,028
Lie down now
and let me examine you.

798
01:15:30,757 --> 01:15:33,480
Let me see.

799
01:15:37,122 --> 01:15:40,526
Nothing around the anus.

800
01:15:40,566 --> 01:15:43,448
I'll use the speculum now.

801
01:15:52,694 --> 01:15:57,338
If ever I get out of here,
I'll never make love again.

802
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:01,060
- No...
- Yes.

803
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:02,180
I have to examine you.

804
01:16:02,181 --> 01:16:04,143
You have to lie down.

805
01:16:04,183 --> 01:16:06,266
- No!
- I have to examine you.

806
01:16:06,306 --> 01:16:07,907
I have to.

807
01:16:07,947 --> 01:16:09,192
Come on.

808
01:16:09,227 --> 01:16:10,968
Now spread your thighs.

809
01:16:11,003 --> 01:16:12,709
No two ways about it.

810
01:16:12,749 --> 01:16:16,232
I can't see your sex otherwise.
Come on now.

811
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:21,437
Look at me.

812
01:16:21,477 --> 01:16:23,118
You have to lie down.

813
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:26,521
Lie down and spread your thighs.
You have to do it.

814
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:32,325
The cervix is fine.

815
01:16:32,365 --> 01:16:34,487
Heavy but normal discharge.

816
01:16:34,527 --> 01:16:36,928
How about your period?

817
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:39,450
It comes and goes.

818
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:41,411
When did you last have it?
Two months ago?

819
01:16:41,446 --> 01:16:42,491
Three?

820
01:16:42,492 --> 01:16:44,373
Not long ago.
I forget.

821
01:16:44,413 --> 01:16:47,142
Six months?

822
01:16:47,177 --> 01:16:49,938
You don't have your period
anymore?

823
01:16:49,978 --> 01:16:52,139
I'm not pregnant.

824
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:54,987
Six months...

825
01:16:55,022 --> 01:16:57,303
I just don't have my period
anymore.

826
01:16:57,343 --> 01:16:59,504
How about your period?

827
01:16:59,544 --> 01:17:01,547
Same thing.

828
01:17:01,587 --> 01:17:03,589
It comes and goes.

829
01:17:03,629 --> 01:17:05,109
And you?

830
01:17:05,149 --> 01:17:06,229
Normal.

831
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,831
And you there?

832
01:17:07,871 --> 01:17:09,513
Mine's fine.

833
01:17:09,553 --> 01:17:11,154
Let me examine you.

834
01:17:22,522 --> 01:17:23,803
Lie down.

835
01:17:29,449 --> 01:17:32,330
- Okay?
- Yes, I'm healthy.

836
01:17:54,347 --> 01:17:55,949
Well?

837
01:17:55,989 --> 01:17:58,670
I'm fine.
I'm healthy.

838
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:00,591
And the others?

839
01:18:00,631 --> 01:18:01,873
I don't know.

840
01:18:01,913 --> 01:18:03,073
I swear...

841
01:18:03,074 --> 01:18:07,197
What am I supposed to do now?

842
01:18:07,237 --> 01:18:09,598
You think they're not pregnant?

843
01:18:09,638 --> 01:18:11,679
No, I'm sure.

844
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:15,843
But, I'm sorry,
that girl there has syphilis.

845
01:18:26,611 --> 01:18:29,614
- It's okay. I accept it.
- Bravo.

846
01:18:34,218 --> 01:18:37,579
I'd just like someone
to give me a hug.

847
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,871
I want a macaroon.

848
01:18:56,033 --> 01:18:58,595
What a shit job.

849
01:19:05,201 --> 01:19:08,043
Fucking is a fuck awful job.

850
01:19:41,467 --> 01:19:45,471
It won't be easy tonight.

851
01:19:45,511 --> 01:19:46,992
No.

852
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:49,794
Have you seen my bracelet?

853
01:19:49,829 --> 01:19:52,557
- Which one?
- The pearl one.

854
01:19:52,597 --> 01:19:55,599
I think I saw it in the box.

855
01:20:04,005 --> 01:20:08,287
I put a charm on her doll.

856
01:20:08,327 --> 01:20:09,570
I got a needle and...

857
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:11,491
It's not your fault, Samira.

858
01:20:11,531 --> 01:20:13,212
It could have been me or you.

859
01:20:13,252 --> 01:20:15,014
It's the clap.

860
01:20:15,054 --> 01:20:17,535
Samira, go down.
Louis will be here soon.

861
01:20:23,661 --> 01:20:25,222
Madame...

862
01:20:25,263 --> 01:20:26,542
I have my period.

863
01:20:26,582 --> 01:20:28,503
We're too busy.

864
01:20:28,543 --> 01:20:29,945
- Take a cold bath.
- Please...

865
01:20:29,985 --> 01:20:31,065
I can't.

866
01:20:31,066 --> 01:20:34,708
I'm already one girl short
as it is.

867
01:20:34,748 --> 01:20:36,751
You'll have to work more.

868
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:38,191
Yes, Madame.

869
01:20:38,232 --> 01:20:41,874
And try to show
a little joy tonight.

870
01:20:41,915 --> 01:20:43,715
All right?

871
01:20:47,799 --> 01:20:49,840
Tonight,
just pretend I'm dead.

872
01:22:05,818 --> 01:22:08,059
You really have a tiny head.

873
01:22:08,094 --> 01:22:09,780
So?

874
01:22:09,821 --> 01:22:11,703
A tiny head is pretty,
isn't it?

875
01:22:11,743 --> 01:22:14,625
It's very pretty.
Charming.

876
01:22:14,665 --> 01:22:16,427
You have a tiny head too.

877
01:22:16,467 --> 01:22:17,667
I'm sorry?

878
01:22:17,707 --> 01:22:20,028
The size of your head...

879
01:22:20,069 --> 01:22:22,190
My head is fine and delicate.

880
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:24,712
I knew it.

881
01:22:24,752 --> 01:22:29,836
A woman called Pauline Tarnowsky
has written a scientific study

882
01:22:29,876 --> 01:22:31,557
on prostitutes.

883
01:22:31,598 --> 01:22:34,759
She says their heads are smaller
than average.

884
01:22:34,799 --> 01:22:37,203
The same is true of criminals.

885
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:38,924
Really?

886
01:22:38,964 --> 01:22:41,485
I can lend it to you
if you want.

887
01:22:41,525 --> 01:22:43,167
If it's good.

888
01:22:43,207 --> 01:22:45,927
It's very good.

889
01:22:56,776 --> 01:23:00,699
Right now, a normal girl
goes for 300.

890
01:23:00,739 --> 01:23:03,341
400 for a Negress.

891
01:23:03,382 --> 01:23:05,504
- Plus the debts.
- I can't.

892
01:23:05,544 --> 01:23:08,144
Even to keep Julie
without working, I can't.

893
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:10,907
Paris is too expensive now.

894
01:23:13,148 --> 01:23:19,052
I have a friend
who organizes special evenings.

895
01:23:19,153 --> 01:23:22,356
The Woman Who Laughs
interests him.

896
01:23:39,689 --> 01:23:42,571
I want to pay off your debts.

897
01:24:02,027 --> 01:24:03,667
Five times six.

898
01:24:03,707 --> 01:24:05,749
Eight...

899
01:24:05,789 --> 01:24:07,551
- 30... 40.
- 40.

900
01:24:07,591 --> 01:24:11,153
Here you are.

901
01:24:11,194 --> 01:24:12,835
Five times seven?

902
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:15,637
No, five times nine.

903
01:24:15,677 --> 01:24:16,997
What time is it?

904
01:24:17,037 --> 01:24:19,399
It's only 8:00.
Go to bed.

905
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:22,321
You'll look like hell tonight.

906
01:24:23,602 --> 01:24:24,804
Five times nine?

907
01:24:28,407 --> 01:24:30,848
You're still here?

908
01:24:30,888 --> 01:24:32,809
Will you sleep with me?

909
01:24:32,849 --> 01:24:34,010
No.

910
01:24:34,011 --> 01:24:35,612
It's too late now.

911
01:24:35,652 --> 01:24:36,852
Or too early.

912
01:24:37,813 --> 01:24:40,655
I didn't mean sex.
Just sleeping.

913
01:24:40,695 --> 01:24:43,577
I don't want to go home.
I feel bad.

914
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:49,101
Just sleep then?

915
01:24:49,141 --> 01:24:50,543
At 8:00 a.m.,

916
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:54,266
there's no more commerce.

917
01:24:54,306 --> 01:24:56,188
You can lie
between Samira and me.

918
01:24:56,228 --> 01:24:57,789
I promise.

919
01:24:57,829 --> 01:24:59,350
I'll be fine between you.

920
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:01,832
Lea, go to bed.

921
01:25:01,872 --> 01:25:03,512
Sorry.

922
01:25:03,552 --> 01:25:07,836
Good night.

923
01:25:07,876 --> 01:25:11,039
I can't bring myself
to go home.

924
01:25:11,079 --> 01:25:13,480
- Where's Pauline?
- She's asleep by now.

925
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:17,763
Who with?

926
01:25:17,803 --> 01:25:20,805
Do you mind
if I stay here awhile?

927
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,809
If I go home,
I'll be a wreck.

928
01:25:23,849 --> 01:25:25,410
You've gone off Clothilde?

929
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:26,609
I don't know.

930
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:28,011
I adore her, but...

931
01:25:28,051 --> 01:25:29,872
we don't have fun.

932
01:25:29,907 --> 01:25:31,693
I make her sad.

933
01:25:31,733 --> 01:25:34,577
But I'm very fond of her.

934
01:25:34,617 --> 01:25:36,498
I love whores.

935
01:25:36,538 --> 01:25:40,661
I find them wonderful.
They move me.

936
01:25:40,701 --> 01:25:43,583
I'm happy with them.
Terrible, isn't it?

937
01:25:43,618 --> 01:25:46,003
I understand.

938
01:25:46,038 --> 01:25:48,388
I understand you.

939
01:27:09,369 --> 01:27:11,130
It's occupied.

940
01:27:27,101 --> 01:27:31,144
"Anthropometric Study
of Prostitutes and Thieves"

941
01:27:31,185 --> 01:27:34,308
"Pauline Tarnowsky - 1889"

942
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,701
Spread your legs.

943
01:28:18,741 --> 01:28:22,464
So I can see you.

944
01:28:22,504 --> 01:28:25,386
Tighter.

945
01:28:27,589 --> 01:28:30,030
My geisha...

946
01:28:40,998 --> 01:28:45,081
"The prostitute
is a female criminal.

947
01:28:45,121 --> 01:28:51,026
"We observe an encephalon
several millimeters smaller,

948
01:28:52,046 --> 01:28:53,768
"due to the fact

949
01:28:53,808 --> 01:28:57,570
"that prostitutes
have smaller heads.

950
01:28:57,610 --> 01:29:03,514
"Consequently, this means they
have much less brain matter.

951
01:29:04,336 --> 01:29:07,499
"Their weak intelligence

952
01:29:07,539 --> 01:29:09,821
"and mental abnormality
is natural.

953
01:29:09,861 --> 01:29:14,985
"The dull spirit of some
can become stupor in others

954
01:29:15,025 --> 01:29:20,428
and even attain
a state verging on idiocy. "

955
01:29:25,912 --> 01:29:28,954
Get up, Clothilde.

956
01:29:32,597 --> 01:29:34,719
- I'm fine here.
- You are?

957
01:29:34,759 --> 01:29:37,041
Stupefied, you're fine?

958
01:29:39,963 --> 01:29:42,364
You'll end up
in a Marseille brothel

959
01:29:42,404 --> 01:29:46,648
turning tricks
on a vermin-ridden mattress.

960
01:29:46,688 --> 01:29:49,010
No.

961
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,651
Know what I'm going to do?

962
01:29:51,692 --> 01:29:53,053
I'll sell myself

963
01:29:53,093 --> 01:29:55,054
to another house.

964
01:29:55,134 --> 01:29:58,897
For a high price,
so I can pay off my debts.

965
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:00,663
Of course.

966
01:30:00,698 --> 01:30:04,982
No one will want your debts.

967
01:30:05,022 --> 01:30:06,582
Well, I'll sell my teeth.

968
01:30:10,305 --> 01:30:13,028
A Marseille brothel,
with the clap.

969
01:30:13,068 --> 01:30:15,950
Great.
Fine.

970
01:30:15,991 --> 01:30:19,994
We deserve the clap.

971
01:30:20,034 --> 01:30:22,355
We deserve our punishment.

972
01:30:23,997 --> 01:30:26,158
I've been here 12 years.

973
01:30:26,198 --> 01:30:28,961
The clap will be a nice break.

974
01:30:45,734 --> 01:30:47,094
Be brave.

975
01:30:51,657 --> 01:30:54,378
Good-bye.

976
01:30:57,902 --> 01:31:00,383
My dear Julie...

977
01:31:00,424 --> 01:31:02,746
my little Caca...

978
01:31:02,786 --> 01:31:04,427
it hurts me to write this

979
01:31:04,467 --> 01:31:08,750
because it will hurt you
to read it.

980
01:31:08,791 --> 01:31:11,313
You're ill, my little Julie,

981
01:31:11,353 --> 01:31:13,914
and I wish I was there
to comfort you.

982
01:31:13,954 --> 01:31:17,797
But there are things
I must say.

983
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:25,963
Don't think I'm abandoning you.

984
01:31:26,003 --> 01:31:29,406
I'd never abandon someone
I cherish as much as you

985
01:31:29,446 --> 01:31:32,729
after all these months.

986
01:31:32,769 --> 01:31:36,451
But I must tell you this.

987
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:37,692
Our relations must change.

988
01:31:37,733 --> 01:31:40,654
I don't want to catch
your disease.

989
01:31:40,694 --> 01:31:43,897
I never hesitate
to sacrifice myself,

990
01:31:43,937 --> 01:31:49,222
but now that sacrifice
would hurt me and not help you.

991
01:31:53,464 --> 01:31:57,072
You know I cannot pursue
your disease.

992
01:31:57,107 --> 01:32:00,469
I think I have eluded it
as I have no symptoms,

993
01:32:00,509 --> 01:32:04,713
but I'm not safe yet.

994
01:32:04,753 --> 01:32:07,915
I have to wait two more weeks.

995
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:13,359
Julie, if I were ill,
I would forgive you.

996
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:17,123
But no one in my family
has ever had such diseases,

997
01:32:17,158 --> 01:32:20,246
and I wouldn't like
to infect others.

998
01:32:20,286 --> 01:32:23,046
Men have secrets
but no mystery,

999
01:32:23,086 --> 01:32:26,449
and I'm so sorry,
my little Julie.

1000
01:32:26,489 --> 01:32:28,890
I still love you,

1001
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:33,415
even more now
because you're ill.

1002
01:32:33,455 --> 01:32:37,778
Your loving friend, Maurice.

1003
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:39,579
"Men...

1004
01:32:39,619 --> 01:32:41,941
"Men have secrets
but no mystery,

1005
01:32:41,981 --> 01:32:44,063
"and I'm so sorry,
my little Julie.

1006
01:32:44,103 --> 01:32:45,304
"I still love you,

1007
01:32:45,343 --> 01:32:47,745
"even more now
because you're ill.

1008
01:32:47,785 --> 01:32:49,707
Your loving friend, Maurice. "

1009
01:32:49,747 --> 01:32:51,187
Where was it?

1010
01:32:51,227 --> 01:32:52,268
In the mail.

1011
01:32:52,269 --> 01:32:53,670
Tear it up.

1012
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:54,910
She mustn't read it.

1013
01:32:59,075 --> 01:33:01,036
That's really sick.

1014
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:03,878
I can keep her
because he's still paying.

1015
01:33:03,918 --> 01:33:06,920
Even if he no longer sees her.

1016
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,521
Any news of Pauline?

1017
01:33:08,561 --> 01:33:10,803
No.

1018
01:33:12,804 --> 01:33:15,246
Is the house closing down?

1019
01:33:15,286 --> 01:33:17,728
I don't know.

1020
01:33:25,015 --> 01:33:27,856
Does it suit me?

1021
01:35:08,852 --> 01:35:11,575
It's funny.
She looks like an old doll.

1022
01:35:11,615 --> 01:35:13,256
No, she's too thin.

1023
01:35:13,296 --> 01:35:15,097
She's like a big puppet.

1024
01:35:15,138 --> 01:35:17,860
But I like her breasts.

1025
01:35:49,603 --> 01:35:51,765
Pinch her nipples

1026
01:35:51,805 --> 01:35:54,687
to see
if she stops smiling.

1027
01:37:25,996 --> 01:37:30,080
Has Pauline left,
or did something happen to her?

1028
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:33,403
Could Madame have sold her
without saying?

1029
01:37:33,443 --> 01:37:35,804
Will she sell us one by one?

1030
01:37:42,530 --> 01:37:44,372
Will she sell us one by one?

1031
01:37:44,412 --> 01:37:46,972
I don't know.

1032
01:37:49,414 --> 01:37:52,536
God only knows
where we'll end up.

1033
01:37:52,576 --> 01:37:56,500
Maybe in some seedy brothel,
with revolting clients.

1034
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:59,422
Especially past 25.

1035
01:38:14,153 --> 01:38:15,594
Looking at the freak?

1036
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:25,002
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.

1037
01:38:29,765 --> 01:38:32,166
You too.

1038
01:38:45,337 --> 01:38:46,938
I don't want to die.

1039
01:38:46,978 --> 01:38:49,861
You're not going to.
I promise.

1040
01:38:53,224 --> 01:38:54,944
I want to see Maurice.

1041
01:38:56,705 --> 01:38:59,907
He's going to come.
Soon.

1042
01:43:23,389 --> 01:43:26,550
I feel your sperm fill me up

1043
01:43:26,590 --> 01:43:28,111
and flow out through my eyes.

1044
01:43:28,151 --> 01:43:33,556
There are white tears,
thick ones, coating my cheeks.

1045
01:43:33,596 --> 01:43:35,837
My mouth is red,

1046
01:43:35,877 --> 01:43:39,761
and the white tears
trickle over it.

1047
01:43:39,801 --> 01:43:42,242
I don't want to wipe them away.

1048
01:43:42,282 --> 01:43:43,362
I cry so much...

1049
01:43:43,363 --> 01:43:45,451
I can't stop crying.

1050
01:43:45,486 --> 01:43:47,447
You don't have an emerald?

1051
01:43:47,487 --> 01:43:49,208
No, I don't have one.

1052
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:51,290
I want to tie you up.
May I?

1053
01:43:57,414 --> 01:43:58,615
Shh.

1054
01:44:20,711 --> 01:44:23,273
You were on the floor.

1055
01:44:23,313 --> 01:44:27,117
I picked you up.

1056
01:44:27,152 --> 01:44:28,798
Thank you.

1057
01:44:36,443 --> 01:44:39,767
You said something
in your sleep.

1058
01:44:39,807 --> 01:44:43,489
What did I say?

1059
01:44:43,529 --> 01:44:45,490
"If we don't burn,

1060
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:47,731
"how will the night be lit?

1061
01:44:47,771 --> 01:44:50,614
"Michaux...

1062
01:44:50,654 --> 01:44:53,657
"my fragment...

1063
01:44:53,697 --> 01:44:55,979
meteorite. "

1064
01:44:57,379 --> 01:44:58,821
I said that?

1065
01:45:03,824 --> 01:45:07,947
Don't be afraid
to express your love.

1066
01:45:07,987 --> 01:45:12,271
Don't be afraid.

1067
01:45:43,935 --> 01:45:45,977
What's your name?

1068
01:45:46,017 --> 01:45:47,619
Madeleine.

1069
01:45:47,659 --> 01:45:49,700
No nickname?

1070
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:51,701
Just Madeleine.

1071
01:45:59,187 --> 01:46:00,868
Long live France.

1072
01:46:05,391 --> 01:46:07,157
Where will they go?

1073
01:46:07,192 --> 01:46:10,155
I've sold some
to other houses.

1074
01:46:10,195 --> 01:46:12,277
A man has bought Samira.

1075
01:46:12,317 --> 01:46:15,599
The others will do
what they can.

1076
01:46:15,639 --> 01:46:19,202
Enjoy them while they're here.

1077
01:46:19,242 --> 01:46:21,243
I'm not staying.

1078
01:46:21,283 --> 01:46:23,685
I'm in no mood for fun.

1079
01:46:23,725 --> 01:46:25,887
I just wanted
to give you a kiss.

1080
01:46:36,494 --> 01:46:38,255
A new Jeanne Paquin dress?

1081
01:46:38,290 --> 01:46:39,503
Yes.

1082
01:46:39,538 --> 01:46:41,539
You're ravishing.

1083
01:46:41,579 --> 01:46:45,302
Thank you.

1084
01:46:45,342 --> 01:46:47,863
Cheers.

1085
01:46:47,903 --> 01:46:51,026
My favorite sound.

1086
01:46:51,066 --> 01:46:54,669
It's not crystal now,
just glass.

1087
01:46:54,709 --> 01:46:56,271
Never mind.

1088
01:46:56,311 --> 01:46:58,712
It's still champagne.

1089
01:46:58,752 --> 01:47:01,954
You look wonderful.

1090
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:10,280
Look, they're having fun now.

1091
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:13,223
Do it.

1092
01:47:13,258 --> 01:47:16,124
Go on.

1093
01:47:16,164 --> 01:47:19,528
I attended the opening
of the metro yesterday.

1094
01:47:19,568 --> 01:47:20,769
It's horrendous.

1095
01:47:22,051 --> 01:47:23,891
It's dark,
the seats are hard,

1096
01:47:23,931 --> 01:47:25,411
and it's so grim.

1097
01:47:25,451 --> 01:47:27,253
Everyone seemed happy.

1098
01:47:27,293 --> 01:47:29,460
Stupidly happy.

1099
01:47:29,495 --> 01:47:32,978
They loved crossing Paris
underground!

1100
01:47:33,019 --> 01:47:35,580
It's appalling.

1101
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:40,704
I walked back from Porte Maillot
to Palais Royal.

1102
01:47:40,739 --> 01:47:42,625
I thought of you.

1103
01:47:42,665 --> 01:47:45,266
What will we do without you?

1104
01:47:45,306 --> 01:47:48,910
You'll have other experiences.

1105
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:53,072
All the other houses
will be closing too.

1106
01:47:53,112 --> 01:47:56,075
It's sad, but too bad.

1107
01:47:56,115 --> 01:47:58,556
Today love is out
on the street.

1108
01:47:58,596 --> 01:48:01,000
No one can stop that.

1109
01:48:03,561 --> 01:48:06,404
What will you do now?

1110
01:48:06,444 --> 01:48:07,764
I don't know.

1111
01:48:07,804 --> 01:48:11,086
I'm a bit tired.

1112
01:48:14,569 --> 01:48:19,493
Promise to stay yourself,
even without L'Apollonide.

1113
01:48:19,533 --> 01:48:21,695
Keep the flowers, the music,

1114
01:48:21,735 --> 01:48:23,576
the fine dresses,

1115
01:48:23,616 --> 01:48:25,658
the color, the champagne,

1116
01:48:25,698 --> 01:48:27,660
even in glass...

1117
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:30,583
Make noise, please.
We're going to need it.

1118
01:49:50,283 --> 01:49:52,204
Have we met before?

1119
01:49:52,244 --> 01:49:54,530
Perhaps.

1120
01:49:54,565 --> 01:49:55,927
I'd remember.

1121
01:49:55,967 --> 01:49:57,648
What's your name?

1122
01:49:57,688 --> 01:49:59,289
Madeleine.

1123
01:50:07,655 --> 01:50:09,216
A little perfume...

1124
01:50:18,384 --> 01:50:20,785
What are you like under there?

1125
01:50:20,825 --> 01:50:22,232
However you want.

1126
01:50:22,267 --> 01:50:24,868
How do you want me to be?

1127
01:50:24,908 --> 01:50:26,149
I don't know.

1128
01:50:26,189 --> 01:50:29,952
Aren't you asking me
what I'm like?

1129
01:50:29,992 --> 01:50:32,353
No.

1130
01:50:57,773 --> 01:50:58,975
Lea?

1131
01:51:02,016 --> 01:51:03,857
Lea's up in a room.

1132
01:51:09,222 --> 01:51:10,904
Hear that, Simone?

1133
01:51:10,944 --> 01:51:12,465
The fireworks?

1134
01:51:12,505 --> 01:51:15,947
It's the fireworks!

1135
01:51:27,596 --> 01:51:29,397
Don't be scared.

1136
01:51:29,437 --> 01:51:30,758
My pretty Ninon...

1137
01:51:30,799 --> 01:51:34,601
It's Bastille Day,
but no one's beheading you.

1138
01:52:11,109 --> 01:52:13,871
It's the fireworks!

1139
01:52:13,911 --> 01:52:17,434
I want champagne.

1140
01:53:48,342 --> 01:53:49,945
Come in.

1141
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:26,932
You really do like it.

1142
01:54:37,981 --> 01:54:39,101
I want to stop.

1143
01:54:39,102 --> 01:54:41,903
I don't like it anymore.

1144
01:54:41,943 --> 01:54:44,826
I'm paying, so I decide.

1145
01:56:20,138 --> 01:56:24,582
What will you do now?

1146
01:56:24,622 --> 01:56:27,503
I don't know.

1147
01:56:28,402 --> 01:56:31,473
