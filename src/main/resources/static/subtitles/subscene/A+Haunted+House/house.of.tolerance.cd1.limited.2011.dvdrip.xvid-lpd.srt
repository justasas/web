00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,199
You stay until the clients go,

371
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,674
but get up when you want.

372
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:55,736
When you get up,
go down to the dining room.

373
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,543
You never go out alone.

374
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,277
Only with Madame or a man.

375
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,286
If you're alone outside,
that's soliciting.

376
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,550
At around 4:00, we wash.

377
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,784
We have to be clean.
Very clean.

378
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,655
Smell nice. Clean hair.

379
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:12,652
Soap your body and hair daily
and rub down with cologne.

380
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,528
Often we do it in pairs.

381
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,760
I wash you, you wash me...

382
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,497
I'll show you the creams.

383
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,437
A hairdresser comes at 6:00.

384
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,464
He can curl your hair,
dye it and so on.

385
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,807
You don't pay him.
Madame does.

386
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,972
If a client likes your hair
one particular way,

387
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,505
don't change it too often.

388
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,710
Come on.

389
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,982
If a client says you smell
or you're dirty,

390
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,648
Madame will fine you.

391
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,454
It'll only increase your debts.

392
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,983
So wash yourself.

393
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,796
We all buy our own perfume.

394
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:54,567
You don't use another girl's.
You buy your own.

395
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,436
After each client,

396
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,808
rinse your mouth with water
and a few drops of mouthwash.

397
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,837
It's strong, but it works.

398
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,612
- My name's Léa.
- Pauline.

399

Welcome.

401
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,189
- When the client undresses,
discreetly check his cock.

402
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,492
Check for sores or spots.

403
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,055
Check his body for rashes too.

404
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,227
Any doubts, don't have sex.

405
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,139
After each job,
wash your lips,

406
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,607
rinse and rub them
with cologne.

407
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,700
Ever used it?.

408
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,268
- No.

409
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,872
- It stings,
but that's normal.

410
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,906
- When you get to the room,
what do you do?.

411
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,748
Talk?.
- Yes, you talk.

412
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,152
You chat a little.

413
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,122
They might talk
about themselves.

414
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,784
You have another drink.

415
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,816
It helps.

416
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,728
Find out what he's like
and adapt.

417
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,756
- After a while,
you get the same ones.

418
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,665
- Just arouse them
and make them come.

419
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,534
But fake it during sex.

420
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,540
- Why?.
- Because.

421
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,566
That's how we do it.

I can't get it out.

~ ~

555
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,838
- I adore her.

556
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,810
- I've never had her.

557
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,506
- When she goes off you,
you get this.

558
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,846
- Pussy fur?.

559
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,579
- Who were you with?.

560
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,588
- My Julie.

561
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,487
Caca.

562
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,826
- How many?.

563
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,522
- Four.
You?.

564
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,360
- Six.

565
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,763
- Five.

566
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,164
- Three.

567
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:25,793
I'll never get out of here.

568
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,201
- Okay?.

569
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,105
- This shit is sticky...

570
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,975
- Let me help.

571
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,484
What's this?.

572
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,786
- It's not easy in a bathtub
but I'm okay.

573
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:50,987
- Want some ointment?.
- I'm okay.

574
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,689
- Did it go well?.

575
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,723
- I think so.

576
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:03,266
How do I clean the sperm
with the sponge?.

577
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,400
- Use this cream and rub gently.

578
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,434
It stings but that's normal.

579
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,492
- It's so depressing.

580
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:26,519
It'll be dawn soon.

581
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,374
- I've drunk too much.

582
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:48,978
- Thank you.

583
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,025
- 80.

584

608

- It reeks of sperm
and champagne here.

609
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:55,586
- Why do they call you Caca?.

610
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,100
- Why do they
call you Caca?.

611
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,034
- Why am I Long Hair?.

612
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,169
- Let's just say...

613
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,903
I have a specialty.

614
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:11,141
- I get the picture.

615
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:12,842
- Want to know anyway?.

616
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,577
- Julie, we're eating!

617
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,882
- Why?.

618
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,057
- Don't spoil it.

619
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,960
- Does it still hurt?.

620
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,191
- Only a little at night now.

621
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,733
- Did Madame make you?.
- No.

622
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,236
She asked me.

623
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,330
- And?.

624
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:39,206
He paid for the night,
but didn't want sex.

625
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,641
- Why not?.

626
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:45,373
- Probably just to see
the monster close up.

627
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:48,077
He was sweet.

628
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,348
He said he'd come back
next week.

629
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,684
But I don't believe him.

630
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:55,687
- Want to check in the cards?.

631
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,022
- No, it's okay.

632
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,290
- Last night was
a real freak show.

633
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,126
I had one...

634
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:02,426
He keeps going to confession

635
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:06,231
to talk filth
to get the priest hard.

636
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,760
He wanks off at the same time.

637
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:12,338
- That's sick!

638
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,173
- I'd like to see
a brothel for women.

639
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:19,272
A great place with great men
who are hard all the time

640
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,648
and tell us we're pretty,

641
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,516
even if we're old
with saggy tits.

642
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:26,113
- We'd never ask
the stupid questions they do.

643
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,716
- Do you like my tits?.

644
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,055
Do you like my big tits?.

645
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,151
- What's "whore" in Arabic?.

646
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,320
- "Zaniya"...

647
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:36,196
or "Qahba,"
depending how polite you are.

648
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,995
- What's the polite one?.

649
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:42,403
- "Zaniya," the kept woman.

650
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:45,897
- I don't mind being
a kept woman.

651
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:49,538
- Is Maurice going to propose?.

652
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,740
- Perhaps.

653
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:54,079
If his wife dies.

654
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,709
- Are you in love?.

655
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,879
- No.

656
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,388
But he's sweet.

657
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,515
The other day,

658
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:04,152
we went to the Wepler
for oysters.

659
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,721
Then we went dancing.

660
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:11,359
Know what I told him?.

661
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,494
"l would pluck out my eyes
for you

662
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,766
"so you'd have more holes

663
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:18,035
to make love to me."

664
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:20,474
He loved that!

665
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,307
- Is this only for Madeleine?.

666
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:23,869
- No, for all of us.

667
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:33,546
Four show the past,

668
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:37,583
four the present
and four the future.

669
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:01,480
- Oh, cazzo.

670
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:03,543
- No, it's all right.

671
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,611
That's the good spade card.

672
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:08,886
It means stability, luck,
security...

673
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,122
The nine of clubs
means a job, a situation.

674
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:15,154
The Queen is a kind woman.

675
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:22,060
There's a young man, single.

676
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,206
He's next to a diamond card.

677
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:30,770
There's a romantic project,
but it's upside down.

678
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:34,973
That means there's a problem.

679
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,153
A girl with long hair.

680
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,282
She's upside down too.

681
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,795
You have to be wary of her.

682
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,923
- Are you sure?.
- Of course.

683
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,832
- That it's upside down.

684
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,768
- It's in relation
to the dealer.

685
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,964
- They're only cards.

686
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,735
- If you draw them,
they're more than that.

687
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,936
- You're a bit of a mystic?.

688
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,945
- I want to stop.

689
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,948
- We've started, let's finish.

690
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,212
Come on, the future.

691
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,412
- What did they call you before?.

692
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,011
- The Jewess.

693
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,068
- Which is the worst one?.

694
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,800
- The ten.

695
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:38,770
[bell tolling]

696
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,880
- Do you like that?.

697
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,583
- Yes.

698
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:52,277
[knocking]

699
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:55,990
- What do you want?.

700
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,755
- To see the Woman Who Laughs.

701
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,922
- For sex or just to see her?.

702
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:04,297
- To see her first,
then decide.

703
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,029
- lnside a room,
you do as you like,

704
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:10,301
but you see girls here for sex,
the normal way.

705
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:14,174
- I'd like Léa as a doll then.

706
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,788
[dramatic music]

707
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:21,300
- Come here.

708
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:43,849
You smell nice, my doll.

709
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,887
- Who did you have?.

710
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,551
- Simon.
And you?.

711
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:51,924
- Louis.

712
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:03,964
- [yelling]

713
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,998
- Julie, no!

714
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,472
Help me!
Julie!

715
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,029
- I want the peach.

716
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,401
- Well?.

717
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:38,100
- I'll get you!
You have to strip right now.

718
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,873
Catch.

719
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:57,993
Marie-France, where do
the clients get their money?.

720
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:00,587
- In industry, textiles,
paper...

721
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,120
Family fortunes too.

722
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:04,997
Fortunes of the aristocracy.

723
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,433
- Are there a lot
of aristocrats?.

724
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,130
- Yes.

725
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,104
We get a lot of aristocrats.

726
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,300
- What does Louis work in?.

727
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,832
- Louis is in textiles.

728
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:16,902
He made his fortune
in textiles.

729
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:19,574
Michaux has a family fortune.

730
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:23,984
Charles is a family fortune too.

731
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,080
- Who's the richest one?.

732
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:30,354
- The richest one?.

733
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:32,486
Charles.
