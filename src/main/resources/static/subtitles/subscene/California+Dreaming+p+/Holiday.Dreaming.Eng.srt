1
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,269
Everybody Front and Center!
On the Double!

2
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,798
Front and Center,
battle formation.

3
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,065
The last one there
is in deep shit!

4
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,573
Move it!

5
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,216
How can you sleep at a time
like this? Breakfast is ready.

6
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:49,426
Come on, Front and Center!

7
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,297
Let's go now!

8
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,430
Sergeant!

9
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,098
Captain!

10
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,610
Why the sudden meeting?

11
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,511
Didn't you call us here?

12
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,445
What's the reason for this?

13
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,112
I was sleeping in my room!

14
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,780
Front and Center!
Up and at 'em boys.

15
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,886
Front and Center, Formation!

16
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,380
Do you pussy's understand
Chinese? I said move!

17
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,520
What the fuck?

18
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,787
Faster!

19
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,388
Those at the back,
quit straggling behind.

20
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,431
Keep loafing and you will
crawl to mess.

21
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,328
Damn! Private!

22
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,584
I said run fast!

23
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,260
Got ya!

24
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,262
Fuck, this hurts.

25
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,842
A lack of water around here and
here you are, playing with it.

26
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,042
Captain is Concerned that
it might get heat stroke.

27
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,977
Heat Stroke?

28
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:09,947
I don't care
if he has heat stroke or not.

29
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,021
I'm finished running, sir!

30
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:17,845
How many laps have you run?

31
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:19,990
How would I know?

32
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,391
You don't know how many laps you've run?

33
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,185
Sir, I forgot.

34
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,199
You forgot? Would you forget to eat also?

35
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,927
Seems to me like you slept
all night. Keep running.

36
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,294
Yes Sir!

37
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,871
Idiot. Fat ass.

38
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,272
One day he will screw
the company.

39
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,541
Faster!

40
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,581
I had a dream last night.

41
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,890
I dreamt that a girl
I knew in grade school died.

42
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,224
And?

43
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,053
Is it possible she really died?

44
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,721
Have you gone nuts?

45
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,360
Thinking of this nonsense everyday.

46
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,230
I haven't seen her for a long time.

47
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,028
Now she shows up in my dreams,

48
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,400
Dead

49
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,709
Is she trying to tell me something?

50
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,774
Yes, quit jerking off so often.

51
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,680
Faster!

52
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,253
Call someone, Hurry!

53
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,620
Something's wrong!

54
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,333
Get him out of here. Hurry!

55
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,729
One, Two, Three.

56
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,270
One, Two, Three.

57
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,276
What a heavy pig

58
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,209
One, Two, Three.

59
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,359
Lin Kuen-He,

60
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,298
Lin Kuen-He!

61
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,975
There's a squadron ahead,

62
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,567
Full speed ahead

63
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,575
Masculinity! Dignity!
Iouder! Firm!

64
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:28,378
Resolute! Silent!

65
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,582
Strong! Louder, louder, louder! Precise!

66
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,920
Salute! Sergeant!

67
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,334
Orange.

68
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,875
Yellow. Heh, heh.

69
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:51,873
Tell you what,

70
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,336
I use this to pick up girls

71
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,346
and it has never failed.

72
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,140
Besides being handsome,

73
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:57,747
it is crucial to have good technique

74
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,612
Humor

75
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,210
A sense of humor, you understand?

76
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,787
Know why you are a loser everytime?

77
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,012
Why?

78
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,648
Because you are as dumb as
an ass

79
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,686
Who wants to be
with a dumb ass?

80
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:12,626
Let me have it, please?

81
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:13,687
Sure.

82
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,125
We are pals, right?

83
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:16,800
You can have it for $60

84
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,172
What? These flowers cost $60!?

85
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,136
What? You think it's expensive?

86
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,676
You are a moron.

87
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,146
The cheapest whore around will cost you $60.

88
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,579
You are not just buying flowers

89
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,111
It's a technique, man.

90
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,378
Come on

91
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,048
$ 60 for your happiness.
What do you think

92
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,255
Too expensive?

93
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,119
Happiness is just
around the corner.

94
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,792
But...

95
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:43,923
Come on! Forget about it.

96
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,987
We're getting discharged
next week -

97
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,257
then you won't be able to
buy them even if you want.

98
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,942
That's it.

99
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,608
Here is your happiness

100
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,412
Xiao-Gui

101
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,282
Apple is calling for you.

102
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:12,621
Bugger.

103
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,417
Xiao-Gui

104
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,424
Take your time.

105
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,428
Ah-Zhou,

106
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,521
let's go! Let's go!

107
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:34,769
Shit, something's burning!

108
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:49,123
Aim it here, would ya?
Throw it HERE!

109
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,196
Ah-Zhou, I've brought you milk.

110
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,669
Catch!

111
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,569
Thanks, Apple

112
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,470
No problem.

113
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,537
Hey, Xiao-Gui! Stick your head out

114
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,477
I want to see you

115
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,344
Give me a break, would you?

116
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,784
Come on, I haven't seen you
for days.

117
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,487
It hasn't been that long.

118
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,025
Yeah, it has. Come on, let me see you!

119
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,864
Over here.

120
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,493
Happy now?

121
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,837
Yes.

122
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,505
Meet me tonight, okay?

123
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,643
No. It's tiresome to go out
at night.

124
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,110
Come on, come over.

125
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,874
I will cook you
something special

126
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,512
Okay?

127
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,244
Okay.

128
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,046
What do you want to eat?

129
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,914
Can you make curry?

130
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,579
Curry. Anything else?

131
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,649
How about some vegetables

132
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,352
Okay, vegetables. Anything else?

133
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:54,852
Can you two discuss this later?

134
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,890
Sweet and sour pork then?

135
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,552
Talk about it later!

136
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,597
All right, all right.

137
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,531
Go home first and we'll
talk about it tonight.

138
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,534
All right,

139
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:03,936
I'm leaving now.

140
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:04,526
Bye-bye

141
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,733
Bye - bye.

142
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,531
You a weak man.

143
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,201
Ah-Zhou, Good bye. Bye.

144
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:51,832
Stop that, you can't abandon me

145
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:00,185
I love you so much.

146
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,453
Hello, mom? Ummm,

147
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,861
will you go find my
elementary school yearbook?

148
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,399
It's in the lower left drawer of my desk.

149
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,522
Hello? Check it for me.

150
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,868
There is someone named

151
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,274
Chen Shing-shing in my class.

152
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,936
What's her phone number?

153
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,741
Just give me the number. Yes.

154
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,350
Hello? Hello?

155
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:43,988
My phone card is out of money,
can I borrow yours?

156
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:44,427
Okay?

157
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,696
Thank you.

158
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,038
No. Don't move.

159
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,372
Stop it!

160
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,709
Attention!

161
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,717
Attention!

162
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,455
This private in your company

163
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,520
seems to have some mental problems.

164
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,731
I think so, too. What else could it be?

165
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,734
I think we will have to send
him to a psychiatrist.

166
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,034
Also, check to see if we can
get him early-discharge

167
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:32,939
If it goes on like this

168
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,674
I will go crazy

169
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:36,942
before he does

170
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:50,951
You okay?

171
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,755
I guess I shouldn't have
borrowed that phone card.

172
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,127
And drive him crazy over a phone card!

173
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,197
Are you out of your mind?

174
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:02,900
He is in upper class

175
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,306
and you dare to hit him?

176
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,306
Get up

177
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,205
Fat ass.

178
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,976
Stop faking

179
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:11,774
Don't hit me

180
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,783
Still faking

181
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,109
what are you crying about?

182
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,588
My girlfriend wants to
break up with me.

183
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:20,989
When did you get a girlfriend?

184
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,282
I have one.

185
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,465
Let me see,

186
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,332
let me see.

187
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,831
He says this is his girlfriend.

188
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,340
What does she do?

189
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,668
She's a model. Right now she is on a shoot,

190
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,247
involving in a love scandal now

191
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,817
I told her not to get into
this business.

192
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,748
Is she really your girlfriend?

193
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,255
Yes.

194
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,152
Are you out of your mind, too?

195
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,918
He is just in love

196
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,292
with a page from a magazine

197
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,363
Take back your girlfriend.

198
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,361
Give me a tissue.

199
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:05,826
Hurry up, hurry up.

200
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,520
Password?

201
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,519
It's me.

202
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:27,855
Sorry sir.

203
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:36,498
Captain!

204
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,397
Shape up! Otherwise, I make
sure you never get discharged

205
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,171
Sorry about today, sir.

206
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,144
I'll make it up to you next time.

207
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,216
I'll loan you my phone card from now on.

208
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,412
I'll buy my own

209
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,747
Shine the light here. Here!

210
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:10,761
The wind is clearing the road,
the cloud is leading the way.

211
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,503
I'm throwing away love,

212
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,699
climbing over that high mountain
and crossing the sea,

213
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,904
destroying enemies, hey, hey...

214
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,917
Destroy the enemies of the
country, hey, hey...

215
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,246
Please encourage me, wait for me,

216
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,448
wait for my victorious return.

217
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,320
Hey big guy, how much do you want to spend?

218
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,788
Chewing beetlenut is bad for the teeth.

219
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,591
Well then, cigarettes?

220
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,064
What's your favorite brand?

221
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,395
No, my mother says

222
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,457
I can't smoke since I am

223
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,299
You are under 18?

224
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,327
How about going to karaoke?

225
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,265
Come on.

226
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,933
No,
I am working now.

227
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,876
You look so beautiful today.

228
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:53,343
Come on

229
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,401
I can't.

230
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,138
Charge

231
00:16:58,617 --> 00:16:59,481
Xiao-Gui, what are you doing?

232
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,415
What?

233
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,748
Who are you?
What are you doing?

234
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,809
We are closing now

235
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,819
Why? We are friends

236
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,315
Tell him we are closing

237
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,683
Don't be like that!

238
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,624
You're not going to tell him,
are you?

239
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:10,784
Ah-Zhou, let's go.

240
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,325
Okay, okay, Xiao-Gui.

241
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,630
I'm sorry.

242
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,896
I will buy you drinks next time,

243
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,493
Okay?

244
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,970
Forget it.

245
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,498
Do come again.

246
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,239
Why did you do that?

247
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,604
Why do you dress like a slut?

248
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:29,642
Don't you know that

249
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,238
there are lots of perverts around

250
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,573
You used to enjoy watching me like this

251
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,084
I don't enjoy it now,

252
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,343
go get changed.

253
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,650
Why did you do that?

254
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,823
Didn't I just ask you
how would you feel

255
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,656
if your mother dressed like a slut

256
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:44,423
and I came by to get some beetlenut?

257
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,158
Is this okay?

258
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,863
Sure. Look at yourself, you look cute.

259
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,067
You must dress this way from now on.

260
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,538
Is that okay?
Sure.

261
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,341
There are so many perverts right now, right?

262
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,435
How dangerous.

263
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,239
Hello, may I speak to Chen Shing-Shing?

264
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,169
26357741

265
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:11,881
May I... Oh, wrong number

266
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,551
I am sorry

267
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:32,767
Be quiet!

268
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,974
Anyone who ordered milk, come and get it!

269
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,137
Wang Ing-Zhou,

270
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,913
you didn't order milk, did you?

271
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,081
I'll give you mine.

272
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,954
From now on I will give you

273
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,519
my mother orders for me everyday.

274
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,257
Really?

275
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,162
Really.

276
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,002
Is it tasty?

277
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,161
Yes.

278
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:03,388
What do you want?

279
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:07,728
$5 of beetlenut.

280
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,191
She's busy.

281
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,367
Don't bother.

282
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:57,574
Lin Kuen-He,

283
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:05,246
Lin Kuen-He

284
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:15,594
Hello? Hello? Hello?

285
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,063
Emergency assembly, get up!

286
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,387
I think Apple is cute.

287
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,098
Cute? She's annoying, okay.

288
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,959
No, I think she is

289
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:52,901
You don't understand.

290
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:53,494
Who is there?

291
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,980
Fuck. What are you two pricks doing here?

292
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:15,315
Shit.

293
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,089
They want us on search patrol
this late at night

294
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,587
Why don't they just ask us to catch ghosts?

295
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,390
Why are you shining the light on me?

296
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,661
It's too dark, I can't see

297
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,529
Is it funny? Let's move.

298
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,436
Up front Private!

299
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,340
Hurry up!

300
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,088
Baby, the soy milk is burnt.

301
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,192
Go check whether the dumplings are ready.

302
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,893
Did you find the Private?

303
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,367
Come on, if we have found him

304
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,769
we would not be hiding here

305
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:01,634
for a break before we go on another search

306
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,468
I don't care

307
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,841
Stop, I am trying
to get some sleep.

308
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:06,707
Come on

309
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,540
How do I make soy milk?

310
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,049
Xiao-Gui, the captain said you
two could take a day of leave.

311
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:12,583
Go report to him now

312
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,050
don't lie to me.

313
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,115
True, why would I lie to you?

314
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,587
Get back quickly

315
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:18,520
Is it true?

316
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,047
Of course. Hurry up!

317
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,690
Take your time cooking.

318
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:22,860
All right, day off.

319
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,452
Put it back. Let's go!

320
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,459
I wanna take a leave as well.

321
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,930
Trust me, you don't want

322
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,936
Why?

323
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,139
It will bring bad luck.

324
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,278
I haven't taken leave

325
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,956
Captain, what will you do with the mouse

326
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,488
once we leave?

327
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:01,688
I will take care of it myself.

328
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,966
But Captain,

329
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,165
he has a gun!

330
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,977
This is the home address of
Lin Kuen-He.

331
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,516
Bring him back

332
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,515
before

333
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,453
the MP's find him.

334
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,979
I need to save my face

335
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:36,127
Captain, that guy is a bit weird.

336
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,563
Yeah. Yesterday he was...

337
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,235
Find him. What now?

338
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,478
How about me getting lost
and you come find me.

339
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:52,742
Why are you laughing?
You get discharged next week,

340
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:53,647
so what else do you have to worry about?

341
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,419
I still have to stay here
for ten more years

342
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,978
and no matter how hard I try
I will still be a captain!

343
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,147
You boys

344
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,027
should go out and have fun

345
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,361
instead of wasting your days here.

346
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,841
Now what?

347
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,166
What do you mean what now?

348
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,637
We're getting out of here soon

349
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,669
and we should know how to goof around.

350
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:24,846
He told us to play,

351
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,008
so we go play.

352
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,444
We'll just go hang around in Taipei first

353
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,851
and then head for his house, right?

354
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,320
You don't really think we're
going to catch him, do you?

355
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,016
We are out of here soon,
who cares?

356
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,888
Know any fun palces in Hualian?

357
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,052
Hualian is fun. You can surf,

358
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,528
I will take you.

359
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,530
Then I need to bring

360
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,897
Swimming trunks?
Everyone wears shorts now.

361
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,735
What if we do see him?

362
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,828
How could that happen?

363
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,037
If you were AWOL, would
you take your gun home?

364
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,335
Fuck! Shit!

365
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,906
My ass got attacked in the toilet!

366
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,741
Really? And then?

367
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,707
What then?

368
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:32,848
What happened next?

369
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:33,975
What do you mean what happened next?

370
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:35,775
Take off your pants.

371
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:36,682
Why should I do that?

372
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,279
Friends should share happiness
as well as misery

373
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,787
So, you wanna touch my ass?

374
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:40,586
Take them off

375
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,057
No!?

376
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:41,922
Here, I'll help you.

377
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,255
No.

378
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:42,918
Let me give you a hand

379
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,522
No

380
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,725
Oh, what a white shining ass!

381
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:51,791
Young man, what are you doing

382
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,866
taking your pants off in broad daylight?

383
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:57,940
Showing off your

384
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,880
Show me your tickets,

385
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,042
quit playing around.

386
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:26,962
Okay, stop it!

387
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:08,868
Purple? Purple!

388
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,209
Miss, should I put this here?

389
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,145
I see everything this way.

390
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,083
Right here. Green, red

391
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:16,479
Not bad.

392
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,351
Last one, pink

393
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,418
It's simple.

394
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,483
You learn quickly.

395
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,027
A yellow one here.

396
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:25,685
I'm out of here.

397
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,890
You going?

398
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:27,954
Yes. I wanna go home

399
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,033
You aren't being a good friend.

400
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,866
What are you going home for?

401
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:33,893
Stay here and keep me company

402
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:34,802
I'm going home to sleep.

403
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,238
Why are you going to sleep?

404
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,797
I am about to hook up
with a girl

405
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,207
and she is going to bring her friends.

406
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:40,971
I will introduce any one of them to you,

407
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:41,704
all right?

408
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:42,440
No. I wanna go home

409
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,505
No? No what?

410
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,777
I am going home.

411
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:46,806
What for?

412
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,242
Okay!

413
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:50,577
Remember, tomorrow,

414
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:51,711
12:00 at Taipei station.

415
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:52,723
Bye-bye.

416
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:53,719
Bye-bye

417
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:45,767
What do you want?

418
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:47,905
Tell you what,

419
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,977
although I'm a Marine,

420
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,612
I can only do it once.

421
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,444
No, I can't.

422
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,448
What?

423
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,448
Loan me $1500, okay?

424
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,318
I'll get it back to you

425
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,449
You look so cute

426
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,458
like this

427
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:06,190
I mean it. I spent all my tuition

428
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,791
My mother is going to kill me.

429
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,964
Loan me $1500, please.

430
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,863
Do we know each other well?

431
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:14,862
Do we know each other well?

432
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,266
You'd better be generous,

433
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:20,805
we just had a great time,

434
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,176
and now you're being stingy.

435
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,147
Just loan me the money and

436
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,809
and we'll go out for fun, okay?

437
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,684
Okay?

438
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,152
Okay?

439
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,156
Come on.

440
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:37,761
Okay?

441
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,296
Money always hurts relationships,

442
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,626
right?

443
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,839
Everybody got hair,

444
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:56,046
only in different locations.

445
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,285
Fuck.

446
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,129
You don't plan to pay for
the service?

447
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,077
What's the pen code of your ATM card?

448
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,341
My boss is asking you, so tell him.

449
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,083
What's the pen code?

450
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:38,548
Say it!

451
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,214
What's the number?

452
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,423
Are you losing your mind?

453
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,217
What's the number?

454
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,499
1519!

455
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,434
Should have told us earlier.

456
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:53,997
Boss, 1519.

457
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,713
Is anybody here?

458
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,313
Is anybody here?

459
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:54,549
Sir,

460
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,024
Do you have an appointment?

461
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:58,824
Dr. Chen is off work now.

462
00:34:58,863 --> 00:34:59,887
You need to make
an appointment for tomorrow.

463
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,228
I'm here for his daughter.

464
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,826
Is she the one in the picture.

465
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,031
Yes.

466
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,031
Is she here?

467
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,230
She's not in either.

468
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:17,712
Where is she?

469
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,038
I've heard Doctor Chen say

470
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,846
she works in a hospital.

471
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,248
Works in a hospital?

472
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,183
So she is a nurse?

473
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,653
How is she?

474
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,055
I don't know. She hasn't been here

475
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,061
since I've worked here.

476
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,594
Sorry, I am off work now.

477
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,192
I'm sorry.

478
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,135
We are almost done

479
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:56,807
Okay! Okay!

480
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:03,487
Hang in there

481
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,021
Okay! Okay!

482
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,151
Hang in there

483
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:11,620
It's a deep cavity

484
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,357
Hang in there

485
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,827
Why don't we come here

486
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,026
No, your teeth are filled with cavities,

487
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,298
how can we wait?

488
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,237
Can we come tomorrow then?

489
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,978
Mom, I don't want to have my tooth pulled

490
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,648
Let's go home.

491
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,388
It will only take a minute.

492
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,856
Open your mouth

493
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,861
What a cavity! I will pull it out.

494
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,296
Wang Ing-Zhou, have you come here
to have your tooth pulled?

495
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,726
Dad, is he getting
his tooth pulled?

496
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,394
Yes. The cavity is too big to
fill. He must get it removed.

497
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,563
Look, your classmate is here.

498
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,569
Be brave, don't cry.

499
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,205
Mama's going to
make a phone call.

500
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,082
Are you afraid of having
your tooth pulled?

501
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,208
No.

502
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,686
I'll tell you a way not to feel any pain.

503
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,222
First,

504
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,484
take a deep breath

505
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,616
and then yell AAAHHH.

506
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,156
That's it, now you try.

507
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:31,400
Uh-huh. That's it.

508
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,235
Okay, open your mouth.

509
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,040
Take a deep breath.

510
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:48,248
Okay! Almost done

511
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,360
You okay?

512
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,257
When did you come back?

513
00:38:58,969 --> 00:38:59,936
Last night.

514
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,869
Oh. Thought you want the phone number

515
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,931
of Chen Shing-Shing.

516
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:05,271
Why didn't you call back
to get it?

517
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,275
My phone card was out of money.

518
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:13,011
Oh, I went to Dr. Chen's yesterday.

519
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,819
Did you see her?

520
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,223
No. I saw her a couple of years ago,

521
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,692
but I haven't seen her since then.

522
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,094
Dr. Chen said she works in the hospital.

523
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:29,557
Why are you wondering
about her?

524
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:31,297
Nothing.

525
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,503
Nothing? Can I help?

526
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,233
Help me what?

527
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,805
Seriously, I will help you

528
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,372
talk to Dr. Chen.

529
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,573
Talk about what?

530
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:44,773
Look,

531
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:45,577
I'm taking a dump!

532
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:45,978
Okay, I will tell you.

533
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:46,380
You go out first.

534
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,509
Let me finish brushing my teeth.

535
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,985
You go out first.

536
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,355
I told you

537
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:34,557
to come see a doctor.

538
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,365
I can't help you

539
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,560
over the phone.

540
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,463
Come see a doctor!

541
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:43,703
Excuse me,

542
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,402
is Chen Shing-Shing here?

543
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:47,372
Who are you?

544
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,110
I'm her classmate.

545
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,046
On the third floor.

546
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,011
Is she busy now?

547
00:40:58,422 --> 00:40:59,912
She has nothing
to be busy with.

548
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:33,946
Excuse me,

549
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,429
Excuse me,

550
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:48,802
coming through,

551
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:35,904
Where did he take you to
last night

552
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:37,536
Nowhere

553
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:38,548
Nowhere?

554
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,742
Then why did you take off early

555
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,210
Home for dinner

556
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:41,876
Oh

557
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:46,018
Excuse me,

558
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,657
is Ms. Chen Shing-Shing here?

559
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,284
She's over there.

560
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:52,554
Thank you.

561
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,065
Miss, time to take
your medicine.

562
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,159
No.

563
00:43:58,235 --> 00:43:59,566
Stop playing around.
What are you doing?

564
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:00,561
No!

565
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:01,969
Hurry, let's go take the medicine!

566
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,230
It is strange the way you put your book.

567
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:06,432
Don't take my book away!

568
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,442
Now come take the medicine.

569
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:09,637
No!

570
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,578
Come on!

571
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:11,739
Chen Shing-Shing!

572
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,249
Shing-Shing, you have a visitor

573
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,751
Get up and take the medicine.

574
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,916
This is her medicine,

575
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,923
please help give it to her

576
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:21,753
she isn't behaving well

577
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,324
I have other things to do.
Thank you.

578
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:29,666
Is she Chen Shing-Shing?

579
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,792
Yes.

580
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,106
Sit.

581
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,909
Sit

582
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:04,966
Drink.

583
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:08,493
Drink

584
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,000
Finished studying?

585
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:24,181
Finished studying?

586
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,319
Well then, you ask me.

587
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:36,525
Ask me

588
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:47,605
Why does wine go sour
when left open?

589
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:53,214
That's because there is alcohol in wine...

590
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:54,807
What is the question?

591
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,349
Not supposed to give me
the answer

592
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,415
Don't you know how to
ask questions?

593
00:45:58,455 --> 00:45:59,513
You read it wrong.

594
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:01,757
You need 450 points to
get into medical school.

595
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,350
How can you take the test
if you act like this?

596
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,696
I'm worried about you. Don't
tell me you've studied.

597
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,898
You're not making progress.

598
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:10,899
Don't you know that it is
hard to get into college?

599
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,300
Not as easy as you thought

600
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:13,703
It's more difficult.

601
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:14,795
Everybody is waiting
to see you fail.

602
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:15,702
If you don't get into college,

603
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:18,304
your father will give you pressure.

604
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,171
Your mother will give you pressure.

605
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:20,873
Everyone gives you pressure

606
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,703
Everyone is waiting

607
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,906
Not acceptable to go

608
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,440
from a top high school to a bad college

609
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:00,746
Water.

610
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,278
You should take medicine.

611
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,484
The medicine puts me to sleep.

612
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,749
I have to take the entrance
exam. I must stay up late.

613
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,258
It won't put you to sleep.

614
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:15,560
This will strengthen your immune system.

615
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,257
That will improve your memory
and help you with your exam.

616
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,763
Quit lying to me!

617
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:20,262
You take the medicine first.

618
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,498
I'll test you and see

619
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,774
if your memory is getting better.

620
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,068
See. You are all the same. You are all liars.

621
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:42,084
Do you know what?

622
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,991
My mom also gives this

623
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,259
to me every morning.

624
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:52,802
Then you take it first.

625
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,660
You take one, and I'll take one.

626
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,414
See, nothing happened.

627
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,353
Tell you what,

628
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,889
you are the one who treats
me the best in the world.

629
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,128
Others are trying

630
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,702
to get something from me.

631
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:41,840
I'm leaving.

632
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,850
Bye-bye.

633
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,158
Be careful on the road

634
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,528
Bye-bye.

635
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,226
How did you get out?

636
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,632
Last time you told me
you would come visit me.

637
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,339
I waited for a long time.
You never came.

638
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:45,774
Do you study at all?

639
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,578
I am worried about you.

640
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,316
You will not make it
to college!

641
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,017
I do study.

642
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,915
Well then, you go back and study, okay?

643
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,950
Next time I'll test you.

644
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,221
You wanna test me?

645
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,120
Keep your promise

646
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:03,330
Do come.

647
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,865
Okay. You have to go back.

648
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:13,609
Bye Bye. Be careful on the road

649
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,498
What's the matter?

650
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,366
You all lied to me.

651
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:42,127
You promised to take me to take the test.

652
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:46,374
I've been urging you to study,

653
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,971
and now you want to go to
the test alone.

654
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,487
You are all the same.

655
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:55,040
Who is she?

656
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:56,236
Chen Shing-Shing.

657
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,804
Are you going to take the test
as well?

658
00:51:58,582 --> 00:51:59,241
Huh?

659
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,381
Dumpling for good luck

660
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:04,447
Take it!

661
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,054
Take it!

662
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:10,049
Who is she?

663
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,054
Tell me

664
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,624
Look!

665
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:52,629
She studied hard and went
to a top high school.

666
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,971
See what she has become, a nut

667
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,470
Thank god I didn't study hard

668
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,111
Where are you taking her?

669
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:11,276
I don't know.

670
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,280
She just followed me.

671
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,187
Let me check your tickets.

672
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,057
You two again?

673
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:26,568
Take out your tickets.

674
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,016
Nutcase!
Two nutcases together.

675
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,348
Freaks!

676
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,016
You are disgusting.

677
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:20,545
It's so beautiful!

678
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,751
Where the hell are we?

679
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:25,687
Where are we going?

680
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,650
Where are we going?

681
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,863
The test site. It's getting late, let's go!

682
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:53,947
There are MPs over there.

683
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:55,944
Shh. Be quiet.

684
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,119
Is Lin Kuen-He coming back?

685
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:01,620
It's impossible.

686
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,154
Can anyone escape with a gun
and then dare to return?

687
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,961
You want the bad guys
to know where we are

688
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,965
They're gonna catch us. Hide!

689
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:38,419
They are all gone.

690
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,519
What should we do?

691
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,060
Are they gone?

692
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:45,525
What do you mean
what should we do?

693
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:47,067
Have they gone yet?

694
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:51,335
Let's go, let's go.

695
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:52,338
Go where?

696
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,209
Move it!

697
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:00,998
Xiao-Gui!

698
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,570
Xiao-Gui!

699
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,240
Xiao-Gui!

700
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:43,750
You want to come down
to the beach?

701
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:46,118
No.

702
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,047
My mom says
the beach is dangerous.

703
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,558
Tell you something.

704
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:28,154
My stomach hurts.

705
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,027
Your stomach hurts?

706
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:30,631
Seems like my period has come.

707
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,165
What has come?

708
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:33,357
My period.

709
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:36,168
Period?

710
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:01,062
Where can we find pads
in this fucking place?

711
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:09,632
Which college major are you interested in?

712
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:21,081
Which college major are you
Interested in?

713
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:26,544
Hello,

714
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:36,227
Hello?

715
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:47,373
Hello?

716
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:50,777
Gentlemen,

717
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,116
take what you need yourself.

718
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:00,720
Don't you have women here?

719
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:05,052
Women? I am looking for some myself.

720
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,671
Kill! Kill!

721
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,976
No, Come on!
It is totally wrong

722
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,280
You asked me to teach you,
and you must pay attention,

723
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,479
okay? Try it again!

724
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:34,912
Kill!

725
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:39,127
That's not right!

726
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,020
Thank God you aren't qualified
for military service

727
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:40,791
if you were

728
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,923
you would have died
in the Marine training

729
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:45,500
Is it always so strict in the Marine Corps?

730
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:46,659
Of Course.

731
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,637
Let me show you how to kill, okay?

732
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:50,499
It's important to show
your force

733
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:51,967
You can threaten enemies

734
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,576
with the gleam of your eyes
can kill a man,

735
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:55,633
you understand?

736
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:58,137
Kill!

737
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,479
Kill!

738
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:01,646
Get it?

739
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:02,780
Once more!

740
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:06,788
Kill! Kill!

741
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,586
Much better,
I can feel your force

742
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,056
Kill!

743
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:10,989
Correct!

744
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:12,784
Kill!

745
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:13,989
I am Finished!

746
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,052
Not bad.

747
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:23,196
You can come out now!

748
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,345
I often see the military parades;

749
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,005
they are all marching
in step - Pretty cool.

750
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,513
Teach me how to do that?

751
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:36,481
Give me a break.
I'm in the Marine Corps.

752
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:37,543
No Marine would march in step like that.

753
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:39,148
We are trained to be special forces!

754
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,286
Really? Special forces?

755
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:42,851
Thanks boss.

756
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:44,088
Not at all.

757
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:44,955
Go play over there,

758
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:46,085
okay?

759
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:47,695
Go play over there,

760
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,363
be good

761
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:51,957
How many days are you going to stay here?

762
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:54,427
We'll stay for a while.

763
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:56,501
Oh yeah?

764
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,095
We should be here.

765
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,640
Then I will come and find you.

766
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,698
Great.

767
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:01,701
Bye.

768
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:02,233
Thanks.

769
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:02,869
No problem.

770
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:03,844
Bye.

771
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,508
He is weird, wants to learn
all this nonsense.

772
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:09,812
Who knows what he's thinking.

773
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:31,960
I'm hungry, what do we have?

774
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:34,997
There is no damn restaurant here,

775
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:36,664
it's faster to eat worms.

776
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,801
Where are we going?

777
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:41,470
This way?

778
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:50,814
This way?

779
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:51,819
Let's go.

780
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:54,011
Let's go!

781
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,618
Shoes, My shoes!

782
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:00,684
Xiao-Gui,

783
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,691
wait for me!

784
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:22,383
Dinner is ready!

785
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:25,184
Yeah! Dinnertime!

786
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,848
Food's ready, let's eat.

787
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:30,025
No! I'm not eating.

788
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,191
I cooked a lot of food -

789
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,626
You just said you were hungry

790
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,988
I'm having stomach problems. I can't eat

791
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:37,465
Ah-Zhou kept saying that
he was hungry,

792
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,865
give it to him.

793
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:41,262
Eat it while it's hot.

794
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:43,861
Eat!

795
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:46,871
Is it tasty?

796
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:47,898
Very good.

797
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:52,271
You spit it on me!

798
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:55,142
Give it to Xiao-Gui.

799
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:56,874
Tasty?

800
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,885
Had enough?
Delicious

801
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:00,889
I'm full.

802
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,015
And I got food all over me

803
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:07,559
You spit it on me!

804
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,426
What a waste of food you guys.

805
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:11,096
There's only a little left.
Don't eat!

806
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,293
Had enough?

807
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,426
Yes, I'm full.

808
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:14,297
Yummy?

809
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:15,361
Outstanding. Really good.

810
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:16,701
I added pepper, can you tell?

811
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:19,240
Yes, it is tasty!

812
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:22,705
Since you are all full,
I'm going home. Bye.

813
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,346
Shing-Shing, wait a second.

814
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:32,120
Huh? I'm sorry.
What's the matter?

815
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,245
Xiao-Gui, there's something in my eye.

816
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:37,119
Oh. Shing-Shing,
what's wrong?

817
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,053
Don't cry,
what's the matter?

818
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:41,596
I have to be home by 10:00.

819
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,132
10:00? But it's late.

820
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:44,928
We can't get a bus.

821
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,033
We'll take the bus
tomorrow morning,

822
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:46,534
Okay?

823
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:47,263
In early morning?

824
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:48,803
No!

825
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,203
We'll have dessert after dinner, okay?

826
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,534
You must make a fine dessert as well.

827
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:54,473
Xiao-Gui loves to eat dessert,

828
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:54,942
right?

829
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:55,602
Yes.

830
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,009
Great! We'll have tiramisu.

831
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,809
Sounds good.

832
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,281
I'll have it next time. Bye.

833
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:06,478
Shing-Shing, wait a minute.

834
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,247
Wait!

835
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:11,758
There's something sharp
on the ground.

836
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:14,295
Wait up! Shing-Shing!
Don't go!

837
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,167
Shing-Shing, wait until the sun comes up,

838
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:21,965
okay?

839
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,164
No!

840
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:26,834
Neither of us are wearing shoes.

841
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,274
We'll go back to get them, okay?

842
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,637
No! It's already a quarter to ten!

843
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,838
I must catch the 10:00 bus.

844
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:45,420
There are no late night buses

845
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:47,520
I don't care,

846
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:48,996
I have to go home tonight,

847
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:49,998
or my mother will yell at me.

848
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,802
The buses have all gone to sleep!

849
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:58,330
You are so childish!
Buses don't go to sleep!

850
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,876
Drivers need to sleep!

851
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:03,873
Then wake them up!

852
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:21,532
One-two, One-two...

853
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,544
Say it louder!

854
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:32,577
Masculine! Dignified! Firm! Resolute! Silent!

855
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:36,721
Strong! Speed!

856
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:44,626
Calm! Patient! Alert! Brave!

857
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:46,229
March!

858
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:48,163
One-two, One-two.

859
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:49,894
Get in step!

860
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:56,441
1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4.

861
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:58,043
Halt!

862
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,340
One, two.

863
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:00,340
Kuen-He, Where are you taking us?

864
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:02,835
I'm sorry, Kuen-He,

865
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,170
we shouldn't have found you.

866
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:05,110
Let us go,

867
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:06,306
we'll pretend we haven't seen you, okay?

868
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:10,515
Move faster!

869
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:19,652
Turn left!

870
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:26,623
Get in there!

871
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:28,136
It is dark!

872
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,337
Get in, be quiet!

873
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:32,063
Get inside!

874
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:34,865
Squat down!

875
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:36,340
Hold still!

876
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:37,777
Don't even

877
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:39,341
think of running away.

878
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:42,009
So many fireworks!

879
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,649
What are you doing?
Don't touch it.

880
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:47,183
Move over, move over there.

881
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,422
I'm warning you, don't even
think about escaping,

882
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,621
I've got other things
to attend to.

883
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,030
What is Lin Kuen-He doing?

884
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:07,366
Making bombs I guess.

885
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:09,232
To bomb who?

886
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:10,500
I don't know.

887
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:22,515
What are you looking at?

888
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:29,727
What?

889
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:55,412
Lin Kuen-He,

890
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:58,181
Calm down!

891
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,762
I can't do anything right,

892
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:08,862
I haven't done anything right
since I was a child,

893
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,833
not even fireworks.

894
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,605
No wonder my girlfriend
breaks up with me.

895
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:18,640
Fatso, are you crying?

896
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:21,572
Poor boy,

897
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:23,774
Don't cry.

898
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:43,669
Fatso, don't cry!

899
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:11,085
Ah-Zhou, Ah-Zhou, Ah Zhou.

900
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:14,825
What?

901
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,361
We're out of here.

902
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:18,989
Where is Kuen-He?

903
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:20,292
He hasn't noticed us.

904
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:22,102
What are you talking about?

905
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:25,768
Shhh! Shing-Shing, we are
going to have a game.

906
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:26,967
Let's play hide and seek, okay?

907
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:28,500
Hide and seek?

908
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:30,167
Shhh. Pipe down!
Don't make a sound!

909
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:31,234
Don't talk at all.

910
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:33,638
Untie me!

911
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:35,877
Now who's the seeker?

912
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:38,078
Fatso! Fatso will be it.

913
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:41,684
Can I be the seeker later?

914
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,247
Sure, of course.

915
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,355
Help, help!

916
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:22,158
Fatso fell into the water.
I can't swim!

917
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:23,219
Scram!

918
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,764
Fuckin' fat-ass!

919
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:30,634
Help, help!

920
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:31,433
Hold it! Go! Fatso go!

921
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:32,631
Help!

922
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:39,311
Grap it.

923
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:44,652
Fatso wins the game

924
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:49,646
What the heck?

925
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:52,082
The water is shallow

926
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:52,786
and you are pretending
to drown.

927
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,161
What are you doing?

928
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:58,922
Sir, I just wanted to
catch some fish

929
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,331
to grill it for you.

930
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:07,497
Smells good!

931
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:09,799
Tell you what,

932
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:11,869
whenever I Bar-B-Q

933
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:13,842
with my friends,

934
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:15,674
they loved my grilled fish

935
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:16,877
because they tasted the best.

936
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:19,443
Can I have this one later on?

937
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:20,677
Sure.

938
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:23,448
Sir, do you want it spicy?

939
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:25,292
Okay. Just a little though.

940
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:30,294
Is it ready? I am starving

941
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:30,763
Yeah, it's ready.

942
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:31,697
I'm hungry

943
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:35,996
Be careful

944
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:40,230
Let's eat fish!

945
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:42,298
Be careful!

946
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:48,204
Sir

947
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:54,384
Sir

948
01:19:57,592 --> 01:20:00,527
Thank you for saving me, sir.

949
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:04,157
Sorry about yesterday.

950
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,833
I never meant to tie you up.

951
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:12,232
Well then, I will get back to work.

952
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:13,935
Take your time and enjoy it.

953
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,135
It's okay if you leave first,
don't wait for me,

954
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,104
I still have some fireworks
to make.

955
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:27,344
What are those fireworks for?

956
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:32,892
Kuen-He, why are you
making those?

957
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,966
My girlfriend, You-Lin, wants
to break up with me.

958
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:42,368
I wrote a letter telling her

959
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:44,029
that I would

960
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,866
have a special fireworks show

961
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:47,101
on the beach tonight.

962
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,275
I made it myself

963
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,309
hoping she wouldn't leave me.

964
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,645
Now he is fantasizing about
the model from the magazine.

965
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:09,328
The wind is clearing the road,
the cloud is leading the way.

966
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:13,834
I'm throwing away love,

967
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:16,935
climbing over that high mountain
and crossing the sea,

968
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:20,804
destroying enemies,

969
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:25,207
Destroy the enemies of the country,

970
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:04,208
I don't see any fish.

971
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:09,249
All the fish are gone.

972
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,453
Sir, you're still here?

973
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:19,253
My clothes are still wet.

974
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:21,918
Are you done?

975
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:23,252
Yes. Sir?

976
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:27,363
Sir, can I ask you to write some blessings

977
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:28,596
for me and my girlfriend

978
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,230
on the fireworks later?

979
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:34,940
Sure.

980
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:36,799
Thank you, sir.

981
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:47,251
Look at those fireworks he made.

982
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:48,817
It would be a miracle
if they actually work.

983
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,823
So strange, where have

984
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:54,492
Fatso caught them all!

985
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:55,688
They're all in your stomach!

986
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:56,287
How could there be any fish left?

987
01:23:56,364 --> 01:24:01,267
No fish? But I want to fish!

988
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,699
I want to fish!

989
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:30,364
Yeah! I've got the fish. I've got them.

990
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:33,464
Aah blowfish!

991
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:39,400
And an octopus.

992
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:42,669
And there is a crab!

993
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:45,442
A Mermaid!

994
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:49,509
A Dolphin!

995
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:50,807
And look, also a shrimp!

996
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:55,681
A shrimp!

997
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:05,828
And a seahorse!

998
01:25:23,218 --> 01:25:25,049
Xiao-Gui!

999
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:28,583
Xiao-Gui

1000
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:34,725
Xiao-Gui

1001
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:19,105
Xiao-Gui

1002
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:20,771
Thanks.

1003
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:22,842
Next time we'll go fishing again.

1004
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:26,112
I forgot to catch ajellyfish
and a seahorse today.

1005
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:27,439
And the...

1006
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:29,372
Blowfish?

1007
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:36,121
Sir, I'm going to put on a firework
display on the beach.

1008
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:40,317
Do your fireworks really work?

1009
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:41,517
Of course they do.

1010
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:43,631
It must be a special firework display.

1011
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:45,656
Do you wanna come along

1012
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,400
fireworks? I'm in. I'm in.

1013
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:49,797
Great.

1014
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:52,537
We'll find you after the Bar-B-Q,

1015
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:54,139
okay?

1016
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:56,140
Sure.
Do your best, Fatso!

1017
01:26:57,612 --> 01:26:58,544
Sir, I'm leaving.

1018
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:02,445
Bye-bye. Be careful

1019
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:05,074
Yeah, fireworks.

1020
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:07,011
You're not flipping the meat!

1021
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:08,487
This should be great.

1022
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:16,523
Did you enjoy yourself?

1023
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:18,161
Yes, I did.

1024
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:21,559
Me too.

1025
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:23,702
The Bar-B-Q got burnt.

1026
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:30,234
Is he still there?

1027
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:35,433
Lin Kuen-He!

1028
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:37,738
What's up?

1029
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,912
Put down your gun? Hands up!

1030
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,801
Look, what's that?

1031
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:11,408
The wind is clearing the road,
the cloud is leading the way.

1032
01:29:12,146 --> 01:29:13,408
How does the next part go?

1033
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:18,350
I'm throwing away love.

1034
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:20,444
What the hell?

1035
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:23,218
Fatso put on the fireworks without us.

1036
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:26,283
He didn't even wait.

1037
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:27,760
Hurry up, or else we won't make it!
Those fireworks would actually go off?

1038
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:28,955
They're too loud.

1039
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:31,422
Run slower, slower!

1040
01:29:38,306 --> 01:29:39,295
Be careful,

1041
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:44,505
Slow down.

1042
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,849
Who's that guy? Is it Fatso?

1043
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:49,778
No.

1044
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:50,849
What are they doing there?

1045
01:29:50,918 --> 01:29:51,509
Nothing.

1046
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:52,986
Where are they going?

1047
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,750
Nowhere.

1048
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:17,367
Where's Fatso?

1049
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:22,345
Did he leave with his girlfriend?

1050
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:36,025
I didn't see any fireworks at all.

1051
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:38,483
Haven't you been wearing
those clothes long enough?

1052
01:32:38,519 --> 01:32:39,747
Are you taking them back
to match yourjeans?

1053
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:42,551
I'll take them back as a souvenir

1054
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,156
You two.

1055
01:32:48,429 --> 01:32:49,157
Captain.

1056
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,691
Congratulations. You finally
finished the service.

1057
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:53,993
Your Discharge Orders

1058
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:55,494
Thank you Captain.

1059
01:32:55,536 --> 01:32:56,867
Do your best

1060
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:58,505
and come visit if you have time. By the way,

1061
01:32:58,539 --> 01:32:59,665
the mice are going to miss you.

1062
01:33:01,642 --> 01:33:02,506
Take care.

1063
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:03,837
Thank you Captain. Good-bye.
Good-bye captain.

1064
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:20,622
Xiao-Gui, we have been discharged already,

1065
01:33:20,661 --> 01:33:22,060
there is no need to climb over the wall

1066
01:33:23,064 --> 01:33:24,053
I am a man of habits

1067
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:26,858
Are you going to see Apple?

1068
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:27,662
No, of course not

1069
01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:28,997
Please don't be shooting
your mouth like this

1070
01:33:29,537 --> 01:33:30,697
If she finds out that
I have been discharged,

1071
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:31,329
She may insist on going
back to Taipei with me,

1072
01:33:31,372 --> 01:33:32,532
then I have to say goodbye to the happiness

1073
01:33:35,142 --> 01:33:36,632
You don't need to say goodbye to her?

1074
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:39,078
No need.
You are really annoying

1075
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:44,584
We're out of there!

1076
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:48,410
Be careful of the cars!

1077
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:49,551
Watch out!

1078
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:53,558
Hurry!

1079
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,070
Are you bored?

1080
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:08,099
Yeah.

1081
01:34:08,509 --> 01:34:09,669
If you come back to keep me
company, that would be nice.

1082
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:12,577
Of course! No problem!

1083
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,443
Didn't you say you would do
a magic trick for me?

1084
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:16,109
Yes, watch.

1085
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:17,378
Wow, that's wonderful.

1086
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:18,247
Hold on, there's more.

1087
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,847
Wow! You're really great.

1088
01:34:22,923 --> 01:34:23,912
Thank you.

1089
01:34:24,392 --> 01:34:26,121
Would you like a drink?

1090
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:28,723
Is it cold enough?

1091
01:34:28,796 --> 01:34:30,024
Yes, it tastes great.

1092
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:32,624
You're all sweaty

1093
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:34,934
Will you teach me
how to do the trick?

1094
01:35:01,495 --> 01:35:02,484
Hello.

1095
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:09,627
One dollar please

1096
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:10,762
Thank you

1097
01:35:35,429 --> 01:35:36,657
She feels much better these days.

1098
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,665
Her father took her home last night,

1099
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:41,266
didn't you know that?

1100
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:43,534
Huh? I didn't know.

1101
01:36:40,528 --> 01:36:41,722
Do you hear sound of the sea?

1102
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:49,726
You're out of your mind!

1103
01:36:52,202 --> 01:37:09,726
THE END
